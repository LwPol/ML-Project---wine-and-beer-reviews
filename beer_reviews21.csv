Hops Flying Squirrel Nut Brown Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);...sampler at gainesville location. Well, as with thier other beers, nothing special.

Hops Flying Squirrel Nut Brown Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);FBG07. Nose is sweet malts, simple and one-dimensional.

Flavor is boring as all hell.

Hops Beat The Heat Summer Wheat;Madison, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);I had one last night and it looked and tasted more like a pale ale then a wheat beer. It was amber in color and pretty hoppy. I thought the waitress made a mistake but she double checked. If I was rating a Pale Ale it would get good reviews as a wheat it’s not good
Hops Beat The Heat Summer Wheat;Madison, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Location: Had this at the Golden, CO branch Summer ’08 Overall Impression: Fairly typical summer season, was really needed and tasted really good on draft after a long hot day, so I’m probably overrating by a bit.

Hops Beat The Heat Summer Wheat;Madison, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Palm Harbor Location. <!-- P --> Aroma is VERY faint, probably due to the frozen mugged it is served in but that is how they choose to serve it so that is how I will rate it.

Legend Winter Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Legend Brewing Company;Fascinating nose on this one. Loads of cherries with a rich cocoa backup. Flavor is significantly less interesting. Rather medicine-y with a quantity of sour cherry. Liquid cough drops, if you will. Per the brewer, it was first fermented with ale yeast, then lager yeast, then champagne yeast, and brewed with whatever happened to be lying around. While interesting in some ways, the chaos of its production is noticeable in the oddness of its flavors.
Legend Winter Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Legend Brewing Company;Black-brown body with minimal tan head. Aroma is cherry, some cocoa. Taste is medicinal cherry, with sour bitterness. Finish is quite sour.
Baltimore Brewing Edelweiss;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Hazy yellow-amber body. Nice pillowy white head. Big yeasty aromas, bubblegum with a slightly acrid aroma way back in the mix. The flavor is big bubblegum, quite sweet with some vanilla in the finish. The alcohol (9.5% on the 2004 vintage that I tried) on this monster is totally hidden. Medium slightly sticky body. Quite a nice beer.
Baltimore Brewing Edelweiss;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Cloudy yellow-brown. Odd nose. Very peppery, also get a strange pungency similar to steamed asparagus. Also has a taffy-like sweetness to it. Quite sugary, a bit like liquid bubblegum. Very spicy, has loads of pepper, some nutmeg and clove. A bit thin on the palate, could use a bit more heft. Does mask the alcohol quite well. Frankly, seemed a heck of a lot more like a tripel than anything else. Reminded me of a vaguely wussy Don de Dieu.
Baltimore Brewing Edelweiss;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;"Big fluffy white head which disapates, leaving good lace. Argo""s description of big clove, banana, pepper and bubblegum in flavor and aroma is right on, though I found no astringency whatever.

Santa Barbara Harbor Light;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Sampled on tap at the brewpub.

Hard Times Craft Lager (Victory);Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);As I drank this beer at the Victory brewpub, I found myself thinking: Geez, this is one terrific...pizza! For those who don't know, Victory makes incredible brick oven pizzas. Oh, turning to the beer. For once, Victory Brewing demonstrates that they don't have to overhop each and every beer they make. This lager is much less-bittered than their All-Malt Lager and is a session lager. Forget their horrible Milltown Mild, this Hard Times Lager is the thing to drink in quantity.

Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Reviewed from old notes. On tap at the brewpub. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a semi-dark red to brown color with a bar pour’s kind of head that died off quickly. The smell started off with the blueberries sweet and tight up front. A decent grainy malt base ended up coming across. The taste combined the blueberries and the graininess which tasted better than it smelled -more or less like wheat to me. On the palate, this sat about a light to medium with a decent sessionable quality about it. Carbonation seemed fairly subdued but probably due to the want of having the wheat give it a little kick, which actually Dorset really happen. Overall, the taste was there but something in the smell seemed a bit off in the grainy/what was supposed to be wheat. For the most part, not bad.
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;En fût. Verre de dégustation chez Jack Russell’s Steakhouse & Brewery (Bar Harbor, ME). Arôme: Odeur de bleuets. Apparence: La couleur ets ambrée légèrement voilée. Présence d’un mince col mousseux et d’une fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût de bleuets légèrement amer. Durée moyenne de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps et la texture sont mince. Faible effervescence en bouche. Présence d’amertume venant de la pulpe des bleuets en arrière goût. (Rating #1796)
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"Any first impressions? -An immense opaque head throned over the rusty brown clarity. -The sweet, fruity perfume of blueberries reached my nostrils even before the waitress set the pint glass on our table. -The first half of the sip is full of blueberry sweetness, the second half of its dry and lightly tart skin. -The mouthfeel appears bloated (some nitro?), but fits the pie clone attempt. What if you dig deeper? -A toasty, dry finish cuts the fruity wave just enough to make you want to get another gulp. -A brown ale base could have yielded more malt flavors to render complexity. -A smidge of buttery fat emboldens the rich blueberry nose. -Quite the idiosyncratic fruit beer; not up to New Glarus levels of course, but this batch was pleasantly flavorful. On tap at the brewery restaurant."
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Pours a cream, five-finger+ head that goes very slowly and leaves a chunks of lace. Amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Strong bluberry nose. Starts sweet, blueberry flavor is not overwhelming, dry finish with some hops barely lingering. $2.13 for a 12oz bottle from Bayside Liquors Bar Harbor, Me.
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Ok, so this one finally works, but I think it is only coincidence. On draught at the brewery, 8/14/2005. The little, bittersweet wild blueberries are fresh and real in here and well-prepared for the corky, rusty yeast assault. Good crisp mouthfeel, low, pleasing carbonation, kind of feels like an Abbey Trippel, dry and perfumey. Light grainy malt and tons of tartness/dryness from the yeast. A touch of sweet honey malt on the end. Light to medium-light bodied. Huge foamy head, moderate retention and a pale-copper-golden appearance with some rusty earthen-clay tones and the head being white. The crazy, drying, sourish yeast works, coincidentally, I have to believe, because it keeps this fruit beer tart and dry, as a good fruit beer should be (in my opinion).
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Pours copper with no real head to speak of. Smell and taste was dominated by blueberries (one of my favorite berries), but fell way short of the other Bar Harbor area blueberry offerings.
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Tasted fresh before it even touched the bottle. This is the best blueberry beer I’ve ever had! I dont like blueberries, and I dont like fruit beers (which this should be in for a category). The smell is pleasent dominated by blueberries. Flavor is pretty good, they say it’s based on the brown ale then they add the extracts to get the blueberry flavor. Thank god the blueberry extract somehow gets rid of the poor tastes in their brown. This is the king of blueberry beers.
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Pours a surprising ruby red. Clear with a small white head. Smells strongly of blueberries but not overpoweringly sweet. Light malt aromas. Taste is very nice! Not what I was expecting after the aroma. Bitter and tart, not syrupy sweet like so many fruit beers. Creamy malt. Low carbonation with the blueberry bitterness coming through and finishing with a light sweet flavor. Bluebery flavors actually complement the beer and don’t drown it out. (Imagine that!) A nice medium bodied ale. I like the taste of the darker malt with the bluberries in contrast to other fruit beers that have light wheat malt. This one actually stands up well to the bluberries. I would put this blueberry ale right up there with Bar Harbor Blueberry Ale as two beers that have mastered this style. Head and shoulders above the rest.
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;The color a translucent burnished copper color, the head frothy and light tan also modest in stature with the lace a velum like sheet to coat the glass. Nose is blueberry sweet, fresh, crisp and quite pleasing to the senses, start is nicely malted and somewhat sweet, top is thin. Finish is mild in its carbonation, hops subdued and the taste of blueberries quite evident though out, drinkable, and pleasant enough, but a bit to thin-waisted to get much respect from me.
Maine Coast Wild Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Bottled. Interesting. A notably foamy head and nice aroma. The blueberry taste is very subtle, but I noticed a whiff of green peas. Don’t know why.

Clocktower Wisharts Bitter;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Clocktower Brewpub;Just found this rating from a few years ago with this special brewing of their bitter with Apollo hops. Poured a cloudy amber colour with not much head, as was from cask. Hoppy nose with hints of fruity malts. Lots of these fruity malt notes in the taste with some oranges and hops. Mild citrus grapefruits. The mouthfeel is decently dry. Milder hops than usual, but still quite a nice alternative on their classic. Earlier Rating: 3/29/2014 Total Score: 3.3 A special one-off that is unfiltered with lots of hops and yeast floating all around. Amber colour with a frothy warm cap and good retention. Probably the biggest head and longest lasting I have had at this brewpub. Sweet honey and fruity malt nose with a bit of grassy hops. Wet mouthfeel and medium-bodied. Not as hoppy as expected, but a nice consistent dry bitterness. Decent fruity malts with hints of burnt notes and nuts. A pretty good experiment with one of their classic brews and adding Cascade hops for those who prefer hoppier beers. Earlier Rating: 11/2/2011 Total Score: 3.6 Use to have this one on cask back in the day, but had it recently on draft. Pours a clean amber colour with a small off-white head and decent lacing. The nose was fresh and nicely hoppy. Great crisp mouthfeel with a hoppy taste and grainy aftertaste. Nicely balanced between the hop and the malt (which give it a little burnt grain to it). I really like this one as it is a nice bitter and great session beer.

Clocktower Kölsch;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Clocktower Brewpub;Sweet aroma which is reflected in the foretaste. Afterwards some fruity and buttery taste to the malt. Definitely some diacteyl here. I don't always mind that but not sure it works here. I also wouldn't identify this as a Kölsch if it did not say so on the can.

Crouch Vale Crouch Winter Ale;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Old Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Strictly speaking a Winter Warmer. Winter Warmers can sometimes be a Barley Wine or a Strong Bitter, but can also be an Old Ale. This had a soft (oh so soft!) malty base. This was all about the deep, deep, deeply delicious malt. There was a slight wine edge, and a restrained alcohol warmth that kept urging to burst through, but was held back by the smooth (oh so smooth) malt. Gone too soon!

Kelham Island Kelham Gold;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelham Island Brewery;Tasted 22/02/2006. 500ml bottle conditioned ale from Rumble’s, Wellington. Very very pale (pilsner and wheat malts?), bright, with a creamy white head that disapates pretty quickly and laces slightly.

Fantôme Santé-5! - Pinocchio;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;"One of a whole series of one-offs by Fantôme, this one, I believe, from 2002; all of them have been brewed for the Heikantse Bierliefhebbers but profits go to charity. Vintage tasted in 2009. Off-white, quickly opening head (typical for an old beer), warm amber colour. Oxidized aroma with clear cardboard apart from notes of lemon juice, caramel, hay, rhubarb, overripe peach, walnuts. Pretty sharp lemony acidid onset, nutty malts, hints of sherry, gooseberry, sour cream, jute, soft floral hop bitter finish, slick mouthfeel, retronasal tartness and oxidation. Didn’t stand the test of time too well but still feisty like all other Fantôme brews - and being an amateur of this brewery’s products, I willingly ignore the oxidized flavours."
Fantôme Santé-5! - Pinocchio;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;Bottle. Pours amber with an off white head. Sweet caramel malts, leather, some fruity notes, odd yeasty notes, and evident oxidation. Honestly, the oxidation really doesn’t kill this at all. Still pretty good.

Fantôme Santé-5! - Pinocchio;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;75 cl bottle purchased from Etre. Shared at Fantomefest. Bottle pours a murky burnt orange color with minimal head. Nose is malty with a little funk and oxidation. Flavor is some oxidation again, but in addition, also some pleasant lactic acidity. Mouthfeel is moderate and dull, almost flat. Maybe it was because of Sante 4 was bad before this, but I happened to like Sante 5 a decent amount more than the rest of the group. Definitely on the back end of it’s drinking years, but still quite drinkable.

Barba Roja Negra;Escobar, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Barba Roja de Anapa;Bottle from the brewery. A very safe beer from a brewery which doesn’t take risks. Sweet (as are all their beers) and grainy with liquorice and lots of treacle then a short dry caramel finish. Hints of unfermented wort. Not bad, but there are many better beers in Argentina.

Barba Roja Negra;Escobar, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Barba Roja de Anapa;Pours a hazy dark brown color. It looks pretty much like a coca cola in every glass except Per’s one. He got all the head. It seems it was in the bottom of the bottle xD Aroma is malty with a good presence of chocolate, caramel and burnt aromas. If this beer is a Dunkel then I’m The Pope. It’s a Stout, or maybe a Porter. Flavor is sweet with a soft ending burnt bitterness. There are notes of chocolate, prunes and intense coffee roastiness. Body is medium, like the carbonation. Texture is oily and the finish is good and sticky. The best Argentinian brew we had in the tasting with Per. Bought in Mendoza, Argentina Shared with omhper, Lilith and nigredo

Barba Roja Trigo;Escobar, Argentina;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Barba Roja de Anapa;Bottle from the brewery. What the hell is this rubbish?!? A 3% wheat beer which is so sweet to rot my teeth on contact and with very little wheat flavour just isn’t worth drinking. Horrible.

Barba Roja Trigo;Escobar, Argentina;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Barba Roja de Anapa;(My bottle fell and started leaking so I had to drink this directly from it, rather warm...) Color is clear light yellow. Lots of white, thick foam. Aroma is malty and yeasty with notes of fruits, dough and bread. Pretty much like a Low-Alcohol beer. It’s a little disturbing and I couldn’t find the banana aroma of german hefes. Sweet fruity flavor with hints of cherries, anise, curazao and mint. Rather cloying and sticky. Lots of flavor but nothing resembling BEER flavor. Body is thin, extremely light watery texture. A little like a Root Beer or Ginger Ale....as the flavor. High fizzy carbonation. I’m confused by this beer and definitely don’t like it. I don’t know what this guys tried to do....3% ABV? I guess it’s better colder and from a glass. (Drunk in a Park in Mendoza warm, agitated and directly from the bottle)

Barba Roja Frutada;Escobar, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Barba Roja de Anapa;Bottle, black with a bubbly beige head. A slight berry fruit aroma. A malty flavour at first with a reasonably mild palate, and then a syrupy fruit flavour comes through, increasing to a sickening point in the finish.
Barba Roja Frutada;Escobar, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Barba Roja de Anapa;Extremely artificial beer. Good appearance but awful taste and aroma. Too much carbonatation. It taste like a coca cola strawery flavored with no body.

t Smisje Sleedoornbier;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Artisanal fruit beer made with sloe berries, which may sound exotic nowadays, but were commonly used in beer in medieval times. Moussy, off-pinkish, regular head, ’dirty’ bronze colour with pinkish glow, dark and cloudy. Powerful fruity aroma, obvious sloe berries, subjective hints of apple, strawberry, pear, cherries, rhubarb, ginger, cinnamon along with a fortunately very faint sulphuric presence (rotten egg). Sourish fruit taste, unripe plums, sorrel, green apple, strong carbo, light maltiness with vague sweetness but the (genuine) fruit acidity dominates and dries the palate, brief and late hint of hop bitterishness in the end.
t Smisje Sleedoornbier;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Regenboog;18/IV/14 - 33cl bottle from Den Zytholoog / Bierloods (Adegem) @ home - BBE: 2010 (2014-371) A rare find, that alas didn’t survive time. Although I’m not sure it was very good when fresh, either. Anyway. Little cloudy reddish amber beer, small pinkish head, irregular, unstable, non adhesive. Aroma: dusty, cardboard, bit sourish. MF: soft carbon, medium body. Taste: sourish start, black currants, bit dusty, some cardboard. Aftertaste: bit lemony, cardboard, sourish, dusty, citric touch. Actually, the acidity of the berries is probably what keeps this beer pretty drinkable, but it has aged too much and was probably to low in ABV to survive properly.
t Smisje Sleedoornbier;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Regenboog;33cl bottle from A Tutta Birra, Milan. It pours a peach color with a fluffy white head. Subtle fruit and brettanomyces aroma, yeasty. Definite horseblanket character in the flavor. I like this brewery
t Smisje Sleedoornbier;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Why is it so hard to brew a decent non-lambiek fruit beer? Even Smisje kind of failed, since this beer is too sweet and a little metallic. A shame really.

t Smisje Sleedoornbier;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Draft at Ginger Man NYC with Linh. Pours a hazy orange body. Aroma is very light fruit?

t Smisje Sleedoornbier;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Regenboog;22nd December 2007 Cloudy orange beer, sherbet nose. Very sharp note with unusual orange and tomoto tones. Good but a little bit too off the wall!
t Smisje Sleedoornbier;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Regenboog;bottle, reddish-amber coloured with small and unstable white head. Smell: like cigarettes, pipes and some blueberrys. taste: very smoked, blueberry, monotone, very strange and heavy beer! Beer for real man who want to try some fruitbeers.
t Smisje Sleedoornbier;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Draft at Redlight Redlight. Poured into a flute glass, the lightly hazy body glows a dusky orange-gold color. A small but lasting head of smooth, snow white foam coats the entire glass with thick, solid sheets of lacing. The aroma is downright strange. I’m talking off-the-charts strange. First to hit are notes of dirt and minerals, combining to mimic the scent of well-circulated coins. Copper, nickel, and worn tin are then joined by unidentified, slightly minty berries, with a touch strawberry sweetness, and then some aquavit burn. Did I mention that this stuff smelled strange? Well, the flavor is just as weird, showing a smoky ash contingent, sweet-tart berries, sugary alcohol, and caustic metals. Ugh! The palate sports the consistency of tonic water, spritzy and fizzy, with a light body and some residual sugars. I can’t really find a redeeming quality. This stuff is practically a crime against beer. Pretty horrid.

Ørbæk Queen Extra Lager;Ørbæk, Denmark;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Skummet er begrænset og duften slår tydelig an med den Ørbæk'ske karakteristika, som jeg efterhånden har indskærpet til at måtte skyldes malten. Var overrasket over bittterheden og tørheden i øllen, der sætter ind allerede fra begyndelsen - havde måske haft den dejligt afrundede Classic fra samme bryggeri i tankerne, men her er der lidt mere gang i humlen. Jeg synes også at kunne smage spor af hyldeblomst i en lidt mere sur og bitter udgave end Fynsk Forår. Alligevel mangler der harmoni i brygget, synes jeg, og mit indtryk er umiddelbart, at dette er en god øl, men heller ikke mere.

Ørbæk Classic Pilsner;Ørbæk, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Copenhagen 22/10 2017. 33 cl bottle from Meny. A lot of corn on the label.

Settles as 0,5 cm thick layer of foam. No lacing. Aroma is not sweet malts. Rather something slightly sour - an something chemical. Like Hobby Glue. Medium carbonation and slightly thick palate.

Spring Hill Irish Red;Brisbane, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;On tap at brewhouse. A clear red-brown dark amber colour with a very thin white coloured small bubbled head.

Lingering slightly bitter finish.
Spring Hill Irish Red;Brisbane, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Draught at brewery tap @ International Hotel, Brisbane. This is the pick of the beers brewed on the premises in my opinion. It pours clear red-brown with a medium off white head. Nose and palate is sweet caramel malts with a touch of fruity hop bitterness. Rather thin bodied but has that freshly-brewed easy going mouthfeel. Sessionable.
Spring Hill Irish Red;Brisbane, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;On tap. Bronzed red colour with a modest head and a mild aroma with traces of hops in the aroma. Some caramel malt flavours come through and there is a nice sweet aftertaste.
Spring Hill Irish Red;Brisbane, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Bland stuff but the best this supposed superstar german brewer puts out. Toffee malt but really thin and bland. Slight bite on the end then it’s gone. If you find yourself at the international this is the pick of the bunch!
Spring Hill Irish Red;Brisbane, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Draught at International Hotel, Brisbane. Pours a reddish brown with small beige head. Predominately roasted malt aroma and flavour. Short, harsh bitterness. Poorly balanced.
Spring Hill Irish Red;Brisbane, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Very ligh brown, low carbonation with a small, tight and holding head. Light aroma with hints of coffee.

Spring Hill Indian Chief;Brisbane, Australia;Wheat Ale;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;The International Hotel in Spring Hill (about 15mins walk from CBD) is a nice unpretentious pub with attached microbrewery. The front bar serves standard Aussie macro beers but on the side there are taps that sell 5 beers brewed on the premises. This one is a Belgian-style wheat beer that is rather lacking in flavour and body but at least the palate is clean and refreshing. It pours pale cloudy yellow with a small white head. OK and cheap at $5.50 a pint.
Spring Hill Indian Chief;Brisbane, Australia;Wheat Ale;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;On tap. There is the familiar haziness of a wheat beer and the pale lemon rind straw colour. The flavour was basic and non descript and the beer was light in the mouth. Would make for a good session beer.
Spring Hill Indian Chief;Brisbane, Australia;Wheat Ale;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Rock bottom. Water with the taste of wheat in it. Don’t get any spice. 50 characters yeah!
Spring Hill Indian Chief;Brisbane, Australia;Wheat Ale;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Draught at International Hotel, Brisbane. Pours golden with small white head. Strange aroma similar to lemon tea mixed with coriander. The flavour is not much better. I couldn’t finish a glass of this. Unpleasant.
Spring Hill Indian Chief;Brisbane, Australia;Wheat Ale;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Pale gold, very lightly carbonated with a thin weak head which drops very quickly. Light citric aroma. Cry citrusy flavour with an overly bitter finish for the style.
Spring Hill Indian Chief;Brisbane, Australia;Wheat Ale;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Tasty. Some musk sticks, actually fags/fads. OK stuff if a little salty. Kind of gimmicy cool and peppery. Afterwards some infection Kmart confection.
Spring Hill Indian Chief;Brisbane, Australia;Wheat Ale;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;nfob03. i changed my mind a couple of times about this one. i was put off a bit by the leaded petrol aroma. some wheat tartness was pleasant but a nasty lemon-scented toilet cleaner tang crept through. not sure if the keg was looked after well enough at the beer festival
Spring Hill Indian Chief;Brisbane, Australia;Wheat Ale;Spring Hill Craft Brewery;Slightly eggy sulfuric nose, sweet start, with a peppery, spicy finish. hoppy, slightly citric tang, the body is quite light and watery. Interesting that they use corn in this one. Having a lemon with it never crossed my mind while having it.
Mash House Jacked Up Stout;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Stout;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Tribeca Tavern, Raleigh. Black pour with a creamy tan head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and whiskey. Taste is a milk stout with Jack Daniels. Decent overall.

Mash House Jacked Up Stout;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Stout;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;21-Feb-11 (12-oz sample bottle: Free bottle for stewarding the 2008 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) Having let this whiskey barrel-aged stout mellow a few years, this beer isn’t so much about Jack Daniels as it is about the flavor and aroma of an oak barrel. The nose offers aromas of oak, red cherry, earth, and dark chocolate. On the palate, the oak and tart cherry flavors are prominent in the entry, but these fade a bit in the finish where dark chocolate gradually overtakes the other flavors, reminding you that this is still a stout at heart. The medium-weight beer has moderate carbonation and a fair amount of acidity in the entry, but the finish is mostly just dry and surprisingly refreshing for a stout. In the glass, the beer is dark brown in color and fairly hazy in appearance and is capped with barely a wispy head that quickly dissipates. Overall, this is a very drinkable barrel-aged stout, and thankfully the flavor of Jack Daniels is kept light rather than dominating like in so many similar beers, but the base beer doesn’t seem to have much personality.

Mash House Jacked Up Stout;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Stout;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft at Mash House. Pours an oily black with a fat, foamy tan head. Excellent lacing. The color is spectacular, as is the darkness residing inside the glass. Aromas of whiskey creep from the glass as it’s being handed across the bar. Upon closer inspection, every scent in the nose is angrily drowned out by one of the strongest whisky profiles I’ve encountered in a barrel aged beer. It seems like the barrel still had liquor in it when it was filled. Light notes, deep underneath, of roasted malt, baking chocolate, vanilla, wood, cold and burnt coffee grounds and lactose. Alcohol is very evident. The flavor almost drops off the charts of acceptability. Notes of whisky completely dominate, imparting cloying sweetness and heavy vanilla. A light smoke addition enters the fray. Bitterness is mild to medium, though it seems like most of it comes from a grossly overstated alcohol presence. Acidity is even high; this is going nowhere fast. The finish is chocolate and whisky, medium in duration, acrid and cloying. Mouthfeel is oily, watery and scattered, light-medium bodied, unpleasant. This beer was awful, almost undrinkable."

Mash House Jacked Up Stout;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Stout;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;OK, I admit it - I’m a sucker for the aroma of these bourbon barrell beers. Really nice smells of vanilla, bourbon chocolate and coffee mix to form a really enticing aroma. Flavor is similarly balanced, perhaps a bt more vanilla than bourbon. Sampled at the 2007 Hickory Hops.

Arôme a évidemment pris un coup, et donne plus des notes de fermenté et soja; le tout avec encore du malt et caramel ainsi que qcq traces de houblon. Bière qui de suite reflète son age de part un profile de soja. Pointe de houblon et amertume avec en retrait du malt, caramel/pils avec une effervescence marquée surtout pour l’age de la bouteille.

Printemps de Silly;Silly, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie de Silly;Das trübe und alkoholisch süßlich riechende Bier schäumt stark, die Blume hält mittellang. Das Bier hat sehr viel Kohlensäure, jedoch ist dies noch ertragbar. Es schmeckt anfänglich nach Wasser, im Mittelteil schmeckt man den Alkohol und ein leicht metallernen Unterton, der jedoch verschwindend gering ist. Im Nachgeschmack entwickelt sich eine gewisse Herbe, was auch dringend Notwendig ist, um das Ganze überhaupt als Bier bezeichnen zu können. Muss man nicht getrunken haben - ein Geschmackserlebnis bleibt aus. Übrigens: Dieses Bier ist ein Saison - Frühlingsbier. Test vom 2.10.2005, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 7,5,10,8,10,5 - 6,65

Carolina Brewery To Hell and Bock;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Carolina Brewery;pint at Pittsboro location 7/31/11. Good aroma, sweet, choclate, nutty, little vineous/soy sauce as it warmed. Dark orangy brown color, good head, ok lace. bitter sweet flavor. Medium body, smooth creamy mouthfeel, bitter dry finish. Pretty tasty, nice malty brew. 8% beer in 100 degree heat, well it was air conditioned, but seems like this could be served during cooler months. Nice chocolate roasty flavor
Carolina Brewery To Hell and Bock;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Carolina Brewery;Tap at the brewery. Dark brownish amber with a reddish hue, small white head. Nose of dark fruits, lots of malt, roast, a little vinegar, char, ash. Taste is really strange, a little soap, vacuum cleaner, light vinegar. Ashy finish.

Carolina Brewery To Hell and Bock;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Carolina Brewery;Again, a mediocre beer from Carolina. This one seems to have a vegetal characteristic that is pronounced to the point of unpleasantness. I must say, however, that when paired with the vinegary NC BBQ sauce, the malty sweetness really comes out.
Carolina Brewery To Hell and Bock;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Carolina Brewery;"This beer has obviously been amped up since the NC ""Pop the Cap"" law. Previous ratings are from a time when beer over 6% ABV couldn’t be served and this recent one was a solid 8%. Very deep red with a thin but firm caramel head. Foam coats the glass with every sip but doesn’t really leave any permanent lacing. Light fruit, prune aroma with some toffee notes. Not quite as fruity as the aroma had me believe it would be. Some toffee with a tangy finish. Perhaps a little coffee lurking in the background. Dry finish. Solid beer that I began to enjoy more and more as I finished my second glass."
Carolina Brewery To Hell and Bock;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Carolina Brewery;Dark brownish red, minimal (draft) tan head. Minimal malty aroma. Not too exciting. Flavor almost exactly mirrors the aroma, malty caramel. Medium somewhat watery body. Ok but just kind of there.
Carolina Brewery To Hell and Bock;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Carolina Brewery;Attempted Doppelbock. Not a bad try. It would have been bettre with more agreeable NC beer laws. Sweet, and strong. Nice malty flavor, but a lot of watery taste. Lacks the balance of palate and flavor that only the appropriate alcohol content can bring.

Decent.
Gentle Bens Mocha Java Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout;Gentle Bens Brewing Company;nitro tap @ tap & bottle: listed as 5.5% abv american stout, not 7.0%. Nose is roast aromas all the way, not a hint of burnt grains nor weird coldbrew aromatics. Distinct wet grain bag smell, taste is sadly a little watery and light. Finish is again fairly light and water but covered in quite a bit of coffee and roasted aromatics. For me this doesn’t quite come together, with a little bit more body it would be the perfect refreshing low-abv stout but in its current form I cannot get away from the watery feel.

Sonoran Festivus;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Other;Sonoran Brewing Company;The color a very deep amber to burnished copper color to the pour, the head impressive in size, the texture frothy and the lace thick and clinging. Malt at the front and the hops underlying this sweet nose, start malt and lightly sweet, top middling and the finish spicy in its hop presence, moderately acidic, dry as a bone aftertaste.

BJ's Bitternacht;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;2002 vintage. 8.5% ABV bitter? Hmm... don't think so. Derek, the brewer at Chandler BJs, recently served this at a barleywine tasting, and at the end of the night. This beer was huge! Rich, heavy malt flavors of caramel, butterscotch, toffee, and molasses combine with strong herbal hop flavors and bitterness. Intensely sweet and bitter at the same time, that is, there is obviously a ton of residual sugars in this beer, but there are also a ton of bittering alpha acids from hops. Thick, syrupy body. Not my cup of tea, too intense. Would like to try again in a few years.
BJ's Bitternacht;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;This is an interesting combination of bitter & sweet. You get a nice hoppy flavor w/ a sweet toffee finish & some maltiness. It was very unique. Had it on draught a BJ's in Irvine, CA.
BJ's Bitternacht;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;"Very interesting Bitter. The waitress described as ""Barleywine"" like. Close but no cigar...Very dark cloudy brown (reminded me of Rochefort). By the time I received the beer there was no head left so Cna't really judge that. Nice maltly front and a fair amount of bitterness in middle/finish. Pretty complex middle that had some alcholic flavor. Warm finish. I would try this again. Derek did a nice job on this one."
BJ's Bitternacht;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;A beer for those who like them bitter. 82 IBU'S but on the cask...It tastes like so much more. It looked like prune juice in the glass. a cloudy brown. And if there were any other flavors they were completely hidden by the overwhelming taste of yellow grapefruit juice. Unique but not that great for a malt lover.
Rock Bottom Indianapolis Cézanne Saison;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;A farmhouse with a weak body, no complex malt, and little Belgian yeast. To compensate, the brewers have attempted to overburden the ale with odd and unnecessary flavors. It’s a very poor representation of the style.

Rock Bottom Indianapolis Cézanne Saison;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;Saison’s can vary widely in aroma and flavor depending on the spices, but this just wasn’t anything close to a saison in my opinion. Amber and no head (strike 1). Sugar and no spice in the aroma (strike 2). Very sweet with little else in the flavor (strike 3). In addition, very little yeast and carbonation. Less than a dry finish. The lacing wasn’t bad, though.
Rock Bottom Indianapolis Cézanne Saison;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;This was the first beer we tried at the downtown Indy location - it was one of their seasonals. Pours a amber with no head. The nose is sugary sweet with hints of caramel. The body was simply underattenuated on this - lots of residual sugars made it hard to drink. The delicate saison yeast was just lost in this and the finish was far from drying. Not a good example IMO.

Jamieson Best Bitter;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jamieson Brewery;I really enjoyed this bitter from a Micro that I think has a good future.

Mountain Sun Tsunami Strong Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;"I thought this beer was ""ashy,"" somewhat harsh, and a little unbalanced. Big, smoky flavors seemed to rule. The palate was spikey (carbonation and alcohol) on the top and a little watery underneath. Finished with a cabbage-like off-flavor I wasn't too fond of. I didn't find it quite as bad as I'm describing it, but I'm focusing on the negatives I found. This beer could be much better after laying down a while."

Pumphouse Backdraft Imperial Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Medium dark brown colored body with light easily shining through at the edges. Somewhat lactic on the tip of the tongue, and harsh as well, with a charred milk note, candied dark plum, cherry syrup and sweet cocoa. Hints at some cream in the middle but finished harsh and astringent.
Pumphouse Backdraft Imperial Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Crushed with Jakebra at the brewpub. Why is this rated so low? Dark fruits, roast, booze, chocolate and vanilla on the nose. And awesomeness. Plenty of that. Flavor is sexy and the mouthfell might be the best I’ve had in any Imperial Stout. So thick and velvety. Unexpected and absolutely awesome.

Pumphouse Backdraft Imperial Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draft: Black with a beige edge. Tight tiny-bubbled tan head is broken but holds well. Diacetyl (buttered popcorn) and chocolate fudge leap from the glass. Whispers of iron, caramel, dried plums, and a seductive cherry fruitiness. Deceptively light in body. Soft pricks of carbonation. Opens with a refreshingly bright cinnamon-dusted cherry expression which curtails the slight graininess. Crunchy char and black-malt phenols contribute plenty of snap. Fruit character is notably succulent. Lack of malt depth causes the acidity to neutralize much of the fudgelike richness. Irony zing complements the sharpness of the deeply kilned malt. Roasted barley also helps to quell the graininess with its feathery softness. Finishes well-integrated with roasted barley and chalky char with a lasting afterimage of cinnamon and raisins. Phenolic burps. Not a bad effort by any means but the mouthfeel definitely suffers from being too prickly, and the diacetyl hinders what is otherwise a pleasant aroma. Also served way too cold.

A decent pale ale overall, drinkable if nothing else. I’m giving a lot of these HMB beers similar ratings, because the quality is very, very consistent here: slightly above average.

McMenamins Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;"A step up from other McMenamins, mainly because it wasn""t carbonated to the level of soda pop. Frothy, with a huge mouthfeel and head. Taste could be better, but this was alright."

Rolinck Alkoholfrei;Steinfurt, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Privatbrauerei A. Rolinck (Krombacher);A yellow beer with a white head. The aroma is sweet malty, but also like soap water. The flavor is sour and hoppy - hoppy to cover for the lack of alcohol, and ofcourse the body is thin. I’ve tried better non-alcoholic beers.

Grainy, malty and lighlty fruity nose with some notes of DMS. The flavor too has that DMS touch, but it’s mostly hidden by the grains and fruityness. Medium body, quite dry.

The aroma is quite fruity, lightly lemony and with some pale malts. Sort of feels a bit infected. Strange thing is, I think it adds an interesting twist to the beer. It’s lightly acidic on the palate, with lemon peel, pale malts and a generic fruityness. Rather thin on the palate, with decent carbonation. Well, drinkable it is, but it’s certainly far, far from interesting. 121102

Molson Carling Black Label Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bouteille 341 ml. 4%. Couleur jaune, arôme de maïs. En bouche c’est une light mais encore mieux que la Coors Light et Bud Light.
Molson Carling Black Label Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);nothing special about this one. Aroma is of a stale iron-like quality. Has a slight and fast disappearing head with golden yellow color. Has an inoffensive taste of corn and hops, neither bold nor daring. A little too carbonated to be a favorite. The price is right for those summer afternoons out on the lake with relatives.
Molson Carling Black Label Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle. Pours pale yellow with a white head. Aroma of corn, grain, and sweet malts. Flavor is watered down, weak, corn, grain. Thin bodied, nothing good.

Molson Carling Black Label Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);An uncle had a few bottles of this at a recent family function so I thought what the hell, give it a try. A piss poor pale piss colour beer (get the idea?) but the taste is actually quite inoffensive - only mildly grain like with no real offensive of skunky tastes - just a watery light malt taste and no finish at all. Like Coors Light, for people who like to pee.

Bordelet Sydre (Sidre) Argelette;Charchigne, France;Apple Cider;Cidriculteur Eric Bordelet;2016 bottle. Clear deep golden color with white head. Aroma is red apples, vanilla, custard, good funk. Taste is vanilla, juicy red apples at first, then immediately the funk takes over, light hazelnut, going towards a dusty, bone-dry finish. Bone dry, foamy carbonation. Great bone dry Cidre if you are into that. Lots of character going on here, no compromises, bold and balanced at the same time.

Wolpertinger Dunkles Urweizen;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maximilians Brauerei;An unclear red-brown beer with a small collapsing brown head. The aroma is sweet with clear notes of wheat and very strong notes of caramel and toffee, but also hints of banana. The flavor is sweet with lots of caramel, but also light notes of wheat and a dry roasted end.
Wolpertinger Dunkles Urweizen;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maximilians Brauerei;Bottle opens with a bang and seems to be heavily carbonated - this is not noticable later in the beer however. A sour nose more fitting for a dairy product. Murky brown, head dies quickly. Bland soapy taste. Feels like it leaves a sticky residue on the tounge. This beer is the worst dunkelweizen I have ever tasted!
Gale's Hard Cider;Madison, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Thomas Family Winery;Pale yellow body. The nose is rich apples with some dry oak notes. Very sweet smelling. The taste is very dry with only a little bit of apple core. It is a very muted flavor. The finish is lingering with some more of that apple core character and hints of black pepper spice. The alcohol isn’t really noticed. This is a weird one in that it seems like it wants to have more character than a macro cider, and it does with obvious real ingredients. However, it is still fairly muted in the taste. I would like a little more character.
Gale's Hard Cider;Madison, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Thomas Family Winery;"750 ml bottle. Very pale yellow with almost no head. Strong apple aromas. A nice tart, dry apple flavor with a hint of pears as well. Very dry finish. My first ""micro-cider"". Very drinkable, I’d have it again."

Gale's Hard Cider;Madison, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Thomas Family Winery;"Sampled on 10/14/2006 at the winery... Sample was poured from a large pitcher. Color was *almost* the color of water and just as clear. Barely any carbonation. Light apple aroma. Crisp, subtle apple flavor. Not really sweet, but not really dry either. Finish reminded me of a generic white wine. Palate was very thin, again like water. Everything about this cidar seemed to be light - too light. I was hoping for a little more fruit flavor and carbonation. Overall this cidar was not very exciting, but I will give this winery credit for offering something a little different besides just having wine. I also grabbed a bottle of the Gale’s Hard Cidar ""The Chieftan’s Blend"" which might be a bit more interesting..."
Gale's Hard Cider;Madison, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Thomas Family Winery;(draft- Indiana brewers fest) Yellow fizzy and smooth commerical cider with a sour apple nose, and a dry lactic taste with fresh apple.
Gale's Hard Cider;Madison, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Thomas Family Winery;"750 ml bottle, labeled as 7% ABV. Very pale, almost totally clear yellow with slight bubbling and no top fizziness, no ""pop."" Light fresh nose, slight hints of alcohol. Very light and dry, rather bland actually...lightly alcoholic, lightly buttery, but overall lacking in fruity sweetness and too smooth. A disappointment. Purchased at that Mecca of great cider and beer in S. Indiana, New Albanian/Rich-O’s."
Gale's Hard Cider;Madison, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Thomas Family Winery;"Though described as ""strong and dry"", I'd have to cast my vote differently. It is actualy more sweet and crisp than strong and dry. It is up to par with most most domestice ciders made at small orchards. Its light with little to no carbonation. Very clear and tastes best well chilled. Mild alcohol aftertaste."
Wolpertinger Urstoff;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Maximilians Brauerei;Gelb-braun, reichlich trüb und mit viel Schaum. Ein schönes Apfelaroma macht sich neben der Hefenote breit. Weicher Antrunk. Würzig-brotiger Geschmack, der in eine ausgeprägte Hopfenbittere übergeht.

Wolpertinger Urstoff;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Maximilians Brauerei;Bottled. A hazy orange beer with a thin off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of caramel. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of straw, leading to a bitter finish. The body is thin.

Wolpertinger Urstoff;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Maximilians Brauerei;Golden color with a white head. The taste is full bodied malty sweetnes with a very light bitterness on the palate. Comes off a little thin, but overall drinkable.
Wolpertinger Urstoff;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Maximilians Brauerei;Like their dunkelweisse the swing-top bottle opens with a bang - curiously enough there is little CO_2 in the beer itself. Straw golden, low head. Maltish sweet aroma, a little hint of chlorine. Very bland and watery, and they definetly forgot to buy sensible hops in it - even if I would pee in my homebrew it would be better. Maximilian must be a cheap beer outlet for another brewery - I will have to investigate that.
Possmann Frankfurter Äpfelwein - Der Klassiker;Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Kelterei Possmann;Bottle pours out a pale straw topped with a small fizzy head. Nose is earthy sour apple and a touch of sweetness. Taste is more of the earthy sour tart notes and a funky apple.

Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;Enjoyed on tap at the brewery, clocking in at 8.3% and IBU 32. Two months of barrelageing. A bite of burnon. Very dark Colour had red highlights, lace lines left as she went. Some sour stout roast. A winish taste, in a word. Above average mouthfeel.
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;~8oz glass @ brewpub, 8.4%. Pours with a black body and a tan head. Absolutely no clarity and looks like a stout. Very roasty aroma, again akin to a stout. However here come the other aspects, a traditional earthy maltiness and some chocolate even below that. Taste is not heavy, peppered with nutty/earthy maltiness, light peat, some cocoa sweetness. No alcohol burn but just a hint of alcohol heft. Slightly under-carbonated body. A great thirst quencher with lots of character, recommended and would have again.
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;On tap in a snifter at the brewery. This year’s has some chocolate in it and weighs in at 8.6% ABV. Very nice beer, a bit like a scotch ale/porter hybrid. Cocoa and peat in the flavor. Sooo very easy drinking, the high ABV is practically undetectable. Watch City nailed this one.
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;On draught 4/06/2005 at Redbones. Though the glass was convex and I was in a bar (though not smokey), I could immediately smell a strong treacle/molasses aroma, with brown sugar, thick, dark malts, quite sweet, and a bit of light roast. Very intense aroma. The body is a dark brown, opaque and unfiltered with a small light beige head, that slowly recedes to a ring. There is not so much lacing, as there is coating of the glass. Flavor begins with a sugary (brown sugar, molasses) malt, that is thick, chewy and lasting of flavor. A touch of dryness, ever so light, begins to show on the palate, with light roast, a touch of earthiness and faint warming from the alcohol. Sweet chocolate, caramel and toffee are in full force through the middle of the beer. As it begins to finish, the flavors continue to dry some, with the peat smoke lingering lightly in the background, increasing in apparency as the beer warms, but never adding more than just an enticing hint. On the very finish, dry, earthy notes (light wood, barley, brown bread) are apparent but do not really challenge the caramel and brown sugar. Full body, wonderfully creamy and yet drinkable. Though the beer leans heavily towards the sweet side, I didnt feel the balance was thrown off. If they knew how to bottle beer well at Watch City (based on all of my experiences, they don’t) this could age marvelously.
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;Big round malty aroma is very sweet and appealing. Clear dark brown with ruby highlights and generous, fine-bubbled, off-white head that recedes to ring with some lacing. Big, sweet, round malty flavours with some doughy yeast notes and caramel and toffee sweetness that lead you through to a lightly roasty finish with just a hint of peat. Smooth creamy texture with moderate carbonation and medium-full body. Truly well-made and enjoyable. Sampled at the brewpub with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;Roasted malts and the dry crust of pumpernickel bread gain weight with the rich caramel it is fed with...Coffee beans and fruity esters dance freely in the round body, as roasty bitterness serves as a curtain call...The hands-down winner of this afternoon of sampling at Watch City...
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;Very dark brown body. Head is initially quite big, light brown, foamy and displaying excellent lacing. Aroma initially scares with its sour hints, but that’s more from the breadiness than anything else. It smells very toasty, biscuity with strong dried caramel, molasses and pudding notes. I wish this were more intense because this is truly enjoyable to whiff. The palate answers the expectations. A strong peatiness ensures a lengthy finish, earthy, rich and generous. Ample sweet malt profile procures a generous body, creamy, comfortable through its light carbonation. More malt development leads into toasty chocolate and leather goodness. This may actually be one of the top 5 scotch ales I’ve had.
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;Dark brown in color with ruby highlights and a small tan head with large loose bubbles. Sweet malty aroma with a touch of alcohol,oak, dark fruit and cherries. Flavor starts sweet and ends dry with a good malt presence, subtle roasted grain,chocolate and molasses.
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;Yeah, this was a strong ale that felt strong going down. Deep color that draws you in, with a type of light brown froth around the edge of the glass. Maybe its the peat that makes it so heavy, but you feel as if you've eaten a joint of beef after drinking half a glass. Otherwise, quite smooth, with a medium bite and a nice pointed flavor.
Watch City Skye High Scotch Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Watch City Brewing Co.;Sweet and malty the way a scotch ale should be, but this one is much more heavily hopped than most, which makes of a more pleasant, drinkable beer.
Wolpertinger Helles Urweizen;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Maximilians Brauerei;Bottle. Hazy dark golden colour with a big white head. Wheaty citrus and banana aroma and taste. Medium body and a light sweet finish.
Wolpertinger Helles Urweizen;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Maximilians Brauerei;Ok, now I am used to it: All the bottles from Maximilian open with a bang. Some standard clove aroma, but also a hint of chlorinelike aromas. Looks are pretty ordinary, allthough the cloud is a bit grey and the head retention could be better. Lightbodied, but other than that a standard cheap weisse.
Swale Cracker;Maidstone, Kent, England;Porter;Whitstable Brewery;A beautiful, smooth, roasty, dark beer with mild acid fizz and some oaky wine qualities. A light to medium body which is disturbed by the constant mild fizz. Enjoyable, decent quality beer.
Harvest Moon The Jubilant Scrooge;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Enjoyable beer, brewed with vanilla beans. There is cinnamon and nutmeg in the aroma. I enjoyed this brew. Hoppy and malty.
Harvest Moon The Jubilant Scrooge;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);"Previous rating 2.1. This beer did not smell anything like it tasted. Nutmeg/Cinnamon nose reminded me of XMas. There was a very obvious ""chemical"" flavor on first swallow however, which laid on the tongue throughout the entire glass. The cinnamon flavor remained prominent throughout, but that could not save this watery beer. ****RE-RATE 02/13/2005 on tap at brewery**** This brew has improved. No more sickly chemical flavor and the aroma resonated with pine and resin. Flavor is filled with vanilla esscence with a bit of cinnamon and ginger."
Molson Carling Extra Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);pours clear bright yellow with a small white head, little retention and lno lacing. faint grainy maltiness - sweetish, booze (!), lots of cardboard, caramel touch, corn, dust, grass, pepper, chalk and minerals. moderate carbonation, light body - slightly watery, bland yet balanced herbal-grassy finish. awkward booziness for stated abv. inoffensive yet some flaws show compared to regular carling.

Molson Carling Extra Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Alors, je suis tombé sur une autre bière qui ne mérite pas l’appellation. Elle est jaune pâle, ayant une mousse respectable qui dure un tant soit peu. Les odeurs sont propres aux bières bon marché/grand public, c’est-à-dire qu’il y a du malt et c’est à peu près tout. De la gazéification s’immiscent au travers. Un goût sans surprise d’effervescence, de sirop de maïs et de malt. Bière pour les gens qui n’aiment pas la bière. Parfait pour se gargariser. (376-280912)

Molson Carling Extra Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Swillfest ’04: Pale. Aroma stings with highly inappropriate phenols. Grainy palate thankfully shows no sign of them. Slightly tart finish. A non-event after that disgusting aroma.
Molson Carling Extra Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Clear gold, small white head. Fruity malt, sweet sugars. Bready , sweet lager , plain brew . Extra dry ? Now that’s a joke.
Molson Carling Extra Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);this beer, is not one of molson good beers. Better off just getting the regular carling.
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Pours cloudy amber with a really frothy head. Aroma of pineapple, pine, maybe some guava. Taste is piney, malty, quite bitter, then ends on a slightly sweet note. Not super good, but still appealing. Aftertaste lingers. Like the bike theme on the bottle. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Blah...very disappointing brew. Light mild grainy nose with a bit of a perfumey floral and grassy hop note. Light maltiness in the taste as well with a mild dry finish and a few citrus notes. The hops are boring, the malts are non-existant. This beer is boring!
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;pours clear yellow-y brown with a thin ring of white. very perfume-y aroma... a combination of citrus, caramel malt and dirty pine. the flavor is a lot alike... buttery caramel, orange/citrus-y hops, citrus pith, sweet earthy pine and some spice on the finish. it is medium bodied... a little prickly and sharp yet creamy at times. 6/3/6/3/13/3.1
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Pours copper with a thin off white head. Smells citrussy with some resiny hints. Tastes bitter and peppery with a splash of resin on the finish.
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Deep gold with creamy white head and lace. Light citrus aroma. Medium malt, citrus, and a nice finishing bitter. A foamy medium bodied beer. Not bad but not your standard ipa either.
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Im going to put my rating here. On tap at the 2008 Strong Ale Festival and listed as an IPA although the notes say Big IPA and ABV of 8.6. Poured a medium golden-amber color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of some fresh hoppiness and earthy. Tastes of fresh hops, citrus, pine, and lighter caramel.
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Sample at the brewpub. This beer pours a clear amber-orange color with a medium thin and foamy white head that dissipates steadily. Large patches of lacing on the glass. Some hops and earthy malt in the nose. Medium-bodied with a fairly even ratio of hops and malt flavor. Light floral notes here and there as well. The finish is sweet malt with a touch of hops lingering in the aftertaste. Average overall.
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;From a growler (which I now wish I hadn’t bought): Pours a very light amber with a thin head that lasts through out. Aromas of malt, hops, and pine. Flavor is more of the same with some earth and mustiness. Light dry finish. Not a bad beer but it was hardly worth the trip, and I live in Vegas.
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Consumed on draft at brewery, 12/30/07. Clear, medium gold. No lacing. Thin skin of foam. Metallic note in aroma with citrusy hops. Moderately hoppy on initial taste with malt character emerging after. Aftertaste of malt. Weird: reversed the usual order of malt and hop flavors! Regardless, it is well-balanced and smooth. Not bad and a little unusual to boot.
Tenaya Creek Ringtail Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;IPA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;on tap-pours a retaining off white head and gold color. Aroma is funky earthy/woody hops, earthy medium malt. Taste is earthy/woody hops, earthy medium malt. OK carbonation. Fully English style.
Max Chocolate Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Max Lager's;"Name: Max American Porter Date: 08/30/2002 Mode: Draft Source: Brewpub Brown, whispy head, rich slightly sweet chocolate aroma, rich chocolate malt flavor, dry, touch of roasted bitterness in the finish Aroma: 7/10; Appearance: 5/10; Flavor: 5/10; Palate: 5/10; Overall: 10/20 Rating: 2.8/5.0 Score: **/4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The score was calculated based upon the notes and an old scoring system."
Max Chocolate Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Max Lager's;Very similar to the Max Black, with the burned brownies and smoke although there was more brownie and less burning and smoking. The flavor is more subdued, less sharp. It's also darker than the Black with smaller highlights that are just brown instead of ruby. That's topped by a fluffy light tan head that is slow to leave.
Hal and Mals Trophy Buck Stout;Jackson, Mississippi, United States;Stout;Hal and Mals;"I could detect very little aroma; very dark, as you'd expect from a stout; definite coffee taste"
Hal and Mals Trophy Buck Stout;Jackson, Mississippi, United States;Stout;Hal and Mals;Great mocha and cream aroma, unfortunately the beer didn't deliver what the smell promised. Flat, milky palate that needs more CO2 or hops or bitter malt or something. Pitch with camel head. Lactose sweet and only moderately bitter. Decent, but lacking character and too one-dimensional in the lactose sweet department. Nothing like Guiness, as the commercial desc suggests.
Hal and Mals Trophy Buck Stout;Jackson, Mississippi, United States;Stout;Hal and Mals;Nice flavor, very similar to Guinness. Think and chocolatey. Will drink again. Even better this time. A more complex and thicker chocolatey flavor. Almost like Young's double chocolate stout. Much better than last time with the flavor suddenly tasting unlike Guinness in a draught can.

Phoenix Porter;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Cask @ Trades Club, Hebden Bridge. Black with a frothy off-white head. Light tasting and easy drinking as it slips down the palate with ease. Has a hardly noticeable roasted aroma and taste, but even so is very enjoyable and could easily be a dark session ale.

Coach House Honeypot;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Coach House Brewing Co.;Cask [gravity dispense] at GBBF, day 3 on 3 August 2006. Clear amber colour. Aroma is not too bad - some light biscuit malt with a touch of fruit salad. However, on the palate there’s a sort of washed out honey feel that I find rather unpleasant. It’s as if the honey flavour has gone but the sweetness is left behind. And in a rather watery body with very little hop presence to liven things up. Not great.
Coach House Honeypot;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Coach House Brewing Co.;Cask. A hazy golden beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma has notes of malt and caramel. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt and caramel, leading to a dry toffeeish finish.

Quidi Vidi Honey Brown;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Second beer with my meal and better than the first but not by much. Amber with a bit of bubbly off white head. Light caramel and a bit of sugary maybe its honey with some faint earthy hop to counter. Sitting in a restaurant on the French Shore in Newfoundland with country music coming through the speakers overhead and 3 tables around me speaking french is a bit of a culture clash. Drink up the bar is calling.
Quidi Vidi Honey Brown;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Bottle at The Ship. Clear golden color white edge head. Subtle cocoa aroma. Even more subtle malt taste on a lager like background. Given the color I thought it might be a predecessor of today’s blonde stouts, sadly no

Quidi Vidi Honey Brown;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;"Pours a clear deep gold to pale amber with a short white head dissipating rapidly to a thin ring and no lacing. Nose is honey, light grain and malt, slightly floral. Taste is caramel and biscuity malt with hint of honey. Medium body and smooth, with moderate to prickly sustained carbonation. Well, it’s not brown, but it’s sorta honey. (I’ll be generous there, since it’s local, and assume it’s more ""honey"" and less ""corn syrup"".) I’ve of course had a great many of these over the years, but really the best one can say about it is, it gets the job done. Eventually. If “the job” is “quench thirst” and/or “impair judgement”. It’s better than an adjunct lager… barely. Fairly mediocre, overall."
Quidi Vidi Honey Brown;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;In bottle .. this wasn’t good. very light bodied, almost watery. No aroma and really no flavor. I would not buy this again at all.
Quidi Vidi Honey Brown;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;"Thanks to my bro for bringing this back for me from NFLD. This is pretty bad. Especially for a ""honey brown"". This is even worse than Sleeman’s Honey brown, which i found more palatable than this. Pours golden with grain and corn aromas. Nothing sweet or honey-like about this beer. Bitter finish....but not in a good way. It’s so mediocre in every way I’m surprised the Manitoba Liquor Commission hasn’t brought it in yet."
Quidi Vidi Honey Brown;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Golden colored beer with not very much aroma. The honey taste is not overpowering but it's definitely there. The aftertaste is a bit lingering but overall not horrible. Crisp taste off the top that eventually mellows.

Fegley's Brew Works Belgian Triple;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Fegley's Brew Works;"Served in a 12oz goblet at the Allentown Brew Works. Clear, light golden body with a quickly diminishing white head. Not as aromatic as I would expect from the style; smells of citrus, bread, and spice. Flavor was also less powerful than I would expect. Citrus, cloves, bread, and light hops were present. Quite sweet, and the 9% alcohol was hidden very well. Overall a good beer, but not the most flavorful or complex tripel."
Fegley's Brew Works Belgian Triple;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap at BBW, a very sweet aroma on a pale clear gold body. Definitely didn’t look like a tripel in the glass, but the flavor was very nice, a little on the sweet side, with neither component taking control of the flavor. The mouthfeel was almost a little tingly, possibly part of the 8.7% ABV that they say this has, but I didn’t really taste the alcohol as part of the beer.

Sweet citrus notes, mandarin oranges, cream candies on the nose. Wax paper-wrapped vanilla and butterscotch tastes.

Buller Cream Ale;Tristán Suárez, Ezeiza, Greater Buenos Aires, Argentina;Cream Ale;Buller Brewing Company;"A really mediocre attempt at a Boddington’s type brew--lacking in flavor, bouquet or ""cream"". Also, Buller’s prices are horrific for Argentina--though their brew pubs are packed with Argentines willing to pay London/East Coast prices to avoid contamination by the riff raff."
Buller Cream Ale;Tristán Suárez, Ezeiza, Greater Buenos Aires, Argentina;Cream Ale;Buller Brewing Company;Tap in May 2006. Golden ale with a thin white very lacing head.

Me gusta esta!

Buller Cream Ale;Tristán Suárez, Ezeiza, Greater Buenos Aires, Argentina;Cream Ale;Buller Brewing Company;Draft - December 2005 Pours a light copper colour, almost orange. Aroma is flowery, maybe a bit citric. Taste is subtle and soft, a hint of mineral, not very bitter nor malty. It flows very smoothly and, because of the head that remains at the bottom of the glass at the end of my pint i´m inclined to think it is nitro drafted.

Fat Weasel Pale Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Aroma is a bit weak and reminds me of cheap beer. A nice semi-opaque orange color. Starts out with a good, strong flavor, but it fades quickly into a kind of watered-down finish. It’s okay, but not great.
Fat Weasel Pale Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pours a pale copper with a good bit of head. Aroma is almost non-existent, but what is there is mostly metallic and faintly bitter. Taste matches the aroma, starts out decently enough, with a light bitterness and hint of hops and malty sweetness. This fades pretty quickly, however, and just waters down to a residual coppery taste. There is something slightly unpleasant about the finish, which I suspect is just lower-end quality brewing. Not bad... just not very good.
Fat Weasel Pale Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottled. Not a very big nor complex APA but better than macro stuff. Just a really light and low alcohol beer that is fine for a really hot day outside.
Fat Weasel Pale Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Ya, doesn’t pack much of a punch at all. Just a faint hoppy note, and a bland bitterness and washed out mouthfeel at the end. Just not very enjoyable, especially from a style I normally love.

Got better the more I drank. (#4679, 7/7/2012)

Schloss Pils;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;"500 ml brown PET-bottle, a gift from Germany. Now called ""(Traditional) Schloss Premium Pils"".

Pale golden colour, large head. Sweetish fruity aroma, not bad. The flavour is rather moderately hopped for a German pils, there is a very moderate sweetness in the background. Not a great pils by any means, but not repulsive either. At least it is ""Reinheitsgebot"" ...

Poured pale yellow body with smaller white head. Not really strong aroma of some flowery malts, with somewhat sourish touch. Flavor sourish probably from the hops and sweetish malty, let’s say pleasant but very light bodied. Finish is short, reflecting the sweetness of the flavor. Not so bad but far too light.

Poured a pale yellow-golden colour, small creamy white head that went away fast, lazy carbonation. The nose turned out to be quite weak, just some weak and unimpressive notes of malt and honey showed themselves. The taste isn’t any stronger... some weak weak sweet maltiness, which was supposed to be balanced by some herbal hopiness near the end, which turned out to be flat and unimpressive, if quite noticable and somewhat lasting... the two tastes don’t complement each other all that well. Just a touch eggy. Ok I guess, but bland. Shame.

Nymburk Postřižinské Francinův Ležák 12°;Nymburk, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Nymburk;Had it from the bottle so there's nothing much to say about its appearance. Unfortunately, it was also a bit past its prime so I can't really say much about the taste either... Anyway, malt side took over. Strong caramel and honey notes combined with herbal and unpleasantly bitter background. A bit cloying, really. I'll leave a generic rating and re-rate when (if) I hopefully get ahold of a fresh sample.

Joshua Huddys Amber;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Joshua Huddys Brewery;"(4/98) This beer was nearly forced on my in an ice coated mug that was so cold the beer started to freeze. Even the arctic chilled mug could not force a head onto this (I'm sorry) bile colored ""amber."" Who's idea was it to cram a so-called brewery into a Ground Round? Smells a bit like dishwater, that's probably the overpowering aroma of melting dishwater/ice. This stuff tastes like Karo and water and pennies and cornbread. Not refreshing, even though it was served at -25 degrees. This was the second beer I gave back to the bartender. Sadly, not the worst beer I've ever had."

No visible carbonation. Aroma: mild ripe apple, some pear. Flavour: nice ripe apple, lovely carbonation with an almost peach like finish. Not bad at all
Stutz Hard Apple Cider;Grand Pré, Nova Scotia, Canada;Apple Cider;The Cider House / Domaine de Grand Pré;Forgot who I got this from, sorry, but thank you to the kind soul who provided it. Neither good nor bad, strictly speaking, but instead pretty similar to every other bottled hard cider I have ever had. Too sweet, almost artificial in the aroma, but taste is much milder apple and tart flavors and a chalky, peely aftertaste. Light mouthfeel and effervescent carbonation. Know what I would like? A cider that’s sweet like an ice wine. Guess I’d better pony up for one of those Quebec ice ciders.
Stutz Hard Apple Cider;Grand Pré, Nova Scotia, Canada;Apple Cider;The Cider House / Domaine de Grand Pré;(Bottle) Obtained through a trade with OKBeer. Pours a clear, light yellow body with a very active carbonation. Nose of sweet apples, milky white wine and a slight yeastiness. Very well presented and nicely sweetened. Good apple presentation with a mid-palate that delivers a tart dryness into the finish. I really don’t understand the poor reviews for this unless it very susceptible to temperature changes during transportation? This trade took place in November which may have kept the goodness preserved. Similar to Jodoin Temptation. Very refreshing!

Stutz Hard Apple Cider;Grand Pré, Nova Scotia, Canada;Apple Cider;The Cider House / Domaine de Grand Pré;Pale golden yellow. No head. Aroma is apple pie... nothing much too it.

Aroma: Super mild aroma with creamer and milk chocolate, but it’s way weak. Taste: Sweet malts with big chocolate and mild roasted malts. Subtle yeasty esters on the finish top this off nicely. The finish lingers of bitter dark chocolate. Palate: Soft and thick. Overall: Despite the mild aroma, this is a great imperial stout with bold flavor.

Triumph Imperial Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Triumph Brewing Company;I had this on tap at the Princeton location. It was served in a snifter, which was nice to see. The color is a completely opague black with a tan head. Lacing lasts a long time. Hay fever had my sinuses a bit stuffed up, so I wasn’t able to get as much aroma as I should but what I got was predominatly roasted malt. Flavor was also chocolatey roasted barley. It was served a pretty cold, but even as it warmed the alcohol stayed well in the background. All in all a very good Imperial Stout.
Triumph Imperial Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Triumph Brewing Company;Root beer brew with browned creme top. Exceptionally hoppy nose for an imperial stout, but otherwise, the malting seems subdued, or even flat. Pleasant chocolate roast barley flavors wind through the palate, with the hop flavor more balanced than the aroma would indicate. Well crafted to conceal the potency.

Good lacing follows on this one. Nose is toffee, biscuit malt, light spice, toffee apple, brown bread. Taste comprises bready malt, earthy tones, biscuit base, bready malts, light sugar.

Triumph Scottish Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;Triumph Brewing Company;In short: Bland cereals and bland tea-like hops. Well brewed but rather bland How: Tap at brewpub, Princeton location The look: Clear amber body topped by a medium beige head In long: Unexpected tea-like nose, the type of generic tea-bag aroma served in cheap diners. Taste of bland breakfast healthy brown cereals and whole-wheat bread. Not much in the way of caramel, toffee or other sweet flavours. Very soft with a airy body. Finish has a little dry grass and the generic tea that I got in the nose, unusual but bland tea-like hopping here. Yet another Scottish Ale that I find totally boring. I really need to avoid that style but I didn’t have access to ratebeer at the pub so how could I know what style the beer was just by its name.

Triumph Scottish Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;Triumph Brewing Company;Cask in Princeton. Nice amber color with a thick tan head. Too much foam in my opinion. Smell had caramel, toffee, chocolate and vanilla. Interesting buttery flavor. I found this overly bitter because the temperature was too warm. This was above average but not memorable.

Aroma was lots and lots of corn starch, fruit, and yeast.

Hard to get over the sweetness and the blandness of this one.
Chelsea Frostys Winter Wheat Wine;Bronx, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;The aroma is cereal grains, wheat, caramel. The appearance is somewhat clear yellow, white head. The flavor is like a wheat ale, usually for the normally oversweet wheat wine style. The alcohol is undetectable. Thin/medium in body, a disapointment for this style. The finish is wheat, cereal grainy, no real hops (!?!). Not great, but I didn’t vomit.
Chelsea Frostys Winter Wheat Wine;Bronx, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;On tap. Odd beer.

Chelsea Frostys Winter Wheat Wine;Bronx, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Murky blond pour. Not too familiar with Barley Wines, this one at least seems similar to a Saison.

Buttered sherry aroma. Raisiny, fizzy. Chew of dried fruits over a solid biscuity backdrop. Light lemon curd notes; almond, nougat. Honeyed with no esters or hops to lift it. Dull."

Bright pour, a gleaming light amber with moderate carbonation and nice sticky legs. Toasted coconut, mild citrus, and sweet toffee in the nose. Body was lively, with a slightly too sticky feel in places (a common enough feature for the style). Flavors were quite floral to start, and - after a sweet, malt-heavy center - led to a bitter finish. More complexity than in some wheatwines I’ve had and I found it pretty good.

Pizzeria Uno Station House Red Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;On cask. Deep red color and unfiltered and very cloudy, nice body.

Pizzeria Uno Station House Red Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Deep amber with white head and lace. Medium malt and a funky caramel or brown sugar aroma. Medium caramel/molasses flavor with a medium bitter. A bit foamy and a tad thin. Not a bad drinker but not very special.
Pizzeria Uno Station House Red Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Pours red (obviously) with a small white head. Tastes much like a Killians red with light flavor of caramel. Light palate overall its just OK. Worth a try.
Pizzeria Uno Station House Red Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;"Not much aroma, but what was there was all malt and nothing else. Has a reddish-copper hue and a very short off white head that provided nice lacing all the way down. A bit overcarbonated and watery, this doesn’t taste like any Irish Red (or Amber ale) I’ve ever had, but was crisp and easy to drink. Not much flavor here, with almost no hop presence makes it balanced in a bland sort of way. I would consider this to be a ""starter"" more than even a session type offering. Nothing special."
Pizzeria Uno Station House Red Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;sampled at the brewpub. Amber in color, aroma is light floral hops and malt, some light roast. Taste is pretty much the same with a lighly bitter finish. not bad.
Pizzeria Uno Station House Red Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Sample at Metuchen,NJ location. Not much aroma here, maybe because of the sample size? Copper red brown color. Initial flavor that is strong in caramel and brown suger, but quickly dissipates. Hoppy finisih is spicy with some notes of pumperknickel, but I pick up too much hairspray flavors. The weakest of the sampler.

Pizzeria Uno 32 Inning Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;The waitress described this beer as being much like a Heinekein but to me it had a stronger flavor and was pretty good, but nothing special. Tasted like a commercial beer, but more fresh - makes sense. Very small white head/amber yellow pour.
Pizzeria Uno 32 Inning Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Second beer of the night that I tried at Uno. Nice flavor for a summertime blonde ale, but wait.........it’s supposed to be a pilsener? I guess it tastes like a pilsener? Had a slightly buttery, yet clean, texture and was leaning more towards the doughy, malty flavor of a traditional Czech pilsener than the more hoppy styles to be had near the German coast. Golden coloring with a small white head. Tough to get much head when Uno freezes the glasses before serving, but the carbonation was still towards the stronger side and I have no complaints about that. The mouthfeel was nice and the aftertaste was nil. A decent offering that compliments greasy deep dish pizza well.
Pizzeria Uno 32 Inning Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;sampled at the brewpub. very light clear straw color. Butter/vanilla notes in the aroma, along with some grain. Taste is lightly buttery, vanilla, diacetyl but not completely overwhelming, grainy, clean watery finish.
Pizzeria Uno 32 Inning Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Did they use ale yeast when they call it a Bohemian Pilsner? Pours golden with white head. Pale malt and pilsneresque lager aroma. Flavor is bread like, with hints of pils malt, grass, and hay. Crisp hoppy finish, but the soapines is a bit overwhelming.

Aroma of toasty grainy sweet pale malts and some grassy English hops. Body starts fairly full and well-carbonated with a grainy malty sweetness and grassy earthy resiny bittering hops before a drier toasty bittersweet finish. A pretty good IPA.
Pizzeria Uno Ikes India Pale Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;On cask this was boring. Average for a light pale ale not close to an IPA on cask. Draft version definitely had more hops present than the cask version. Draft was way more vibrant and carbonation was very, even ultra low for a cask. Even though it was on cask I expected some carb. The red was better. Rating average of two.
Pizzeria Uno Ikes India Pale Ale;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Red/copper pour with off white head and lace. Medium malt and medium hops on the nose. Caramel malt and a nice finishing bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A fine beer. I also had this beer at noogfest 08 but could not find it on the site.

Pizzeria Uno Gust-N-Gale Porter;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Poured a dark brown with a small white/tannish head that lasted probably half way down the glass.

Pizzeria Uno Gust-N-Gale Porter;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Poured a nearly opaque brown, with blonde highlights. Little head or lacing. Smelled and tasted a bit like iced coffee. Carbonation was pretty much spot on, flavor was mild, yet all the right flavors were there, the coffee, the malt, the slightest hint of toffee. Looks like a Porter or almost even a stout, yet tastes more like a Porter leaning towars a Brown. However, that’s not a bad thing and it might be the best out of the handfull of Pizzeria Uno offerings I’ve tried.
Pizzeria Uno Gust-N-Gale Porter;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Pint served very cold. Hazy dark brown pour leaving a lasting beige foam. Surprisingly hoppy and ridiculously cheap at 1.75$. Bready, well-roasted ale with flowery aromas. Gentle brown chocolate flavours together with a minimally lactic tang. Highly effervescent, exaggeratedly so even cuts the flavour evolution short and bites the tongue sharply and unfortunately.
Pizzeria Uno Oatmeal Stout;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Stout;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Pours black with a thin tan/almost brown head. Aroma is of sweet chocolate, and some light roasty notes. Taste is complex, with a nice thick mouthfeel. Dark roasted malts, chocolate, some sweet flavors, light coffee. Very well done.

Nice head, malty aroma with a perfect nose of hops, color alone made my mouth water. Taste completed my rave. This beer was delicious! I believe it’s a seasonal brew, but dang, if it’s served fresh...get it and get it often. I had three of these bad boys with a damn good cheeseburger. I highly recommend.

Long Valley Oatmeal Stout;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Stout;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;Long Valley Oatmeal Stout - 4.5% abv - Winter 2010 batch (No longer Joe’s Oatmeal Stout). Had on nitro-tap at brewery in shaker. Poured with unusually large oat head, just off-white. Dark brown with lots of ruby highlights. Nose of oats and roasted malt. Light to medium bodied, relatively flat with smooth texture. Mellow roasted flavor, little to no hop presence. Super easy to drink.
Long Valley Oatmeal Stout;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Stout;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;Deepest brown, but clear around the edges. Oatmeal comes out nicely in the nose. Sugary flour, brown sugar, rather cakey misture of malts. A tiny alcohol note manages to sneak in. Minimal perceived hoppiness. A bit sloppy on the palate, the carbonation appears faded. The little coffee notes in there are toppled by rich chocolate warmth, that, paired with the oats, make for a rather rich medium body, bready and with full-on maltiness.
Long Valley Oatmeal Stout;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Stout;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;On tap at the brew pub. Pours black with an average size creamy tan head that left some lacing.

Long Valley Oatmeal Stout;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Stout;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;GABF 2005: Rich deep brown hue with a small but lasting creamy head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of oats and grains, chocolate, aromatic hops, and woody yeast esters. The taste is similar to the the nose and in this beers case, that is a good thing. Lots of sweetness and malty goodness but a nice dose of finishing bitters and a touch of coffee keep it from becoming cloy. Smooth and lush, this is one solid sweet stout, yummy!
Long Valley Oatmeal Stout;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Stout;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;Take your gold medal winner Lazy Jake Porter, take some slightly more roasted malts, toss in some oatmeal, and you have Oatmeal Stout. Pours with a head as hard to penetrate as styrofoam, and a color so beautiful it makes you want to cry. Long Valley Pub & Brewery proves that when it comes to dark craft beers, they are still the king.
Long Valley Oatmeal Stout;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Stout;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. A delicious stout. This seems to have been built off the model of their Lazy Jake Porter. No complaints here about that. Nice seasonal stout.

Thomas Creek River Falls Red Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thomas Creek Brewery;A great example of an Irish red ale. Irish red is one of my favorite styles and this beer is excellent, Balances the sweetness and caramel flavor with just enough hops, not overly sweet or overly bitter.
Thomas Creek River Falls Red Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thomas Creek Brewery;Thus far I've had a hit-and-miss experience with this popular red ale from Thomas Creek, some bottles have been overtly sweet and thin-bodied while others have had a bit more complex caramel maltiness and texture. Not sure if that's a production issue or a shelf-life issue, hard to say without a date on the bottle. Anyhow, from a recent good bottle, this poured a pale amber-red color with a cap of bright white foam and decent lacing, although I normally look for a brighter ruby color in red ales. Sweet caramel and toffee candy on the nose, followed by a predominantly caramel malt flavor with notes of subtle toasted malt and breadiness. Perhaps some earthiness from the bready malt, but not really any complex earthy or bitter hop notes. Overall, strikes me as a just a higher quality rendition of the macro Irish red Killians.
Thomas Creek River Falls Red Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thomas Creek Brewery;12oz bottle at the Peace Center before the Nutcracker. Pours clear reddish amber with a thin white head. Cereal notes, sweet malt. Very light body, somewhat sweet finish. OK.

Blind Man Pale Ale;Athens, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blind Man Ales;This is one of the best pale ales that I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I had this on draft at Smith's Olde Bar, and it is delicious. Cloudy and opaque in appearance, a unique floral smell that smells very musty and sweaty but in a good way. Tastes extrememly sweet and bitter all at the same time, with a nice yeasty finish, because of the layer of sediment unique to Blind Man Ales.

Blind Man Espresso Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout;Blind Man Ales;Blind Man ales was a very innovative brewery. I remember having a sample of their Brown Ale and it being so different from any other beer (although I don’t remember it enough to provide an entry for it here). On to the beer at hand: the espresso stout was available in Atlanta in 6-packs along with one or two other beers by blind man (btw, a new Athens, GA brewery called Terrapin has started relatively recently and they also have a beer that uses coffee from Jittery Joes). The beer had a very nice aroma of roasted/burnt malts and strong coffee. The beer poured black with a very dark head. The time I bought bottles from a grocery store, the bottles were a little over-carbonated - it would foam out of the bottle without even pouring it. After letting some of the CO2 gas out, the mouthfeel was pleasant and properly carbonated. The taste was big and bitter - coffee bitterness combined with unmalted roasted barley bitterness overpowered any bitterness provided by hops. But in a good way (if you like coffee stouts). It was a very memorable beer.
Blind Man Espresso Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout;Blind Man Ales;This is a small local brewery in Athens, GA. This is truly the best stout I have ever had, hands down. The coffee taste comes from actual turkish ground espresso grounds from a local coffee house called Jittery Joes. The aroma is captivating, what a mean scent it is. Columbus hops for bittering. WIth a mixture of roasted barley, black and two-row malts provides most of the beers dark dark appearance. A must for all, you can get this now I am told you can still find this is small batches, if you ever are in the south, you must try this!
Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Light sweet caramel notes. Clear gold with a small white head. Caramel and a light bitterness.
Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;On tap at Mt Begbie, pours a clear amber with a small off-white head. Aroma is quite malty, with bready malt and barely any hop content. Flavour is balanced between the malts and hops, being more characterized by bready malt and toasted caramel. A little bit of bittering hops to balance. Not too interesting.
Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;650ml brown bottle. Golden colour, clear, thin white head. Nose is toasty and grainy with caramel sweetness. Taste is malty, sweet caramel, grains and toasty notes. Not much of a finish. A fairly plain English pale ale.
Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Appearance: clear pale amber with a short ivory head, good retention and patchy lacing. (3/5) Aroma: biscuity and caramel malt, honey, grassy, light diacetyl. (6/10) Taste: moderate sweet, mild bitter. (6/10) Palate: medium body, lively carbonation, brief duration finish. (3/5) I guess it’s reasonably true to style, but I’d be happier with more hop presence. Sessionable, and would probably go well with fish and chips. Can’t see ever bothering to try it again. (12/20)
Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;"This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a mostly clear amber color with a slim white head that just capped the top of the pint glass. A basic film glossed the top of the beer. Light carbonation was seen rising to the top. The smell had a huge roasty caramel aroma over top of a light ""soapy"" English-like flavor. The taste copied the aroma and gave off a light sweet malty soapy aftertaste. A quick sweet semi-watery finish accompanies the aftertaste. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed okay. Overall, I say this was a good English Pale ale I could have again and with some fish n’ chips if I would find again."
Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Bottle. Clear amber pour with small white head. Sweet malty aroma. Taste is quite flat and sweet. Low carbonation.

Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Draught at Burgoo on 10th Ave W, Vancouver, as “Burgoo Brew” house ale Light amber color, with creamy head. Aroma of biscuits, malt, cereals. Dry mouthfeel, with a decent grainy caramel flavor and ordinary bitterness. Pleasant, with a personal touch.
Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;The aroma and taste of this one are both recognizable, but feels like they come from different beers... the aroma is of crystalline hay, the flavour (which I admit is mainly aroma itself, but what you feel when exhaling while drinking) is caramel coffeeish. Only at the finish did I pick up on hops, which were mildly lemony. OK, but not coherent.
Mt. Begbie Powerhouse Pale Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;650ml bottle pours a pale amber color with a finger and a half of white head that settles quite quickly leaving only a few spots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is light grassy hops with some caramel. Taste is a light caramel malty sweetness with some grassy hop bitterness. Light to medium body with abundant carbonation. A pretty decent pale ale, but would be better with a more pronounced hoppiness.
Phoenix Old Oak Premium Bitter;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);First tasted this at the Boswell Hotel, Glasgow in December 1994. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale garnet in colour with a thick off white creamy head. Sweet aroma of malt and berry fruit, short in intensity. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a moist maltloaf base with sultanas, raisins and brown sugar. Slight prickle of dusty hops gives a brief bitter aftertaste. Finish is malty with chocolate powder, maple syrup and oak cask notes laced through. An ok session bitter.
Phoenix Old Oak Premium Bitter;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Cask various locations over many years. brown, almost orange colour with white head.

Goose Island Imperial IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Sixteen ounce glass. A rather weak IPA, medium lacing , not very bitter. It was alright , but I am not in a hurry to have another.
Goose Island Imperial IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);"From Nov 2007 I got this one in a trade with autumnaldave. Thanks Dave! This is the 2007 edition, best by 041208 and it pours a clear gold with a nice 2 finger head of foam that settles down to a 1/2"" layer further into the session. Lots of nice lacing to be had here. The smell is a wonderful nose of floral hoppiness along with a touch of spice. The taste is hoppy to the max. Lots of floral and some grapefruit are tickling my taste buds. There's some malt character in the background to somewhat balance things out but this fresh bottle really is all about the hops. Tasty son of a gun. It has a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is nice and lightly done. It finishes very florally with just the smallest of touches of caramel malt. Yummy. And...the alcohol is hidden pretty well so I'd say this is quite drinkable. I reviewed a 2006 version that was slightly past its best by last year and the hop character was quite subdued compared to this. Either way, you get a top quality DIPA but I defintely prefer the fresher sample. Thanks again, Dave!"
Goose Island Imperial IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Tried for the first time back in 2008, still a very solid DIPA.

Goose Island Imperial IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Draft at The Pour House in Westmont, NJ. Pours a very cloudy, very dark golden orange color with light tangerine edges and a 1.5 finger white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Really good retention with streaks of soapy lacing left behind. Dank resinous hop aroma with lots of pine needle, spruce tip and earthy grass character. This is countered by a subtle citrus presence along with boozy sweetness and a caramel malt backbone. On the fuller end of medium bodied with a very dry and dank earthy hop presence that lingers over the malt backbone and boozy sweetness into a slightly dry finish. Dry, sticky and bitter with aggressive hops up front. The hop profile is a bit one dimensional however with only very subtle citrus character. Could use some more sweetness for balance. Malt backbone is a bit too heavy for my liking with notes of caramel, toffee and biscuit followed by boozy heat in finish. Decently hoppy but alcohol and strong malt flavors hinder the flavor a bit.

Taste is crisp but distinctly bitter. The full hops taste overpowers this beer, leaving it all on the palate after the swallow. A mild clove and lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. A good Imperial IPA, just not my style.

English Ales Edinburgh Winter Ale Special Reserve;Marina, California, United States;Flavored - Other;English Ales Brewery;This beer poured a hazy dark greenish brown with hardly any head. Aromas included cookie, carmel, molasses and some sort of mysterious aftershave like aroma—bay leaves, maybe? The palate was light-to-medium with a velvety texure and soft carbonation. The flavor was lightly bitter and a short, slightly sweet finish. I didn’t find this beer terribly engaging, but not bad.
English Ales Edinburgh Winter Ale Special Reserve;Marina, California, United States;Flavored - Other;English Ales Brewery;2003 vintage. Pours a clear reddish-brown with a thin amber head that dissapates quickly except for the side of the glass.Malty aroma with some vinous notes, spices and chocolate. Very thin body for a winter ale. Tastes of chocolatey malt up front, followed by more malt and spices.
English Ales Edinburgh Winter Ale Special Reserve;Marina, California, United States;Flavored - Other;English Ales Brewery;Pours medium brown with little head. They're not messing around with this winter warmer - it's all spice and more spice. Aftertaste of orange peel, pumpkin and apples. Unfortunately, the flavor does not match up to the amazing aroma.
English Ales Edinburgh Winter Ale Special Reserve;Marina, California, United States;Flavored - Other;English Ales Brewery;Medium brown color. Small head. Aroma is amazing spicy and malty and perfumey. Malty and slightly sweet. Carmel and toffee. Very spicy. Nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and others. A milder flavored ale. Very drinkable but it does NOT live up to its wonderful nose. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
English Ales Edinburgh Winter Ale Special Reserve;Marina, California, United States;Flavored - Other;English Ales Brewery;Light brown with a small head. Nice spicy, somewhat-perfumey aroma alongside a beautiful malt aroma. Very strong caramelized malt flavor. Slight sweetness. I can't really put my finger on the spices--cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg? Fairly light bodied. Wonderful aroma whose promise is left unfulfilled.
Haines Lookout Stout;Haines, Alaska, United States;Stout - Dry;Haines Brewing Co.;"Tap at the brewpub. Pours very dark brown with a creamy beige head. Nice chocolate aroma. Smooth dark malt. Med body or better. Flavor is smooth dark malt with a little chocolate and something suggesting chicory. Brewer suggests that’s roasted barley. Pretty dry; decently bitter. Good stout."
Haines Lookout Stout;Haines, Alaska, United States;Stout - Dry;Haines Brewing Co.;"On tap at Hangar on the Wharf: appearance was a pure jet black color with a thin less than a finger’s worth of head (bar pour); light lacing is left in the wake; roasty coffee smell; its got the same taste; dry roasty aftertaste and finish (kinda hits ya like an Irish Dry Stout); not too heavy on the palate but still sits well enough like any stout should; overall good Irish Dry Stout that I would have again"

Haines Lookout Stout;Haines, Alaska, United States;Stout - Dry;Haines Brewing Co.;Draft at Cafe Amsterdam, Anchorage (Thanks Ken!). This is a nice American stout ... delicious sweet chocolate at its core, but also with a subtle coffee aspect to it as well, I enjoyed a couple of these while visiting my favorite Anchorage beer haunt.

Haines Lookout Stout;Haines, Alaska, United States;Stout - Dry;Haines Brewing Co.;19-Jan-08 (Draft: Connoisseur’s Session, 2008 Great Alaskan Beer and Barley Wine Festival in Anchorage, AK) Earthy hay aroma is most prominent, with some chocolate, coffee and roast, but oddly for a stout, these are more background flavors. Some roast in the flavor, light sweetness, finishing with some milk chocolate. The finish is easily the best part of this stout. Medium body seems too thin, dry, medium in carbonation. Very dark brown in color and nearly opaque. The tan head settles to a film and a wide, bubbly ring. As stouts go, this one is on the mediocre side.
Haines Lookout Stout;Haines, Alaska, United States;Stout - Dry;Haines Brewing Co.;From multiple growlers filled at the brewery while in Haines, 12/2005. Rich, Deep, complex, but still pretty clean. A slight fruitiness from the yeast, with a touch of diacetyl. The finish is on the dry side. Nice woody/mapley flavours of a homebrewed style stout that you never taste in a commercial stout. Very low hop flavor and bitterness, allows the nice roasted grain flavor to shine through. Haines brewing Co. apparently sells more of this than any of their other beers, and it shows.
Haines Lookout Stout;Haines, Alaska, United States;Stout - Dry;Haines Brewing Co.;A fantastic stout. Dark roasted flavors abound, but not bitter, more of a creamy taste. Don’t drink it too cold. Let it warm up a bit. Highly drinkable.

Haines Bigger Hammer Barley Wine;Haines, Alaska, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Haines Brewing Co.;19-Jan-08 (Draft: Connoisseur’s Session, 2008 Great Alaskan Beer and Barley Wine Festival in Anchorage, AK) Fruity, malty, chocolaty with some light tart fruitiness in the background. Less body than most barley wines, and carbonation is light-medium. Slight tart fruit aroma, but mostly malty and fruity. Medium-brown in color and fairly hazy. A good barley wine, but not one that stands out.
Haines Bigger Hammer Barley Wine;Haines, Alaska, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Haines Brewing Co.;A swingtop bottle, saved with care by Alaskanwarren, since June 2004. A picturesque strong beer pour, with a small, fine layer of creamy head. Amber body. Hops are entirely gone from the nose, which seems appropriate for an aged barleywine. Very buttery carmel aroma. Smooth. Flavor reminds me of a failry dry-leaning manzilla sherry, with toasty almond flavors and a finish that is cleaner and dryer than the initial aroma might lead you to expect. The alcohol is there, but blends well with the rest of the flavors. Full body, but not sticky. This is a fabulous barleywine! Sort of what I hoped an old barleywine would taste like, but the first chance I’ve had to taste a well cared for example. Thank you Alaskanwarren for the chance to taste this!

Haines Bigger Hammer Barley Wine;Haines, Alaska, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Haines Brewing Co.;Talked at length with the brewer about his barleywines. A true craftsman. Not as hoppy as many barleywines. This is a rich beer, sweet and smooth. I’ve tried the longer-aged barleywine, and it’s very good as well. More rich, smoother with barely noticeable carbonation. Good beer, worth taking the time to sip and savour.
Haines Bigger Hammer Barley Wine;Haines, Alaska, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Haines Brewing Co.;Out of the keg at the 2003 Great Alaska Beer and Barley Wine Festival. Dark orange color with no head and a subtle, sherry nose. Complex malt sweetness of dark plums, burnt caramel and butterscotch. Well balanced with hops in finish.

Syrupy and intense. Front is sweet and fruity, followed by wonderful grainy character. Smooth, soft and velvety. warm and inviting, big, full mouthfeel. Chocolate and woody notes emerge through the syrupy sweetness. I couldn't believe it was so strong until I stood up. One of my all time favorite barley wines, I am eternally grateful for even geting a glass off the cask. A freind who works at the resturant let me know it was on the cask. I went in for a glass that night and the next. Unfortunately though, that next evening, the cask had run out 10 minutes prior to my arrival. Awesome nonetheless!! I cant wait for the next!

Big River Grille Scottish Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Scottish Ale;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Draught. Pours a light red hue. The aroma is certainly akin to a Scottish ale, though rather generic. Notes of peat, caramel, pipe smoke are detected though mostly a sweet malty aroma dominates. The body is almost sticky with a fairly smoky, nutty finish like toasted almonds perhaps. Mild notes of rose and peat turn up in the sweet flavor. Pretty average, sweet, malty beer. Drinkable.

Drinkable but very tame.
Jasper Murdocks Dr. Bowles Elixir;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;"My Bottom Line: Dark fruit and roasted nuts are ably balanced out by earthy and leafy hoppiness in this able-bodied quencher. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the hazy reddish brown. -Plantane bread subtleties rise in the nose upon warming. -The head dies rather quickly in the glass. -The fruitiness is raisiny and sometimes appears as cherries. -The hops do contribute some calculated bitterness. -I’m not sure this follows any style really; Brown Ale? Red Ale? Imperial Mild? On tap at the brewpub."

Jasper Murdocks Private Stock;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Strong Ale - American;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;"On tap at the brewpub. I would've said this is more like an English strong (little hoppiness, woody-sweet character) but whatever. The important thing is the quality of the beer. Extremely dark molasses brown, nearly opaque, no head and very still. Big malty-sweet nose with hints of blueberries; it was served too cold so the nose was impeded for much of my sample. Very nice fruitiness throughout, very drinkable and pleasant, almost no carbonation, just a hint of bitterness at the end. Very nice, I just wish they had more offerings tonight."

Bittings Woodbridge Winter Warmer;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;I had it on tap. It pours a reddish brown color with no head and barely any lacing. The aroma was faint spice. The taste was strange with hints of apple and other fruit and lots of spice. It was pretty sweet. The cinnamon and nutmeg flavors are strong. The palate was thin and a little flat. Batches of this in past years have been better.

Bittings Woodbridge Winter Warmer;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Pours a clear, somewhat copper color with a tiny lacing of a head. Aroma is of some cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, caramel and a little more spice. Taste is solid, some cinnamon, sweet caramel notes, vanilla, clove and a light earth taste as it warms a bit, big on the cinnamon flavor, but not in an offensive way. Definitely the standout of the trip there.
Bittings Woodbridge Winter Warmer;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Draft from a sampler. This was far and away the best if the six beers I tried. Deep amber body with a smaller off white head. Aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg over a grainy malty base. Medium bodied with a lingering aftertaste. Flavor has lots of spices up front that blend nicely over the malty body.
Bittings Woodbridge Winter Warmer;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;"At the brewery. Dark brown/black body with minimal head. Sweet smell. Cola, toffee, corn syrup notes. A little too sweet. Despite dark color, not too thick; on the thin side palate-wise. A pretty good beer."
Bittings Woodbridge Winter Warmer;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Nice dark mahogany coloring with miles of tan head. Honestly, too much head for the style. However, the carbonation level was right where it should be, and letting it sit in my glass for a while brought everything out. Hints of coffee, chocolate, spice, etc. Lots going on here with the flavor. Medium to thinner body, with a nice bittersweet finish. Seek it out.
Bittings Woodbridge Winter Warmer;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Growler me! Oh yeah, great beer. Wonderful when you are snowed in, deep in the winter. Powerful aroma, and swimming with flavor. Can’t miss this one if you have the chance.
Bittings Woodbridge Winter Warmer;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;This beer is very good... It lives up to its name. You can taste the nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and vanilla... you can certainly taste the nutmeg as it exudes this beer. Served cold... probably would be better at room temp.

S: The aroma is somewhat light, but what is there is pretty enjoyable. Hints of toffee and bread with a light grassy hop aroma. T: Fairly heavy on the bread with a light sweetness in the form of toffee. There’s a slight creaminess to this beer that was sort of surprising, but also enjoyable. A very moderate level of bitterness. M: The body is a bit on the heavy side for an ESB, but still good. Medium carbonation to go with it. D: Like most US drinkers, I prefer my ESBs more on the bitter side, but this was still pretty good.

S: The aroma has a decent hoppiness to it. Some mild grapefruit and orange notes and a slight bit of pine. The rest of the nose is made up of caramel malts. T: The flavor is about what you would expect from the aroma. A bit of citrus on the front with the caramel malt doing the majority of the work. The finish has a nice bitterness to it. M: The mouthfeel was a touch thin and watery and the carbonation was appropriate. D: Another easy to drink pale ale (as if there weren’t enough of them). I wasn’t totally crazy about the beer, but with some pizza, it’s wouldn’t be a bad pint to have.

Ocean Avenue Ocean Pale Ale;Laguna Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ocean Avenue Brewing Co.;One of the four Ocean Avenue beers on my flight at the brewpub on 12th May 2015. The least interesting of the four tried, pale gold with a small head it had a mild hoppy nose and flavour, balanced by a malt backbone. It could not compete with the two beers either side of it: the Sunshine Red had a semi-sweetness and the Main Beach IPA out hopped it. Maybe drank alone it would have faired better, but on the flight it sank into oblivion.

As early as 1328, The Augustiner Brothers were brewing bier within the Augustinian monastery in Munich.

Dick's Mountain Ale;Centralia, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dick's Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours clear copper – gold with thin white head. Does the “mountain” part of this amber prevent it from attaining an amber color? This is the goldest amber I’ve ever seen. The aroma is sweet malts mixing with caramel malts and a touch of biscuit and toffee. The taste has some modest yet vague to maybe pine hoppy notes blending with caramel malts, sweet sugary malts and a touch of roastiness. I think I get a sense of citrus into the finish. Interesting interpretation.

Rupp-Bräu Dunkel;Lauenau, Lower Saxony, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauhaus Felsenkeller - Rupp-Bräu;Eigener Antrunk, dominiert von einem dumpfen Hopfenton. Im Mittelteil grasiger, der Hopfen wird aromatischer und bleibt dies auch. Vollmundig aber eher unsüffig scheint das Bier hier zu sein, hintergründig mit einer Vielzahl von Aromen. Auch das Malz befindet sich hier noch im Hintergrund und kommt erst im Abgang zur Geltung. Immerhin setzt es hier direkt intensiv ein, hat aber gegen die Hopfigkeit keine Chance und muss sich mit Platz 2 zufireden geben. Untypisches und voluminös hopfiges Dunkel.

Jedem anderen Bier hätte ich dies negativ ausgelegt, aber hier passt es doch ganz gut. Die Malzig-pickigen Aromen werden schön von einer leichten Hopfenbittere unterstrichen, die sich zwar vornehm zurückhält, aber nicht ganz verschwindet. Es wird wohl nicht mein Lieblingsbier werden, aber hie und da kann man es schon trinken.

Holnsteiner Ahnentrunk;Neukirchen-Holnstein, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schlossbrauerei Holnstein;Säuerlicher Antrunk mit nur leichtem Malzeinschlag, der von der gleichzeitig auftretenden Herbe in den Hintergrund gestellt wird. Im Mittelteil wirkt das Bier etwas unorientiert, es kommt kein klares Aromen zustande, stattdessen sind säuerliche, herbe und bedingt malzige Töne mal stärker und mal weniger stark präsent. Im Abgang sind die Aromen alle auf ein Minimum zurückgeschraubt und hinterlassen einen wässrigen Grundton. Extrem unspektakuläres Dunkles, das sich geschmacklich höchstens in einem Experimentier-Status befindet. Test vom 27.12.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 11,5,5,3,8,4 - 5,05

Holnsteiner Barons Urhell;Neukirchen-Holnstein, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Schlossbrauerei Holnstein;Getreidiger Antrunk wobei das Getreide, dass den Hauptteil einnimmt, nur kurz alleine ist und dann Gesellschaft von einem leich würzigen und honigartig süßlichem Ton bekommt. Deutlich hopfiger werdend, dieses Aroma zieht eine deutliche Bitterkeit mit sich, die aber durch eine grasig-süßliche Note abgemildert wird. Das Bier wird nun noch etwas würziger und verharrt einige Zeit auf diesem Punkt bevor der eher bitter geprägte Abgang beginnt, der sich im Nachgeschmack noch steigern kann.

One of Oak’s original beers and very much out of step with their newer, more bitter, products. Dark amber with medium white head. Rich fruity aroma with flowery hop overtones. Full malt taste with the sweetness just winning out over the bitterness in the finish. Excellent beer.
Phoenix Double Dagger;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Cask (Head of Steam, London) Big bitter. Sweet malts, fleshy fruits, aromatic hops. Decent finish. I didn’t mind the sweetness at all.

Phoenix Double Dagger;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);A rich, sweet bitter beer. Intense flavours of hops and toffee malt and a rich fruity (apricots/peaches) and quite bitter finish. Might be a bit sweet for some people. (Cask in Queen’s Arms, Manchester)
Phoenix Double Dagger;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Copper colour. Rather faint fresh hop aroma with hints of yeast and vinous undertones. The flavour is quite winey and woody with some dry green hops, falling away in the middle, but the hops return strongly on the finish, which is bittersweet. Overall, a bit soft and sweetish, but comes off somehow. Cask (handpump), Head of Steam, Euston, London.
Phoenix Double Dagger;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Rare Breeds Fest. Dark amber premium bitter. Wow! This is absolutely gorgeous. Not as sharply hopped as other Pheonix beers, this is a malt and hop moment of pure pleasure and balance. Flavours and aromas and bouquets swarm all over the place - lilly, honeysuckle, strawberry, melon, rhubarb and custard, cedar wood, etc, finishing with a gentle hint of chocolate. Smooth and silky. Absolutely awesome - thank god this was in good condition!
Phoenix Double Dagger;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Sampled cask conditioned at Oliver Twist, Stockholm, Sweden. Amber coloured. Grapefruity hop aroma. Sweet and rather malty. Domintaed by it's citrusy fruitiness. The mouthfeel is sharpish and thus the bitterness becomes unbalanced and harsh.

Lemke Red Ale;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brauerei Lemke;Draught at the brewpub. Clear red, average head. Roasty and lightly flowery . Medium dry with some soapy hops. Rather straghtforward, but with a surprising touch of ash (in a positive way) in a finish with medium bitterness. A brewpub amber may not be breaking news in the US, but in Germany it’s quite unique.
Lemke Red Ale;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brauerei Lemke;(On tap @ Lemke) Aroma of fruity malts and hops. Clear amber-red coloured with an off-white, lasting head. Taste is sweet, slightly bitter. Fruity and hoppy. Nice brew.

Lemke Schwarzbier;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Stout;Brauerei Lemke;Draft at the brewpub. Black beer with off-white head. Sourish pumpernickel aroma with light roast and low bitterness. It’s OK, but a bit light in the ass.

Spreewalder Bock;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Spreewälder Privatbrauerei 1788;The Dunkel Bock is basically a supped up version of this breweries dunkel, quite malty with less diacetyl it seems, and the hop balance leans more towards the malt than even the dunkel does. It is a bit darker more towards a brown, with notes of deep red.
Spreewalder Bock;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Spreewälder Privatbrauerei 1788;The aroma is barnyard, roasted and caramel. Dark brown color, light brown head, good lace.

Spreewalder Dunkel;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Spreewälder Privatbrauerei 1788;Draught at the brewpub. Muddy brown colour. Stable tan head. The flavour is mostly malty, but also slightly roasted.
Spreewalder Dunkel;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Spreewälder Privatbrauerei 1788;The dunkel seems to use the same yeast (a standard house yeast which is taken from the Radeberger Brewery) as the pils. The first time I was there it was a dark red color, which was a brilliant garnet when held up to a candle. Again, it also displayed a malty sweetness with a bit of diacetyl, but without the assertive hop bitterness of the pils. At other times it can be not quite as clear but the flavor is much the same if not just a bit sharper.
Spreewalder Dunkel;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Spreewälder Privatbrauerei 1788;Light caramel aroma. Brown, little hazy, white almost creamy head, good lace. Sweet, caramel, roasted malts, medium body. Hint of coffee in the finish.
E9 Roasted Porter;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Porter;E9 Brewing Co.;Draft pour at the brewery. Pours black with a tan foam head. Spicy roasted malt aroma. Flavor is a nice blend of spice, roasted coffee, and some dark chocolate. Very light in body, which was a bit unexpected. Coffee comes back late and lingers. Not bad.
E9 Roasted Porter;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Porter;E9 Brewing Co.;"""Thin in body, but with a very nice and pronounced roasted and chocolate aroma and flavor. Not much different than a standard porter, just done a little better. If the body was more robust I’d have been really impressed."""

E9 Roasted Porter;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Porter;E9 Brewing Co.;Aroma of coffee with an underlying light sweetness. Pours dark brown almost black with pretty much no head. The flavor is roasted malt, coffee, and light chocolate. I enjoyed this one, and my only complaint is that it might have been a little too watery. It did have a nice coffee flavor however.
E9 Roasted Porter;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Porter;E9 Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. Black, still, headless, laceless. Looks two days old sitting there in the glass. Not a great presentation, especially for a porter. Neutral--and I do mean neutral--nose. Watery light body. Stale licorice on the mid-palate, followed by a mild milk chocolate finish. Yawn.
E9 Roasted Porter;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Porter;E9 Brewing Co.;On tap at Engine House #9 in Tacoma, WA--Poured a dingy dark brown with a small off-white head. Acidic, nutty, gnarley nose. Molasses, toffee, and bold coffee, but not to the degree it should have been. This beer is not super terrible. That should tell you right there what I thought of this brewery.
E9 Roasted Porter;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Porter;E9 Brewing Co.;Draught @ Brew Pub Tacoma. Dark brown pour. Lots coffee and residual sweetness. Over done with the coffee in my opinion. Decent though.

E9 Roasted Porter;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Porter;E9 Brewing Co.;Not as much aroma as you’d expect. Flavor is very strong of coffee. Roasted, but with a sweet finish. Too much coffee for me.
E9 Roasted Porter;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Porter;E9 Brewing Co.;Enjoyed this one on draught at the brewpub in Tacoma, WA. Pours to a deep brown to black color, with a creamy, tan head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent, with lots of good dark chocolate, coffee, and roasty notes. The palate is firm, with good dark chocolate, and malty flavors, paired with just a touch of estery fruit, and a very nice coffee/roasty flavor. This beer finishes with more good dark chocolate, and coffee up front, then ends dry and roasty, with good roasty flavor that lingers. Excellent robust porter, with really good dry, roasty, coffee aromas, and flavors. I really enjoyed this one. It would make an excellent match with the pub grub, or deserts on the brewpub’s menu.
E9 Belgian White;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;E9 Brewing Co.;Lemony with earth and yeast. Crisp and refreshing. Medium to light bodied. Not bad.

Schweiger Black Lager;Markt Schwaben, Bavaria, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Privatbrauerei Schweiger;A bottle 0.33L tasted at One Pint Pub. Pale beige head. Brown reddish colour. Slightly metallic nose. Malty taste. Mild hoppiness.
Schweiger Black Lager;Markt Schwaben, Bavaria, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Privatbrauerei Schweiger;330ml bottle (One Pint, Helsinki, Oktoberfest 2008)<br /> Amazingly grainy sweet aroma - just like an LA. Sweet body, but also thin. Taste very simple, seems to have several degrees of fermentation still pending. Not a schwarz, just a lager made dark. The late finish is reasonably hoppy, but you need to wait for the sweet malts to subside before you get that. Disappointing. The label being in English should have been a warning sign.
Schweiger Black Lager;Markt Schwaben, Bavaria, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Privatbrauerei Schweiger;light body, watery, dark (Coulor malt), no roasted malt aroma and no pleasent bitterness
E9 4 Alarm Oatmeal Stout;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Stout;E9 Brewing Co.;There is nothing much to say about this one, it is very typical of this style and more so of the NW style. Black and dense, with a dark tan head. Nose is roasted and full of coffee, flavor matches the nose, with hints of chocolate, cherries and just a hint ever so slightly of oatmeal and coconut.
E9 4 Alarm Oatmeal Stout;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Stout;E9 Brewing Co.;Black, creamy tan head.Nice roasted nose. Good roasted taste throughout,hints of chocolate
E9 4 Alarm Oatmeal Stout;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Stout;E9 Brewing Co.;Almost black. Chocolatey, slightly coffeeish aroma. Soft palate. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Mild. Nitro.
E9 4 Alarm Oatmeal Stout;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Stout;E9 Brewing Co.;The best party was the creamy head, agreed. Not too much else going on. Could have been a lot more full bodied and richer for this style of stout. It almost seems like they're going for a dry stout taste. Interesting brewpub, I'll have to go back.
E9 4 Alarm Oatmeal Stout;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Stout;E9 Brewing Co.;Great big creamy head on this one (...I hope that doesn't sound like the opening line to some graphic novel...) after sampling the wonderful Roasted Porter I was stoked to try this, but was a bit disappointed. The Oatmeal stout was rather thin with hints of coffee and some bitter hops, but alltogether not a robust beer by any means, especially for being an Oatmeal Stout. I congratulated myself for having not purchased a full pint of this and continued drinking the Porter.
Iron Hill Bourbon Porter;Newark, Delaware, United States;Porter;Iron Hill Newark;12 oz glass at brewpub. Only a 5.3 abv- really?? LOL Sharp bourbon and vanilla flavors. Well aged, authentic. Would not buy a case of this- but a wonderful tasting beer. They got this right.
Iron Hill Bourbon Porter;Newark, Delaware, United States;Porter;Iron Hill Newark;On nitro tap at the brewpub in Media, PA. Pours with a red-brown body that has good clarity and highlights. Creamy tan head and a full coat of sticky lacing. Lots of bourbon an BBL flavor, partially masking the underlying porter (consumed immediate before the special version). Very good bitter-sweet balance. No sour or other off notes. Compared to the original, this i slightly more sweet, has some vanilla notes, and there is less smoke in the finish and aftertaste. Medium body and soft carbonation. Much smoother than the original.
Iron Hill Bourbon Porter;Newark, Delaware, United States;Porter;Iron Hill Newark;Nitro at NWIH. Color unknown but dense nitro head. Nose is vanilla and alcohol, and malt sweetness. Flavor is very abrupt and strong. Sweet with hints of Bourbon and cocoa with alcohol burn. Flavor is all back if the tongue here.

Iron Hill Bourbon Porter;Newark, Delaware, United States;Porter;Iron Hill Newark;On tap at the Iron Hill Barrel event in Maple Shade. Aroma is dark coffee, slight cocoa and a strong vanilla presence.

Iron Hill Bourbon Porter;Newark, Delaware, United States;Porter;Iron Hill Newark;Nitro draft at Phoenixville. Pours black with thick creamy nitro head. Nose is huge milk chocolate. First sip is malty sweetness with bourbonn, oakk and dark chocolate. Finish is sweet with hints of vanilla.
Iron Hill Bourbon Porter;Newark, Delaware, United States;Porter;Iron Hill Newark;Draft at 2012 Barrels Bugs & Bourbon event. Poured a thinner looking dark brown center with lighter orange/brown edges and a foamy small beige head. Aroma is great with chocolate pudding skins, bourbon, vanilla, toast. Thinner body with average to stronger carbonation with a medium dose of heat. Flavor isn’t as good as the aroma with strong alcohol notes at first, followed by chocolate and bourbon. Okay but flavor doesn’t hold up to the aroma.
Iron Hill Bourbon Porter;Newark, Delaware, United States;Porter;Iron Hill Newark;Draft. Dark brown in color with a small tan head. Bourbon dominates the aroma, with vanilla, oak, roast, and chocolate behind it. The flavor is also extremely bourbony. Oak and vanilla are secondary, and after that chocolatey and roasty porter flavors. Medium-bodied and boozy despite the ABV, or maybe that’s just the bourbon flavor confusing me. Sorry guys, there’s just too much bourbon in this one. I’d like to see the base beer shine through more. Good flavors in it still though.
Iron Hill Russian Imperial Stout;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Iron Hill Wilmington;Pours a jet black with a foamy tan head. Aroma is chocolate, roast, and earth. Flavor is sweet chocolate, caramel, toffee, roast, and earth. Good carbonation. Very good.
Iron Hill Russian Imperial Stout;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Iron Hill Wilmington;One of the best dang RimpyStouts I've ever had.

Appearance - poured from a corked bottle into a Guinness pint glass; heavy cloud of a head; prominent Black and Tan look. Nice lacing, too.

Iron Hill Russian Imperial Stout;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Iron Hill Wilmington;Sampled from a 750 ml corked brown bottle this beer poured a black color with faint orange highlights and an enormous foamy brown head that lingered and left excellent lacing. The aroma was dryish and woody with anise, a hint of cocoa and floral hops. The flavor was dry, bitter and roasty with notes of wood, cola, floral hops, anise and a touch of smoke. Long finish. Medium body but noticeably thin for the style. Decent but disappointing for a style I tend to love.
Iron Hill Russian Imperial Stout;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Iron Hill Wilmington;Draft. Disappointing. Aroma and initial flavors are solid coffee and dark malt, but these quickly disintegrate into distinct disparate sugary and bitter elements. It’s almost as if this brew was stirred together and the components hadn’t had enough time to adequately mix. It’s akin to sugar coated ginseng candy - you can taste the sugar and the bitter root at the same time. Too sugary overall.
Iron Hill Russian Imperial Stout;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Iron Hill Wilmington;on tap at Maple Shade - super dark in color. Slight coffee aroma and flavor. Very good.

Bull & Bush Fyfes Highland Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;Clear dark burnt amber with a thin spotty head. Aroma not unlike a winter warmer. Dark malts, sweet nutmeg, and some sort of raisin-like dark fruitiness in the nose. Flavor is dark malty sweet with just a touch of peat smokiness, a light touch of chocolate, faint notes of winter-warmer mulling spice, with a smooth dark malt/peat finish and whispers of dark fruity tones.
Bull & Bush Fyfes Highland Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;Tap @ brewpub. Deep red, almost brown appearance with a light head. Sweet amber malty nose. Somewhat bitter amber malty Scottish ale. Pretty smooth and drinkable but not all that exciting.

Bull & Bush Fyfes Highland Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;On Tap at Bull & Bush Pub & Brewery, Glendale 14/09/2010 Malt aroma. Amber coloured strong in alcohol a little sweet on the palate and malty. A hint of earthiness and bitterness in the finish.
Bull & Bush Fyfes Highland Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear mahogany colored body with a thin, creamy, tannish head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is muted with some flowery malts and fruits. Some earthy peat too, but not a whole lot going on. Flavor is better, but a bit jumbled. Caramel, toffee, smoke, earthy peat, and dark fruits before a semi-dry, smoky finish that lasts for a moderate duration. Light to medium body and smooth with a soft carbonation. Overall, not terrible, but somewhat thin and boring. Eh...
Bull & Bush Fyfes Highland Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;draft @ table 6 in denver. clear rust body with an off-white head. skunky peat and old/mold/fermented vegetables in the nose and up front. flabby body, disjointed carbonation. really a poor choice for a local draft to have on at probably my favorite denver restaurant right now.
Bull & Bush Fyfes Highland Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;Fairly light for the style, but straightforward and satisfying nonetheless - quite earthy and peaty, with light hints of smoke, very reminiscent of scotch, which shouldn’t surprise me, considering the staggering array of single malts available at the brewpub - outside of this, there is not much going on in this beer, but what is going on is pretty good - would I like more complexity? - yes - but I would order this again.
Bull & Bush Fyfes Highland Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;On tap at Wynkoop poured a clear amber with a lingering ring of ivory foam.

Bull & Bush Tank Town Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;At Bull & Bush with Stephen. Pours brown ruby red. Aroma is pungent figs, big malt, cardboard. Taste is card lard, big nice sweet figs, burnt sugar.
Bull & Bush Tank Town Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;(From old 2010 notes.) This has a really fine, off-white/light brown, soapy head with a dark brown colored body. It’s pretty solid and deep. The aroma... whoah... like whiskey/bourbon, alcohol, wood, and sweetness. Man, it has a great aroma. Wow. It smells too good to drink. Especially since the flavor isn’t as good as the aroma lets on. It has some sort of a cherry/liquor finish with an alcohol and roasted malt flavor hitting you plainly in the face. Overall, although it’s a great beer, my advice: just inhale this beer and leave your taste buds out of it.
Bull & Bush Tank Town Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;Apparently this was a 2010 vintage aged in a 23 year Pappy Van Winkle barrel, too bad its not bottled, the geeks would have a field day.

Pretty light appearance for a dunkelweizen- it’s a slightly dark yellow/orange hazy appearance. Some clove and banana scents in a somewhat spicy wheat nose. Quite malty wheat flavor that again isn’t very dark as you would expect from a dunkelweizen. Somewhat spicy and almost mash-like flavor. Not all that good.

Very hazy light orange, almost no head, and it dissipates quickly. But the aroma is very nice. I’m getting mostly orange citrus, with some cherry (?!) and a hint of wheat. Taste is more or less the same, just without the cherries. Lots of orange citrus, wheat, some grassy hops without much bitterness, and maybe a touch of caramel malt. Light-medium bodied. Easy to drink and kinda delicious. Just not different enough. But I can easily see myself drinking one for breakfast/brunch.

Not much in the flavor department, barely any hints of the nuttiness or roast grains this style is usually noted for. Falls flat on the tongue ...almost watery.

Bischofshof Malteser Weisse;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Bischofshof;Nice sessionable hefeweizen... as if any decent one isn’t. Pouring a very hazy, deep amber body with a thick, creamy ecru head, the base of the nose is a soft wheat atop which is heaped vast quantities of banana and bubblegum scents. Soft mouthfeel. The flavor has some buttered toffee to it with a handful of Wheaties, but the bubblegum and banana surge forward accompanied by a spritz of lemon. Surprisingly dry finish. More.

Bischofshof Malteser Weisse;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Bischofshof;Hazed oxidized copper color with a tall stable brownish white head. Mild wheat aromas with faint smells of peat, earth and buttery caramel corn. Rather weak bouquet. Pleasant flavors, though still rather light. Dry malt and wheat start and lead to a mild citric middle. For a ur-weisse this is very mild and unexciting, but quite drinkable.
Bischofshof Malteser Weisse;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Bischofshof;"(500 ml bottle: $2.19 at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) So I can’t figure out what the deal is with this beer. According to the company web site, there are three different versions of the Malteser Weisse (Hefe, Dunkel, Kristall), but none of the bottles match mine. My bottle is entirely in German, so that’s not helping me either. The only thing that might identify the beer is the word ""Naturtrüb"", but I doubt that is a clue either. Anyway, this beer is pretty dark, pouring a murky ruddy brown color. The off-white head rises quickly to about an inch before slowly subsiding to a thin, broken layer. Moderate aromas of wheat, banana and bubble gum, but not much in the way of spices. The flavor is actually pretty bland and really disappointing. Yeah, it’s wheaty, but the banana-like esters are extremely timid, and again, no spices. Sweetness is very light, and there’s a mild citric tartness in the finish. Light bodied, flimsy, and kind of watery in the finish. So this looks like a Dunkelweizen, but tastes like a watery Hefeweizen. Whatever it is, it’s entirely forgettable."
Bischofshof Malteser Weisse;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Bischofshof;The bottle I had poured a deep brown, with a decent head, true, its pretty smooth, but the aftertaste is quite good, lots of spicy banana flavor, nice beer.

L'Abbatiale de Saint-Amand Blanche;Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie des Sources (formerly: de St. Amand);Et fransk bud på en hvedeøl. Det er en syrlig uklar øl, der har undertoner af citrus. Den er meget frisk i smagen og skal helst drikkes godt kold, god til sommeren. De første par mundfulde var næsten for sure, den vandt dog i løbet af øllen. (75cl hjælper på det). Ikke det bedste af wit/hvedeøl, men et godt fransk alternativ til en fransk hvidvin om sommeren.

It’s an OK wit, but I would prefer much more depth in the flavour, but if you like Hoegaarden Witbier, then you probably like this one too.

L'Abbatiale de Saint-Amand Blanche;Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie des Sources (formerly: de St. Amand);(Bottle 75 cl) French wheat beers are a close relative to their Belgian brothers - and then again quite different. Spiced yes, but not in the typical Belgian way with coriander and orange peel. I believe this has more of a gingery touch. Very dry, almost without any body or any sweetness - or bitterness for that matter. Pale and slightly hazy with a frothy head. OK and quenching but rather bland and uninteresting for it’s type. 270103

Corsaire Bière Caribéenne;Baie-Mahault, Guadeloupe;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasserie du Corsaire - COFRIGO;Robe dorée brillante et limpide, carbo très correcte, mousse correcte, reste 5mm. Nez très herbacé, avec dans un deuxième temps un nez de pain frais aux notes fleuries légères. En bouche, l'attaque est clairement sur le pain, léger et très facile à boire, avec une légère note herbacée qui arrive rapidement par dessus, mais disparaît vite au profit du pain. On a une lager très classique, pas mauvaise, mais clairement lambda.
Corsaire Bière Caribéenne;Baie-Mahault, Guadeloupe;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasserie du Corsaire - COFRIGO;Pale lager de 5,4 % abv. Mon exemplaire était à 1 mois avant sa date.

Grand Rapids Chocolate Rye Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;On tap at GRBC. Deep brown body, thin clumping tan head with shades of dingy gray. Dry slightly acrid roast aroma with sharply metallic grain notes. Plenty of dry roast in the flavor with bitter dark chocolate providing the rest. A bit sharp on the tongue, finishing with a suggestion of spicy rye and the slightest hint of fruit, but these essences were slight.

Great Western Honey Wheat;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Light for a wheat beer. Thick head. Yellow/gold brown. Distinct taste compaired to the other western beers. Scent weak, again seems a bit sweet. Has the western hop-taste, but more hoppy and a bit better, which seems very odd for a Honey.

Great Western Honey Wheat;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Started with a fruity-light aroma and poured with a thin quickly fading head. A light flavor with bittersweet tones...but not strong enough to really distinguish any honey or wheat flavors. This is my favorate of the Great Western lineup so far and is a nice beer to drink cold on a hot Saskatchewan summer day.
Great Western Honey Wheat;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Pale yellow with hardly any aroma to speak of.

Big River Winter Ale;Richmond, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;BRB (Be Right Back - Big River);Gotta be the same as the Old Blitzen...I’ll sort that out later. Slightly hazy dark amber.

Cloudy brown color with off white head. Lightly spiced citrus and carmel nose. Flavor initially was citrus (lime) and changed to spice (cinnamon) with a hint of raisins. Nothing but cranberries and cinnamon? hmmm

Not a pleasant beer.

C.K. Browar Marcowe;Kraków, Poland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;C.K. Browar;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a mostly clear copper colored body with an inch thick, dense and creamy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is a good amount of DMS up front with a light toasty caramel sweetness, some grassy hops, and a light fruitiness. Flavor is better. A lightly toasted caramel sweetness with touches of bread, a balanced grassy hopping, a few fruit notes, and just a slight DMS hint. Finishes clean and lightly bitter before leaving a medium length aftertaste. Medium body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a decent marzen. A bit too much DMS on the nose, but the flavor was better. Easy drinking and balanced. Not bad.

T-Bonz Low Country Light Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;New South Brewing;Draught. Man, I was already pumped up to sample this fine beer, but the description on the menu stoked my fires even more. Pours just like stale urine with some bubbles coming up and no discernable head. I was hoping for a tru pale lager, y’know, one that tastes as much like carbonated water as possible. Unfortunately, there is some a presence of this stuff, hops, I think. The good news is that the hops mostly resemble newspaper in smell and taste, and nothing else is really present except a sacchrine-like sweetness in the flavor. Bottom line: this beer is much too dark and heavy, but it’s still delicious. [September 3, 2010] Pint at the T-Bonz. . . ordered accidentally due to my poor observation skills. A beer that I originally thought was so lackluster that I could only mock it in a sarcastic review turned out to be almost alright. While I will hopefully never drink this again, it did have discernable beer flavor of cereal, grain and veggies. It was fairly clean without a lot of off-putting notes. But please don’t drink light lager.

T-Bonz Raspberry Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New South Brewing;Draught. Pours hazy pale yellow with a small fizzy white head. The aroma is faintly grainy and a little bit fruity. The flavor is a very distinct artificial-seeming raspberry over a very earthy, grainy malt. It dries out slightly toward the finish and becomes a little bit chalky.
T-Bonz Raspberry Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New South Brewing;Draught sample at the Mount Pleasant, SC location. Faintly hazy, yellow (no pink in this one surprisingly), no head, bubbly-fizzy.....light sweet raspberry cookie-vanilla wafer aroma with little to no hints of sour wheat, or any malt or hop character for that matter....very bland and sour body, overattenuated and extremely thin, dry and mineralic, with a weird aloe/soapy tang at the finish. No sir, I won’t have another.
T-Bonz Winterfest;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Mild Ale;New South Brewing;Golden-amber colour. Caramelly, slightly earthy aroma. Fairly thin. Lightly metallic caramel character. Off-dry finish. Kind of bland.
T-Bonz Winterfest;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Mild Ale;New South Brewing;Deep cherry wood color with thick off-white head and lacing. Mild, dark bread aroma. Slick, soft mouthfeel with low carbonation. Some tannic character, maybe a touch of cinnamon but otherwise not so spicy. Nice lingering hop finish. Thin but decent.

T-Bonz Winterfest;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Mild Ale;New South Brewing;Draught at the Charleston location. Pours hazy burnt orange witha small whitish head. The aroma is mild caramel, some hay. The flavor is very earthy. Some crackery malt, dirty esters, and spicy hops. Single minded and very discordant, but somehow it comes across as tasty to me.
T-Bonz Winterfest;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Mild Ale;New South Brewing;Draught. Pours slightly hazy light amber with minimal head. The aroma, much like their other offerings, was rather weak though I could detect caramel, butter, and paper. The flavor is slightly astringent with the faintest of spices, a bit of nutmeg perhaps. There is a flat earthiness which is upfront, but not much else to balance. I thought it was just okay.
T-Bonz Winterfest;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Mild Ale;New South Brewing;Tap at Charleston. Sweet malt aroma with hints of orange and apple. Clear amber color with small head. Sweet malt flavor with hint of orange and light hops finish. A very good session beer - very quaffable.
T-Bonz Winterfest;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Mild Ale;New South Brewing;Draught at Charleston, SC location. Clear brown color with no head or lace. Spicy nose and flavor, nutmeg I guess. Kind of nutty as well. A bit over-carbonated. Ehh.
The Keg Alaskan Pale Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Keg Pub and Grill;Draught at the Keg: transparent light gold. Nice cascade hop aroma and a of sweet honey. Smooth palate and a good N. Brewer flavour. A light sugary caramel rounds out a pretty good brew.
The Keg Alaskan Pale Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Keg Pub and Grill;"I have a fond memory of visiting the Isadore Street Brewing Co., which is what the Keg was under previous ownership. It was therefore with great anticipation that I visited the Keg recently. When I sat down at the bar, the first thing I noticed was this Alaskan Pale Ale. Immediately I was excited thinking that this was one of those places that, in addition to brewing their own beer, also served several craft brews made by other brewers (e.g., Alaskan Brewing Co., etc.) Alas, I was wrong; it was just the Keg's Pale Ale, for some reason named after the state of Alaska. Anyway, the aroma was sweet and had some characteristics that reminded me of a x-mas beer (cinnamon, nutmeg, holly, etc.) I also picked up some grape jelly notes. There was no visible carbonation in the beer, which was the case in all of their beers. Amber body, white head and good lace. Nice initial mouthfeel, but no real bite in the finish. Malty, with a lack of balance."
The Keg Schmeekle Stout;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;The Keg Pub and Grill;Draught at the Keg: burnt/charred bronze colour with an extremely light milk chocolate aroma. Thin, watery palate that has a bit of cocoa and a hint of hops in the finish, though this one left quite a bit to be desired.
The Keg Schmeekle Stout;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;The Keg Pub and Grill;"Bourbon cask aroma with some off notes. No head except a thin off-white ring around the edge of the glass. Dark reddish black in color. Tastes of molasses. Is flat and thin without any zing or punch. Easy drinking; just not all that enjoyable. Almost tastes non-alcoholic. Not bad, especially around mid-glass, although the recipe for this brew needs some tinkering. Still probably their second best brew after the Night Train IPA."
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;"Clear medium gold body and little foam, rotting cabbage on the nose. Flavour is 7-up with rotten hop hints in the background. You know, after a few hundred ""pilsner"" beers brewed around the world I realize how hard it is to do one well - this thing is a mess, most won't notice, but it sure does make me appreciate the good ones."
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;Can. Pale yellow, aroma of creamed corn, flavour of sweet grain, a touch of corn, very watery.
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;For a budget beer it’s pretty good. It had a head made to dissolve into nothingness. No lace. It actually comes with some flavour at a budget price. It has topside malt sweetness mixed with some lingering bitterness. It has hop and only a light wateriness, better than most budget offerings. I have had what this brewer considers top flight and this will do nicely to put me over the top, after the expensive beer tastings are over.
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;A couple of 4oz samples at VCBW 2012 pours a pale straw color with a finger of white head that leaves some spotty lacing. Aroma is grass and cereal grains. Taste is a grassy hop bitterness with a grainy malty sweetness and a nice clean finish. Light in body with a decent amount of carbonation providing a nice sensation on the palate. After reading some of the reviews here I think they are confusing this with Great Western’s Brewhouse Pilsner which is just a terrible beer. This is not that beer, it is much better with a fuller flavor and cleaner finish. I do not believe this beer is sold in a can, so if you had a can it is definitely the Great Western version.
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;Actually a very refreshing beer for how cheap it is ($1 a can). My baseball team drinks it after games and we never complain about it.... but it must be cold. It rivals PC Light as my favorite cheap beer which I use to clear out pesky garden slugs (LOL).
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;Pours golden yellow, nice carbonation, tall thick head. Malty skunky aroma. Flavour is light not much body a lot of filler in this beer. This was a great beer when it was $1 per can. but now that it’s $16/per 12 pack it has kind of lost its appeal.
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;35.5 cl can, Winnipeg, MB, Canada. Pale golden colour, actually some pilsner like aroma, grains and grass. Probably tasted too warm, slightly seet, could be moer crisp, with a thicker mouthfeel than I would have liked. Better than I thought though.
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;Light, golden a white head. An overall soft feel. Funny almost sour smell that is rather faint. I liked it. I find it to be a quite toned down compared to most pils. Smooth, but almost flat. Overall I like it, especially the taste.
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;Every beer tastes best when you shotgun it. But for its price i enjoyed it. Its pretty average pils for me, and just good to get drunk with. Cans are pretty goofy though, You wont really look cool at a party with this.
Brewhouse Pilsener;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;From teh can. It was free. It was cold. And I was thirsty. Another corny-tasting beer for people who just want to get drunk for cheap.
Brewhouse Scotch Ale;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;On tap at Whistler, pours a dark amber with a small beige head. Aroma brings out bready malt and caramel. Flavour is along the same lines, with a dry bready caramel malt backbone. Thick palate but not overly complex. Not bad.
Brewhouse Scotch Ale;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;"Draught at the brewpub; 12oz Cloudy red-amber color with small creamy head. The aroma is too light, there is some malt, nuts, milk chocolate. Round mouthfeel, a bit less body than expected, some malt and caramel flavor, moderately sweet, lightly nutty in the final, ordinary bitterness. A good beer, but simple, not trying to achieve anything special."
Brewhouse Scotch Ale;Whistler, British Columbia, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Whistler Brewhouse/High Mountain;Just as every dog has his day, every brewpub brews at least one beer of note (NB: this general rule seemingly does not apply to the Rock Bottom Brewery). But I digress. This scotch ale is truly a standout. A man among boys. Weighing in at 6.7%, it packs a mighty wallop and delivers taste by the truckload. A cornucopia of flavors, I was truly impressed with its combo of malt and yet mildness. A real winner with alcohol better hidden than most.
Paper City Winter Lager;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paper City Brewery;12oz bottle: Pours a clear medium orange color with minimal alabaster bubbles, mostly around edges of glass. Aroma is of light malts, grass and bizarre spice. Crisp and light bodied with ample carbonation. Astringent/metallic ending.
Paper City Winter Lager;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paper City Brewery;The beer pours amber with nice notes of allspice and cardomon. These flavors work well with the malt and light hops on the palate and finish in a balanced manner.
Paper City Winter Lager;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paper City Brewery;12 oz bottle via trade with hopdog, who probably got it from jjpm74, who I traded with before hopdog. Anyway, this beer was very decent with breakfast this morning. Eggs and toast, by the way. I digress however. The pour was glassy amber with almost no head. Aroma was of winter spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon- almost pumpkin ale spiced. Taste was caramel and those same spices. Not a bad beer at all.
Paper City Winter Lager;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paper City Brewery;12oz bottle acquired in trade with jjpm74 (thanks!). Poured a medium and slightly hazy orange color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, lightly floral and very lightly spicy. Tastes of caramel with a light spicy finish. Thinner body.
Paper City Winter Lager;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paper City Brewery;Pours amber with a white head. Smells rosey with some caramel qualities. Tastes a little sweet with some tangy notes.
Paper City Winter Lager;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paper City Brewery;Poured a nice amber with a white frothy head. I found it a little on the sweet side, I don’t know. The first five bottles of the six pack I enjoyed a lot. But when I poured the sixth (not on a row, mind you!) for rating, I found it not as good as I remembered from earlier in the week. A little malty sweet, kind of nutty.
Paper City Winter Lager;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paper City Brewery;"2004 bottle. Dosent pour a pale color. Not at all. Very robust orange-copper color with a small white, lasting head. Light lacing as well. Aroma is a bit off-putting; rusty yeast, some bits of dirty earthy wet grass, lightly sharp notes of grains. Strong scent of dry dog food. As you dive right in, it is certainly a strange experience. At first it tastes like spicy English yeast, but that quickly fades in to a spicy lager bite, mixed with notes of copper, tin and iron. Earthy, graininess, and a lightly dull meat-like quality. A hint of bittersweet nuttiness. Some light hop notes on the finish. Watery mouthfeel, medium-light body. Some breadiness on the end. Not altogether filtered tasting; it may not be the most spectacular tasting yeast in the world, but at least it has a good apparency. Very interesting experiment here. I will agree it shares some common flavors with SA Boston Lager."

Paper City Winter Lager;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paper City Brewery;Has a nice amber color with light carbonation and a light malt smell. Taste is lightly malted and almost a bit sunked and finishes with a moderate bitterness. Overall this wasn't the better 'winter' type beers that I have had.
Florisgaarden Griotte;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;red / pink color with a white head. cherry smell is quiet strong as is the taste. not too sweet. a nice summer beer. Have to admit that I have not tatses a kriek often
Florisgaarden Griotte;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;330ml bottle drunk at home on a perfect July evening. Pours opaque ruby pink with not a lot of head, some lacing but no visible rising carbonation. On the nose, sour cherry and hints of mirabelle plum. In the mouth, medium carbonation, sour from the first sip and throughout but not excessively so, minimal apparent sweetness but there is plenty in the aftertaste, sour cherry flavour, thin but not watery before a dry finish, no real bitterness, just sour. A fairly one-dimensional fruit beer that only a lambic lover could love.
Florisgaarden Griotte;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Although Floris loves to cut corners, this version of a kriek is not the worst ever. Light sour cherry notes.
Florisgaarden Griotte;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle from Darts Farm near Exeter. Pours clear deep pink with a light pink head. Aroma is full of sweet cherry plus some marzipan. Taste is more sweet cherry & marzipan ,barely balanced by some acidity & a little oak. Lightish bodied with decent carbonation. The finish is sweet with more cherry with some balancing tartness. Ok but not great!
Florisgaarden Griotte;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Fles thuis geprobeerd. Het is een roodkleurig bier met een dun rose schuim. De geur is voornamelijk kersen. De smaak is zoet en kersen achtig, beetje syroop achtig.
Florisgaarden Griotte;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;A very nice cherry juice! I don´t know how a good Kriek should taste, but I was imagining that it would still taste somewhat like beer. This one didn´t.

Taste: Quite sweet fruity start with a decent sour mouthfeel. Has an oily texture. Light body with medium carbonation. Medium lasting tarty/sweet a bit acidic finish.

Florisgaarden Griotte;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;(Bottle) Pours hazy dark pink red with short lived head. Pleasant aroma - cherries, candy hints of chocolate. Smooth, light body with pleasant carbonation. Intense cherry flavour, underpinned by citrus tartness and candy. Very pleasant, but is it really a beer?
District ChopHouse Oatmeal Stout;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);Pours a deep brown color with a roasted malt aroma. Taste is slightly sweet with a burnt rolled oats flavor. The sweetness is truly evident at first sip then dissipates as you swallow. A dry, roasted malt aftertaste that finished the beer quite well.

Guillet Cidre Breton Brut Traditionnel;Guenrouët, France;Apple Cider;Ets Guillet Frères SA - Cidrerie Kerisac (Eclor-Agrial);Bottle from Champion of the Thames, Cambridge. Very cloudy brownish gold. Lots of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Strong apple smell, with a hint of candy sugar sweetness. Taste is ambrosially sweet, with just enough tang to keep the balance.

Meesters Galmaarden Kerst;Galmaarden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Meesters;"(Bottle 33 cl) Damn, it doesn’t happen often, but this beer is utterly dead - well, almost dead. Deep, dark brown and very, very flat almost without any head at all. Fortunately there’s still a lot of flavour left. Roasted malt, dried fruit and some spices - coriander is there but also some ""darker"" more christmasy stuff. Probably would’ve been an excellent beer had it been fresh. 290998"
Meesters Galmaarden Kerst;Galmaarden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Meesters;"BBD: 12/2003 - Hah! It’s a real one, not some blasted Huyghe wannabe Fully dark brown beer, with small, dirty brown, creamy head, reasonably stable. Very malty & chocolatety nose - though more like some chocolate Ersatz. Sweet coffee. Bit rubbery aroma - probably Michael’s ""fruity old gym shoe"". Dusty indeed. Taste is chocolate malt, and a ton of liquorice, but not its sweetness, leaning towards drop. Finishes sweeter, and yet drier. Apparent body is misleading, adjunct-like; behind it rather thin-watery, which is rather unsettling for a 9%ABV beer. Somehow, this beer is thinnish without age playing a role. It doesn’t taste as if it’s tired, it tastes as if it was born tired."
Meesters Galmaarden Kerst;Galmaarden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Meesters;"Dark amber coloured beer with a light brown small creamy head. Sweet fruity old gym shoe aroma. Now tasting; A slight sweet start followed by a malty ,medicinal gym shoe taste. A bit dry, chalky finish."
Finians Organic Lager;Enfield, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Celtic Brewing Co.;Very nice, was my first impression, and this stayed with me, a very exciting and unexpected flavor followed by an even more unexpected palate, good one.
Finians Organic Lager;Enfield, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Celtic Brewing Co.;"Moderate organic lager from an Irish ""craft brwer"". Poured a cloudy yellow colour with a fleeting 1cm head. Fresh hay in the nose and some zesty hop characters. Spoiled by some faint uric notes. Medium-bodied - firmer than you might expect for a lager. Undermined by some sour notes but it’s possible the sample was past its best (two weeks after Best Before). Quenching but unremarkable. (Bottle)"
Finians Organic Lager;Enfield, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Celtic Brewing Co.;Bottled. Clear golden ale. Larger malt aroma. Low carbonation. Moderate bitterness. Just.

Bittings Doppelbock;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;The version I sampled was an 8.0% ABV version that they served in a 12 oz glass. Claimed that they could not serve it in a pint glass because of the higher ABV. Whatever. Thin head with good carbonation. Bit surprised at the decent carbonation. Light roasted malt aroma with a hint of spices. Color is a very dark brownish red. Flavor is quite smooth and clean with more malts and a decent alcohol warming which was nice because it was about 55 degrees inside the building. Slightly sweet (caramel) with a pretty clean finish. A decent dopplebock.
Bittings Doppelbock;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Bursting with malty goodness. Thick rocky white head, reddish brown in color and nearly opaque. Aroma shows chocolate, earthy hops, and butterscotch.. Not overly sweet for a Doppelbock. High warming quality in the swallow. Starts of with light earthy hops, malt sweetness builds, then ends on a sweet grassy note. The spiciness of the beer does not hit until mid glass. Best served in a snifter.
Marylands Best;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Yeah aint it just typical that Sloth/slob gave me this dusty old can from his basement silo of a beer warehouse and said to me...""Yeah well you didn’t drink it when you were here last time"" (ten years prior). So here it goes. Can cracks open with a distinct Pfttt! The best buy date is August 7, 1997. So at least the can and carbonation were successful. Nose of sweet lollipop/ cotton candy. Pours a semi glowing golden in the glass. It would be perfect if not for the large grey chunks of whoknowswhat floating about in patrol boat like precision. The finger taste revealed a sweet sugary smelling vinegaresque type of undrinkable liquid. A testament to canning."
Marylands Best;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Enormous thanks to Sloth who sent me this rare gem simply because it was on my wants list. What a freakin’ great guy. Pours a nice golden color with a very small head that pretty well goes away after a minute. The aroma is malty, sweet, tinny, and cidery. Some mild alcohol is present but it seems natural in the mix. The flavor is doughy and sweet. The beer has a distinct cidery character, it’s lightly spicy, relatively clean, and totally weird. There’s no doubt I’m giving it points for originality here, I’ve never tasted a pale lager like this one, nothing is even close. What a strange strange beer.
Marylands Best;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Cheers to slob for sending this fine ancient can of old school swill my way. I love it! Cloudy dull beige colour. Smells like an aged macrobrew, mixing overly heavy (slightly sherryish) bread notes with medicinal phenols and rotting pork. The taste, surprisingly, isn’t bad. There’s some light oxidized notes and vague cough syrup phenols but mainly just clean pale malts, the faintest hop. It’s almost gained a certain freshness, a second wind if you will. Seriously, this is actually drinkable.
Marylands Best;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I found this beer at a local liquor store not long ago. Since I am from Maryland I thought it would be something neat to try. I bought a six pack and it was about $2.00. The can is very interesting. It has a list of foods that go well with this beer. And the can also has a map of Maryland on it, but the map is wrong. The map also includes part of Virginia. This should have warned me not to buy it. But it's said Maryland's Best on the can. I had to try it. Eventhough it's brewed in Milwaukee. When I got home I poured one in a glass. It was very light and had almost no head. It smelled like chemicals, and it tasted like it was made from an old bale of hay. It was the worst beer I ever had. I managed to suck the one beer down but it was hard. I gave the other five away to this Belgian guy that I know. He loved them. But he also thinks Budweiser is wonderful.
Zigs Bobby Magees ESB;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Mild nutty caramel nose with a smattering of hops thrown in for the ride. Overall lacking.
Zigs Bobby Magees ESB;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Zigs Kettle and Brew;"NO mention of ""Bobby Magee"" on the menu, this one had a nice and simple malt profile that was caramelly and nutty. Some slight grassy hops was present at the end."
Zigs Bobby Magees ESB;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Zigs seems to have undergone a recent revolution. If you look at their old beer menu, they were crazy, kaleidoscopic, out of control with style ideas. Now they are more strait laced, cleaner, simpler, more attractive to the off-the-freeway-can-I-just-get-a-beer crowd. This beer is deadly clear, exceptionally clear, and tastes like that too - rather uninteresting and monochromatic, based on hop action. It has more significant head retention than it's brethern Zig brews, but is basically lackluster. I'd guess the recipe has been simplified from the award winning ways, like the menu and the marketing approach at this place.
Zigs Bobby Magees ESB;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Since this was the first beer on my sampler I got a pretty good taste of it. My first thought - This is an ESB? Not nearly enough malts and body - and too much alcohol. I think Zig's need to narrow their focus and work on creating two or three decent brews before they make offensive imitations of every well-known European style they can think of.
Zigs Bobby Magees ESB;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Zigs Kettle and Brew;I was all hyped up for this...my first time at Zig's (formerly Jackson Brewing Co), as this beer won a World Beer Cup award for the Strong Bitter category in 2002. I can tell you that there are only three possible reasons why my experience was the way it was: either the beer was stored/served improperly, was intentionally made this way, or the brewer doesn't know a lot about ESBs. There's a bit of ESB malting, a fair hop level, but an underlying sweet flavor that had nothing to do with malt, hops, ESBs or anything else. This was like drinking an ESB served with the remanants of a poorly made Belgian Dubbel. Some bitterness. Hop variety not obviously English or West Coast. Thin. Noticeable ABV even at 4.8%. No beer menu. Hmmm, I was wondering how my Zig's experience was gonna turn out at this point.
Zigs English IPA;Jackson, Michigan, United States;IPA;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Hip-hop-da-hibby-hop. Really hopped nose. Some perfume and floral arrangments, but pretty much dominanted by the bitter hops. Fizzy with medium finish.
Zigs English IPA;Jackson, Michigan, United States;IPA;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Nice and hoppy! The citrus and grassy hops mix well to make it perfumy and a bit oily at first sip. Some graininess is drowned out by some caramel malts. Finish is bitter, leaving a nice hoppy aftertaste.
Zigs English IPA;Jackson, Michigan, United States;IPA;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Cask Conditioned. Cloudy, glowing orange. Very hoppy and has some body...lots of floaties. The malt depth is lacking....yet the beer still maintains heft...weird (hop oil overload...I dunno). Orange juice sweetness...in the aroma and the flavor, a little flowers...quite artificial tasting and looking. Marginally better than the previous beer I had there.
Zigs Imperial Stout;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Zigs Kettle and Brew;This is a pretty decent Imperial stout giving off a nice chocolate coffee aroma. Thick and chewy, the roasty malts are the most dominant feature, but hints of smoke, nuts, coffee and especially chocolate at the finish make it a very pleasurable experience.
Zigs Imperial Stout;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Compared to their other selections, this is probably the best showing. Well hopped and malt balanced, and the nose has a port/alochol sweet aroma. Roasted and smoked flavors peak through at times. Could be thickened up a bit.
Zigs Imperial Stout;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Zigs Kettle and Brew;"You have to drink this from a bottle - they won't serve it to you on tap. This phenomenon happens a lot - either the microbrerwery makes you buy tiny glasses of the good stuff, or won't let you drink it on premise at all. What's up with that? Anyway, when you fight through the shrink rap and swing top, you get a very nice imperial. I mean that in the way a young goddess would tell me - you're very ""nice"" back in my frustrated dating days. All the pieces are in place - decent dark malts, a touch sweet and on the edge of deeper darkeness from the hops, but nothing rages against the dying of the light."
Zigs Imperial Stout;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Bottled from draught in a 500 ml swing-top. Middle-weight consistency, nice dark brown fading to lighter head.Slight alcohol, nut, chocoalte malt and brown sugar nose. Flavors are initially sweet (sugar), nutty and some salt in the finish (noticeably less salty than Founders Imperial Stout). Closer to 60 deg and up salt and bacon bits show up a little brusquely. Hops are very well balanced. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.

District ChopHouse Bourbon Stout;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Stout;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);Dark brown colour with low head. Medium intensive aroma of bourbon, vanilla, peat and some smoke notes. Very nice at nose. Taste is medium to heavy sweet, light bitter and light sour with short roasty fisnish. Unfortunately, taste is very thin and surprisingly watery. Soft carbonation. Overall, it’s a beer with very nice, full of bourbon note aroma, but taste is very thin. More body could help it.
District ChopHouse Bourbon Stout;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Stout;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);On cask at the brewpub. Has an essentially black body with a decent head. Lots of bourbon flavor and aroma, suggesting the bourbon barrel was not ruined before brewery use. Smooth but overly light body.
District ChopHouse Bourbon Stout;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Stout;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);Im Geruch gibt es eine wahnsinnige Vanille-Komponente, die sich auch im Geschmack wiederfindet. Dickflüssig, fast wie ein Cocktail. Kaum karbonisiert.
District ChopHouse Bourbon Stout;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Stout;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);(On Tap) Jet black with big white head. Smoky, peaty, oaky. Great palate - smooth but quite light at the same time. Great taste primarily oaky whisky over a sweetish dark roast malt. Very well balanced combination of flavours. This is bourbon, not stout, dominated. I like whisky so this works well for me. I guess if you are looking for a stout with whisky notes you may be disappointed.
District ChopHouse Bourbon Stout;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Stout;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);Bourbon rules this one. Not much of a stout behind it. Pours black with OK head and lacing. Light sweet finish. Lots of booze and bourbon barrel aroma doesn’t help. Tap at brewpub.
Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);Pours ruby-tinged dark amber with a small off-white head. Nose shows resinous pine and some juicy fruits alongside loads of caramel and bready malt. Same story with the flavours, lots of rich sweet malt with some resinous pine. Bitterness doesn’t quite manage to balance the heavy malt. Carbonation could be a fair bit higher, it might even cut through the sweetness then. Extremely malty for an IPA but still very enjoyable.
Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);Tap. Hazy brownish orange pour with a fluffy, lasting white head that leaves lots of lacing. While the aroma has lots of fruity hops it also has a solid malt profile, with notes of passionfruit, orange, grapefruit, caramel and nuts. Flavour pretty much mirrors the aroma, striking a nice balance between the malty sweetness and the hoppy bitterness. Fairly slick mouthfeel with prickly carbonation and a long bitter finish. Overall a good IPA, nice but fairly run-of-the-mill.
Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);2 separate experiences with this beer. First one was disappointing. Lacked flavour and bitterness. Second experience: awesome! big tropical fruit hop flavour. Bitterness was just great. Good looking beer. Thick head. Heaps of lacing. A really good IPA!!

Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);Draught (at the brewery bar). This one was full of hoppy goodness, while still have a great chewy malt base. The Galaxy hops come through big time.
Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);330ml bottle. Deep orange russet colour with a well compacted head that looks good when poured into the glass. Inviting aromas of floral hops that allure you in with citrus notes breaking through. Slight tartness in the finish and a mellow bitterness in the mouth. Overall a good effort.
Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);Good appearance but stops there. Rubbery, musky. Not aged but unpleasant. Disappointed
Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);Tap. Hoppy and tasty. Aroma has grass, and fruit. Flavour produces nice bitterness, and good duration. Medium bodied in the palate. Copper in colour, with a long-lasting head.
Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);This is not really hoppy enough to call itself an IPA. It’s a respectable drop, but don’t come looking for hops. Very malty. Disappointing.
Mountain Goat India Pale Ale (-2010);Richmond, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mountain Goat Beer (Asahi);Had this one during my holiday in Australia april/may 2009. Copper colored brew. Floral aroma. Aggressive bitter hops. Nice hoppy aftertaste. Nice.
English Ales Ramsays Fat Lip Ale;Marina, California, United States;Scottish Ale;English Ales Brewery;July 22nd, 2015 - English Ale's ESB should be an excellent beer given the brewery's name, and indeed fits the bill. A nice toasted bread crust color, it is true to what I expect from ESB. Crispy and biscuity on the nose, it is savory and delicious, with a great carbonated palate and a nice firmness.

Top of the Hill Big Bertha Brown;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Top of the Hill Brewery;Yikes! Not sure what was going on here, but this was a light/medium brown pour without much head. Didn’t taste much like a brown ale. Sweet, metallic, somewhat malty, but generally not so good. Earthy in a not good way.
Top of the Hill Big Bertha Brown;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Top of the Hill Brewery;Dark brown pour with medium tan head. Aroma of toasted malts and some caramel. Light sweetness and slight bitterness in the flavor. Looks and tastes like a brown ale, so a decent effort.

Mild bitterness with some residual sweetness on the mouthfeel.
Top of the Hill Big Bertha Brown;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Top of the Hill Brewery;Had this on tap at the brewpub. Dark brown color with thin head. Aroma was faint brown sugar and roasted malt. Slightyl malty without being sweet. Hint of roasty flavor without much in the way of hop flavor or bitterness.

Top of the Hill Blackwood Mountain Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Top of the Hill Brewery;"On tap at Top of the Hill. Nice appearance, dark brown in color with a large cascading nitro head. Roast and coffee characterize the aroma. Not much else to say - it’s a standard Irish stout more or less, nothing wrong with it but nothing outstanding. As for the flavor, well, I hate to use the mantra of the uninitiated, but honestly, ""It’s like Guinness."" Maybe a little more to it. Fairly dry and toasty with coffee and earthiness. Slightly dry on the mouthfeel with medium body and good nitro carbonation. A decent beer overall - the best I had at TotH."
Top of the Hill Blackwood Mountain Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Top of the Hill Brewery;On tap, tan creamy head off the nitro, aroma of burnt coffee, maybe a but if bacon, this really isn’t that good. Like stale, old Guinness.
Top of the Hill Blackwood Mountain Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Top of the Hill Brewery;looks fine. mouthfeel is light and thin with an unpleasant slickness at the finish. nose is slightly acrid coffee and roasted malt with a strong note of, help us, bacon. the bacon doesn’t persist into the taste, thankfully, where you get more of a weak but singed coffee character.
Top of the Hill Blackwood Mountain Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Top of the Hill Brewery;On tap at the brewery. One of their least offensive beers. Attractive enough pour... dark brown with creamy tan head. Ever had Guinness ice cream? You know, when it sort of tastes like stout, but is just more sweet and creamy. That’s how this beer was, but not even that good. Watery, but not horrible.
Top of the Hill Blackwood Mountain Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Top of the Hill Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deep ruby with a thin creamy nitro cap with good retention and lacing (but it’s nitro so not that impressive). Aroma of stale coffee grinds, roasted malt. Taste is sort of like if there existed instant stout mix poured and stirred into cold water. Slight cocoa mix in there too but- I agree- very artificial. Overall watery body with a bitter, stale coffee finish almost like drinking left out cold coffee.
Top of the Hill Blackwood Mountain Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Top of the Hill Brewery;Black pour with small white head. Roasted malts aroma, felt like it was a coffee with cream at times. Very heavy, bittersweet flavor.

Top of the Hill Blackwood Mountain Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Top of the Hill Brewery;As thin as the porter. Black pour, on nitro. Chalky chocolate flavor to it that is incredibly artificial -- not the slightly powdery texture of Rogue’s chocolate stout, more of a chewing semi-sweet hot cocoa mix texture. Some roastiness. Not worth your time.

Trap Rock Octoberfest;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trap Rock Brewery;Location: Draft at the Brewpub, 10/5/12 Aroma: It has some caramel, toasted malts, and a little earth on the nose Appearance: It pours a clear caramel color without any head or lace on the glass Flavor: The taste is mostly malty, it is medium sweet, and has a mild earthy bitterness Palate: The body is fairly light, there’s a smooth/clean feel and a soft carbonation to this one Overall Impression: I felt that this was a solid, malty beer. It drinks fairly typical of the Marzen style, and hits on what it is trying to be, but it isn’t the beer for my taste.

Upper Mississippi Lumberking Lager;Clinton, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Upper Mississippi Brewing;Always strikes me as a bit watery, but a decent lager from a very nice local brewpub.
Upper Mississippi Lumberking Lager;Clinton, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Upper Mississippi Brewing;Extremely pale, some DMS and cascades in the aroma, subdued, though. Low aroma intensity. Fairly good american lager. Light bodied, but well bittered. Dare I say thirst quenching?
Upper Mississippi Cherek Stout;Clinton, Iowa, United States;Stout;Upper Mississippi Brewing;(Tap 5/2004) Sweet malt and some cheesy hops. A bit of coffee, harsh roast and some very weird whiskeyish notes. (Infected?) This ones a mess.
DuClaw Fantome;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;"I thought thi sone was a nice example of the ""northern"" style of British brown ale, on the order of Newcastle, but better. Very nice deep caramel color, some [but not much] malt sweetness, nice hops finish. I ony wish I could have had another, but it was time to go!"
DuClaw Fantome;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Dark copper color with a small head. Malty, slightly fruity aroma. Nutty, toasted malt taste. Dry finish.
DuClaw Fantome;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Woody earth aroma, with vanilla and a hint of sweetness.Deep brown umber color, with a rapidly vanishing head. Medium body, with slight nut taste. Earthy undertones. Not a bad nut brown, but not a standout.
DuClaw Fantome;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Deep, amber-brown color with a quickly dissipating head. Smells like a belgian strong (a vanilla sweetness to it). The aroma is lovely, inviting. Yum! Tastes a lot like a Belgian strong, too, but without much of the sweet, biting alcohol. There's definitely vanilla in the flavor (it would probably make a great vanilla float!). It's lovely, sweet, with a hint of balancing sourness in the finish. Very good.
DuClaw Fantome;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;DuClaw Brewery and Eatery in Belair, MD. Sparkling clear, cherry wood hue with a small, bone-colored, creamy head. Minimal lacing, but a very nice creamy head remains for the duration. The aroma is of dark chocolate and English toffee. The flavor is rich and malty up front with blasts of milk chocolate, caramel and English toffee up front. Well-balanced by a tart hop addition on the backside. Medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, crisp and clean finish. A great, grown Springtime beer!... and hey, it's 67 degrees outside. Perfecto!!
DuClaw Fantome;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Clear red-brown body. Aroma and taste are both vanilla, sweet, and nutty malty. Medium body. Nothing special, but pleasant in its own right.
DuClaw Fantome;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Fantastic beer all around. This beer is a true meaning of a Brown Ale. The aroma and the taste of this beer is textured perfectly. I also had the Cask Fantome. This one exceeded my expectations.
DuClaw Fantome;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Firkin version. This was awesome. Can only hope more is on the way. Every Friday should be a firkin Friday. Caramel, buttery, toffee for both smell and tastes. Slight hint of hops. Almost Scottish Ale like in flavor and character. The extra molasses used in this version really stood out in a good way. Smooth velvety mouthfeel, served the way real beer should be. Will rate standard Fantome on next visit. Was having trouble ordering anything but the firkin. It was too good to not keep drinking it.
White Oak Cider;Newberg, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;White Oak Cider;Bottle from Belmont Station. Pours a clear, medium golden color. No head forms. Very sparse, delicate carbonation. Aroma is indeed musty and horsey. Semi-dry, not really bone puckering dry but enough that you notice. Sour/sweet apple flavor that battles the dryness and a hint of alcohol. Just doesn’t seem to flow very well and blend.
White Oak Cider;Newberg, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;White Oak Cider;Pale golden. Headless. Gigantic musty horseblanket aroma. Very leathery with a flourishing white oak character. Wax and juicy apples underneath. Brushing carbonation. Musty and grainy initially with a faint tannic note in the middle pursued by musty oak flavors and plump apple hints. It showcases some lovely tartness which keeps the leather and brett notes at bay. Finishes extremely dry with a grainy, musty edge and a perpetual medicinal character. Lingering apple notes lurk under the huge brett notes. Certainly a Cider worth examining from all angles.
White Oak Cider;Newberg, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;White Oak Cider;One of the few domestic ciders I've tried that does a very good job replicating the dry and subtle sweetness of traditional English ciders. The nose is rich and full of apple aroma while its mildly bubbly. Its has a true cask taste that will follow you for a while. Some might find this a bit strong (like myself), but after a couple of sips its not too difficult to get past. This is a little difficult to find as it appears to only be sold in Oregon, but it can be ordered from their website so longas you live in certain states. Worth trying if you can find.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Bottle at White Winter Winery on Nov. 18, 2011. A clear almost white pour, faint nose of lemon, taste was lemon/lime. I enjoyed this.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;750ml foiled and corked, thanks after4ever. Pours a touch thicker than water and show light legs on the walls of the glass. Nose is fairly light with obvious honey notes as well as bright white grape and touches of riesling, light floral as well. Not overly sweet and the riesling notes show through in the flavor quite well. Drinks easy and is a good intro mead that would pair well also with a meal.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Nice honey nose fermented light fruirts on the nose. White wine notes. Ppurs light yellow. Flavor is light honey, light tart fruit. Medium sweet, some alcohol. Smooth introductory mead. Nice and drinkablr at 11percent.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;750, corked and foiled. thanks tyler! pours clear, headless, laceless, legless. looks like thick water. mild white wine grapes on the nose, tart, not much honey aromatic. fairly easy drinking creamy medium body, nice mix of light honey and white wine grapes. almost refreshing.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Bottle. Light pour with a sweet aroma of honey and light spice. This was a basic dry mead but was done quite well. Body was nice and light with the balance of sweetness kept nice and low. Easy to drink and nice.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Bottle via a trade from the man, the myth, the legend, tytoanderso...as an extra along with 3 other White Winter EXTRAS! (BEER KARMA to him!). Pours nearly as clear as water, with some legs. Aroma is straight forward with honey, some freshly cut grass, sage brush, light citrus, and desert flora and dryness. Nice spiciness to the honey. Taste is very dry but near watery with alcohol, mint water and dry wine. Odd trade duality of alcohol flavor and thin body. Strange, and I am not sure quite how they accomplished that (along with the water like hue). A few too many wine tannins (added after, not from oak). Very dry in residual sugars and finish. Would be interested in talking to the brewer about their process in making this.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;ABR 2008. Light aroma of honey with a bit of wood in there as well. Sweet, finishes very dry. Alcohol seemed stronger in this than in the others from White Winter I tried.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Appearance is almost water like with just the slightest of golden tint to the clear headless liquid. Aroma of oak, light honey, and a bunch of other things I’m not real sure of. Taste of honey, yeast and tannins. Reminds me of a dry wine rather than something I should typing up a paragraph about on ratebeer.com. Semi-watery, mildly tart with a nice dry finish. It’s okay, but I’d just assume have a dry wine made of red grapes than a honey concoction.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Sampled at the White Winter Winery. Nice dry mead nose on this pale yellow pour. Dry flavor but still a little too sweet for a dry mead in my book. A good product nonetheless.
White Winter Dry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;During May ’07 brewpub tour, stopped at the winery in Iron River, WI. Pours a clear, light yellow chardonnay wine color. Aroma of dry grass, some sour pineapple, earth and light honey. Taste is sweet honey at first and then finishes very dry. A slight tart apple aftertaste. Did not pick any citrus but an excellenet dry mead.

Widmer Brothers Spring Run IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Poured a cloudy gold with white head and good lacing. Nose of citrus hops and caramel malts. Rich and smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is nicely bitter and there is pine in the finish. Not the best IPA ever, but for sure drinkable.
Widmer Brothers Spring Run IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);This is not the most exciting IPA I have ever tasted. Big on the hops and not alot of attention to detail when it comes to flavor and have a strong malt background. Lots of fruit and citrus with a chalky bitter finish.
Widmer Brothers Spring Run IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Pours a medium hazy golden yellow. Aromas of citrus hops and a touch of pale malts. Flavor is crisp bitter citrus hop with a nice lingering aftertaste.

Widmer Brothers Spring Run IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);On draught 2005 at Redbones. Pours a pretty lucid yellow. No head, clear, lightly bubbly. Aroma of dusty leaves, some hints of citrus, pale malt. Flavor is all leafy, dry, earthy hops. That’s about the extent of the flavor. Little to no malt presence. No yeast. Argh. Maybe I’m just in a shitty mood because the last 4 beers I had at Redbones have been complete shit. If that’s the case, Mr. Widmer IPA, I’m sorry and I will certainly rerate you. But for now, you sure seem like a regular American IPA gone bad. No balance, no complexity.
Widmer Brothers Spring Run IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);(12 oz bottle: Cost Plus in La Jolla, CA) Man, this is one bland and boring IPA. There’s nothing in the flavor that is at all noteworthy here. It’s somewhat malty, balanced by a moderately bitter, citrusy hoppiness, and a slight smokiness seems to come out in the finish, but this really tastes like a generic IPA from a generic brewpub. The nose seems a bit more malty than the flavor, but the hops is rather light, which I guess is why the malt is in the foregroung. Somewhat crisp and clean on the palate. Dark yellow color and fairly cloudy in appearance. Small whitish head quickly settles to a sheen, but manages to produce a moth-eaten curtain of lace. Yawn...... ......zzZZ
Wolf Pack Lone Mountain Altbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;I wasn't expecting to find a brewpub in a small place like West Yellowstone. Not a bad little place though. The Altbier was my favorite of the ones I tried. (They were also featuring a Kolsch and Hefeweizen which don't appear on this list).

Enjoyed the brewpub. I stopped by for a few while getting gas in West Yellowstone
Wynkoop Patty's Chile;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Can pour with a lightly cloudy gold color. Chalky pepper aroma. The pepper is mostly aroma without the spice.
Wynkoop Patty's Chile;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Too overwhelming with Chili peppers in taste and aroma. Nothing subtle about it. If I wanted chili peppers in a water, I would have asked for it. We couldn't even drink the flight sample. tap at brewery.

Wynkoop Patty's Chile;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Golden color.

Pours a moderate, poorly retained white head, over a clear, effervescent, dark gold (SRM 6) body........ nose is green chile, very slight hints of smoke, cereal, minimal hops, balance to the chile........taste is moderate green chile, mild chile heat, light base malts, ending with mild lingering chile heat, with vague hints of hop bitterness.......mouth feel, light body, no alcohol, high carbonation. This is a very subtle chile beer. The chile aroma and flavor are there with only minimal chile heat. The base beer is very light in both the malt and hop back bones, with the resulting creation being a very simple beer. BJCP 6/2/10/4/6

Alpine Beer Company Mandarin Nectar;Alpine, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Pleasant, but non-descript. I would gladly have a growler of this at a 4th of July party, but I wouldn’t expect anyone to ask what was so they could buy it themselves. My bottle also had a best-by date of 04-Aug-16. Edit: 5/18/2017 I got in touch with Alpine, and confirmed that the bottle I got from my local IS out of date. I’ll re-rate this when I can get a fresh bottle. Great customer service from Alpine, and I’m going to complain at the bottle shop.
Alpine Beer Company Mandarin Nectar;Alpine, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Alpine Beer Company (CA);"Draft to taster at The Pint Room. Looks solid; a transparent golden orange with white head. Smells and tastes of honey, oranges, and ale yeast with a mildly bittersweet backbone. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Inoffensive, but underwhelming."
Alpine Beer Company Mandarin Nectar;Alpine, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Darkish orange, almost amber pour with a one finger, creamy off white head. Aroma is mostly honey and coriander, some bread, oxidation. Flavor is quite heavy in the honey department, but in a good way, a fair amount of coriander, but not as much as the aroma implies, nice floral notes, really nice orange blossom honey aftertaste, hampered, slightly by a slight metallic twinge. Medium body, creamy at first, then somewhat drying, light, soft carbonation. Good stuff, I really like the way it shows off the honey.
Alpine Beer Company Mandarin Nectar;Alpine, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Heavy on the honey and herbs, light on the beer itself. Needs more backbone.
Alpine Beer Company Mandarin Nectar;Alpine, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Bomber. Deep honey golden with a short loved head. Mandarin aroma with malts and some honey. Mandarin and honey lead the flavor profile and there isn’t a lot more. Feel is too thin.

Church Brew Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Church Brew Works;This was probably the best beer I’ve had from them. Aroma was nice. Strong roasted malt, black licorice with a hint of chocolate. Pour was perfect. Deep dark black with a thick and pillowy dark tan head. One of the best appearances I’ve ever seen. Taste was great also. Strong chocolate and burnt licorice but with a chocolatey aftertaste. This beer tastes like some of the big brewer’s EXCEPT for this off metallic aftertaste. It wasn’t strong enough to ruin the beer, but it hurt the score. Very nice.

Cask conditioned and flat to the palate. Coal black and chocolate mousse head. Slight roasty impy stout aroma. Smells fairly attractive. Bitter and alky. Very strong and oppressive to an exrtent.

Eisenacher Wartburg Pils;Eisenach, Thuringia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Eisenacher Brauerei;"#628 Das tolle Flaschenetikett mit reichlich Gold verzierter Schrift und dem Retro-Look hat mich wohl diese Flasche kaufen lassen. Im Glas dann auch gülden mit viel Schaum; das Aroma ist sehr verhalten, um nicht zu sagen kaum auszumachen. Im Antrunk dann eher malzig mit gewisser wäßriger Herbe im Abgang. Das ginge ja noch, wenn nicht permanent eine gewisse Säuerlichkeit zu schmecken wäre. Irgendwie hatte ich da mehr erwartet. Dieses Bier wird der imposanten und geschichtsträchtigen Wartburg nicht gerecht! Test vom 8.1.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,8,9,8,13,9 - 9,20"

Flavor is smooth creamy and sweet, toasted malts, biscuit, sweet caramel , brown sugar, toffee and honey sweet- a bit slick with some peat and smoke prickliness in the end but it is just a nice wisp that adds to the beer. Pretty smooth and easy drinking.

Brava Lime;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Yellow color. Lime and ginger in the nose and throughout the body. Absolutely disgusting. Terrible, not even remotely good after 15 or whatever beers at the Great Toronto Beer Festival or whatever it is.
Brava Lime;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);I tried this at the Hamilton Good Beer Expo. Uh... this isn't good beer. Metalic artifical Lime. Rotten smell that isn't realy even there. I actally ended up throwing the rest of my sample in the garbage. My friend did the same thing and considering herself as Joe Q Public on beer and seeing her throw it out as well tells me more about the beer. I'm sure the only reason why they would sell it in 24's is just to get rid of it and say that it is marketable. Heed warnings and avoid further consuption. A poor variant on a poor beer.
Brava Lime;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);I was poking around the site looking for some Ontario beers that I haven't tried yet, and noticed that this hideous brew that I made the mistake of sampling at last summer's Toronto Beer Festival had yet to be added to the database. Imagine a crappy Corona/Sol knock-off mixed with lime dish soap, and you'll have some idea of what this beer tastes like. It amazes me that they can sell this crap exclusively in cases of 24 and people actually buy it.

Ödmans Beska;Göteborg, Sweden;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;Sampled draught at Pannrummet, Gothenburg. This is an odd brewpub. It is located in an inustrial area and only open on friday evenings. Furthermore they only brew 150-160 l/week. Anyway, this beer in near orange coloured and really hazy with very little head. It has a bready, spicy and pleasantly hoppy aroma. It is suitably dry and yhe maltiness is nicely soft and reasonably firm. The finish is hoppy bitter. A flavourful and well balanced pilsener.

Ödmans Winter Warmer;Göteborg, Sweden;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;My favourite among black beers at the moment. As long as you´re not in Ireland. Here you get a stoutish drieness but not as full body as a stout.
Ödmans Winter Warmer;Göteborg, Sweden;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;Dark as the Swedish winternight dry vith a burnt malty finish. Nice yellow/brown frothy crown
Ödmans Winter Warmer;Göteborg, Sweden;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;Not quite as good as their previous Winter Warmer Ale but very dry and chocolate-malty finish
Ödmans Winter Warmer;Göteborg, Sweden;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;Samled draught at Pannrummet, Gothenburg. Near black with small beige head. Rich coffee aroma. Clean, dry and lightly spicy with notes of licorice and chocolate and a mild toffee finish. A bit hard/sharp mouthfeel.
Ödmans Julbock;Göteborg, Sweden;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;If you like strong beers and are in Gothenburg, you´d better hurry because the last cask is soon coming up. That´s seasonal beers problem, and they only brew 150 litres of each brew. A fullbodied Bock with a certain sweet ending.
Ödmans Julbock;Göteborg, Sweden;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;Darkish yellow with a nice white crown full of dextrines with a masculin body
Ödmans Julbock;Göteborg, Sweden;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;A very strong, malty Bock-pilsner with a surprising sweetness in the finish.

White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);50cl can from a night shop in Conisbrough. Thin white head. Clear pale golden pour. Pretty dreadful.
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);500ml can, as White Storm 7.5%, from off-license, Liverpool, for 99p. Pale yellow gold colour, short-lived fizzy white foam head and aroma of sugar, sulphur, oil. Taste is sweet, tangy, apple-like flavour, sulphury, with artificial sweeteners & booze. Slick mouthfeel, medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, drying finish with residual sweetener. Not the best
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);Tried at 7.5% in the early 2000s. Pours clear white with a slight yellow tinge. Smells like stale urine and chemical. Nasty sour apple taste like those fizzy Chewits sweets, more chemicals and powdered sugar. I doubt any apples were used in this. Leaves a worse aftertaste than menstrual blood, not that I would know.
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);Wanna see me chug this bitch? Copy and paste this link: https://youtu.be/ss6p0hHdqj4 Drank real good. Way better than I was expecting, actually. Nice finish. Loved it.
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);Can from local off licence, great Barr. Almost clear with yellow hint, lots of carbonation. Aroma of dry apple core. Taste is sweetener and apple core, dry. Drinkable.
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);1000ml bottle. Pours very pale white with little carbonation. Aroma is slightly meaty sour apple juice. Taste is meaty apple to start with a dusty finish.
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);Can (500ml). Poured a super clear watery colour with a tinge of greenish yellow and a fizzy white head which was full diminishing. Aroma was of vinegar, sulfur, hints of apple and an odd eggy smell in the back, almost like someone let one go! Taste was insanely sweet with more sugar than apple present and some unwelcome acidic/sulfury notes. This one hid its alcohol volume well, but other than that it was a disaster.
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);Plastic 2 Liter Bottle. Mildly intimidating. Slight sour apple aroma, somewhat skunky. Flavor is sour at the open and overly sugary in the finish. The sugar content kind of hurts my stomach. Dangerously high abv.
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);Oh please pinch me so I can wake up!!! It looks like someone has urinated into a filled water dispenser, though the bubbles that lift rapidly from the sides of the glass give it a post-mix flare. It smells mousy, hairy, a touch too much walnut puree and timber varnish. It tastes of unexcitement. Brashly carbonated, biting, light bodied, fizzy soda water with very little apple yet I clung on just hoping some juicy succulence might peek its welcome head out. Its husky, the alcohol, not hot, but just harsh. The clean spirit aftershock is bewildering. It is vinous and astringent on the swallow, crisp and carbonic, really bites in, but the alcohol is not shy at all. It leaves a mess on the palate, or is that your palate in a mess. This isn’t cider. It’s alcohol for football hooligans too young and daft, too bloody stupid but preyed upon by products like this. Nothing truly nasty, I survived a pint, but this is just evil. (50cL can, 31/01/08, The Beer Store Morley)
White Lightning;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);The only good thing about this beer is the price tag! Gets you hammered quick, but tasted like hell!

Clear golden colour, large white head. Malty nose. Malty, slightly fruity (lemon) with rather shy hoppy notes. A rather mild beer, but not at all boring.

Essential Beer;Seoul, South Korea;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);Got this in a can at a small grocery store in Taipei. Funny name, looks very generic. Taste is nothing which is actually a one up compared to other Asian lagers which are mostly offensive. Incredibly watery which some notes of candy sugar and corn.
Essential Beer;Seoul, South Korea;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);330ml can - thanks LP! Sweet aroma. Horrifically light. Fizzy soda water palate. Water, yes, water. Taste is papery. Some almond. Finish thin. Ug.
Essential Beer;Seoul, South Korea;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);Clearly correct in its message, just as there is essential air, essential water, essential shelter and essential bodily functions, either pleasurable or otherwise. What is not essential is THIS beer. This brewery is coming up with some real gems.

Cariba;Qormi, Malta;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;LBM Breweries Ltd. (Löwenbräu Munich InBev);Bottled. Pale golden with no head. Adjunct aroma. Sweet with mellow body, and -wait - here's a flavour: burned malt. No bitterness.
Jazz Non Alcoholic;Qormi, Malta;Low / No Alcohol Beer;LBM Breweries Ltd. (Löwenbräu Munich InBev);Canned. A 'beer' probably aimed for the Libyan market, as a lot of the info is in Arabic writing, and Malta trades a lot with Libya. Well, it pours pale golden and has an offputting aroma of old dates. The body is really thin and mellow, and it is also very sweet and in fact utterly revolting. Poor Libyans.
Cisk Gold;Mriehel, Malta;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Simonds Farsons Cisk;Canned. This was an oddity. I saw only one can available in the whole country, no matter how hard I looked. I was fearful that it would be well out of date or something, but it seemed OK. It poured golden and somewhat hazy with small, airy head. Reasonably malty and rather sweet with near decent hop rate and some late bitternes. An average lager.

The Czechs can’t be too happy with having their name attached to this one.

Black Boss Porter 9.4%;Witnica, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Witnica;11.2 oz bottle. Pours a dark nut brown with tan head of micro bubbles. Scents of dried fruit and malt. Nutty raisiny flavors and alcohol overtones don’t dominate. Well balanced. Really nice.

Black Boss Porter 9.4%;Witnica, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Witnica;500 ml bottle. Pours a dark brown with light head. Aromas of aromas of almonds, chalks, woody chocolate, and roasted malts. Flavors of sweet chocolate, praline, nougat, and dry roasted malts. Slick. Nice.
Black Boss Porter 9.4%;Witnica, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Witnica;500 ml bottle. Since when is a porter Amber in color??? This is amber. Aroma shows mild toffee, toasted grain. Bread hints. Kind of a strong dark Amber lager. Kind of thin bodied. Not bad if you tell yourself it is not a porter.
Black Boss Porter 9.4%;Witnica, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Witnica;Poured from bottle thanks Stacey brownish black tan head. Aroma is light roasted malt caramel yeast. Taste follows more like an amber lager than a porter.
Black Boss Porter 9.4%;Witnica, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Witnica;Pitch black colored pour, with a thin tan head. Aroma is dark malts, something like burnt bark and a pancake syrup like sweetness. Quite sweet tasting with a big malty body. Flavor profile is licorice, burnt sugar and jelly beans, with molasses. This is certainly interesting, but very good.
Black Boss Porter 9.4%;Witnica, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Witnica;Given that it's a rarer find, I always pick up a Polish-made Baltic Porter when I see one, and this one does not disappoint, although that being said I found it overall not as enjoyable as other examples of the style. From the bottle into a snifter, this poured a faintly reddish brown-black color with a small top of khaki foam, not as intense black as others and not completely opaque, surprising given its assertive name. Aroma of dry chocolate and licorice, with raisin and cherry fruit notes. Flavor follows with licorice-accented roasted malts and a cocoa sweetness. There's a slight boozy hint in the aroma and taste as well. No coffee notes that I could discern. Relatively light and thin on the palate but with a rounded mouthfeel. Overall this brew is good but not great, with fairly complex flavors but not as rich and textured as my personal favorite Zywiec Baltic Porter.
Black Boss Porter 9.4%;Witnica, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Witnica;Aromas of macerated strawberries, raisiny, licorice, faint smoky tree branch. Brown-black with faint ruby highlights, and a mostly fading beige head. Earthy, mildly fruity, light roast. Medium bodied.

Abbeydale Belfry;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Abbeydale Brewery;At Great British Beer Festival 2015, Day 2. Clear pale golden beer with a small beige head. Fruity grape aroma, hay, floral, om bread. Kinda the same flavor, a bit dull but also flawless.
Abbeydale Belfry;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Abbeydale Brewery;Golden ale with loose, snow white head and clear golden blonde colour. Weakish aroma, some bready malts, flowers, white pepper, apple, grass but also an unpleasant H2S odour (stale urine)... Plain pale malt sweetishness in the mouth, subdued fruitiness (more malt fruitiness than yeast fruitiness), touch bready, becoming more vegetable-like in the finish with a light amount of grassy hoppiness. This type of light and relatively uncomplicated session beers has to be absolutely flawless to delight, and unfortunately that is not the case here.
Abbeydale Belfry;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Abbeydale Brewery;From cask. Pours cloudy yellow with a small white head. Aroma is citrusy and crisp hoppy. Smooth fruity, crisp hoppy. Bitter, straw and slight grainy. Bitter and slight herbal dry finish.

Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Originally rated June 2005. This one used to be brewed by Silvercreek Brewery in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Now it is owned by Sleeman. This is part of the value brands (cheap shit) at The Beer Store in Ontario. The colour is pale yellow. Hardly no head, and there is no lacing. The mild aroma I get from this beer is sweet malt. So is the taste. Slight grain finish. A very poor brew, but nothing offensive in this one. Great for a cheap evening... comes in a 15 pack only.
Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);341ml bottle sample. Ahhhh the wolf. I remember drinking this quite a bit in my younger days, particularly because you could get it in 18 packs, quantity over quality for this beast. Pours a golden yellow. Aroma and taste is of grains and corn. Your typical macro that should only be had when there is no other option, and must be drank ice cold while cutting the lawn.
Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);It’s a good thing they don’t carbonate and bottle that canine pee anymore. I remember buying a case of 24 of that some years ago, thinking I’d be getting another nice craft beer. What a disappointment. I couldn’t give it a real rating now but I remember it being thin and acid-like. Blechhh!!!
Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Not bad an ok beer for the price. It Is prone to be very skunky. This is probably because it sits around the beer store along time before being bought. If you get a good batch it’s a nice refreshing beer. Sleeman should really put expiration dates on the box, to prevent the beer store from selling old product
Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);"Bottle- Another "" I want a new ratings"" purchase. 18 bottles in a pack, with the expectation of only drinking 1. Sparkling gold pour with a fizzy white head that lasts a short while. Ok aroma of some faint hops and then the corn takes over. Some malt also present in the aroma. FLavours are slightly hoppy with mainly sweet bready malt lasting through the finish. Not really my gig."
Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Swillfest ’04: Pale colour. Malty, bready aroma with a hint of lime. Vaguely malty palate, a little wet. Relatively clean.
Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Nice, clean malty aroma with some light mineral nose. Gold, white head, that did not lasted to long. Arctic Wolf had strange wet bitterness, could be fault of malt ? In this case aroma promises more than flavour can give.
Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);(Bottle) I do not know if people buy this? I bought a case in Ottawa and blew the dust off - another less than exceptional Sleeman beers was my guess - I was right on. Pours a medium white head and a light golden body. Aroma of cheap American Standard. Flavours of very little other than a company's desire to offer more products than they can afford to host. Really, really boring. Finishes with my desire to fill the bottles with water and glue-gun the box re-shut and return it to the place I got it. 18 beers are a lot... 18 crap beers are projectiles! I see you coming down my street... and out my window the remainder of this beer goes!
Sleeman Arctic Wolf;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Your average nothing special lager. There is nothing distinguishing about it other then it comes in an 18 pack it's just odd.
Davidson Brothers Amber Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a semi-dark amber color with a thin white foamy cap. Messy clingy white lace. The aroma had a butterscotch to caramel to toffee malty sweetness up front with a delicate grassy hop bitterness underneath. The flavor leans to the sweet malty side. Hop bitterness is once again, far underneath. Super malty aftertaste. Quick malty dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. Overall, adequate amber ale with a respectable sort of cleanliness all around. I don’t want to knock this too much. But I often find other amber ales much more flavor worthy.
Davidson Brothers Amber Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the Algonquin. Nose is buttery w. some caramel malt.

Davidson Brothers Golden Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Poured into an English pint glass, the appearance was a soft mildly burnt yellow to off-white color with a semi-foamy white head. Soapy stringy lace. The aroma reaches at some citrus and floral notes faintly flowing over some earthy tones and then a nice malt backbone. The flavor leans towards the malt backbone and ends up embracing a nice balance with the citrus and floral hoppy notes. Earthiness seems to be a lot fainter in this department. Crisp clean malty to lightly hopped aftertaste rolling into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a good sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, pretty good English pale ale worthy of coming back to.
Davidson Brothers Golden Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub with a 5oz sample.

Davidson Brothers Brown Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a glossy burnt amber almost close to a brown color. Sly transparency weaves about. Finger’s worth of white foamy head roamed here and there. Semi-sticky lacing, kinda messy. The aroma starts off with the normal qualities of an English Brown ale, sweet toffee rich to nutty character. The flavor leans sweet and smooth. More toffee than expected, but decent. Sly crisp sweet nutty to toffee aftertaste. Sweet wet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fantastic sessionability about it. Carbonation seems to barely hit. Just really moves really nicely on my tongue. Overall, just a tad lighter in color than expected, but everything else is right on for the style.

Davidson Brothers Zydeco Zipper;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Slightly lower quality than the IPA which it most resembles, this is intensely fruity and sweet, very clean and bright, with strong apricot/peach and vanilla flavors, but marred a bit by a thin body and weak nose. Still worth trying for sure.
Davidson Brothers Irish Red;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Poured into a mug, the appearance had an amber color with a thin white foamy head that dissipated immediately. Concave sliding lace. The aroma had some toast, nuts, caramel and toffee.

On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, good Irish red ale worthy of more pours.

Sly lace. The aroma took an English yeast to create some butterscotch, sweet bread, caramel and toffee tones rolling over a delicate chocolate malt. Super subtle roast.

On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Decent carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, as an English porter it works. I would have again.

Davidson Brothers Oatmeal Stout;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Served a deep dark brown with a hint of ruby. A Lasting tight head graces the top of the sampler glass. To the nose it is sweet chocolate, the olfactory equivalent of a tootsie roll. Smooth and light on the tongue, this beer quickly wins me over with its subtle maltiness and subdued hops. An easy choice for a winter session beer. Has a pleasant roasty character without the burnt or bitter notes characteristic of some other examples of the style. On tap at the brewpub in Glens Falls.

Not bad, but not quite what I was expecting either.
Davidson Brothers Scotch Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Seeing the last review for this can make one apprehensive, but after pouring into a thistle, a nice looking, smelling and flavorful Scotch ale shows its favor upon my palate. Here’s the rest: The appearance was a dark chestnut red to ruddy brown color with a sly transparency about it. Finger’s worth of white foamy head dissipates adequately. The aroma blends black tea to a subtle smoke and sly sweet peat. Super subtle toffee, caramel and nuts play far underneath. Light raisin and some red delicious apples smooth out the aroma. The flavor takes all of the previously mentioned aromas and lets the dry woodiness come across nicely. I will mention that that as it warms, the black tea level seems to be a bit higher than expected. Dry sweet woody aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good and low. Some stickiness hits but acceptable. Overall, very nice scotch ale/wee heavy that I would have again despite a stronger black tea level flavor hits more than expected.

Davidson Brothers Scotch Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;A - Pours a deep, but still slightly clear red-brown color with a bit of off-white head. The head faded fairly quickly to a ring around the glass and left some lace behind. S - Aroma is full of sweet caramel malts and some sweet dark fruits. There is also just a touch of vanilla and oak. T - Starts off with some sweet dark fruit flavors and rich caramel malts. Little bit of vanilla notes in the background. Through the middle some oak flavor alongside just a touch of hops come through. The finish is a mix of the sweet malt and fruit flavors and just a touch of oak and booze that linger. M - Medium bodied and moderate-low carbonation. Feels a touch thick and syrupy with just a hint of a oily finish, but fairly clean. Could use a touch more carbonation. D - Very drinkable. The 9+%abv here stays very well hidden and the beer is very smooth. Could use a bit more punch in the flavor and the nose, but otherwise a pretty tasty beer.

The vanilla and butterscotch go well with the earth-soil aspects. Flavor has less diacetyl, some mineral and a very nice burnt aspect to round it off. I love the burnt aspect but everything else is just not that special. Easy to drink otherwise.

Alcohol really not all that evident except for the pepperiness."
Northampton Snowshovel ESB;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Northampton Brewery (MA);this is one of the best ESBs. Those charming english malts shine with a great sweet maltiness. A light lingering hop bitterness in the finish. Awesome brew, love this one.

Northampton Snowshovel ESB;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Northampton Brewery (MA);Deep yellow gold, tiny white head with faint lacing, very clear. Soapy orangey and earthy adequate hops give a fair dry feeling. Support malt lacking, enhancing the Americanized grapefruity hop feel, herbal and with honest bitterness, but finishing a bit short. Astringence lasting, citric and thankfully not acid. Active carbonation. Heavily filtered and thinned out, but it remains one of my favourites at Northampton.

Northampton Blackberry Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Northampton Brewery (MA);Full bodied and rich. A very good Porter. The blackberries were however non-evident. I had to ask if I had gotten the right one. The waitress said that they were subtle, but I think a little too subtle. Overall, still a good quaff. Re-rate (02-04): Ahhh, there were Notes of Blackberries in the nose and the taste this time. Also a good hit of roastiness to the nose. The taste of them, while not overly strong had an almost syrupy feel to it. There were also notes of roastiness and coffee to the taste.

Coachs Sooner Stout;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Dry;Coachs Brewery;(Tap) Pours black with a small, fading head. Doesn’t taste much like a stout, probably because of the weak mouthfeel.

Dark bodied and creamy palate.
Coachs Roughneck Porter;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Porter;Coachs Brewery;Dark pour with medium head, large bubbles in the head. This has no distiguishable aroma, with a taste like a very bland Guinness (in fact this is like a bland version of the Sooner Stout). There is a subtle taste of hops, but it comes off as a bad impersonation. Palate is left feeling smooth. Later, a more roasted caramel taste shows up, and it must have hit the right temperature because when colder, this beer has close to nothing. Far too think of a palate... lack of flavor. Poor effort.
Hale's Pikop Andropovs Rushin Imperial Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hale's Ales;Bottle, Downtown Spirits. Dark thick black colour, off white head. I suppose this was a fairly standard imperial stout, lots of thick roasty flavours, not overly hoppy on this occasion. Felt rounded more than aggressively bitter or boozy. Good, just somehow missing the extra bit of excitement.
Hale's Pikop Andropovs Rushin Imperial Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hale's Ales;Bottle thanks to duchammer: The label we drank had a double decker bus on it.

I actually don’t know when this was brewed cause I don’t see any info on annual release. Whatevs. Black beer with ghost white lacing. Aroma is dry, ashy malt that’s acidic. Flavor is a bit flabby and light... And weak stout. I’m actually surprised this is an Impy Stout. Just a bit too acidic and weak.
Hale's Pikop Andropovs Rushin Imperial Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hale's Ales;"""A spot purchase in Seattle that I might have avoided if I’d looked it up. I was encouraged that so many of the off reviews are years old, and at first this had a nice sweet milk chocolate roasted coffee aroma, and looks great. Lower abv so a less thick body was expected. The giant white chunks were a turnoff though, as was the lactic quality that did not belong, and only grew as the beer warmed. It’s not a milk stout and wouldn’t have been a great example if that style either. A beer that could have been quite good but it seems this one has a long history of quality control issues. Still has its good points, but way under average for the style."""

Geelong Bitter;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;Ugh. All this brewery’s beers taste the same. They’re really quite bad but not offensive enough to rate really poorly in my book. This one has rust and bananas and not much else - OK maybe lemon detergent. Good head retention. Crap beer.

Geelong Bitter;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;Awful, awful beer from Geelong south of Melbourne. It looks like a standard lager, perhaps a bit yellowey. There is definate acetate and other unpleasant things in the smell. The taste is a bit like Budweiser mixed with dishwater. Actually make that washing machine water - there's a hint of old smelly socks in there somewhere. Genuinely bad.

Whitstran Highlander;Prosser, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Whitstran Brewing Company;Bottle:   Fiery amber, thin frothy white head, little lacing.   Soft fruity start, pale breadiness, touch of caramel and biscuit.   A bit too soft overall.   A bit stronger on the tongue, more caramel and fruitiness, soft breadiness and biscuit.   A sweet and malty beer for sure, but not much in the way of peat, campfire, or charred wood.   Body and mouthfeel are moderate.   Tasty finish, caramel, a bit more fruity than most, and less of that charred wood/ashy/campfire stuff.   Coulda used some of that, along with minor dark pitted fruit.   Otherwise alright.

Papago El Grande Nutz;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;This beer is a deep brown color, it is slightly hazy and in the light shows a deep ruby note to it. The head is a frothy light brown color. The nose is light with notes of caramel and perhaps a hint of nuttiness. The taste is fairly dry up front, but then moves to a note of buttery oak. Quite light on the palate. While a bit dry, there is a definite caramel sweetness here. I also get a hint of chocolate. The finish of this beer is the most notable part, actually a bit rich, creamy, with notes of woody tannins, buttery oak and a definite note of hazelnut that comes to linger and dominate the finish.

Papago El Grande Nutz;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;Earthy maple syrup lathers its pungent wealth onto the boisterous nut oil…Delectable perfume reminds of a cross between Saranac’s Caramel Porter and Rogue’s Hazelnut Brown…Thick mouthfeel renders the caramel malts beautifully and plays off the maple syrup vapor with aplomb…Maybe a bit strong on the sweet nuttiness, but if you like decadence and nourishment like I do, you won’t be complaining with this one…Definitely my favorite of their lineup…

Breckenridge Vanilla Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Flavored;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);This is far from being rich as it says in the description, but it is nice good beer for me. Light and watery but that certainly gave the beer not disgusting ending. Toasted being the overall taste, has nice scent of vanilla that is not too much.
Breckenridge Vanilla Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Flavored;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);12 oz bottle into shaker. Pours a bit thin for a porter. White/beige lacy head. Heavy vanilla and typical porter aroma. Mouthfeel is a tad thin for the style. Loses most of its head fairly quickly. Somewhat malty with a real vanilla flavor, unlike some vanilla beers that can taste artificial. The not-so-thick mouthfeel and moderate alcohol make this one of the few session porters around. Very common in the Denver area, and a bit better on tap than out of the bottle.
Breckenridge Vanilla Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Flavored;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Decent porter tastes of chocolate and roasted bark.. have you ever licked the bark of a tree monkey boy?

Breckenridge Vanilla Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Flavored;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);A nice hint of vanilla without going overboard. Light weight for a porter, goes down easy. Bottle at the Burbank airport.
Breckenridge Vanilla Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Flavored;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);I have picked up this beer, at the drinks of the world, at Bern, trying this beverage, at home, in Epalinges, two days ago, during my seafood pasta meal. In my point of view, it is a good vanilla porter, not disgusting and well balanced, I could say that it is a rather light porter, a bit watery, some roasted malt, discreet side of coffee, hop and good dosis of vanilla, easy to drink.
Breckenridge Vanilla Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Flavored;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Aroma of roasted malts. Dark brown pour. Taste is vanilla, roasty, bitter chocolate, malts, oats. Taste is a little watered down than it was used to.

Pours clear gold with a medium-sized white head. Aroma is paper, malt, corn. Taste is the same, low bitter finish. Pilsener in name only. In reality - typical pale lager macro swill.

Paceña Pilsener La Paz;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);getrunken 2013 Als ich das erste Mal von diesem Bier roch, erinnerte es mich an den Geruch, den manches Haustier verbreitet, wenn man es schon länger nicht ausgemistet hat. Bei dem Geruch habe ich schon schlimmes erwartet, allerdings ist der Geschmack ganz passabel, wenn auch etwas wässrig - ein typisches Bier welches besser wird, je mehr man davon trinkt. Sollte man sich im bolivianischen Dschungel verirren, kann man sich darüber freuen, dies in der Überlebensausrüstung dabei zu haben, aber in einem europäischen Land 3 € für 0,35 l zu zahlen, kann man sich sparen...(naja, zumindest konnte ich meine Neugier befriedigen....)
Paceña Pilsener La Paz;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);330ml bottle (thanks martjoobolut). Clear golden color. Small size, white head, stays. Aroma and taste is like sweet caramel candies. Happens.

Sourness, swet, hints of malts in the aroma. Grainy, malty and bit sweet taste. Grainy aftertaste. Strange taste. Strange palate. Nit good.
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);A reasonable Lager (I wouldn't go as far as classifying it as a Pilsener), and a very welcome refreshment on the road in Bolivia. I was morsende by the overall quality there, however rather mid-range on a global level.
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);Bottle in macha, Bolivia. After a long bus journey you need a beer. This one works, just like any other .
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);Not sure if the Bolivians are aware of the difference between the two tropical lagers. But it was like a pilsener, good with traditional chicken. Thick foam.
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);"Had this at the ""bar"" on a cayman filled river in the Amazon basin in Las Pampas near Rurrenbaque, Bolivia. Definitely the most epic beer run I’ve ever made. A bit more flavorful, fruity, and refreshingly dry and tart than the standard, but not a huge difference."
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);"Crystal clear coloured body with a thinnish white head. Aroma of faint fruits, light malt, cardboard and even a tiny amount of hops. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong malty taste with a bit of sugars and a little fruityness throughout. Aftertaste, clean, tart and malty - very nice actually! Overall, definitely one to try - I was impressed! I sampled this 33 cL bottle purchased out of the corner store (you buy the bottles through a jail-like barred window) in Cochabamba, Bolivia (across from the Burger King) on 13-August-2006."
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);Bottle, pours a carbonated light gold with no head. A grainy malt aroma. This and fizzy palate, but a slight fruity touch to the otherwise dry malty flavour.
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);During my 4 months in Bolivia I had this quite a time. The locals often mix this beer with coca-cola! the taste of this beer is not so good though so it is understandable. Big bottle. Straw colour, small very short lasting head. Aroma of something sourish and malty. The flavour is somewhat harsh with a taste of some sour malt. Like any not so gppd brew it tastes better when served cold.
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);Straw-gold color, regular white head. Smells of grains, corn, malt, typical. Tart taste, different than the typical macro-Pilseners. This beer has a heavier malt ody, some lemon. Great for a hot day of swatting mosquitoes in the tropic heat. Good too, if you want to try a Bolivian Pilsener just a click or two off the mainstream.
Paceña Tropical Extra;La Paz, Bolivia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (AB InBev);Just another pale lager, just enough crispness, though, to make it refreshing, and just enough flavour of papaya to make it go down. Nice when it's ice cold and you're sweltering in the oppressive heat and humidity of the Bolivian amazon basin.

Clear golden color with rapidly dissipating white head that didn’t leave any lace. Smells of malty caramel, soy sauce, and sprucy hops. Slightly sweet on the tongue.

Portland Brewing Original Portland Ale;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Poured with small nice sized head, then all gone..a yellow colour straight up, smells very faintly of lemons and syrup. non bittered really, a lack luster beer here. clean aftertaste though.

Aroma is a bit soapy and moderately bitter hops. Tastes of a very pale ale. Somt light malts and I suppose a balance of hops but pretty low on both sides.

Portland Brewing Original Portland Ale;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Dark golden color with a moderate diminishing off-white head. Sweet corn, grass, lightly toasted malt, grapes, hint of pine pitch and honey in the scents. Grains and stomach acid flavors. Corn husks and light sweet white grapes also join in the mix. A boring APA at best.
Portland Brewing Original Portland Ale;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a slightly off-gold, almost no head. Aroma is fairly balanced, caramel, grapefruit, and a slight lemony aroma. Flavor is citric, somewhat balanced by mild hops. Overly carbonated, methinks. Very light and quaffable.

Aroma has some hops and grains. Flavor is just the right amount of hops to put this over the top. Everything else is pretty much light and non-existiant. Still worth the time to find this one.

Geelong Draught;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;I believe this beer is also sold under the name of Mercat draught at the mercat hotel near the Victoria markets. It’s not terrible on tap, sweet and predictable, not dissimilar to Carlton Draught. Probably made with a lot of sugar. Devoid of any defining character.
Geelong Draught;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;Well... yeah it actually had pretty decent head retention and most of the objectionable aromas went away pretty quickly. Other than that it’s thin, metallic, astringent and kind of headache-inducing. And farmboy I can go you one better - I’m from Geelong :)
Geelong Draught;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;Coming from Barwon Heads, 20km from Geelong, I am ashamed to admit that this is as close to swill as you could possible get without drinking a bottle with the letters 'VB' on it.
Geelong Draught;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;Slightly bitter aroma and moderately bitter flavour. Very thin and watery. A real disapointment.
Geelong Draught;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;The lesser of the three evils - the other two being Geelong Bitter and Geelong Lager. This one still has the same insipid quality with unpleasant alcohol flavours coming through. The head is weak, the palate nasty and the whole experience definately not worth having.

St Arnou St Cloud;Sydney, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St Arnou;Very true to the style of Belgium wit for such a widely available and Australian brewed beer.

St Arnou St Cloud;Sydney, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St Arnou;A decent, if uninspired wit. Beautiful on a hot Queensland day at the Regatta with the typical orange-coriander flavors and light body. Has a pale cloudy appearance with a big fluffy head. Fine, nothing out of the ordinary.
St Arnou St Cloud;Sydney, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St Arnou;A wonderful appearance from the pour, and a good example of witbier. Always going to struggle up against the class of Hoegaarden, but certainly a worth contender.
St Arnou St Cloud;Sydney, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St Arnou;on tap. pretty weird sulphuric nose suggesting something went wrong but as with 3 ravens blond, i would say it made the beer more interesting. hazy yellow, lightly lemony with faint compost and some fruit tella sweetness
St Arnou St Cloud;Sydney, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St Arnou;Tried this at the Regatta.Thought this was pretty thin with just enough of the witbier characteristics appearing to make it recognisable as a witbier.
St Arnou St Cloud;Sydney, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St Arnou;On tap at the Regatta. Can’t believe I haven’t rated this already. A fair attempt at the style. Some spice and citrus in the nose. Relatively thin body with citrus to the fore. Clean finish.
Fyne Ales Maverick;Cairndow, Argyll, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fyne Ales;Pours a semi-transparent deep orange/red, with an average sized creamy head that shows good enough retention and nice lacing. Reasonably intense aroma shows a caramel and lightly roasted malts base, red fruit notes and a grassy whiff. Taste follows the aroma closely: caramel and lightly roasted malts base, red fruit notes and a herbal/grassy underlying presence (a bit more distinct than in the aroma). Slightly sweet entrypoint with a balanced finish. Light bodied with low to medium, soft carbonation, resulting in a nicely smooth but not at all empty mouthfeel. Definitely an easy drinker as mandatory per style, well-balanced and interesting enough. A very well crafted bitter.

I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Im Glas steht ein sehr hell gelbes, stark getrübtes Weizen mit flacher, feiner Krone, die sich lange hält. Geruchlich dominieren hefig-fruchtige und bananige Züge das Bier. Das Weizen startet fruchtig säuerlich, mit leichter Bananen-Note im Hintergrund. Der Abgang hallt nicht allzu lange hefig sahnig nach. Das Weizen wird im weiteren Verlauf immer säuerlicher. Hält sich zwar im Rahmen, aber es macht den ersten guten Eindruck leider zunichte. Schade drum, Potential ist auf jeden Fall vorhanden!"

I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Ins Glas ergießt sich ein dunkel nussbraunes Weizen mit prächtiger Krone. Der Geruch offenbart sich röstig bitter, dezent fruchtig. Der Antrunk erfolgt röstig mit guter Hefenote, und zarten Fruchtnuancen (Pfirsisch und Grapefruit!?) im Hintergrund, welche im Verlauf immer besser durchkommen. Der Abgang zeigt sich fruchtig bitter, minimal sauer werdend. Zum Finish verschwindet die Röstnote fast komplett und wird von dem säuerlichen Fruchtton komplett übertönt. Insgesamt doch ein leckeres dunkles HW!"
Hobsons Old Henry;Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hobsons Brewery;500ml bottle picked up @ Hobsons Brewery, Cleobury Mortimer. Pours a clear amber, medium off-white head. Taste takes a caramel malt tangent, perhaps a little cake-like, alluding to sweet ginger cake without the ginger. Really a lovely fruity malty amber beer.

Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Came to the table a clear dark amber in color, thin white head and low carbonation. Aroma is dominated by the Munich malt, some light caramel notes in the back. The flavor starts off with Munich and moves into a sweet caramel middle with a slight almost cigar smoke flavor towards the end. The flavors meld fairly well but the beer is just a bit watery for the complexity of the flavors. Overall the smokey notes make the beer pretty good and give it a bit more character than you normally see in an amber.
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;On tap at Prairie Rock. Poured a deeper, garnet-tinted amber with a medium cap of off-white head… left some nice lacing. The aroma quickly hinted at rather nasty dark undertones.. bit of toasty cocoa emerges toward the back as a quasi-redeeming factor. Toasty caramel in the flavor along with some vinous-type dark fruit notes and some cardboard.. wouldn’t have been bad if the ingredients came across as fresher.. also not very well-blended. Sharp at the edges and back-end.. lighter-bodied.. ugly taste at the finish. Not good.
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Dark amber beer. Carmael and chocolatey aromas. I found this to be rather one dimentional and cloying. Overly malty and not at all balanced. Somewhat watered down and somewhat drinkable. I did not order a second.
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Very thin, weak, watered-down...with a mild sweet caramel base and a light hop bitterness that was just a hint. Some mettalic notes in the finish. Disappointing.
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Brown/Copper Coloring with White Skin. Sweet Malt Aroma. Sweet Caramel and Light Musty Malt Aftertaste.
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;So they also have an amber ale. Hmmmm. As ambers go this again was quite thin, but seem to be par for the course for this place. Malts and grains typical of an amber. Drinkable.
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Dark copper color with a medium head. Nice aroma of caramel malts. Fairly strong malt taste. Not much else, but for an Amber, this is pretty tasty.
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Schaumburg. Nice clear bronze/amber with a centered splotch and an off-white wrung for the head. Some caramel, peat, pecans, maple, brown sugar and hops in the nose. An affluent acidic edge strikes the palate first but then it’s quickly bygones, transitioning to a mild caramel and subdued nutty pecan profile. Hazelnut and walnut casings come in on the tail end and are the biggest contributors to the nutty finish. Decent.
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Served as a flat amber with just a ring for a head. Delicate orange hops in aroma with a mild bitterness in the flavor. Mouthfeel was thin and a little tinny, and that put me off. Prairie Rock Brewing Company, Elgin, IL
Prairie Rock Clock Tower Amber Lager;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;"Odd Vienna. It’s a dark copper color with a solid off-white head, a strong earthy hop aroma, and a murky, muddy taste. (""This isn’t your Dad’s Vienna..."") Roasted malts are there in strength, but the earthy hops muddle up the brew. Prairie Rock Brewing Company, Schaumburg, IL"
Prairie Rock Prairie Rock Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;12oz bottle (Old Notes-Brewed by Chicago Brewing Co.)-Pours a very dark golden with a small white head.

Jacob Bodenwöhrer Jacobator;Bodenwöhr, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Familienbrauerei Jacob;Pours a clear, mahogany coloration with a medium, creamy head and visible carbonation. Smells of bready, slightly grainy and caramelly malt, dark fruits and herbal hops. Taste follows the nose, with a good balance of sweet, bready, caramel, slightly grainy malt, dark fruits: fig, plum, raisin, lighter red fruits: redcurrant and just a hint of herbal hops and estery spice: clove. Finishes with a light/medium bitterness and some bready/caramel malt, dark fruit and herbal hops lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. Quite a nice Doppelbock with a good balance of sweet malts and bitter, herbal hops, as well as some dark/red fruit and estery spice adding some depth to this, with the clove actually standing out quite a bit.
Jacob Bodenwöhrer Jacobator;Bodenwöhr, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Familienbrauerei Jacob;500ml bottle. Clear, chestnut colour with ruby glimmer and average, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, beige head. Sweet-ish, dark and caramel malty aroma, notes of malt lozenge, some malt spiciness, a chocolately touch. Taste is sweet-ish, toasty dark and caramel malty, notes of malt lozenge, a touch of treacle, minimally nutty and chocolately overtones, a touch of dried fruit as well. Very nice.

Jacob Bodenwöhrer Jacobator;Bodenwöhr, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Familienbrauerei Jacob;Bottle from Drankenhandel Leiden. Sweet brown malt aroma with caramel, notes of dried fruits and lightly spicy. Sweet almost syrupy flavour with a light to moderate bitterness. Body is above medium with a mildly sticky texture. A bit sweet for my taste but pretty richly malty Doppelbock.
Jacob Bodenwöhrer Jacobator;Bodenwöhr, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Familienbrauerei Jacob;Doppelbock de 7,5 % abv pour 18,7° plato. Mon exemplaire était à 1 mois avant sa date.

Jacob Bodenwöhrer Jacobator;Bodenwöhr, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Familienbrauerei Jacob;Pours dark, clear amberbrown. Small white head fades instantly. Smell is surprisingly subtile. Caramel, tad chocolaty, rather sweet for sure. Taste is mildly bitter, pairing well with the otherwise overly intense sweetness. Creating that fine balance. Caramelly, chocolaty, more or less 50 50 between both. Médium body and medium to medium high Carbo. Clean fermentation profile. Very easy drinking beer. Lovely!

Kimmel Premium;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Bottled. A straw coloured beer with a reasonable white head. The aroma is on the sweet side but there’s a little corn. The taste is relatively clean and nicely balanced but really nothing special.
Kimmel Premium;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Bottled. Gold colour, low head and condition. Good initial hoppy aroma reminiscent of a German lager, Sweet malt in the mouth and a slight hoppiness in the finish.
Kimmel Premium;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Brewed (cheaply I suspect) for the UK market. This has a light sugary aroma that is followed by a sugary water flavour. There is a hint of caramel in there somewhere. The finish is quite long and consists of a chemical mouthfeel. OK, I suppose, for 75p.
Maine Coast Oatmeal Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Tap from brewpub. Dark chocolate, coffee and oatmeal malt aroma. Midnight black with moderate head. Creamy chocolate/caramel initially with a moderate astringent hops finish. Extremely nice stout especially on a nice 10 degree Maine night.
Maine Coast Oatmeal Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Any first impressions? -A frothy, creamy head covers the opaque black, lacing admirably. -Nutty caramel and roastiness coalesce in an expressive sweet aroma. -Heavy roastiness and caramel sweetness first massage the palate. -A puffy mouthfeel is achieved even without nitrogen, a smoothness which is appreciated. What if you dig deeper? -Sweet black grapes evolve in the nose. -Dry, roasty bitterness is combined to tea-like, herbal hop for a tasty curtain call. -Fruitiness is now found within the butterscotchy, fat malt. -A very good pint of stout was what I got, none of that quirky yeast and worrying aromas some guys below experienced. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Maine Coast Oatmeal Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Pours a tan, one-finger head that goes very slowly and leaves a good lace. Black color. Low carbonation and heavy bodied. Coffee nose. Starts on the sweet side with a roasted chocolate/coffee flavor, finish is smooth. $4.25 for 16oz glass at Jack Russell’s Brew Pub Bar Harbor, Me.
Maine Coast Oatmeal Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;2005 draught at the brewery, 8/14/2005. Opaque, deeply black beer with lacing. Big head, with little retention, recedes to ring. Yellowish colored. Coffee and nuts in the nose, with house yeast jumping out. Flavor smacks of house yeast character. Very earthy, dry, corky, lightly sour. Probably closest approximation is an old rubbery cork. Very odd, but at first, it’s quite novel and interesting. Some coffee and light grains, with light roast as well. But it loses most of its stout/malt quality towards the end of the pint and the yeast takes over. Corky finish. Watery and thin is the consistency. Low carbonation. Nutty somewhat, pretty basic and light bodied. Really wish I could have talked to the brewers about their yeast.
Maine Coast Oatmeal Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Smells of the clam flats around the coast. Looks nice enough in with a dark color. No head really to speak of, some lacing. Flavor is also similar to the clam flat smell. Not particularly good at all. Very watery.
Maine Coast Oatmeal Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Nice dark color, this is where the good stops and the bad begins. Little or no head, sickly smell with a touch of metalic at the tail end. Was too watered down, bad bad after taste.

Maine Coast Bar Harbor Espresso Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Pours flat black with a dense tan head. Lacy. Smells first and foremost of coffee with underlying smoky malt aromas. Taste is of roasted malt followed by bitter coffee flavors. Smoky and creamy flavors. Milky flavors and mouthfeel not unlike a milk stout. Bitter, almost dry finish. Very smooth. Interesting concoction. First time I’ve had a stout brewed with coffee and it is a positive experience! Thanks to bennybrew for the growler.
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Espresso Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;i like australian beer......................................................
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Espresso Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Good stout, not sure I agree with the sweet stout classification, though. Very dark brown with a tan, foamy head that can be rekindled with just a swirl of the glass. Roasted, nutty, aroma with a hint of bitter coffee. Roasted flavors persist, more like a dry stout or even a porter with a subtle and effective use of the espresso. Not at all overbearing. Nice lingering flavors. Minor nit - a little thin on the palate.
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Gold;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Bottle. Plastic/fake cherry aroma. Hazy golden yellow with small head. Plastic and iodine flavor - I don’t taste malt or hops. Bought this in Feb so don’t know if this has been sitting around since the summer - can’t stomach this, it’s going down the drain.
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Gold;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"(Bottle from Florian’s) Sour, fizzy, infected...Underfilled bottle as usual from Maine Coast. Gigantic foam pour. Cap opens with big pffffffttt!!! 99% of first pour was white foam. Foam oozes out of bottle as it takes about 15 minutes to decant a 12 oz. bottle with all the foam. Cloudy gold-yellow body. Aroma is sour, citrusy, iodine and yeast. Mouthfeel extremely prickly. Taste is citrusy, iodine, Band-Aid and yeast. Another ""masterpiece"" from Maine Coast. These guys have some real issues going on with their product but they don’t seem to want to hear about it."
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Gold;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"Any first impressions? -Enormous foam covers the clear blond à la Belgian saison. -Faint citrus is perceived in the aroma, and a distant iodine phantom. -Herbal hops are met an iodine mess, this is truly horrific and disgusting. -The frothy carbonation and lean maltiness create a competent body for a would-be blond ale. What if you dig deeper? -Do I have to? You’re cruel. -Important herbal hop bitterness almost topples the iodine monstrosity. -If properly delivered, this would’ve been a very decent blond ale, but as is, it should hastily be taken off the shelves. Bottle; no date!"
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Gold;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"Pours a white, three-finger head that goes quickly and leaves traces of lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Musty hoppy nose. Starts with some bite, I agree with other reviewers this has a sour, corky taste; still a clean finish. Nothing like any blonde I have had. $1.83 for a 12oz bottle from Maine Coast Brewery Bar Harbor, Me."
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Gold;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;On draught at the brewpub 8/14/2005. The very low gravity of this beer, and relative low hoppiness did not help fight off the corky, sour, acidic yeast. At least the oatmeal stout had some roast to fight it off, the precipice, some hops, and the blueberry just seemed dry. But this one just gets clobbered and after about 2 sips, the yeast has completely taken over. I will say, the malt is ok in these beers, and this one, especially for a golden is not poorly malted by any means. Same golden color as the precipice, though with a little bit less rusty-tinged notes to it. Smells like a hint of toasted grains and then all cork. A bit watery, hard to finish. I really wish I knew what was going on with this brewery and its strange, to put it lightly, yeast.
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Gold;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Light yellow/gold beer. Thin fizzy head. Watery and refreshing but that’s about all it’s got going for it. It’s basically Maine Coast Budweiser.
Maine Coast Bar Harbor Gold;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Light Golden color with a fine white foam. Mild hoppy aroma. Light malt.

Maine Coast Bar Harbors Best Bitter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Reviewed from notes. On tap at brewpub. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a dark copper/Red color. Bar pour’s kind of slim white head left no lacing. The smell had a decent light caramel/nutty/English maltiness ( light soapiness). The taste was pretty much the same. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. It left a nice creamy texture over my tongue. Overall, good bitter to style, I’d have again.
Maine Coast Bar Harbors Best Bitter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;On tap at Jack Russells Brewpub. Amber colour with a thin white head. Decent bitterness. Smooth texture. Seems well balanced. Nothing special but makes a decent bitter.
Maine Coast Summer Wheat Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Any first impressions? -A ring of foam circles the hazy blond. -Crisp wheat and faint citrus fruit fail to excite the nostrils. -Dull banana and honey sweetness barely wake up the wet, wheaty softness. -The smooth carbonation fits the appropriately lean body, but it soon feels limp. What if you dig deeper? -It finishes dry, and mostly bland. -A salty, Cup-a-Soup is evoked by the flaccid nose. -Oh, the brewpub estival wheat ale...I still don’t see a purpose for it when the house blond could easily do the same trick. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Maine Coast Summer Wheat Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;After sampling this one, and being thoroughly disappointed in this brewer’s offerings, I stumbled into the car my wife so lovingly drove and went back to the hotel to drink some of Atlantic’s offerings. I don’t think I’ll seek out this brewer again.
Maine Coast Summer Wheat Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Yellow, fizzy, mildly refresing, but not exactly exciting. Watery hop taste with little aroma.
Maine Coast Summer Wheat Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Had a bottle of this whilest up in Maine for the weekend. it was a pretty generic and average summer ale.
Maine Coast Dark Winter Wheat;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Reviewed from old notes. On tap at the brewpub, this was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a black color with a thin bar pour’s kind of head that died off immediately. The smell had a light chocolate covered banana thing going on, not bad but not exactly what I thought it was going to be for a true dunkelweizen (side note, what was I expecting, its not in a weizen glass), sorry, anyways. The taste was sweet through the chocolate covered banana, not bad. On the palate, this sat about a light to medium with a fair sessionability about it. Overall, well, actually I liked it for what it was, but it just didn’t seem like a true dunkelweizen but an American version of one.
Maine Coast Winter Warmer;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;OK, to be fair, I found this bottle 1/3 full in the barn while cleaning things up. Of course, being a connoisseur of aged brews, since I have been obliged to imbibe many of my own over the years, I had to give this a taste. I have no idea how long it’s been there, but I can say that I haven’t been to Bar Harber since my wife’s birthday (Jan 4) somewhere around the turn of the millenium. I rate this winter ale high on the scale because I am currently enjoying the aged version, and I know we both made the most of the fresh brew on that cold January night by the fire. -Al maxwell
Baltika Medovoe Light;St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);From the archives: Oh damn me - this was available 10 years ago in Tartu. It was priced below anything else, it was sweet an honey-like. Drinkable and fulfilling for every student out there. Stay away from this one.
Baltika Medovoe Light;St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);1.5l Bottle- Golden/Amber in colour with mild carbonation and a cream white head. Overwhelmingly sweet honey aroma which is a bit off putting. The taste is quite smooth smooth with honey featuring prominently. It is probably not natural honey but the beer is more drinkable than the aroma initially suggested. This bottle size is too big for one though as it just gets too sickly.
Baltika Medovoe Light;St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);This was the first Russian beer I ever tasted, and it also was among the first I ever rated. We were visiting friends, and this bottle was brought on the table. And it was a 1½ litre plastic bottle, and it brought my prejudice out of the closet... It was sweet and sickening to put it short and the honey never was brought in the right context...
Baltika Medovoe Light;St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);1,5 ltr plastic PET-bottle. Pale amber color, small white head. Strong aroma of honey. Light mouthfeel. Malty flavor with honey sweetness. This tastes actually like a light lager with real honey added.
Baltika Medovoe Light;St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);1,5 litre PET bottle. Yes, the rating is right: 0.6! Hazy, light copper color, no head. Smells like dishwater, combined with sweet apples and apple syrup. Ditto flavor. Threw away the whole bottle after a sip. Luckily it was only € 1,25.
Baltika Medovoe Light;St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);A hazy amber beer with a lazing beige head.

Paulaner Original Münchner Urtyp 1634;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500 ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.5%. Smallish, so-so lasting head. Clear gold, classic German lager colour. Very clean, uninterrupted honey and corny malt aroma. Moderate carbonation. Slightly earthily bitter hops go down to meet a slightly honeyed sweet bready malt rising upwards, striking a nice flavour chord, with a slight mineral aspect, and almost no 'sweetcorn' notes. The combination is really quite pleasant, even for myself whose favourite style isn't lager, so I imagine some drinkers would rate this very highly. Doesn't let itself get bogged down and sickly/soggy sweet, so it's a win as a lager in my book - I like them this way, ever so slightly pilsner-y, and Paulaner are happy to oblige.
Paulaner Original Münchner Urtyp 1634;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Von Holzfass at Braustub Munchen. Thought that was the best way to check up on this MJ 500 beer. Bright gold, crystal clear, with a tall, slightly rocky head. Light lemon in the nose, with sweet biscuits, bread. Overwhelmingly malty. Sweet flavor os honey and biscuits, with light lemony hops and a slightly peppery finish. There is some sulfury minerals too. Soft, smooth body with low carbonation as expected. How does it stand up? Not well. It is sweet, lacks hops, and the malt character is far too simple to carry it. It does have a lovely and drinkable body due to the gravity pour, though. But I think that growth in the company may have led to cheaper malt bills, and there are just too many better lagers around to think this is still interesting.

Piss Weak;Richmond, VIC, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pi55 Beer Company;Crazy, crazy stuff. Light amber colour, poor head retention and a bit of chill haze. This is not your typical light beer - smells like a cross between cider and Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout (seriously). The cider aroma isn’t the typical megalager cider aromas but more like the musty, stemmy cider aromas of Kellybrook Old Gold. Has the salty, sultana, tobacco and licorice aromas like SSIS - the resemblance is quite uncanny really. Flavour is pretty thin with apple and pear juice sweetness, thin malt, diacetyl, no hop character and a champagne-like acidity. Freaky shit really and quite enjoyable, though I’m sure it’s not how this beer is intended. An Aussie Berliner Weisse?
Piss Weak;Richmond, VIC, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pi55 Beer Company;Eponymous. God ratebeer, this means it lives up to its name. Eponymous. 75 characters yet?
Piss Weak;Richmond, VIC, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pi55 Beer Company;Surprisingly malty aroma. Tiny bit of a malty then bitter taste but still really watery. I'm going to be kind and say that this is probably better than most other lights, but only when consumed fresh. Damning with faint praise.

I pour this in a Maisel’s Hefeweizen ’vase’, in which it looks already majestic... Thick and dense, egg-white, frothy head as usual in this style, colour mahogany (orangey brownish) with yellowish edges, fully cloudy with a great deal of sparkling, almost like a sparkling wine. Aroma of red apple, banana, cookies, brown bread, cloves, ’speculoos’, cinnamon, gingerbread, chestnuts, sourish wheat coming through nicely. Fruity taste, restrainedly sweet, some banana, peach and passion fruit hints, wheaty sourness piercing through with very refreshing effect; soft and smooth mouthfeel, a bit powdery and fluffy as usual in this style, caramelly and somewhat nutty malt sweetishness in the middle, retronasal spiciness from the yeast (cloves) and finishing in a play of sweet, sour and bitter, all in a subtle way and working well together, but the sourishness lasts the longest; texture-wise, one could argue the finish is perhaps a bit thin and on the watery side. Though not Bavarian and not the most tasty Dunkelweizen I ever had, this is a perfectly acceptable, well-made and well-balanced example of the style (a style I prefer over the closely related Belgian witbiers), highly drinkable and very quenching.

Geelong Premium;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;21 Sep 05 - Simple slight sweet, light apple fruit and slightly spiritous aroma. Clear yellow golden colour, with poor head and lacing. Low malt, low hop flavour. Light tangy bitter finish and some lingering sweet hops. This beer is a bit ordinary.
Geelong Premium;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;I really don’t know what to make of this. I’m actually getting some enjoyment from this beer but I can’t believe it’s in the manner that the brewery intended it. Aroma is nuts, cider and metal, as with most of this brewery’s beers but perhaps less objectionable with the cideriness quite appley (Granny Smith). The beer tastes thin, sour, very appley and astringent. It really in no way resembles a good pale lager. I’d kind of describe it as cross between my insipid (but OK) home-brewed cider and a wussy lambic (maybe Belle-Vue Gueuze). Looks pretty good. High carb. Tastes like granny smiths.
Geelong Premium;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;Better than the Draught and the Bitter put together but still a crappy taste for the price.
Geelong Premium;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;Pretty screwed up. Better than the pale ale, i tasted more hop in this (but it ain't any where close to being hoppy). Classic Aussie chemical finish, (although, it does say that theres no preservatives). Pretty shite.

Geelong Premium;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geelong Brewing;"Well, this supposed ’premium’ stuff is slightly less bad than the confusingly named ""Geelong Premium Lager"", but that’s not saying much.

Schonbrauhaus;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Geelong Brewing;I was in Purvis cellars ogling all the beers I was yet to try. This place is seriously good. The amiable chap pointed me in the direction of this and given the price I thought I would give it a go. It looks and smells like a lager, little hop presence but a reasonable biscuity nose with overtones of orange. This citrus note comes across in the taste with a hint of dried fruit. Is this brewed correctly or are these esters that shouldn’t be here? Anyway, another rate and a reasonable beer but not memorable by any stretch of the imagination.

Schonbrauhaus;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Geelong Brewing;9 May 2004 - Slight fruit malt aroma. Clear yelllow gold colour and slight lacing. Simplistic malt sweet and hopping flavour, it has a funny artificial aftertaste with a slightly flat body.
Schonbrauhaus;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Geelong Brewing;"Initially smells like Ovaltine, then heaps like pears but both of these dissipate and it smells really malty - honey, bread, golden syrup, diacetyl - so much so that it seems like some kind of artificial ""German malt"" aroma. Really interesting aroma but I’m not entirely sure about it. Flavour is pretty toffee-malty with no real bitterness but it’s not oversweet. Malt is kind of cardboardy. Really interesting stuff but a bit all over the shop, frankly."
Schonbrauhaus;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Geelong Brewing;Hints of fruity maybe even apple and honey notes in the aroma with some almost Old Speckled Hen volatiles. Smallish head that held and a bright copper gold colouring, pasturised clear. Sweet malty almost apple flavours. Weird that this is a Pilsener but even if others didn’t enjoy this I liked it.
Schonbrauhaus;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Geelong Brewing;Decidedly un-Bavarian. Very crappy Aussie stuff, and even though its in accordance with Reihensgebot, its still manages to taste like they threw a crapload of chemicals and additives into it. Dirty water-esque.

Schonbrauhaus;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Geelong Brewing;Too pale & watery with a non-existant head. The flavour is flat and lifeless with an unpleasant cloying quality. The patronising label note gives an indication that this brewer is not to be taken seriously, and this over-aspiring beer is just another awful strike for Geelong Brewery.

Half Moon Bay Harbor Lager;Half Moon Bay, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Half Moon Bay Brewing Company;Like the president this beer was made for in support of, it fails on so many levels. First, you’d think that to celebrate a momentus occasion (despite on his failure so far) they’d create a new beer, not just relabel an old one. But that’s what they did. And then, they didn’t relabel a good beer, but a crappy pale lager. C’mon. The beer pours out a clear dark yellow color with a quick dissapearing act of a head. Aroma is musty grain, green apples and a bit of hay. Flavor has some mild vegie sweetness and little else. Just an awful beer to celebrate a monumentally huge landmark occasion.
Half Moon Bay Harbor Lager;Half Moon Bay, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Half Moon Bay Brewing Company;Obama!!! Your lager sucks! When I see you on the label, I taste this cloudy, musty, and inadequate mouthfeel of grassy, somewhat sweet term of citrus mediocrity.

Barley and Hops Rippen Raspberry Wheat;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;The aroma is all about BERRIES, BERRIES, BERRIES and MORE BERRIES. Sweet Raspberries and Blueberries. I smell both, but the brew's name is specific. Great aroma, either way. I hope the flavor lives up to it. This beer is a slightly hazy, light amber. Small, creamy, white head with minimal lacing. The flavor is fruity, lightly malty and lightly sweet up front. Nicely balanced with lightly bitter and tart hops on the backside. Medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Short, fruity, tart and dry finish. Great Spring and Summer beer. Why it's on tap in February, I have no idea. A very good offering from what I've found to be a fairly mdeiocre brew-pub. Although, the food is very decent and the staff is great.

Barley and Hops Catoctin Clear;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;On tap at the brewpub, July 2006. I was a bit taken aback by how many US brewpubs make a Kolsch, but I thought many of them were just very light quaffing ales that had little in common with the genuine article. This one was closer to the mark than most. Very pale, straw colour. Gentle fizz - not too carbonated. Featherweight mouthfeel. A touch sweet. The merest hint of biscuity malt. Not a lot to it, but clean and fresh, which is really all you’re looking for in this type of beer.

Aroma is a light waft of sweet malt sugars and hints of rock candy. Flavor is a sweet crisp run of nice pale malt, with a balancing parch of hops. Clean, refreshing and nicely drinkable. I give it high marks for a blond, having no detectable off-flavors, a nice sweet lemony malt flavor, good balance, good body, and good carbonation. That’s all I can ask for. However, based on previous ratings, I’m pretty certain that I’m chemically and physically incapable of detecting diacetyl.
Vierling Blonde Ale;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;"5 oz draft sample at the brewpub, late July 2006.

Vierling Amos Harlows Amber Ale;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a rugged looking dark copper almost amber color with a thin finger’s worth of a bar pour’s kind of slim white head. Just falls out into oblivion. The aroma had a decent blend of some roasty malts, light nuts, some caramel/toffee crispness and then some citrusy and dried piney hops. Touch of earth. The flavor had a decent blend of sweet to bitter, somewhat coming through in layers (there’s that ’separation’ that I usually wish more beers could stay blended). Nutty sort of aftertaste with a malty finish. The feel was between light and medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. And ABV felt fine as well. Overall, decent amber ale that really isn’t anything out of the ordinary but still worthy to have again.

Vierling Honey Wheat;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;A clouded orange-tinged pour, with a slimy white rim of head. Light off-lemon aroma. Flavor is a flowing, yet meaty, carbonated watery slush. Some greasy savory notes. Sweet, but in a weird earthy way. Soured honey dominates. Through the water, the palate is somehow cloying, without balance. A number of off-flavors bring this down.
Vierling Honey Wheat;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;5 oz draft sample at the brewpub, late July 2006. Cloudy, translucent golden hue with a touch of quickly dissipating foam....honey and hints of caramel and vanill in the dull unidimensional aroma.....body sweetish, somewhat cloying but lacking totally in malt presence, a bit mineralic to finish....little to say here, and even less to experience.

Silver Peak Red Roadster;Reno, Nevada, United States;Strong Ale - American;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;"""probably their most popular beer A) because it’s a malt bomb, so macro beer drinkers that are afraid of hops will love it, and B) it’s 8 freakin percent, so frat boys looking to get drunk quicker like it. That being said, even though I love my hops, this is a pretty stinkin good beer.

Silver Peak Big Daddy Hooch;Reno, Nevada, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;This stuff ain’t bad, although I have to admit that I was buzzed before I drank this, so my rating might not be 100% correct.

Full bodied, soft carbonation creamy to syrupy body. Wet with light salavation induced. Front is lightly sweet and yeasty like bread dough for a darker bread, hints of bitter and sweet fruit flavor on middle and well masked alcoholic flavor. Finish is yeasty and lightly toasty bitter with sweet malt overtones, similar to those in the odor. Fairly well balanced. Shamefully easy to drink and with its abv...be careful. Overall: Not the yeastiness of Tahoe brews, but close! Better fresh on tap, where it demonstrates a stronger fruity flavor and more sweet malt character. Sweet malts and fruit come to life as it warms(from odor to flavor)."

The beer is awful until it warms up, as most of the following description is non-existent until the beer has sat. Caramel, light hops and light coffee aroma with some alcoholic character. Front is pleasantly sweet with a semi-dry burst of more than soft, almost lively carbonation which is pleasant. Following is some alcoholic flavor, then bitter hops character with mostly light coffee notes and a long, but mild, bitter coffee aftertaste. Probably my favorite brown beer because it's not, really. It's flavored like a stout, but has the lighter body of a brown, obvious color difference and generally lighter ""stout"" character. Very smoothe."

Light black to deep brown with ruby highlights. Taste is similar to bad homebrew that kind of reminds me of a yeasty flaw I can’t quite pick out. Like autolysis or something going on. Weird.

Dempsey's Ugly Dog Stout;Petaluma, California, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dempsey's Restaurant and Brewery;Alhohol should not be made to sniff, swirl or spat. If I had to rank a scent to the beer, it smells just fine. Looks dark like a stout or porter. Taste is similar to Rasputin but slightly milder. It’s a good winter time brew or to be paired with their beef tacos. The grease/seasoning in the beef tacos pairs nicely with this beer and worth checking out. It’s certainly worth checking out if you like Rasputin or the Icelandic Smoked Porter.

Three Rivers Orchard Street Raspberry Wheat;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Pink/orange cloudy body. Smooth palate, but too much raspberry and wheat for me. Not my style at all.

Aromas of rasberries and thats it. This is bad, just bad. Acidic with no brett character. Extremely dry and fruity. No hops or malt, just fruit. BAD!
Three Rivers Red Apple Flyer Cider;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Apple Cider;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Draft @ brewpub. Clear, warm, gold, flat. Aroma is the skin of Granny Smith apple, and somewhat sulfuric. Flavors are a bit sour-sweet, but finishes dry due to the good strength. Has too much acetylaldehyde. Starts to taste like pale lager after a while!
Three Rivers Red Apple Flyer Cider;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Apple Cider;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Golden and smells like apple juice. Very sulphury and lactic cider with only a little bit of apple character. Wonky balance.

Three Rivers Papa Bears Golden Honey Wheat;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Draft @ brewpub. Nice warm honey-gold and clear. Aroma is weak, not forthcoming. Sipping reveals a thin, rather sweet rendition, oozing sweetness, simplicity, and candylike character. Playful, and simple, needing more depth and complexity to be good. Can be called cute. Surprised this is billed as their best-selling beer.
Three Rivers Papa Bears Golden Honey Wheat;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Golden, bright. No aroma. None. Honeyish sweetness on the palate, with a light cascadey, fruity hop character.

Three Rivers Papa Bears Golden Honey Wheat;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Pours as clear as day with a very quick to run head. Nose of adjuncts and honey. (I know thats an adjunct too!!!) SERVED TOO COLD!!! Honey sweetness dominates, with its' typical light body. Refreshing but with a somewhat swill flavor. I would have cut back on the honey and added Gambrinus honey malt, but then again, the brewer was not making this beer for me.
Three Rivers Arroyo Amber Ale;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Draft @ brewpub.

Three Rivers India Pale Ale;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Dark ruby-brown color. Buttered popcorn in the nose. Buttery flavor. The hops don’t get the job done here and fail to balance out the diacetyl issue.

Aroma of grapefruit from cascades/centtenial, and caramel from light crystal malts. Nice body with a good bite from columbus or simcoe.(?) Very drinkable but still delivers the hops> 60-65 IBUs.

Not much of a head but has some smokiness and abv in the nose. Big maltiness with some sweet caramel in the background. Abv is not that apparent on the palate. Smokiness is very upfront and defines the character of this beer. I can tell this has been fermented too warm, but it is still far better than most American examples and is commendible for its' smokiness.

Not much aroma. (NITRO!!) Smooth with a roasty flavor. Raisins and chocolate. Belgian special B? Could use more unfermentables: Chocolate, roasted barley, black patent.

Gettysbrew PA Blonde;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub, July 2006. The brewpub came into new ownership early 2006, so this is the same recipe but a different brewer from the two former ratings. A hazy light yellow beer with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet with light notes of citrus and other fruits. The flavor is sweet citrusy, my first guess at the hop was fuggles, but it was Brewers Gold. A very easily drinkable beer - won’t offend anybody. Listed at 5.4% ABV.
Gettysbrew PA Blonde;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;"No discernable nose, fizzy, short-lasting head; murky yellow color, little or no flavor. Not exactly sure just what they were trying to accomplish here. Reminded me almost of a blonde ale, in color only. Advertsied as a ""pilsner-like"" offering - nah."
Gettysbrew PA Blonde;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;This was the best of the five I sampled & that isn't saying a whole lot, very undercarbonated, the flavors & body seemed flat although the beer arrived with a nice fluffy & bubbly white head, the head though totally disappeared within a couple minutes, the aftertaste was sour, no wheat qualities to the beer at all

Gettysbrew Big Red One;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;One of the worst beers I’ve ever had. Thought I was driking vinegar- don’t waste your money. The restaurant in Gettyburg, PA has a nice atmosphere with good food but just skip the brew and order a Diet Pepsi.
Gettysbrew Big Red One;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;all the beer served here taste like it has some kind of infection. must be tatsted to fully understand how bad this beer is.
Gettysbrew Big Red One;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;You know...the food here was really good. Unfortunately for Gettysbrew, I’m not rating their food tonight. Way more of a sour than a bitter.
Gettysbrew Big Red One;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;wow,,this place is a tourist trap..tried the sampler,,all beers tasted the same,,except the barly wine(ill rate that next),,this was sour where it shouldnt have been...i swore every beer there was infected with the same thing..terrible.stay away
Gettysbrew Big Red One;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;Had a nice amber appearance, but that’s the good news. Thin, cidery, sour aftertaste. The server mentioned the use of hop oils [or was that on the menu?]which may account for the weird finish. I know bad beer - because as a homebrewer, I’ve made plenty - and this reminded me of some of my bad extract batches.
Gettysbrew Big Red One;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;I honestly couldn't tell this beer apart from at least two others from my sampler, no distingushable qualities at all, amber color, decent bubbly white head but it disappeared after a few minutes, once again flat flavors & body, very sour in the finish, undercarbonated
Gettysbrew Dark Horse;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub, July 2006. The brewpub came into new ownership early 2006, so this is the same recipe but a different brewer from the two former ratings. A hazy amber beer with a dense brown head. The aroma is sweet malty with strong notes of caramel, while the flavor is slightly acidic combined with light notes of roasted malt, leading to a dry end with notes of butterscotch. The mouthfeel is very smooth. Listed at 5.4% ABV.
Gettysbrew Dark Horse;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;"""No roasted malt,"" no kidding. This is very smooth, and very sweet. Slightly watery and unimpressive."
Gettysbrew Dark Horse;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;This was the worst of the five sampled, no head, flat, undercarbonated, sour, undrinkable, nothing like the commercial description claims, in fact it's very opposite, there was no rich malt character & certainly no roasted flavors, this beer along with the entire restaurant is very disappointing
Gettysbrew Black Knight;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;"I don’t see how anyone can give any extra points for any of this brewers ""beers"" .

Gettysbrew Black Knight;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;A barleywine? I think the bartender messed up on my sample and poured me 3 glasses of the SAME THING! Nothing about this is either barleywine or good.
Gettysbrew Black Knight;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;More of a stout, really. Under no circumstances could this be called a barleywine. No real malt flavor, just a slightly sweet stout beer. Definately felt like I was getting taken for a ride paying twice as much as the other brews at this brewpub for what was a similar beer.
Gettysbrew Black Knight;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;flat.which i can stand in a good barleywine..but flat out terrible as well..this was the last one i tried on a 5 or 6 beer sampler...i was saving it for last because all of the others tasted like infected sugar water..all exactly the same,sour nonsense...as a fan of big beers i didnt think a barley wine could be so bad i could not drink it...it was the worst of all..undrinkable...tasted exactly like SOY SAUCE...i could have made a freakin stir fry with this stuff
Gettysbrew Black Knight;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;Belive it or not I couldn't honestly tell this supposed barleywine from the bitter, no distingushable barleywine qualities whatsoever, not an ounce of malt in the flavors & body, watery, bland, undercarbonated, flat, sour, very undrinkable, just plain awful

Reddish amber color with a beige head that might lace. Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Spicey hop flavor, but the malt doesn’t show up immediately. Rich malt when it does. Seems a bit rough, but that might be the hop. The finish is arguably balanced, fairly dry, and has a citrus/fruit flavor tagging along.
Elk Grove Wrangler Red Ale;Elk Grove, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Elk Grove Brewery;Huge amount of haze (chill haze?) make this beer, well, not a real looker. Light cookie and clover aroma that doesn’t exude much. Very dry flavor with a prominent hop bite. Flavors/aromas from the hops are restricted to a candy-like apricot jam riff. Some notes from the yeast--some funky, farmy yeast flavors in the background, intended or not.
Elk Grove Sloughhouse Pale Ale;Elk Grove, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elk Grove Brewery;~3.5 Pours a cloudy golden color with white head. ~Sweet, clean hop scent.

Elk Grove Grain Barrel Stout;Elk Grove, California, United States;Stout;Elk Grove Brewery;"Very dark brown color with a head that never arrived. Toasted malt aroma with a hint of plum (actually looks a bit like prune juice). Rather thin in body with creamy carbonation. Toasted malt with a fair amount of bitter; possibly a hint of smoke. Very good combination. The finish is toasty dry and seems to have hop bitter as well as burnt toast bitter."
Elk Grove Grain Barrel Stout;Elk Grove, California, United States;Stout;Elk Grove Brewery;Deep brown-black. Minimal head. Malted milk, dark-chocolate aroma. Strongly roasted, leaning towards smoky flavor, with plenty of bitter roast. Carbonation is a bit strong and leads to a slightly acrid acidity in conjunction with the smoky notes. Otherwise a perfectly acceptable brewpub stout.

Elk Grove Winter Warmer Porter;Elk Grove, California, United States;Porter - Imperial;Elk Grove Brewery;16 ounce sample on tap at the brewpub. Aroma is a bit faint, sweet, fruity, with some mild anise presence. Some coffee is detected in there, too. Aroma could definitely be more assertive. Mostly opaque black/dark brown body with a small, weak tan head with below-average lacing present. Starts off sweet, sugary, and chocolatey. Becomes more roasted with more chocolate and a bit of coffee in the middle. Some metallic hop flavors later. Very nice. Balanced, drinkable, and very flavorful. An enjoyable brew! Wish the aroma was more present, though.

Downtown Joes Ace High Pale Ale;Napa, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;I visited Downtown Joe’s many times during a recent 5-night stay in Napa on vacation from England. I switched to this from Tail Waggin’ in the misguided belief that it was lower in alcohol. It certainly tasted lighter and had more of an English light ale feel. I am certain the great atmosphere in the bar also aided consumption but I woud happily drink this anywhere.

Downtown Joes Tail Waggin Amber Ale;Napa, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber color with a khaki head that settles into a ring and laces the glass. Notes of mildew, sweat, wet leaves, nuts, wet grass, and faint toast. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a bitter, earthy moutheel. Not as mineralic as the others, but also more foul in other ways. Had an old, damp quality that was so unappealing. Also was listed as ""Tail Waggin’ West Coast Bitter"" - is it intended to be an amber ale or an English bitter? It’s that same lack of attention to detail that characterizes the beers."

Downtown Joes Old Magnolia Oatmeal Stout;Napa, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Pours a dark opaque brown with a very creamy Irish coffee foam head. The head retains well. A gorgeous beer to covet as it sits, untouched on a weathered oak bar. Creamy foam coats the glass. Iced mocha aroma.

Great Bear Gold;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the Great Bear. Nice aroma of grains. Golden with a small white head.

Great Bear Gold;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Bear Brewing Company;20-Jan-08 (Draft: Great Bear Brewing Co. in Wasilla, AK) An aroma of soured fruits provides a poor first impression, but an accurate one. Soured fruits are also evident in the flavor, along with sweet grains and some corn. Almost no hop flavor or bitterness. Light-medium in body with light carbonation. Light-golden color, somewhat hazy, and the small, white head quickly fades away to a thin ring. Though on tap at the brewery, the perception of soured fruits obviously make me question the freshness of this beer. It is wintertime in Alaska after all, and dark beers rule up here, and this beer is targeted for people just getting started with craft beer.
Great Bear Gold;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Bear Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub in Wasilla, Ak. Light gold in appearance, thin white head. Aroma, nondescrpt, a bit of fresh lake water perhaps. Flavor has a bit of honey sweetness to it with a touch of mown grass. Decent mouthfeel. Refreshing, but not all that flavorful. Brewed for the masses.
Great Bear Black Beary Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Bear Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub in Wasilla, Ak. Very good for a brewpub fruit beer. Cloudy, murky light orange appearance. Sweet blackberry aroma is enticing and carries over to the flavor. Surprisingly, very natural is the flavor in its sweetness. Very good creamy mouthfeel. A well done Fruit beer by a brewpub.
Great Bear Wasilla Wheat Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Bear Brewing Company;20-Jan-08 (Draft: Great Bear Brewing Co. in Wasilla, AK) Lots of flavor to this usually dull style of beer. Lightly sweet, wheaty flavor with a slightly fruity character, but balanced by gently bitter hops. Medium in body, so not your thin watery American wheat beer. Sweet, wheaty aroma. Dark straw to pale golden in color with medium haze. Small whitish head settles to a wispy layer. Overall, for a boring style of beer, this is solid. It has good body and lots of flavor, and the balancing use of hops really sets this beer apart from its peers.
Great Bear Wasilla Wheat Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a lightly hazy golden yellow with a small almost none existant head. Aroma of wheat, some banana/clove and citrus. Flavors of teh same...want more hops in my American Wheats.

Great Bear Big Su Strong Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Bear Brewing Company;Nice stuff here, this is what I drink whenever I am visiting Wasilla, if they happen to have it on tap, Im drinking it.

Stoney Creek Cherry Stout;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Stout;Stoney Creek Breweries;2003 bottle, drunk in november 04. like clark mentions, looks like cherry cola. smells like tart cherries and chocolate truffles--more balanced, less one-dimensional than bell’s cherry stout. lightly stale and astringent finish, but overall not too bad.
Stoney Creek Cherry Stout;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Stout;Stoney Creek Breweries;Dark chestnut brown, black with plenty of bubbles. Looks like cherry cola. Decent off white head. Smells like tart cherries and has an interesting sour smell on the nose. Right away the tart cherries come out. I am glad that it is not too sweet, I am not glad that there is very little else here other than tart cherries. Finishes with a dry nothingness that is reminiscent of club soda. I think they were so concerned with not making a cloying cherry beer, that they forgot to also make it something other than not cloying. Way too carbonated for a stout.
Stoney Creek Cherry Stout;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Stout;Stoney Creek Breweries;Sampled this at the Polar Beer Fest. I knew from the start this was a tough one. It has an off smell that is reminiscent of vinegar. Taste is very acidic, with the tartness seeming to come from anything but cherries. There is no balance at all to this. Not a great effort.
Stoney Creek Cherry Stout;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Stout;Stoney Creek Breweries;(Draft)Great, Great, Great. This is one of two winter seasonals that they have on tap. The beer has a nice this head, subtle cherry nose with a slight tart cherry finish. Not as overpowering as many other fruit beers and the brewer said it will get better with time. If you are near Detroit, you have to drive over to try it before it is gone.
Stoney Creek Winter Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stoney Creek Breweries;draft at brewery.lovely orange with a light thin head. unspectacular aroma, mostly of caramel malt and some fruity esters. fascinating flavor though, not quite a barley wine but not really an american strong ale. lots of fruitiness that nicely complements the malt--perhaps a barleywine using a belgian yeast? or a regular yeast strain fermented higher than normal? it’s like there are some side-effect flavors, but they seem to belong perfectly! either way it’s a very warming drink, one that i will most definitely drink again! probably the best beer that stoney creek puts out.
Back Road Christmas Ale 2002;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Porter - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Interesting aroma, a combination of vanilla and chocolate and undertones of some spice. Very dark, almost a black beer. This beer lack some balance and heavy of the vanilla malt taste and while there is a noticeable hop presence, it doesn't match up evenly. Bitter on the aftertaste.
Back Road Christmas Ale 2002;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Porter - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Overload on the black and possibly chocolate malts in combination with a lot of bitterness. Just not groovin', not smooth at all. Needs more rounded characteristics and more definition of exactly what this beer is supposed to be.
Klosterbräu Schwärzla Bock;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Klosterbräu Bamberg (Kaiserdom);Draught @ Klosterbraü, Bamberg. Pours deep amber with a White head. Dark fruit, caramel , fudge and intense metal slash iron. Poor, industrial and artificial.

Skol Super;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Malt Liquor;Carlsberg UK;This lager tastes like it’s weaker sibling but with balls and a hairy chest. Right amount of gas and bubbles and unsurprising yellowish lager look. A couple of good gulps in and I’m quite happy with the strong beery taste. I’m getting stale bread and booze on the tongue followed by cola bottles soaked in sherry. I Like this stuff a lot.
Skol Super;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Malt Liquor;Carlsberg UK;I’m rating this to avoid having to drink another Malt liquor to get the style. I had a warm can of this when I was 14. It took about 5 or 6 big swigs to finish (which I alternated with swigs of pineapple and grapefruit Lilt to avoid vomiting). I kept it down long enough to have a smoke and stare into the distance for a few seconds. On the way down it tasted like old ox tail soup and kerosene, on the way up it tasted the same... except totally tropical for some reason.
Skol Super;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Malt Liquor;Carlsberg UK;Can from a little off-licence in Blackwater, Hampshire, who appears to specialise in tramp juice. Fruit yeast lager aroma, with a hint of booze. Bright gold. Initially, at least, the white head is big and foamy. Slow bubbles. Sweet. Saccharine, syrup. There is some boozey bitterness into the finish. Medium bodied. A tad sticky. Soft carbonation. Astringent but abrupt finish. When I took a look at the case I wondered who’d want to drink the advertised ’half litre’. Turns out it’s me. Not a good beer but goes down easily, tramp alcopop.

Chilled but still not cold enough to make it drinkable.
Skol Super;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Malt Liquor;Carlsberg UK;500ml can (Corner Shop, Denham) at 8% Sweet almondy aroma, classic ESL. Paleish, but the head is reasonably persistent. Light palate, covers the alcohol, softish. Sweetish malts, almond, fruity esters, remarkably clean. Finish has a bitter bite, a little metallic. Still fruity. Pretty drinkable, to be honest. Side by side with the previous 2 modern kraft IPAs, I’d chose this, to be honest. Nice clean ESL.

Ørbæk Half & Half;Ørbæk, Denmark;Porter;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Courtesy of Acertain. Thank you, Andrew. The aroma is very malted milk ball with a punch of cocoa, chocolate and dishes fresh from the washer with a hint of soap still on them. The body is a ruddy dark brown and holds a diminishing tan head. Caramel, cocoa and lots of malt powder with a fairly bitter hop/roast kick in the finish. It gets a little metallic twang in the far finish. The defining feature is however the chocolate/cocoa malted milk ball notes. The mouth feel is on the thin side, but not terribly so.
Ørbæk Half & Half;Ørbæk, Denmark;Porter;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Bottle at ÅBF08. Mild roasted aroma. Clear dark brown colour. Roasted flavour, some barley bitterness.
Ørbæk Half & Half;Ørbæk, Denmark;Porter;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Sample at Aarhus beerfestival. Nice head with good duration. Color is dark brown. Aroma and taste are malt and hops with notes of coffee.
Ørbæk Half & Half;Ørbæk, Denmark;Porter;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Aarhus, DK Bottled Coffee and chocolate aroma. Flavor is with balanced sweetness to the dryness of the roasted malts
Ørbæk Half & Half;Ørbæk, Denmark;Porter;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Black with medium beige head.Aroma of rosted malt and coffee,feels mild and smooth a littel thin with a smokey finish.
Ørbæk Half & Half;Ørbæk, Denmark;Porter;Ørbæk Bryggeri;33cl bottle. Pours black with a brown head. Smooth caramel roast & liquirice. Light sweet & smooth - a bit of a weak body though. Low carbonation. Dominating sweetness. Mediocre all around - typical ørbæk!
Ørbæk Half & Half;Ørbæk, Denmark;Porter;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Dark amber with no head. Roasted malt, coffee and caramel hits the nose. Flavor is rather sweet with roasted malt and caramel. Finishes light bitter.
Ørbæk Half & Half;Ørbæk, Denmark;Porter;Ørbæk Bryggeri;[Sampled in 2005.] Funny mix of a porter and a pilsner. Despite its ABV it’s a bit watery. Notes of smoke, smoothness, roast and a flat finish.
Brew Brothers Prairie Berry Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);GCBF. Poured a pale pink, like a cider. Loose, tall head with more pink. Pink pink pink. Aroma was a bit cloying and sweet. A bit of hops aroma came through, but seemed out of place. Mouthfeel was ok, but beer seemed overcarbed with a bit of acid bite to the back of the tongue. Flavour was a bit disjointed. Some nice malts singing backup, but a weird berry taste that I definitely do not associate with saskatoon berries (which I love) literally jammed up the taste. It was that ambiguous berry flavour that is all sweet and no berry that you find in blue drinks. I was pretty disappointed. Hops? there was hops in here?
Brew Brothers Prairie Berry Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Hazy pink colour. Light flavour - only a vague hint of fruit. A quick, light and bland beer...disappointing as I was hoping to sort out what Saskatoon berries taste like.
Brew Brothers Prairie Berry Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);(1 ltr bottle) Pours a medium, white, non-dissipating head and an amber body. Nose of berry and slightly metallic. Artificial Saskatoon berry flavour - too jammy and sweet? Slight malt finish. Above average.
Brew Brothers Prairie Berry Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Big blue 1L bottle. Very loud pop announced to the office that it was beer time. A small rush of foam and all was quiet. Big head of medium bubbles quickly settles. Fruity berry aroma, smells like fruit jelly. Thin light brown colour. Reminds me of a heather ale. The fruit does not overpower the beer. Don't swallow too quickly to let the berry flavour fill your taste buds. Very little hop or malt. Almost no aftertaste. A refreshing change and probably very nice on a hot summer day. The berry flavour gets stronger as you drink.
Brew Brothers Prairie Berry Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);aroma of berries, fruity, light and pleasant. Pours a copper brown with a slight reddish tinge. Head starts off thick but quickly disappears. Carbonation low. Overall delivery is flat. Hops weak, although the berry taste comes out a bit at the end. Better than most fruit beers I've had. At least this has some alcohol.
Helden Bräu Super;Glasgow, Scotland;Pilsener - Imperial;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);Can from Arden Wines- now brewed at 7.4% and distributed by InBev UK. Looks like I’m the first rater to have stumbled on this filth for EIGHT years. Jesus, I’m desperate tonight. Gold with a fat white head falling to a slick. Aroma of rotting apples, grass cuttings, a sprinkle of acetone. Tastes EXACTLY like flying saucers, apple Chewits and sherbet-sprinkled paper. Which is a relief. Tempted to drink, but won’t be doing so.
Helden Bräu Super;Glasgow, Scotland;Pilsener - Imperial;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);Pours copper clear, sudsy medium white head. OK retention. Strong skunky smell opening the can. Slight fruity malt smell after left for a few minutes. Touch of alcohol in the nose too. Thin watery mouthfeel. Terrible skunky malt flavour. Dont know how to describe it, just overwhelming crap taste! Alcohol very present in the aftertaste. Terrible stuff. I think I'll avoid Sköl Super after others comments. I can feel a headache coming on after this one.
Helden Bräu Super;Glasgow, Scotland;Pilsener - Imperial;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);Dark gold amber clear, medium size moderate lasting head. Very faint but not unpleasant fruity malty aroma when cool tending to bandaid when warmed. Medium thin body. Antiseptic and near-breath-taking alcoholic tasting start. Rank malt and stale hops can't cover the alcohol thereafter. Better than Sköl? Perhaps . . .
Helden Bräu Super;Glasgow, Scotland;Pilsener - Imperial;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);Less offensive smell than Sköl Super but same pure alcohol taste. Thinner as well (might as well be paint thinner). Obviously intended for soccer hooligans only. Never again.
Real Ale Coffee Porter;Blanco, Texas, United States;Porter - Flavored;Real Ale Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Pours dark brown with a light beige head. Coffee aroma. Taste is coffee, roasted malt, chocolate notes. Nice one.
Real Ale Coffee Porter;Blanco, Texas, United States;Porter - Flavored;Real Ale Brewing Company;"Aroma: rich and roasty, coffee; Appearance: very dark amber pour with creamy offwhite head; Taste: follows nose with a slight offnote from malt; Overall: a solid porter."
Real Ale Coffee Porter;Blanco, Texas, United States;Porter - Flavored;Real Ale Brewing Company;Look forward to this every year. Perfect porter for the fall. Coffee up front but almost an equal amount of cocoa flavor is good balance. Mid-level alcohol is well hidden behind subtle flavors. Real Ale is quietly one of the best overall breweries in Texas, certainly a cut above Karbach, Deep Ellum, and St. Arnold’s.
Real Ale Coffee Porter;Blanco, Texas, United States;Porter - Flavored;Real Ale Brewing Company;Originally rated on 1/18/09. Tried this today at Opal Devines in Austin, A deep black body with a thin light tan cap that left fair lace. Aroma and flavors of coffee, roasted malts and nuts, a little sweet.

Snake River Locs Brau;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Strong Ale - American;Snake River Brewing Co.;Very easy drinking strong ale. Crisp, with nice dry hopping, but has some hop on the finish as well. Session 8%er?
Snake River Locs Brau;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Strong Ale - American;Snake River Brewing Co.;"Amber-apricot in color. Malty (bready) and smooth on the palate (not watery). Mild in flavor, but really well made and nicely balanced. Alcohol is hidden unbelievably well; it's barely noticeable at all. Very enjoyable to drink."
Snake River Locs Brau;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Strong Ale - American;Snake River Brewing Co.;Draught. Body is hazy dark yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted bread, cookie), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, resin, pine, herbs), lightly yeasty (dough). Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Decent, nice flavor balance.
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);On draught in Jeju. Copper colour and low to medium carbonation. No aroma and very little taste. Some caramel, syrup and rice. No noticeable hop flavour. Very poor.
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);On tap, clear amber, medium head and nice lacing. Aroma of macro lager malts, flat. Tastes medium bitter, strong corn syrup and rice, not much more. Struggling with this.
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);On tap at Hollywood in Itaewon next door to Reilley’s Taphouse (they also have an ok tap selection). It poured more copper than gold but still had lots of hay in the aroma/flavor due to the probable use of adjuncts but had some caramel.
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);"0.33l bottle. Nice one! A non-pale lager in Korea? Amazing.. Anyhow, this is a clear deep deep red beer with a small quickly fading off-white head that sticks nicely to the sides of the glass. The aroma has a mild burned and sweet touch over it. A bit of sour dark malts here as well. Not extreme, but it’s nice with something a bit different from the lagers. The carbonation level is average to soft and it has a thin and quite watery mouthfeel. Tastes alright I guess. Think this is a old bottle (not that it’s easy for me to read Korean) A bit ""old"" flavors. It’s light dark malty with caramel hints. Low on the bitterness and it ends mildly mouthdrying. All in all, drinkable and one of the better I’ve had so far here in Korea."
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);the best beer in korea. not saying alot, but i always viewed this as the premium beer. drank it on payday only. a reddish lager, slightly malty flavor. like a watered down Killians
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);Lyckas väcka sinnena ur sin djupa slummer genom att milt ruska om med sin väna alkoholstyrka. Inget för historieböckerna, ej heller för de riktigt kräsna finsmakarna, men Red Rock får livet att kännas en smula lättare. Bra så.
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);the best beer commonly available in the area of Korea that I lived.....and that’s sad.
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);draft - hmmm... this beer rises to the level of somewhat below average. Wow! That’s high praise for this brewery. It’s light amber with a quickly fading head and a mild lightly roasted malt aroma. The flavor is toasted caramel malt and not much else. At least it’s drinkable and has more flavor than their pale lagers.
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);Bottle. The very best beer I tasted in Korea! Red-brown colour. Aroma of toasted malts and and hops, which very much appears stronger in the flavour along with some caramel and good bitterness. Nice aftertaste indeed.
Red Rock;Seoul, South Korea;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);On Tap - The best Korean beer I had while stationed there for a year. Good reddish color with decent head. Was representative of a Killians-style beer, but not as good in taste or appearance.
TwoRows Southpark Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Deep and dark in color. There was minimal head, but it was darker than I expected going into the political nature of the polcies against the White House. There was some maple syrup, brown sugar in both the aroma and the flavor. there was also some vingarey flavors that kind of ruined the climbing stage.
TwoRows Southpark Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;had day of the FA cup incident.... Pours a dark brown/black....has some good constant coco foam....some roasted cocoa / alcohol aroma....is quite smooth for a imp stout....whew! alcohol is very upfront, warming brew...a good imp stout but they need to bottle it so i can let it rest for a few years!!
TwoRows Southpark Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Fresh out of the vat. Poured a dark black with a tan head. Aroma is malty and chocolate. Taste is chocolate and filled with coffe notes and caramel.
TwoRows Southpark Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at two rows in H town. Had no head at all, black body. Weak vinous/fruity aroma. Taste was kinda spicy and burnt. Had some bitterness to it as well. I did not like drinking this, wish it had some more carbonation. And yeah, the alcohol is very present. But hey, they said they were charging $3.75 for it, but they ended up only charging a buck! I still dont think id try it again, well, unless its only a dollar.
TwoRows Southpark Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Slightly smoky with a mild chocolate finish. Crisp and light throughout, but the alcohol detracts rather than adds to the experience. Refreshing, nonetheless.
TwoRows Southpark Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;The Dallas two rows puts out an imperial that was far superior to this one. Matt is right in that the strength was obvious, but not at all in a good way. Mouthfeel was very sudsy, just a run of the mill imperial lacking character with a slight cardboard finish.
TwoRows Southpark Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;I thought this was great. The only drawback was that you could really taste how strong it was. It was not disguised well. Small, brown head. Aroma similar to palate, very strong. Initial taste was very powerful, strong, and bitter. It got better after the initial shock. Very interesting beer from this place.
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours an amber body with an off white head.

Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;"Bottle. Pours slightly opaque amber with a thin effervscent head. Aroma is mild but hints towards berries and honey-butter. Flavor is sweetly subtle; fruity sweet, honey-butter, and slightly citric. Palate is inoffensive."
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;caramel colored and flavored with a hint of German style hop. clear with short white head the beer is lightly sweet with malt. it is refreshing and does lose its carbonaton after a couple of minutes out of the bottle. i got an alcohol flavor like bourbon or better yet rye at first taste.
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;Bottle from Capone’s. Pours clear deep coppery brownish, with ruby edges. Nose is caramel malt, brown sugar, vinous fruit. Tastes caramel malty, with vinous fruit notes. Medium palate heft, with a bit of a lack of balance and complexity. Not a repeater for me.
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from a variety six pack from EZ Liquors. Pours a clear red orange with a small off white foamy head that quickly disipates. Aroma of vegtables, old corn, musty basement and wet leather. Medium bodied with average carbonation and a smooth watery finish. Flavor of some amber malts, watered down caramel, and biscuit. This beer sure won’t knock your socks off, well maybe the aroma will now that I think about it.
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;I like this beer. Not too heavy. Light enough to drink more than just a few. I`m tired of all those micro over flavored beers. This is a good beer for those who want more than a light beer and less than a heavy micro.
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;No head, just white ring. Body is watered tea, yellow w/ orange and some brown. Aroma is sour, sugary, some toffee and cherries maybe. Taste is a little watery too with cherries and caramel. Aftertaste is skunky. My friend said it reminded him of a certain southern area of a woman.
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;The color is light brown and a bit hazy. The beer has a nice aroma. Vert lightly carbonated. It is an easy, simple beer to drink.
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;a rather underwhelming beer. cloudy w/ little head. citrusy and sweet, but very lacking in malt profile for a amber lager.
Bucks County PennBrook Traditional Amber Lager;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;River Horse Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with hopdog, thanks Steve!) Amber lager? Who are they trying to fool? Pours medium yellow in color with a small, white head that quickly shrinks to a partial sheen. Lightly sweet aroma is totally overrun by wet cardboard, so the nose is pretty unpleasant. The very same cardboard also dominates the lightly sweet flavor, as I really can’t identify any malt or hops at work here. And wow, the watery, cardboard finish is really terrible. This is just bad stuff. And I’m surprised because they call it an amber lager. I never imagined it would be a pale lager, and a bad one at that. This really gives macro swill a run for it’s money.
Flying Bison Bird of Prey IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;on draft, good amber color with decent big fluffy head, nose is very aromatic hop. flavor is overpowering hops, slightly unbalanced, odd finish. Nice beer but needs some work

Flying Bison Bird of Prey IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Draught at the Blue Dog in Chalfont. Clear golden-copper body with a sudsy white head. Aroma and flavor of fruit, chalky malts, weak black tea, and wood stems. Medium bitterness and some undesired sweet residual malt notes. Mild, but noticeable acidity. A remedial East Coast IPA.
Flying Bison Bird of Prey IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Draft at the Grey Lodge in Philly. Nice IPA. Along the bitter style. Godd have been a little more balanced.
Flying Bison Bird of Prey IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Dark golden ale with a thin white head. Strong diacetyl aroma, overpowers the hops. In mouth, caramelly hops with rather flat character, lingering with some nutty notes and a oily mouthfeel. Bizarre Ipa. On tap at the CNY Brewfest 2006.
Flying Bison Bird of Prey IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;An average English style IPA. Nice blend of hops, just no epiphanies here. Sampled with a back of Wild Turkey Rye Whiskey.
Flying Bison Bird of Prey IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Very smooth IPA with a daker golden brown color. The aroma smells alittle skunky at first but then blends nicely into the flavor of the beer the more you drink. This is my first beer from flying bison brewery and I am impressed. I think IPA’s are one of the most challenging to brew and since its brewed in my hometown, Im excited to try other beers from flying bison.
Flying Bison Bird of Prey IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Floral and citrus aroma, while being deep amber with a medium head. Smells delicious, and tastes like a cross between an English and American IPA.
Flying Bison Bird of Prey IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Medium amber color, almost a light brown, cream color head. Bigger floral hop aroma, nice malt backbone. Flavor was little buttery, good dose of hops. Medium body, bitter finish. Nice English style IPA.

Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Hell;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5%. Crystal clear gold. Nice-sized head, OK duration. Grassy, corny, and slightly spicy aroma! Low-moderate carbonation, just right for the style. Grassy, tad lemony, earthy hops. Slight mineral aspect. Slight spiciness too! Malt adding sweetness and body but otherwise keeping well out of the way, and I think the beer is all the better for it. One of the better Helles I've had, although I wouldn't go so far as to say the best (that'd be Ayinger's). Sweet, but keeps the sweetness nice and light instead of getting bogged down - a real roof of the mouth beer. That's how I like this style. Some Heineken influence perhaps, and worth comparing to their Munchner Gold. If anything this might be better.
Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Hell;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Clear golden with a frothy head. Hoppy, metallic smell. Malty taste, unfortunately with a lack of body. Low carbonation.

Hazy amber, low, ugly, unstable, white head, not too much lacing. Aroma malty, roasty, bready, caramel, a little bit of nuts. Taste thick, smooth,roasty rather sweet. Carbonation high, definitely tingling, a bit too high. Bitterness medium, roasty, a tad herbal, nice. Aftertaste bready, roasty, caramel, a hint of nuts. Nice.
Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Hell;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle in 2016. Clear mid golden with a white head. Bready malt, straw and floral hop aroma. Decent enough lager, but pretty simple.

Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Hell;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml flip-top bottle (thanks Viil). Clear golden color. Medium size, white head, stays. Grainy, sweet, fizzy, sugary in aroma/taste. Drinkable brew.
Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Hell;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Pours a clear, golden coloration with a medium, foamy head and slightly visible carbonation. Smells of doughy, slightly bready malt and grassy, herbal hops. Taste is a great balance of doughy and slightly bready, grainy malt and grassy, herbal hops, with just a hint of citrus coming through as well. Finishes with a light/medium bitterness and some grassy, herbal hops lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/high carbonation. Perhaps not too exciting, but a very well-balanced, refreshing and highly drinkable Helles that starts out a little sweet, but gets balanced in the finish by a decent bitterness. Still a little too sweet and also overly carbonated for my personal taste, but a very nice example of the style nonetheless.
Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Hell;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bottled at 5.0% ABV. Clearest straw yellow, tall fluffy white head. Good lacing. Aroma: clean malt, light fruitiness, hoppy hints. Light plus body. Average to lively carbonation. Taste: fairly clean, malty, crisp, sweetish. Some bread. Restraint hop. Low plus bitterness. Well-drinkable but not a favourite of mine.

Custom Brewcrafters Double Dark Cream Porter;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Porter;Custom Brewcrafters;"Pours a syrupy black with a generous tan head. The aroma of this beer was quite nice, and it promises a lot... Lots of roast, some creamy caramel, some floral hops. But the promises quickly become forgotten when you take the first sip. Yes, there is some roast. Yes, there is some creamy mouthfeel (which is actually the highlight of this beer). But this could be so much better... Where’s the chocolate? Where’s the hop bite? Where’s the warming alcohol? They may call this ""Double Dark"", but there is nothing ""double"" about this beer. It is simply average at best. Would not buy again."

Custom Brewcrafters Double Dark Cream Porter;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Porter;Custom Brewcrafters;My wife brought this one back from a trip to Rochester. +++ Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a black color with an enormous foamy brown head that lingered and left good lacing. The aroma was toasty malts, malted milk and cocoa. The flavor was bitter, dryish and roasty with notes of nut, cocoa, coffee and malted milk. The finish was long, dry and roasty with lingering coffee and malted milk. Medium body. Too dry for my liking but decent anyway.

Head: Minimal tan head that dissipates almost instantly. Color: Deep brown/cola, not transparent. Aroma: Noticable chocolate coffee malt. Taste: Bitter Roasted, dark chocolate. Watery texture (not syrupy) Finish: Lightly roasted taste on the back of the throat. Lingers but at no point is overly strong. Overall impression. Mildly bitter, but easy to drink.

Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);The only reason I rated this beer so high is the fact that it has been discontinued and I actually liked it. Anyone who recently rated it probably had a super old batch
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);(bottle) pours orange brown with a lingering head. the sweet malt flavor, watery palate and moderate carbonation reminded us of dr. pepper. i wasn’t too keen on the initial aroma (boozey) but after a few sips it blends with the palate. it has an interesting flavor and a smooth taste. would make a decent session beer but may be too sweet for some. in general, i think southern tier has better.
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Poured dark orange with virtually no head. I thought maybe it wa sflat when I opened it hoever, it was carbonated. Mostly malt aroma with hints of caramel. Flavor is all malt. Nice body. A pretty good beer and a nice example of a mild.
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);"Hazy light amber with a small white head. Aroma of freshly cracked malt with some caramel. Flavor is malty, with just a slight spicy bitterness in the finish. A great session brew, in a vastly under-appreciated style. Unfortunately, this is being discontinued for the time being due to lack of interest. Seems manly men don’t like drinking a beer with ""mild"" in the name. I guess I’m not a manly man."
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);This is a pretty good beer. Goes down really smooth, great back yard, by the pool kinda brew.
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);(12 oz bottle, obtained in trade with shadey, thanks Shane!) Another American mild ale that isn’t close to style. Unfortunately, not only is this one not to style (a fact which never impacts my ratings), it’s also pretty bland and boring (which DOES!). The light, delicate nose has a mild, sweet melon aroma. And the flavor is also lightly melony, with some gently bitter hops in the mix. But because the malt is so light, the mild hoppiness is modestly dominant. Light in body, but doesn’t seem watery. Light amber in color. Smallish off-white head maintains a thin layer and leaves some patches of lace on the glass. I don’t care that this isn’t to style, but I do care that it’s a boring beer. Blah.
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);A nice mild beer. Could have used a little more flavor to it, but the flavor that is there is still good. Overall this is another good beer from Southern Tier.
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Golden pour with a big, creamy, white head. Aroma of corn flakes, hops, florals. Tastes like liquid corn flakes with a hoppy, fruity finish. Smooth as silk, well balanced, and up there with FFF Pride and Joy as the best mild ales I’ve ever had. Just astounding.
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Hazy Orange, no head. Aroma of Orange marmalade and honey. Slight honey flavor a, some mild pine hop notes, as well some citrus flavors. A hint of sweet, then a dry finish. Very tasty. Thanks to Springslicker for this one!
Southern Tier Mild Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);I really enjoyed this beer. I’ve only tried about six milds. This would fall in the middle of the pack... my favorite of the style being Moorhouse Black Cat . This is a very light, refreshing amber ale. Small, fizzy, off-white head. Crisp, clean aroma and perfectly balanced flavor. Notes of iced-tea and straw in both. Light-bodied and watery with fizzy carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish. Perfect with food, much like a Vienna... only better as it’s an ale. Thanks to springslicker for the bottle.

Hanby Rainbow Chaser;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Feb 2009: Brown 500ml bottle, poured into a UK pint sleeve glass. The rear label asked for the beer to be served cool, it was. Light amber, dull gold in colour with a good firm foaming off-white head. Pioneer Hops and White Malts are used in the brew and the hops could clearly be found in the fairly sweetish aroma, my nose isn’t good enough to pick out individual types of hops, even if I knew them! Bitter and refreshing, tangy and tart, but not dry or coy. A true English Bitter in every sense. Good hop retension in the mouthfeel, the bitterness from them obviously stays too. This is a well balanced beer and one I’d love to try on cask one day (soon).
Hanby Rainbow Chaser;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Handpulled cask at JDW Stanmore. Amber with a white head. Malty with good balancing complex hoppiness.

Hanby Rainbow Chaser;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;A pretty standard British golden ale, with grassy aroma, flavoured with some floral-fruity notes and ending up in a weak dry, bitter finish. Watered palate (Cask at GBBF, 08.08.2008).
Hanby Rainbow Chaser;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Had it at GBBF 2008. It was very malty indeed I liked it’s grains taste. NOt boring and very drinkable.
Hanby Rainbow Chaser;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Bottle, Barleycorns, Nantwich. A summer drink for a summer that is yet to quite ignite. Poured a golden colour with a thinnish white head. Malty, sweet aroma. Some fruit and hop present in the flavour which again is a bit on the sweet side. Easy drinking. Quite enjoyed this.
Hanby Rainbow Chaser;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Bottled. Reddish amber, white halo. Doesn’t look real. Sickly buttery toffee aroma with musty ganja-ish hops struggling to poke through. Caramel and green nettley hop, bit of citrus.

Rock Bottom Westminster Honey Brown;Westminster, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Westminster;"Found some strange flavors in this beer; not necessarily all bad, but peculiar. Sweet, unfermented honey, zingy herbs and a big lemony flavor that I didn't expect. Somewhat thin-bodied. Yeast only plays a minor role."
Kraftbrau Dunkelweizen;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kraftbrau Brewery;I found this beer to have a fairly good, smooth, mild flavor with a sweet aroma.
Kraftbrau Dunkelweizen;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kraftbrau Brewery;Good head of fine bubbles and a nice malty aroma. It's body is a dark brown almost non-transparent color. Its head fades fast but leaves a nice lacing. It had an initial caramel taste with a slight aftertaste and a smooth initial taste that starts out strongly then fades leaving an aftertaste on the roof of your mouth.
Kraftbrau Dunkelweizen;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kraftbrau Brewery;Swet, malty aroma. Smokiness in there as well with some roasted malts. Not as much wheat characteristic as expected, but a smooth brew nevertheless. We visited this brewery across the street from Bell's and were impressed with its charming atmosphere. I am eager to try the 6-pack of brews we obtained at this brewery!
Bootleggers Canadian Goose Pale Ale;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Bootleggers Brewpub;"Water is more aromatic than this. Did the ""brewer"" forget to add finishing hops? Slightly darker than their blonde. Light copper/gold transparent color with white head. Start is medicinally bitter with mild mild mild hops. Lactic, astringent, and watery"
Bootleggers Cardinal Red Ale;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Bootleggers Brewpub;Very dark red with a white foamy head. Vdery carbonated and fizzy. Decent, but not great
Bootleggers Cardinal Red Ale;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Bootleggers Brewpub;Very mildly mild mild sweet aroma in this guy with hints of sourness.

Bootleggers Cardinal Red Ale;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Bootleggers Brewpub;"A BEERLOVER'S APOCALYPSE PART 2: THE IRISH VALIANTLY TRY TO SAVE THE DAY I walk into the establishment (fake wood outside, jutting out of a chain motel) and the first thing I see is a video game room, full of kids. Tempted to find something to play; would that I had spent an hour here rather than in the floor above! Up half a flight is the ""nightclub"" where proper dress is required (in Plattsburgh?? I'd be surprised if you could find a suit & tie in this grimy dying postindrustrial wasteland). The bp is airy and spacious, with good window views of...McDonalds, Wendys, the interstate, etc. OK. Gambling is heavily promoted here; hey if I lived here I'd be spending every penny on escapism too, and I'd rather do it in a casino than this sad travesty of a ""brewpub"". I order the sampler, the waitress just takes off before I have a chance to ask for water or anything. Slight pepperiness, malty, caramel, a bit of actual hop bite, good body. I wouldn't make a real effort to have this again, but its quite drinkable."
Bootleggers 3-Nut Brown Ale;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Bootleggers Brewpub;Tap. Poured a reddish brown with a light tan head. Smelled faintly of chocolate and nutty malts. Tasted watery, fairly bland, with a hint of chocolate and little else. Not much in the way of hops, bland. Thin mouthfeel.
Bootleggers 3-Nut Brown Ale;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Bootleggers Brewpub;Faint, sweet chocolate aroma without much else going on. Slight roastiness. Dark copper/light mahogany color with transparent light tan head. Shit, this tastes like it might be beer. I made it through 4 other samples and now I am finally detecting some crappy, albeit beer properties. Start is bitter and slightly lactic. Turns roasty with hints of chocolate. Finishes bitter and medicinal.
Bootleggers 3-Nut Brown Ale;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Bootleggers Brewpub;"A BEERLOVER'S APOCALYPSE PART 4: BROWN SUGAR-WATER I look around me. The clientele is all families; it was obvious from the menus, the conservative way the waitresses dress (the hostess is pretty cute, regardless; guess the place gets one extra point out of a hundred for that), and the decor -- 30s gangster, but ""gangster lite"" if you will. My wall is devoted to Bonnie and Clyde, with lots of cool photos, but none of their bloody dessicated corpses! C'mon don't tease us like that! My food arrives -- I can tell immediately that the chicken fingers and moxx sticks have exactly the same breading; economical, that. Potato skins taste a day old and microwaved, with fake bacon bits. Mozz is a very cheap variety, barely warmed through; fingers are dry and bland. Wings are the only saving grace, and they are quite sweet without a trace of heat, meaty, flavorful -- except I ordered ""very spicy""! Oh and the salad was lifeless and consisted of iceberg, cucumbers, pink tomatoes, onions. Caesar dressing out of a bottle. The families around me are drinking from bottles. I walk past one on my way to the bathroom. Coors Light all around. No surprise there. Extremely thin, watery and bland; a brown sugar nuttiness, the only real flavor, comes out a bit in the end; little aroma except for the ever-present cookies."
Bootleggers Rum Runners Raspberry;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bootleggers Brewpub;Raspberry purree aroma, but at least there is an aroma to this beer unlike most smaples before this. Red/pink/oragne transparent color with a small white head. Hideous. Holy shit this is medicinal. Fruity raspberry taste up front with no sweetness. Finishes very bitter, thin, and medicinal. This tastes like the Kinney Drugs brand Guaifenisin DM that I was taking last week for a cold. I wish I was still congested...
Bootleggers Rum Runners Raspberry;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bootleggers Brewpub;"A BEERLOVER'S APOCALYPSE, PART 6 AND FINALE: BLOW A BIG FAT RASPBERRY If only I had a girlfriend. Girls like wussy fruit beers, right? She (whoever she would be) would have to be patient with me on my beer-travels, she would have to be willing to serve good beer at our wedding, we'd have to have a keg or two of North Coast Old Rasputin, or McNeills Imperial maybe, if it was in the winter like now anyway. We'd have our beer cellar; our kids would be named Saison, Kriek, and Framboise (isn't that an awesome name for a girl?); we'd live on some wonderful farmland in southeastern Wisconsin where the wild yeasts amazingly mimic those of Belgium, and we'd.... One sip brings me back to reality. Oh, the color was bad enough, Kool-Aid watery pink; and the nose is all sugary raspberry jam with an uneasy underlying off vinegar; but the flavor oh my god the flavor is of the cheapest raspberry jam, hot peppers, vinegar and a smidgeon of sour milk. The absolute worst fruit beer ever, the worst beer I've had in a brewpub; if Coors didn't hold a special place in my heart, this would even challenge it for supreme worst beer of all time! I trudge out into the snow, weary from my ordeal, but a smile is on my face; I am not finished with my brewpub tour for the day -- Davidson Brothers in Glens Falls awaits, of which I have heard good stories (which indeed prove to be correct), and I cannot possibly ever duplicate this experience. I have found the worst of all brewpubs, and I have survived, to laugh and sing and write and drink another day. Rejoice!"
Bootleggers Adirondack Blueberry;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bootleggers Brewpub;Smells like a fresh batch of blueberry muffins. Tastes like someone dropped the muffisn in a bucket of water. Semi doughy and kinda fruity, but lacking substance
Bootleggers Adirondack Blueberry;Plattsburgh, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bootleggers Brewpub;"A BEERLOVER'S APOCALYPSE PART 3: BLUE IS BORING. Well after I got my beer I had to order some food; the menu was your basic TGI Fridays/Bennigans greasy lager-accompaniment fare, heavy on wings and burgers, cheapo steaks, salads that you know will be wilted and warm, etc. I go for a sampler plate, what the hell I need some artery hardening. I contemplate my beers, which the waitress could not identify; most look rather weak and clear, except the Oat Stout which is quite properly thick and well-capped by a lasting head. The rasp in particular looks scary. I'm guessing the pale one in front is the blueberry and hey I'm right! The food arrives (wings, chicken strips, fried mozz, potato skins, why am I torturing myself? because I'm masochistic enough to wonder which will be worse, food or beer?). What kind of bp has only 6 beers available, with TWO FRUIT BEERS, anyway? Very pale and clear, almost headles, faint blueberry/nilla wafer (the house nose, I guess) aroma; medium sweetness, trace of hops, canned blueberry flavor is well balanced with the limited malts, but the ingredients just aren't good. Barely tolerable."

Coachs Red River Pale Ale;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coachs Brewery;I find it hard to believe that this ale has the 3% ABV that it was entered with four years ago. What you’ve got here is a sessionable copper bodied APA. The aroma is a light, sweet caramel with some grapefruit around the edges. The caramel flavor is smoothly balanced with a grapefruit/lemon zest/pine resin bitterness. The hoppy bitterness lasts long into the finish, albeit mildly. Nice. Coach’s Restaurant & Brewery, Oklahoma City, OK
Coachs Red River Pale Ale;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coachs Brewery;Very respectable session pale. Nice hop aromas. Mild tastes of grapefruit. The fizz can have a bit too much bite to appreciate this beer.

De Clerck Bière Blanche de Péronne;Péronne, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Clerck;Aroma 5. Appearance 4. Taste 4. Palate 2. Overall 10. Lime aroma, a bit soda alike. Mainly lime taste, sugar, and a light body. A bit chemical aftertaste.
De Clerck Bière Blanche de Péronne;Péronne, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Clerck;Bottle: Big lively but vast and thicker white colored head on top of a hazy yellow colored beer. Smell lots of lemon, lemon zest, lemon soda, light soapy and hint of wheat. At first it smelled like the 0% white beers, but then a more lemon nose came through. Still not inviting at all! Taste is still a bit lemon ish, but there is a more wheaty character in the taste. Thus: lemon, lemon soda, wheat, watery and thin, not bitter but lemon lime fruity, maybe a slight lemon sour ish touch, soapy, some slight hints of grass, spices and a bit dishwater ish... Aftertaste is again lot of lemon with some plastic citron/lemon squit and grainy wheat. Low carbo, soft mouthfeel but also spicy on the tongue, low to slightly medium bodied and a more watery than creamy texture. Unfortunately this beer is pretty bad! Drainpour!
De Clerck Bière Blanche de Péronne;Péronne, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Clerck;Hmm! This hasn’t recieved much in the way of praise has it? However...I must disagree..this is super! Pale straw, typically hazy, and a great white head that lasts to the bottom of the glass. There is a sweetness noticable on the nose, but for me the dominating aroma is of orange peel (curacao,perhaps?) and a slight spiciness. Yes! it is light in body, but surely that is the whole point of white beers, they’re supposed to be refreshing, and this one does just that. Smooth, with a sharp acidity that slowly fades and is replaced with genlte spicy finish that lasts. £1.99, Booths Keswick.
De Clerck Bière Blanche de Péronne;Péronne, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Clerck;Bottle. Fucked up compared to there other stuff. Smelt like lemonade. Some subtle coriander., but otherwise just tastes like lemonade, dissapointing.
De Clerck Bière Blanche de Péronne;Péronne, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Clerck;I have a problem with De Clerck beers. They are often quite interesting, but not always for the right reasons. This is a modern Golden Summer Ale - a fashion that seems to have spread over to France. As usual there is wheat to soften and refresh, and a fragrant hop. But - as seems typical of De Clerck beers - the body is woefully thin. I mean - this is REALLY thin. The mild flavours are quite pleasant - a hint of watered down orange juice, and the slightest splash of melon, but they fail to lift the watery body. It pours nicely, with a light, frothy (but short lived) head. In fact that is the best this beer can offer - the moment of pouring. It is all downhill after that.
Red Bell Winterfest;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Had this at the First Union Center in Phila before a Wings lacrosse game. An average fest beer. Has a very faint hop taste.

Red Bell Strawberry Mansion Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Had this at the First Union Center in Phila. before a Wings lacrosse game. I got this as a sampler. Glad I did and didn't spend $5.50 for a pint of this stuff. As obxdude before me says this beer is horrible. It taste like strawberry cleaning soap. The only good thing was it did look like a wheat.
Red Bell Strawberry Mansion Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Absoutely horrible, the appearance was the best thing about this beer, it had a dark tint to the golden color with a bit of haziness & cloudiness, but you pretty much get that with any wheat beer so I guess that really doesn't count, the flavors were down-right rancid, tasted like edleberries gone bad, like the franenberries in that nasty Count Chocola cerial, had a velvty palate, not at all drinkable, very nasty & horrible
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Light Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;On tapm at brewpub (Wachovia Center). Pours a clear golden color topped by a foamy white head. A light grainy malt aroma. Flavor is mostly grainy malt with a very light hop presence. The beer lacks any real character.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Light Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Crystal clear yellow beer. Malty and crisp with maybe a bit of citrus in the finish. Not too bad, not too great.

Red Bell Philadelphia Original Light Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;A little more drinkable than the big three's light beers, light golden color, very fizzy head, no hoppy tones at all, not much by way of a malty profile either, just your basic light lager beer, but still a bit better than all the known light beers

El Toro Deuce;Morgan Hill, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;El Toro Brewing Company;Draft at Toronado. Nose is a caramel with some slight grassiness. Taste is slightly sweet. Ok but a bit too sweet for my taste. Would like for flavor/aroma hops.

El Toro Deuce;Morgan Hill, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;El Toro Brewing Company;This is a very tasty IPA. Good hop flavor with a touch of sweetness which I really like
El Toro Deuce;Morgan Hill, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;El Toro Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours clear copper with a thin light tan head of foam. The modest aroma offers up sweetness and fruity notes like citrus hard candy and a dash of cherry candy. The aroma doesn’t deliver much hoppiness but the taste sure does. I get resiny bitter hops that start out pine sap like and then climb into grapefruit and orange peel. To midway it picks up off notes of sweet cherry esters as well as some biscuit malts. These last two notes pull the IIPA apart at the seams.
El Toro Deuce;Morgan Hill, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;El Toro Brewing Company;"Bottle; poured a dark orange/caramel color with a big frothy, off white head. Aroma of caramel, alcohol, and fruit. Flavor also was fairly malty; some nice sweetness. Some earthy and fruity hops. The earthiness lingers a bit. Fairly hot for the abv. Palate had a nice finish to it. Really just ok for the style."

Willoughby Limerick Irish Export Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Had on tap at brew pub. Taste was roasted coffee and malts, with a bit of chocolate. This one was not bad.
Willoughby Limerick Irish Export Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Willoughby Brewing Co.;On tap at the Oakroom in Athens, Ohio. Not much aroma. Black, with not much head. Very chocolaty flavor.
Willoughby Limerick Irish Export Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Willoughby Brewing Co.;I do like stouts. I was very excited to see this was ready when I stopped by the brew pub this afternoon. when the beer was poured I was pretty dissappointed in thebrownish head, it was thin and dissappeared quickly. The body was a nice bold black. The aroma smelled a faintly like othe stouts I’d had in the past, nice and roasted malts. But the taste was very disappointing. The nose was bland, there was no real maltly flavor. There was a small begining of a bitter flavor....but is disapated before it should. If you stop by Willoughyby, try something else.
Willoughby Limerick Irish Export Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Black body with a deep tan head. Nice looking beer. Lots of chocolate and coffee in the nose, along with some sweet, fruity esters. This had a lot of the elements that I like in stouts: full, rich mouthcoating body, roasty flavors, assertively hopped...so why didn’t I really like this? I just didn’t think the flavors flowed together very well, plus there was just an underlying sweetness that I couldn’t shake.
Willoughby Limerick Irish Export Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Smelled slightly malty. Dark, dark head with a slight head. Tasted just like coffe, bad bad coffee. It was really undrinkable. Very watery.
Willoughby Limerick Irish Export Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Willoughby Brewing Co.;I must say, I was impressed. Black, with a good sized brown head. Deep roasted, toasty smell. Bittery something in the taste- not exactly coffee, but not exactly caramels... interesting flavor, without a doubt. One of the few Willoughby offerings that didn't seem too thin in the mouth.
Willoughby Limerick Irish Export Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Willoughby Brewing Co.;This was very creamy. Some sweetness, medium roasted malts and a short dry finish. Body was thin and unsubstantial.
Willoughby Romanov Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Willoughby Brewing Co.;"""Solid offering from this NE Ohio Brewer. Fairly tame for an imperial, but damn approachable with a very nice roasted malt profile. Still, black body with a diminishing head and a few spots of lace. Prominent coffee and roasted malt nose with hints of molasses and chocolate. Flavor follows suit with additions of black licorice, chocolate and nuts. Medium to heavy bodied, creamy and soft with a wonderful finish and aftertaste. Multiple samples of this could easily be enjoyed during a session. """
Willoughby Romanov Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Willoughby Brewing Co.;On tap at brewpub Following on the heels of a solid wheat my hopes for Willoughby this evening had me optimistic about their imperial stout. It turned out to be well made with no major flaws and some fun characteristics that would have me coming back more often if it were not such a long drive. This is probably one of their better beers overall and I wish it were on tap more than once a season. Aroma / Appearance - The deep oily black body and thin beige head were the ideal picture of an imperial stout done right. Not too heavy and not thin it flowed smoothly around the glass. Roasted coffee, vanilla, chocolate, mocha, and anise mingled into a dense array of chewy scents. Flavor / Palate - Raspberries followed by rich baker’s chocolate, licorice sticks, espresso, and hints of vanilla filled the mouth. Chewy and thick this was not cloying but balanced nicely between the lines of too thin and over the top. The finish of raisins highlighted was an all around excellent stout that was perfect for a cold snowy winter evening.
Willoughby Romanov Stout;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Black as night, great lacing. Starts off with a medium thick sweeeeeetness, turning roasted towards the middle and finishing with a nice moderate bitterness. Could have gotten syrupy, but stayed on the thin side, like all of the brewer's other beers. Flavors lingered for quite awhile afterwards.
Wild Duck Hopzilla;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wild Duck Brewery;(gabf'03) The Hopzilla sports a palate destroying 100 IBU. Ok - it's not as destroying as a Ruination, but it has a lot of hops. Lemon citrus with some fennel. Obviously trying to go for the big hop taste but lacking in some qualities.
Wild Duck Hopzilla;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wild Duck Brewery;GABF 2003: Cloudy yellow with a creamy head. Spicy pine hops in the nose. Creamy mouthfeel, starts and ends very bitter. I kept going back to this beer during the festival.

Wild Duck Hopzilla;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wild Duck Brewery;"(draught) Dull orange, very slim white head. Nose are hops, but also bit of paint varnish. taste yields hops, orangey; light-coloured malts are there but the emphasis is heavy on the hops, laced with rinds of orangezest. There is a suspicion of sugar underneath - as the juice is promessed under the orangepeel. Medium to full bodied, quite bit sticky - sugar keeps hinting even if it isn't tasted. I'm not really impressed. I expected a hopmonster OK, but this stickiness is not really wanted."
Wild Duck Hopzilla;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wild Duck Brewery;Tap @ the Bistro's Double IPA Festival. Dark golden brown with an off-white head. Dark vinous fruits with a smash of hops.
Wild Duck Hopzilla;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wild Duck Brewery;Cloudy copper color. Malty aroma. Slightly sweet. Very nice balance. Full body. More of a Barley Wine than a Double IPA. Nice beer.

Buffalo Bills Johnny Midnite Oatmeal Stout;Hayward, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Nice, rich stout. It pours dark brown with ruby tinged edges.

Great Waters Peter the Great Imperial Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Waters Brewing;On Cask: Served in a brandy goblet- Black, very black, were talking thick, stark opaque, matte black of deeper then deep, holy sh*t thats black! Nice fluffy tan head just over a finger high that takes for ever and a day to settle and at first there is a small amount of slow bubbling current about an inch below the head that creates a weird lavalamp-like motion for a good amount of time then finely just goes black like the rest of its girth. Loved looking at this thing. I could get lost in its blanktivity for hours. Smell is potently alcoholic, very whisky-like with some brandy hints, takes a bit to get through and reach some sweet molasses, maple syrup, cherry, and chocolate. Taste is quite smooth with the alcohol touching every corner in warming qualities giving mild flavors in some dark roastyness, lightly sweet chocolate and deep sweet cherry that lends some heavyness, touching in molasses and coffee. Not all that bold or rich as most Imp. Stouts that I've had. The feel is why it suffers some in the taste cuz its fluffy and airy with a medium body and not so hefty or thick as most. A fine drinker, but the alcohol makes its presense felt to much in alot of its character where it needs to be hidden more and sneaky.
Great Waters Peter the Great Imperial Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Waters Brewing;Cask at the RAF 2003: Large roasted coffee bean aroma, black with a nice tan head. . . Looks like an imperial stout. . Very dry on the palate, a good raosted flavour, slightly creamy. . . But I found no mouth feel or flavour qualities of an Imperial Stout. . . just a easy going stout here.
Great Waters Peter the Great Imperial Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Waters Brewing;Thick? No. Creamy texture with nothing really speaking to me. Some hints of smokes and roasted. Not the biggest of imperial stouts, but not all of them can be.
Great Waters Peter the Great Imperial Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Waters Brewing;They spoiled a great name for an Imperial Stout. It was so watery and thin... so boringly predictable that the name should taken away. This is no Imperial Stout. No complexity, No big mix of flavors. Thick as the oil slick???? Maybe the brewers never heard of Worldwide, Expedition, or Dark Lord!!!
Great Waters Peter the Great Imperial Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Waters Brewing;cask (RAF): Peter the Great..wasnt great..not at all in fact..it was dark and it had a tan head, but i think thats as imperial as this beer is gonna get..the aroma was very roasty with coffee notes and hints of sweat..but IMO, imperial stouts should not have an overly roasty aroma..leave that for the low gravity crap..the flavor here had some chocolate but more dominant was its peanut skin astringency and its wierd-ass bitterness that completely took my mind from what might have been subtle notes of dark fruits, chocolate, and raisin..NExt.
Great Waters Peter the Great Imperial Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Waters Brewing;"RAF. This was a pretender, not a contender. Almost watery, ""thick as the oil slick"", my sweet cheeks! No distinguishable aroma. I'm sad that they call this an imperial stout. An odd aftertaste of alcohol...but not in a good way."
Great Waters Peter the Great Imperial Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Waters Brewing;This was another thin and boring IS at the RAF. Light in color and mouthfeel. The flavor is strong, but only in the roasted characteristics. Where are all the vinuous notes in Expedition and Dark Lord? The flavor is good, but one dimensional.
Great Waters Peter the Great Imperial Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Waters Brewing;"Sweet, dark chocolate aroma, with strong alcohol presence and hints of smoked oak. Very flavorful; the strong alcohol comes through in the finish. A strong Imperial Stout."
Great Waters OByrnes Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;Keg @ Great Waters. Amber pour with a small head. Nose is brown sugar, nut, caramel.

Great Waters OByrnes Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;Cask at the brewpub.

Great Waters OByrnes Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;On tap @ Great Waters. Red orange appearance with an off white head. Slightly hoppy but mostly a caramel malty nose. Pretty bland caramel malty flavor. Drinkable but boring.

Great Waters OByrnes Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;Dark orange color with a thin head. Dusty malt aroma with a slightly sweet finish. Taste is more of the same, with nothing really standing out. Pinch of a hops finish.
Great Waters OByrnes Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;Named after the owner, O' byrn's Irish Red is a another amber done very well and is cask-conditioned. It reminded me a little of a English Bitter but milder. Color is a hazy light brown, very small head that retained in small bubbles throughout most of the glass as I was drinking it. Very faint and light on the nose, has a slight aroma of hop and citrusy lemon. Taste is crisp, clean, light, a little watery, no real initial taste up front, but the middle gets a nice little dry hop and finishes with a citrus note and slightly dry. Hint of cinnamon maybe, too. Feels very clean but is watery, could be bolder and more medium bodied. Leaves a light pale citrus feel on the tongue. This could be better, but is pretty good and favored it slightly over the other amber.
Great Waters OByrnes Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;Still not a red to rave about. One day will come. Light red colored with some slight, slight hops. But mostly an average unnoticable beer. Nothing offensive, nothing compelling.
Great Waters OByrnes Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;"Very plain... all too common red ale. Almost tasteless except for some tiny malt flavor. Having it on cask probably saved it from being rated as swill because it was so smooth. This was one of those beers at the Real Ale Festival that were easily forgotten and easily poured into the ""dump-tub""."
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;Tap. Light but rich gold pour. White head. Fruit yeast nose. Taste is sticky fruit and banana. Good stuff.
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;When I lived in Duluth/Superior in 2008 and 2009, I would go the Fitger’s every Wednesday night and watch Charlie Parr perform, and drink some of this great beer. Everyone recommended I try this one.
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours a hazy golden amber with thin white head. Aroma is very light, mostly caramel. Flavor is vanilla caramel with subtle citrus notes. Body is fairly light but still creamy with med. carbonation.
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;On draught during Winterfest 2009 in St Paul, MN. Pours a semi-hazy dark golden brew with an average off-white head that slowly dissipates to a white ring. Aroma of strong alcohol fumes with raisin, dark pitted fruits, a hint of banana and some pear. Taste is full bodied, with flavors of banana esters, some yeast, apricots, a hint of pear and some sharp spice. Finish is semi-sweet, a tad metallic from the high alcohol with a lingering banana and alcohol aftertaste. It’s strong!
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;Winterfest 2009. This is a success. Alcohol in the aroma and flavor, but not too much for the style. Dark, fermenting fruit, plums, raisins. Lots of sweet malt and sugar.
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;On-tap at the brewpub: A nice surprise to see this on the board out of how many times I’ve either missed it or just didn’t review due to being at a beerfest. Well worth the wait... Limpid light brownish orange color, quite hazy looking with a very thin capping of white foam mostly sitting at the edges. Small bits of lace graze the 10oz glass within which it was served. And at only $3.00 for the 10oz, was a pretty good price I thought. Light aroma of berries, pear, and Belgian candied sweetness. Quite fresh and fruity with a bit of caramel to its backing, but altogether a bit too light. Would’ve been great to have this be much more forward on the nose. However, taste wise this was quite the spectacle of yummyness. Nicely soft, clean, creamy berryness ensues with a oily ease of lightly sweet sugaryness of fruit juices and malt. Notes of pear, apple, candied orange, and raisin begin to develope but stays favorably well-balanced with a big malty soothing undercarriage of caramely goodness and straight forward malt tone of sweet fruits. I really enjoyed the taste of this one. Has great fruity flavors and an altogether big malt body giving it a soothing creamy, nearly silky ease in texture to go down. Soft fulfilling rich malty finish lets off a sliced smidgeon of heated spice too. Yum. Feel is pretty malty smooth. Just about medium with a lightness to it at frist but grows expedentially as it goes. Creamy, soothing, soft, subtle, and caring nature of carbonation and overall body. A relaxing comfortable brew to behold. Great flavor profile and malty richness thats well-balanced and not to over eager and boozy. Listed at 8%, this was a fucking gem compared to the Blue Label reserve dubbel. Had 2 of these without any problem. A very nice brew. Again, to bad that for the most part, Fitger’s flat out refuses to growler they’re bigger brews such as this. As I begged for one, and only left with a Starfire Pale instead.
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;This was pretty good, but didn’t really feel like much of a tripel. Brown amber body with a ring ofr head. banana and some other fruit yeast aroma. Bit of alcohol with some pepper, banana, and some thick sweet maltyness with hints of alcohol here and there.
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;GTMW 06. After trying the El Nino and Redbeard from Fitgers, I figured they couldn’t miss. Oops. Slight haze, muddy amber body with no head. The aroma is banana and apricots. The flavor is apricots, peach, banana and pepper, fairly sweet. Full, sticky body.
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;Orange-tinted hazy dark golden pour, with no head, except for a white rim. Estery fruit profile wafts, backed with sugary sweet malt notes. Oily orange flavors, backed with a strong ester and hexane profile. Alcohol is absorbed in the front end, making a beautiful, hardly noticable appearance. Carbonation is light. Back end of flavor profiule is extremely sweet, with a good kick of orange, apricot and fresh yeast. Hops are limited to distant notes. Palate is coating, with a sugary honey dry oak aftertaste.
Fitgers Hair O the Monk;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Fitgers Brewhouse;Goldish color. Sweet aroma with a bit o’ spice. Tangy taste to be sure... A little sweet as well along with some malt. There is some maltiness that comes in at the end. The alcohol wasn’t particularly well hidden. Odd Tripel.
Fitgers Sasquatch Scotch Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fitgers Brewhouse;[On-tap at Fitger’s] Pours reddish-brown with a nice beige head. Faint aroma, sweet notes of caramel, grape and pear. Taste has restrained bitterness, big maltiness, caramel, fairly sweet, light raisin and other indistinguishable fruitiness. Well rounded, and nothing stands out. Medium mouthfeel, average length finish. Overall, a nice scotch ale that doesn’t amaze, but is solid nonetheless.
Fitgers Sasquatch Scotch Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fitgers Brewhouse;DL06: Poured a hazy golden dark amber color. Aroma of olives and malt. Sour flavor with more olive juice. I don’t know what was going on here.
Fitgers Sasquatch Scotch Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fitgers Brewhouse;Ruby fringed hazlenute pour, with a frothy cream of a head. Light caramel and banana aroma. Extremely sugary off the bat. Toffee and caramel dominate, backed by oats and earthy tones. Nutty all the way. Blend this with hints of warm bourbon and rum. Bright and sharp on the back end, with mellow cherry truffle. Well done, but a little hot from the alcohol. Lots of vanilla note s and some hints of cinnamon. Surprisingly this has some spicy and estery yeast notes, despite the presence of Fitger’s characteristic malt and yeast flavor running the gamut of the background. Starts off sweet, but melds into a balanced, savory supple example.
Fitgers Sasquatch Scotch Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fitgers Brewhouse;Dark Brown/Red with Sandy Head. Malt Aroma. Sweet Malt Tones with a Warming that Tingles Your Lips and Continues All the Way Down Your Throat. Some Bread Dough. Very Nice Winter Warmer.
Fitgers Sasquatch Scotch Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fitgers Brewhouse;"Dark red color with a thin head. Very malty aroma. The taste is overwhelminly of sweet malt with a bit of caramel. Man, the alcohol is not hidden at all; very upfront and personal. Definitely a winter warmer variety."
Fitgers Sasquatch Scotch Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fitgers Brewhouse;"On-tap at the brewpub: Chestnut brown with a slow crimson hint, slim cap of darkened ivory, some stringing lacing sticks. Aroma is clean and somewhat subdued of a molasses caramel maltyness and slight chocolate with a good load of spicy alcoholic heat. Flavors are well into the full-on malt load here, yummy darkened sweet molasses, caramel and fig hints with a soothing backing of hefty chocolate thats mild and taming; mixing well with the other malts. Nothing overwhelms, very balanced, clean, chewy, big on flavors right from the get go and keeps a giving with malty goodness. Both of a slightly sweetness and mild milk chocolateyness; barely a roast noticeable way underneath. Warm and coating to the belly. Smooth and thick malt feel, medium bodied, clean chewyness, sensational drinkability, coats, soothes and warms. A perfect winter warmer after a day of hiking in the cold."
Fitgers Sasquatch Scotch Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fitgers Brewhouse;Another beer from Winterfest in St. Paul 2/8/03. She gives some head...her taste is malt.

Town Hall Jesters Reserve Imperial Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Had on tap at the pub for the 6th anniversary, 10-18-03 Fully, chocolatey brown in color, with a firm, solid white head atop...aroma: plain at first, but further gleanings reveal a thick, oily, syrupy character...deep and viscous...motor oil, even, I might say... Once in the mouth, big-time, fat chocolate flavor, that continually recurrs throughout the drink...teases the lips and tongue...full-bodied, thick and chewy, substantial texture! The kind of mouthfeel that is fully in control and drives your senses, no back-seat driver, it is in command! Nicely roasted, with a long, resilient finish, and significant alcoholic content that appears medicinal-tasting toward the end. Thick, bold, spicy flavor...I've loved many porters before, but few have delivered the goods like this maniac! Wow...wow...and, one more time, Woa-a-A-OWW!!!
Town Hall Jesters Reserve Imperial Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;GABF '03, black with a small tan head. Aroma of dark fruit,chocolate and roasted malt.Flavor is bitter/sweet with a mild whiskey charcater and oak essence.
Town Hall Jesters Reserve Imperial Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Got a growler of this at the release party back in September, I think it was and sealed the neck with wax and cellared for a couple months. It held up amazingly well. Beautiful fruity, sweet and alcohol nose. Color is very dark, but not opaque. Carbonation was very light and little head formed, but that is how it was when first released as well. Taste was magnificent. Strong, plummy, fruity, slightly smokey. Apparent, but not overpowering notes from the barrel aging. Chocolate notes and alcohol, but neither of these or overpowering either. A beautifully complex beer that held up very well after several weeks in a growler!
Town Hall Jesters Reserve Imperial Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Produced specially for the 2003 Anniversary - Color is a solid inky old, faded black with a nice tan head of thick froth about 1/4 inch high, fades some to a thick skim on top and clumpy thick lace impressively sticking. Smell has lots of deep dark espresso chocolate with some very dark cherry hints, black sweet malts and cognac/brandish-like alcohol sweetness and warmth in the midst of the chocolate cloud. Taste is super smooth and chocolatey! Late hints of alcohol. The chocolate tone is nice and deeply sweet with some coffeeish notes in a late lingering finish. Very nice! The chocolate is quite complex in its its thickness and layering, much like a fudge and/or brownie mix. Feel is airy and fluffy full of creamyness with a late velvety textured palette with a supurb chocolate/cocoa/coffeeish drying. Oh this is quite heavenly, what a lovely Imperial Stout. I could drink this all the time, any time! Smooth and creamy, chocolatey and sweet, awesome and yummy!
Town Hall Jesters Reserve Imperial Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Wawood! stop brown nosing Town Hall in hopes of free beer. It aint happening! This for me was another taste I experienced in St Paul at Winterfest. She's all chocolate...like Halloween..very taboo..she gives decent head and is also very smelly.
Town Hall Jesters Reserve Imperial Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"5/8/05 Re-rate: Ar 9; Ap 4; Fl 8; Pal 5; Ov 18. A partial keg of this stuff had been sitting in Town Hall’s basement for 2 years and they brought it up for the ""I Love Beer"" pub crawl. Might actually have been the same keg from which I had my previous sample. Many similarities to the Czar Jack. I have no question that if Town Hall brewed this more often and gave more folks a chance to rate this that it would be in the Ratebeer top 100 as well. Bourbon barrell aroma. Not much head. Smells and tastes like Czar Jack but perhaps not quite as good. 2/9/03: Before I realized that this beer was aged in a whiskey barrel, I was unsure of the distinct hard alcohol aroma. However, with that knowledge, the aroma lends a unique quality to an excellent big beer. Kudos again to the brewers at Minneapolis Town Hall."
Town Hall White Winter Belgian Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Yeast!!! Yeast!! she's got a yeast infection..which I like but she scared me. I victomized her on 2/8/03 at the St. Paul Winterfest.
Town Hall White Winter Belgian Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Yeasty, citrus aroma with typical Belgian wheat hints. Appearance is that of white grape juice. Sweet for a Belgian wit and very good!
Vine Park Bourbon Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Vine Park Brewing Company;Bourbon aroma with chocolate notes. Both come through in the mouthfeel. Despite how good that sounds, this brew is nothing spectacular. Good, not great.
Kraftbrau Irish Style Stout;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Kraftbrau Brewery;"On tap at the brewery. Deep, opaque and black with a thick tan wrung for the head. Aroma mimics the standard brewpub formula for dry stouts, with chocolate annotations trying to cover up something that’s suspiciously similar to dog poop. Flavor’s saying ""if you’ve had one, you’ve had them all."" Straight forward semi-sweet chocolate, thinning, and turning astringent. Prickly carbonation. Pass."
Kraftbrau Irish Style Stout;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Kraftbrau Brewery;On draft at the brewery, this brew poured a large sized head of brown colored frothy fine to medium sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind an opaque dark red brown colored body with no visible carbonation and an excellent sheet lacing. Beautiful looking brew. The aroma was malty and hoppy with dark brown malty notes that were roasted and nutty. The mouth feel was smooth and flat initially with a mild tingly in the finish like it was on nitro but we verified it was on CO2. The flavor was flat and hoppy with a mild malt note.

Cheers to Vale for being a great hostess that night, made my trip to Kalamazoo quite enjoyable.
Kraftbrau Irish Style Stout;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap: Pours with the darkest brown head I've ever seen. Aroma of scotch and soy sauce. The body is smoky and bitter with a meaty flavor, something I've never noticed in a beer. Tastes like it was fermented with a bratwurst. Very unique and robust with earthy mouthfeel. I was somewhat confused with this one, but overall enjoyed it quite a bit.
Kraftbrau Down Home Brew;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;Unfiltered draft sampler at Kraftbrau. My first trip here has me finally tearing myself away from Bell’s across the street. This is light and yellow, just a little bit hazy. Sips very nice and cleanly. The hop character is actually fruity at the start, then settles down into a good German style. Very well done.
Kraftbrau Down Home Brew;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;A hazy light amber hue with the standard fizzy and fading Kraftbrau head, some lace. The aroam hints of buttery biscuit malts, aromatic and floral hops, lemongrass and soem dusty yeast esters. The taste is lemony, bitter, and display a good malty backbone midway through the drink. Some yeast on the finish which has a noble bitter quality. The mouthfeel is fizzy and crisp. This is a good version of a helles, refreshing and nicely quaffable. A nice surprise indeed!
Kraftbrau Down Home Brew;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;A tale of two Kraftbrau pilseners began with their Down Home Brew. It poured a cloudy yellow-orange, with a thin white ring of foam clinging to the glass. Very earthy, spicy, aromatic hops notes. The flavor was outstanding: strong biscuit and toast flavors, and dominated by earthy, spicy, grassy hops. A touch of lemon in the aftertaste. Strong carbonation enhanced lively mouthfeel. A very well-crafted pilsener. This was the better tale of two...

Kraftbrau Down Home Brew;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;A very good, very snappy Saazy lager with a good, not too oily body. Meant for serious session work, this one warms without excessive sweetness. Good, good, good.

Yellow Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Mortals Beers;"This was an orangey amber coloured, hazy beer with delicate, yellowish white, dense head and a pleasant aroma of walnuts, caramel, apple, melon, mandarin, honey, pepper and dried leaves; tasted very fruity, applish and somewhat citrussy, smooth and light on the tongue but nevertheless full, gracious, with a chalky and flowery, lightly hoppy finish.

Southampton Peconic County Reserve Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Saison/Farmhouse - Flavored;Southampton Publick House;"In short: A part-rustic and part-Sour blond ale with plenty of white grapes. Good original creation. How: Bottle 750ml, 2011 vintage, so probably around 1 year of age. Bottle from yopdoog, thanks a lot Trevor. The look: Cloudy dark blond body topped by a small white head. In long: Nose has plenty of fresh white grapes with a rustic yeast character bringing a dusty attic sensation. Taste is also loaded with fresh white grapes, crackery neutral malts, little salty notes, rustic yeast character. Medium tartness, mild-medium sourness, medium acidity. Overall very fruity (the grapes cannot be misted), rustic and with a semi-sour character that surely comes from the barrel aging. Starts very juicy fruity and ends very dry and with acidity and sourness. This beer is as much a Fruit Beer as it is a Saison as it is a Sour/Wild Ale. Quite nice. That’s a rare beer I’ve been wanting to try for a long time, I knew it would come my way eventually because I believe in Destiny, when Destiny says ""if you touch me again I’ll get you thrown out of the club"" I keep my hands off her."

Southampton Peconic County Reserve Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Saison/Farmhouse - Flavored;Southampton Publick House;Opened this bottle for Todd’s 30th birthday. Been trying to find this beer forever, so happy to finally try it. Pouts a golden orange in color with a half finger worth of tight white head. It’s hazy in clarity. Nose is juicy white grape, mineral, and some stone fruit. It’s alluring, but doesn’t overwhelm your senses. Flavor follows the nose with more juicy white grape and mineral in the forefront. There is some very gentle band aid in the middle, and finishes with some saisons earthiness, more white grape, and lactic sourness. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is moderate and slightly prickly, moderate acidity, and a long finish. This bottle lived up to the hype, it is near a perfect American wild. I will be actively pursuing another bottle immediately.
Southampton Peconic County Reserve Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Saison/Farmhouse - Flavored;Southampton Publick House;Golden pour with a small white head that quickly fizzles away. Sweet white grape meets tangy lactic acid in the aroma. As it warms, light spice notes emerge with subtle fruit and some earth. Flavor is sweet and juicy white grape interwoven seemlessly with a nice earthy saison. There is just enough tartness to keep the grape from overpowering. Medium to light body with good carbonation. I love the addition of sweet white grape to American sours and saisons. This was an amazing beer.
Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;From old tasting notes. The cheapest beer I ever drank. Cost about $4.75 for a case of 16 ounce returnable bottles. Poured a clear pale gold color. Small bubbly white head. Malty sour crab apple aroma. Tangy light malt flavor is quite lacking. No hops to speak of. A cheap beer that promises nothing and delivers just that.
Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Bottle. Pours golden, slight head with a tiny bit of lacing. Aroma is copper, mild herbs, grainy sugars. Flavor is a touch sweet with herbal hop notes. A pretty good american lager.
Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;From a 16 oz returnable long neck bottle, how cool is that in america? Of course its pale yellow and it has the typical cheap lager aroma, but in a good way. Taste is not bad, some hints of hay and the like. Decent carbonation. Refreshing lager with not many ill effects. Nice rather friendly finish without any bitterness per se but there is a slight hint of industrialness in there.
Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Goes down well on a hot summer day. That’s all I can say about it....Oh, yeah, it comes in 16oz. returnable bottles, which are perfect for homebrewing.
Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;"As many have said this is a good beer for the price, unfortunately I did not purchase this beer, it was given to me from a buddy. The beer is like Bud without the beechwood aging. Slightly sweet, a little skunky, not much to it overall. ""Pocono mountain water makes the difference"" This beer has drastically changed my opinion on the water up there."
Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;"Best beer for the price. Light golden color and minimal head. Not much of an aroma, but also no bad aroma. Easy to drink and no bad aftertaste. This is truly a rating on price. I was very surprised when this $12 case of 16oz beers turned out to be even drinkable. I actually enjoyed them, and will definitely buy this again in the future. As an added bonus, you even get $1.50 back when you return the empty bottles. Purchased in West View, PA 15229 at ""Northern Beer Traders""."

Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;I remember drinking this stuff years ago when I visited my friend in college in Albany. We bought Gibbons and some Red, White & Blue. As I recall, RWB was pretty bad, I’ll have to check and see if it is still around. The Gibbons wasn’t all that bad. As I recall it was a typical low-end lager, golden color, with the obligatory malt and corn cereal flavor. I see from some of the other reviews that it is back in the Wilkes-Barre area. I’ll see about picking some up on my next trip to PA and recall those old days.
Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Gibbons Famous Lager is one of my father’s favorite brews. It’s been brewed for years but only available in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area for about the past fifteen years and only in sixteen ounce returnables. My Dad hasn’t drank Gibbons since the mid-80’s when my older brother brought a case (of cans) back from the Poconos. On my trip to Cooperstown, NY for Ommegang’s July 2005 fest I stopped in Schiff’s Beverage Center, Dickson City, PA and bought a case of Gibbons for $14.57 (including deposit) for my Dad. I was number one son the day I dropped the case off for my Dad. Gibbons itself is a coal cracker classic, corny aroma, yellow colored with some barnacle bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Flavor is corny, creamy malt bubble gum macro beer. A great value for the price, and one of my eighty-seven year old Dad’s lifetime favorite beers. .
Gibbons Famous Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Another new arrival at Epps in Limerick, PA. Some redeeming qualities in this. The Lion brewery is not bad, and this one is fairly priced. I’ll probably lawnmower this one next spring.
District ChopHouse California Common;Washington, Washington DC, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);Sparkling clear, honey- colored beer.

Rocky Bay Black Castle Scottish Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Scottish Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;Draught pint at the brewpub October 2005 Well if these guys are going belly-up, I may as well enter my old notes, as it looks like I’m not going to be getting a rerate. Thickly hazed beer (as are most of their beers) is a very deep mahogany with a slight, almost burgundy tinge. Sandy-beige colored head is medium in size, fading slowly to partial cover/ring, providing light lacing. Light creamy malt sugars mix with a very subtle fruitiness. Very mild roasted coffee is notable and a bit of honey comes on in the finish. Warming allows more creamy, somewhat caramel-like sugariness to emerge. No alcohol or flaws in the aroma Round, soft and sweet, the unfiltered, malty texture is always a bright spot in their beers. Hints of licorice quickly fall away, leaving cherries, vanilla and honey-cream sweetness. Lightly sweet caramel is very simple and the beer finishes about the same as it starts (caramel, honey, cream). Light coffee notes as well, picking up a bit of bitterness from some hops. Fresh, nutty yeast. Well-made beer, but very basic malt flavors without a truly developed fruitiness. No flaws noted in flavor. Medium body, medium carbonation.
Rocky Bay Black Castle Scottish Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Scottish Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;Pour is dark amber reddish with a little foamy head. Carbonation goes away fast though in this one. Nose is sweet malt, sugar, molasses, and a little hoppiness. Flavors are clean, slightly watery (uh-oh) :) and dry. Good scottish, i’d call it average. It’s not a standout, but then again it’s not aweful either.
Rocky Bay Black Castle Scottish Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Scottish Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;Maine Brewers Festival 2005. Dark brown, small beige head. Sweet malty aroma, bit of a bite? Flavour is malty with a sharp note to it. Dry earthy finish? Something else. Not unpleasant but lacks the big bad sugary malts of a great scotch ale. Average palate.
Rocky Bay Black Castle Scottish Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Scottish Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;"(Draught) Sampled at The Waterworks Pub & Brewery in Rockland, Maine. Tiny bubbles with a fully dissipating head. Beautiful copper colour yet the nose is weak and the body is too thin. Mild corn flavours are malted with a minor ABV kick. Not enough to ""wow"" me..."
Rocky Bay Black Castle Scottish Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Scottish Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;From a fresh growler. Pours a clear ruby brown with a thick tan head. Smells bitter and of malt. Hints of caramel. Tastes of malt and molasses though not as strong as the smell would hint at. Bitter with caramel flavors. Mouthfeel is thick, sweet and sticky. Is remarkably easy drinking for a scotch ale. A solid offering from Rocky Bay.
Rocky Bay Foghorn Nut Brown Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;On tap at The Waterworks Pub in Rockland, Maine during Rockland’s first annual Chocolate March Festival (I always wonder when somebody calls something a 1st annual - how do they know it will become an annual thing...)

Rose Street Brewery Devil's Kiss;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg UK;33 cL bottle in Fiumicino airport, Rome. Pours clear and golden orange with a dense off-white head. Aroma is malt driven and with a mild caramel note. Light acidic touch with a presence of alcohol. Flavour is dry malty, minor caramel touch, and with a light bitterness. Solid alcohol presence beneath. Ends warming and solid alcohol flavoured. Light sweet malt flavour before the finish and a light growing bitterness into the finish. Somewhat too alcohol flavoured for my liking.
Rose Street Brewery Devil's Kiss;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg UK;"Alla spina al festival Musica W di Castellina Marittima (PI); pressoché imbevibile nonostante l’alcool non sia poi così tanto sull’etichetta. Ma è difficile notare altro nel sapore."
Rose Street Brewery Devil's Kiss;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg UK;Warm golden with a weak head. The aroma is malty and pilsner-like, and very boring. The moutfeel is rather oily. the flavour is sweet, malty with light notes of caramel, fruit and a light note of citrus in the finish. Drinkable, but no pleasure..
Rose Street Brewery Devil's Kiss;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg UK;Rome, Italy airport. Very clean orangish amber brew average foamy head. Heavy malt aroma, sweet like high fructose corn syrup. Smooth, a bit peppery. Dry bitter aftertaste lingers a bit. Very warming alcohol feel in the chest and belly.
Rose Street Brewery Devil's Kiss;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg UK;Bottled, in Trastevere, Roma, Italy. Pale larger, approaching European strong. Not as harsh as some others sold alongside it e.g. Ceres Strong, but not a noteworthy drink either.
Rose Street Brewery Devil's Kiss;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg UK;Bought in the Rome airport. Pours golden brown and effervescent with a thin, well maintained white head. Aroma of caramelized alefruits, grainy, with notes of toffee and brown sugar. Taste is grainy, sweet, with toffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and sticky with lively carbonation.
Rocky Bay Viking Plunder Winter Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Old Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;Maine Brewers Festival 2005. Dark brown body, fairly hazy moderate beige head. Muted dark malts in the aroma, and slightly earthy roast malt. dark sweet malty flavour is much more simplistic than I was hoping for based on the recommendation of a fellow festival patron. Dark fruit beings to emerge as it warms up with some chocolate glimpses. I did not get a lot of complexity out of this but maybe I should have had more patience and let it warm up some? Alcohol is virtually invisibile, to the point of questioning whether or not the abv claim was exaggerated. Average to medium palate. Has stoked my curiousity though (especially now that I have read Clark’s rating!) so I may have to seek this one out again.
Rocky Bay Viking Plunder Winter Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Old Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;On draught at the pub on 10/23/2005. Served cold in a shaker, the beer is highly unfiltered with a deep brown-to-mahogany color, with chestnut edges. A soft, wispy, creamy beige colored head perches atop lightly, being retained only at a light covering, with slight, spotty lacing. Would like to see some better head retention. Smells of deep chocolate, hints of light roast, dark fruits and bits of caramel and black malt in between. A slight hint of earthy, husky malts, dry soil and damp, old coffee rinds really add a nice effect. Perhaps some anise-like notes in there as well. I really wish they would serve this at a proper temperature and in a concave glass, so I could get a better sniff at it, but that might come across as a bit snobby in this down to earth pub. The flavor is what really wows you in this one. It dosent come on strong, brash or burly at all. Quite the contrary. It starts out with a good, thick, chewy chocolate fudge flavor, with an easygoing, porter-like roastiness and a soft malt sweetness on the end. Low carbonation and a supple, substantial mouthfeel make it immediately attractive, while notes of barley, dry toffee, anise, figs and prunes make their way in. After about a quarter of my glass, I thought this was a nice chocolate porter of about 6% abv. It tastes no where, and I mean no where near 10%. And another thing that was very enjoyable was the almost exclusive malt focus. It dosent use the hops for much, if any, flavoring and relies on its complex balance of something like 8 malts to attain the flavors. No bitter hops notes, as a proper old ale. And even without the hops bitterness, it still runs a perfect line between keeping it well-malted, but never too sweet. As it warms, some brandy and more dark roast notes emerge, with perhaps, a vanilla-like flavor. Lots of yeast dryness (Chico Ale yeast). Body is medium-full and the beer is incredibly drinkable. I would put this in the top 3 most drinkable beers I’ve had for the ABV. I bet this would be absolutely killer on cask.
Rocky Bay Viking Plunder Winter Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Old Ale;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;This is a superior brew in the world of high-alcohol beers. With none of the cloying sweetness or estery notes of most high-gravity beers, it goes down easy and makes you glad you bothered. We’ve drained the keg at the local pub and are clamoring for more. I predict this ale will be a local legend before you know it and rightly so.

Castello Birra Lager Doppio Malto;San Giorgio di Nogaro, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Castello di Udine Spa;0,33L bottle (from Tallinna Kaubamaja). Pours clear dark golden with small off-white head. The head doesn’t stay. Aroma is malt, caramel, burnt sugar, metallic. Flavor is sweet, malt, caramel, burnt sugar, some bitterness, very noticeable alcohol. Carbonation is high. Overall: too boozy, but not the horror I thought it will be.

Castello Birra Lager Doppio Malto;San Giorgio di Nogaro, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Castello di Udine Spa;330ml bottle (Stockmann, Tallinn) Meh - papery aroma. On swirling, there’s a hint of some gluey solvent too. Wallpaper - paper plus starch plus glue. You can feel the alcohol. Finish is just more bloody paper. Leaves the mouth needing a cleanse - Marduk suggests casting a /Neutralize Poison/ spell! So much wallpaper. Yeugh!
Castello Birra Lager Doppio Malto;San Giorgio di Nogaro, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Castello di Udine Spa;33cl bottle. Aroma of cane syrup and some caramel. Beautiful orange color for a strong lager. Unfortunately no head at all. Malty enough for the claimed type. Hoppy bitterness is rather weak. Medium body, oily with no carbonation (I would say it is typical for double bock). Better be served colder than usual revved up beer.
Castello Birra Lager Doppio Malto;San Giorgio di Nogaro, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Castello di Udine Spa;Orange, white head. Nose is malts and caramel, some hay notes. Taste is pretty much the same with light hops, mild dryness and bitter alcohol in the finish. Thin to medium body, medium carbonation, slightly oily mouthfeel. Better than expected.
Castello Birra Lager Doppio Malto;San Giorgio di Nogaro, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Castello di Udine Spa;"Brown bottle. Dark golden body with a medium to small head. Sweetish malty aroma. Sweet malty taste with medium hoppiness and light alcohol bitterness. Has a bit richer body than local ""strong pale lagers"" but somehow it doesn’t offer much more depth of flavours. Relatively clean and drinkable but not something exciting."
Keltek Kripple Dick;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Keltek Brewery;Bottle picked up at Tuckers Maltings, Newton Abbot in November. Black as black can be, too sweet but there were some dried fruits on the nose and kicking about in the flavour dept’ other than that I was somewhat dissapointed by this.
Keltek Kripple Dick;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Keltek Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Metropolitan Cathedral Crypt, Liverpool 19/02/2003 Dark coloured and strong in alcohol. Some hoppiness. Lasting slightly malt finish.
Keltek Kripple Dick;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Keltek Brewery;Bottle, bought at St Albans Beer Festival 2004. Reddish orange colour. There’s quite a lot going on in the aroma, but a lot of it is rather hard to pin down. Definite sour cherries, as others have remarked, dried fruit and cocoa are definitely in the mix somewhere, but its a bit muddled. The sour notes and cherries continue on to the palate, with more spicy fruit. A fair ration of bitterness helps to hold things together. Rather good, but I would probably have been able to appreciate the subtleties better had we not been at GBBF all day before.
Keltek Kripple Dick;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Keltek Brewery;Sour cherries and light malty tones to the aroma. Clear brownish red with low tan head that diminishes rapidly to ring. Sour cherries, thin malts, underlying lasting sweetness. Light, very dry body with strong carbonation. Bottle sampled post GBBF with chris_o, daniel_brown and maeib.
Keltek Kripple Dick;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Keltek Brewery;Bottle round Chris_o’s house. Ruddy colouring and a soured jelly aroma. Cherry flavour and strong metal bitterness. Fizz on the tongue and thinnish in the mouth. Very nice, but honestly at this stage I was more interested in the chilli which Chris’ wife Ruth had prepared for us.
Keltek Kripple Dick;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Keltek Brewery;"Black with brownish shine, totally opaque; slim, slightly irregular but rather dense brown head. Sourish-lactic nose, Flemish brown-like, superimposed on the classical chocolate cake. Whew -taste! Bitter, sweet and sour at the same time - some jumble. Flavours of smoked/cigar ash, bitter chocolate, fruit acids, lactic, berries, grapes and sweet cake. Very full-bodied, chewy. Aftertaste is acid-etched sweetness. Extremely likeable and dangreously drinkable for its ABV. Searched long after this -well worth the waiting. Thanks to MatW!"
Keltek Kripple Dick;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Keltek Brewery;What a wonderful name for a beer. With this strength of beer you may well suffer brewers droop. This is a dark ale with earthy, root vegetable flavours complemented by roast malts. Quite sweet, yet vineous at the same time this has a nice fruity, dry finish. The alcohol is quite well hidden so beware. Similar to, but inferior to Traquair House Ale.

Mild chocolate and caramel aromas with some hints of DMS. Quite light and fizzy on the palate. Some light, dark malt flavors with just a touch of sweetness from the wheat late. This just seems to be a light dunkel with only a slight trace of wheat and no other major attributes. Really is not that bad as a brew, but don’t market something you don’t really have.
NorWester Dunkel Weizen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Boy, I sure do love Dunkel Weizens. Too bad this NorWester beer isn’t a Dunkel Weizen! It’s a dunkel all right, and judged as that, it’s a pretty good dunkel with some noticeable roastiness. Yet the wheatiness that I love so much is sorely lacking. It’s as if NorWester/Pyramid used a crisp American Wheat to add dark malt to. This beer is also somewhat watery and light-bodied, even for a dunkel. There just needs to be more grain bill present. Nevertheless, I admire their attempt at this rare style.
NorWester Dunkel Weizen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Dark brown. A pretty descent beer, just not a whole lot there. Certainly very drinkable, but just nothing outstanding.

Chernomor Svitle;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Уже, наверно, десять лет прошло, как пил его. В своё время был неплох, кажется.
Chernomor Svitle;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Golden, slightly bitter and acidic (like other Chornomors). Sweetness is more evident in bottled than in draught version.
Chernomor Svitle;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Pale golden, poor head. Aroma like a young wine, sour. Sharp, metallic, a little bit grainy, light sweet. Unpleasant aftertaste. Bad balanced, awful
Chernomor Gold;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;From a 500 ml. bottle, freshness date on the back label, sampled in a lager glass. Poured a clear orangey golden with a foamy white that slowly dissipates into a thin sudsy lacing. A faint, largely clean nose, cereal grains and sweet pale malts, a little lemony. The carbonation is active, lending towards a light-medium body, crisp, dryish and a tad watery, tastes of a watery tart, lemony citrus, cereal and thin sweet pale malts, fusel alcohol flavor towards the end, a dry, watery tart, sweet malty finish, passable drinkability. This was, for me, barely o.k., I doubt I will be buying this again, there are better cheaply priced east European pale lagers on the shelves of the stores in my area.
Chernomor Gold;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a large sized head of foamy fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that was mostly lasting and left behind a transparent light orange colroed body. The aroma was malty and slightly acidic. The weird flavor was just off and contained acidic notes. A horrible one that I would not buy again.
Chernomor Gold;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Bottle. Poured hazy pale color with a large frothy white head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Light sweet grainy aroma. Light to medium good with a syrupy texture. Medium sweet flavor with a soft sweet short finish. Not much character.
Chernomor Gold;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;16.9 oz bottle- An aroma of corn on a light golden body with a head that diminished quickly. A taste of wheat and corn. A light body. Not bad for a beer that traveled quite a while.
Chernomor Gold;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Sampled from bottle. Pours faintly cloudy yellow-gold with a thin, white head. Sour, wet-hay-like aroma is followed by a semi-sweet, sour malt flavor. Medium-light body with higher levels of carbonation. Quite an unpleasant experience. This beer taste quite old - which is a real issue when a brewer ships a pale lager 1/2 way round the world. I could imagine this being a decent lager at the source (sort of).
Chernomor Gold;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;"This would be a fine, fine drink... if I was into corn syrup and chewing on tin cans. Looks dandy, if you enjoy lifeless pours. Tastes like tin foil, corn syrup, diesel fuel, and white sugar. The description reads, ""developed to satisfy the need of Ukrainian consumers for high-quality premium beer."" I repect Ukranians more than this."
Chernomor Gold;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Chill-hazed golden with a white head that settles in scummy islands. Industrial aroma with a husky corn resumé. Corny, gasoline and vegetables with a touch of sweetness in a flavor that makes me squint and frown as I sip. Who needs that? Purchased from Di Carlo Fine Wines and Spirits, Mundelein, IL 60060

Berkshire Mountain Altbier;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;I poured a 22oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. Its best before month was notched August 2013. It cost $4 ($0.18 per ounce). Appearance: Dark, hazy shady of copper with barely visible sediment floating in suspension. Forms a large, off-white, soapy head which retains and laces fairly well. Smell: Reminiscent of an English-style brew with a fruity notes plus overt maltiness. Taste: I’ve always been surprised that the altbier style is inherently German since it drinks like a British pub style ale. Berkshire Mountain Brewers Alt is a good example of this as its quite close to being an ESB with its pure malty flavors and under attenuated sweetness. It’s quite tasty for such a light bodied brew and satisfying for sure. Right away I get a flavor of wet grain and toasted malt. If you’ve ever homebrewed, it’s akin to tasting the vapor of wort boiling in the brew pot. There’s some tasty fruit flavors to be found in here as well, especially red apple and a hint of cherry. Very mild caramel/toffee or other confectionery sweetness on the backend with some dry, biscuity bitterness as it finishes. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this, and actually found the palette became more enjoyable the more I drank. Drinkability: It’s small beers like this that show how much can be done with less. Berkshire Mountain Brewers Alt is only 4.5% ABV and while it’s palette is fairly complex, its robustness is mild but strong enough not to bore you. The mouthfeel itself is quite comfortable with calm carbonation, but is not a thin or watery beer at all. I was able to drink the entire bomber myself quickly and easily.
Berkshire Mountain Altbier;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle that I kept for too long. Pours a clear ruby brown with a thin beige head. Malty, a bit of age already, and some sour notes. Huh… soured up nicely. I doubt it was supposed to though. Has some nice acid actually, a bit like an Oude Bruin. As a sour it’s not too bad actually. Lots of lacto. Rather interesting. Actually drank a good amount of this and thought I would dump the bulk of it.
Berkshire Mountain Altbier;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Tap at the brewpub.Orange, clear, tan head. Peppery hoppy aroma, and very clean. Hoppy and malty balanced flavor. Really well made and very quaffable.

Drentsche Schans Boeren Rogge;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Schans;Very dark red/brown colour. I haven’t had enough beers made with rye to isolate the characteristics associated with it, but there’s certainly everything but the kitchen sink in here. I picked up wheat (strong), caramel, vanilla, bready yeast, banana (faint) and roast malt. However, I found it a bit of a hotch potch and, in truth, too sweet for my palate. Interesting though. Bottled at Bedford Beer Festival 2004.

[brewery note] *** Colour: Dark reddish brown; medium, creamy beige head. *** Nose: Brown bread. Hints of caramel and roasted malts. *** Texture: Medium body, watery.

Finish: A bit bitter at least, with a little more explicit roasted malts. Short, aftertaste with the same artifically sweet note as before. *** Impressions: The fact that the brewery has added artifical sweetener (saccharine) to the beer doesn’t bode well. This accounts for the unpleasant sugary-bitter note that is typical of saccharine. Too sweet and one-note by half. Tastes like the malt beer for children. ""Wonderfully quaffable?"". Naahhh!"

Buckeye Frankenbock;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckeye Brewing Company;on tap at Beer Engine 28Sept2012, Seriously the acetone paint thinner note that is in this beer dominates the caramel sweetness, it burns and at 8 percent thats something I wouldnt expect.
Buckeye Frankenbock;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckeye Brewing Company;Nice deep chestnut brown in color with a few tan bubbles here and there for the head. Viscous legs slide down on the walls of the stem glass. Aroma unravels maple, brown sugar, caramel, Milky Ways, sugary pecans and apple juice. Sweet malts come calling first for flavor, trotting along with caramel and toffee. Sugary and roasted qualities seem to hit simultaneously and are trailed with a suggestion of smoke. Mild chocolate, squeezed pears and prune juice manifest on the tail end, residing in pockets in between the teeth and cheeks. Medium bodied and palate feels as it should. Batch might have been boiled a tad too long. Finishes like brazed pecans. Thanks to my Secret Santa (kujo9) for sending me this one from my wish list!
Buckeye Frankenbock;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckeye Brewing Company;Bottle, found for only $3.99 in Dayton, lucky me! Anyway, the beer has a nice reddish brown color with a initial large frothy head which fades into a msall covering and left good lacing on my glassware. The beer comes off with a big caramelized and toffee malt nose with additional prune and apple aroma. A bit of earthy ester and hazelnut as well. The taste starts with a caramel and sugary sweet forefront supported by a nice apple like twang. The finish displays some mocha, mild bitters, and a touch of nutty qualities. The feel is lively and yet a bit oily as well, makes this bier quite quaffable despite it size. Wow, worth the long wait. This is a great brew and a dug it completely. Sure it isn’t quite to style, but then maybe that is why I like it so. Get ya some.
Buckeye Frankenbock;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckeye Brewing Company;Dark black pearl with rich burgandy shallows and a dense, thick and foamy head. The aroma is like grape soda with sweet maple tones. Carbonation is light but crisp enough. Grape notes in the flavor with generic stewed prunes and punch. Hops is light but detectable and survives as an afterthought. Toffee in waves and a general lack of complexity. All in all, not too bad, but need some work.
Buckeye Frankenbock;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Lovely to look at, and a delightful nose; smoky and sweet caramel, earthy. Head intiially forms nicely. Then dies. That’s OK, fairly normal for bocks. Still and thicker in the glass as it warms. Uh oh, is it going to get excessively sugary? No! But it turns watery and bland. Palate marks are way down as this warms. Still, tasty until the end, and it didn’t get ugly, just nonexistent. Needs more smokiness. Some nice burnt plastic malt action."
Buckeye Frankenbock;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckeye Brewing Company;Deep red-brown body, thin light tan head.

One of the best American versions of the doppelbock I’ve sampled.

This is one of if not the best beers I have had from Hops. It reminded me of ""An Aaron Beer,"" which I detail in my review of Hops Lighting Bold Gold.

Beer Works Special Pale Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Beer Works;Draught pint at Fenway location on 4/14/07 One-finger of white head atop a very pale, brassy-gold body that is clear and shows brisk carbonation. Head laces lightly, with moderate retention. Nose is moderately hoppy, certainly showing more hops than either malt or yeast. I believe this is a single-hop EKG beer, though I am not positive. Regardless, the main force is certainly EKGs and there are a fair amount of them in here. Still, this hop is not exactly bursting with aroma and flavor by the time it makes it to the US and I really dont see the reason for using it unless you’re getting it fresh in Englan and using it immediately. Dusty, lightly sweaty and with some sourish-cattiness, it nonetheless posesses some dry, yellow fruits and light floral notes (dry lilacs, lavendar, vanilla blossom). Very grainy malt bill is also quite dry and gives some toastiness as well as a small amount of light, pale malt sweetness. Clean yeast, and very low bitterness overall. The sourish-catty flavors persist somewhat, being the biggest drawback to this beer. Lemon and light white grapefruit, toasted malt, floral-herbal hops and light vanilla all combine in the flavor to give a sort of American golden ale-meets-English pale-meets-American pale ale flavor. Low bitterness, but ample, I’d say, bolstered by the relative dryness of the beer and the brisk carbonation. Toasted malt is a little too strong, crowding out the finish and giving too much acidity (though it’s still rather light, overall). Some wateriness and only a medium-light body at best, but drinkable, if somewhat pestered by unclean/old hop notes and too much dryness/wateriness.

Dunn Plowman Crooked Furrow;Kington,, Herefordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Dunn Plowman Brewery;Hazy dark tawny colour. Spicy fruit aroma with yeast, woodiness and a hint of burnt caramel. Also woody and a little bitter on the palate, with a big hop presence too. No sweetness at all and some lactic, sour edges on the finish. Warming alcoholic afterburn. This was very close to its BBE date, so it may be that it develops that woodiness over time. Comes over a bit like a hybrid between a strong ale, a porter and a hopped up old ale. Very interesting. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but I liked it a lot. 500ml bottle (bottle conditioned) from orchard-hive-and-vine.co.uk

Dunn Plowman Crooked Furrow;Kington,, Herefordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Dunn Plowman Brewery;Wow! This is scrumptious! Brobdingnagian head. Yeasty nose very like a Belgian. Smooth, persuasive, luscious, fruity body rather like an Abbey Dubbel. Flawless hop bite in the finish to clean away the sweetness. Yum! This is a winter seasonal in the cask, but is available all year round bottle conditioned. It is a Winter Warmer with a little Belgian twist and and extra slap of hops. Very soft, and ever so easily consumed. A beer gone quickly - thoroughly enjoyed - and left wanting another just to fully savour all the flavours. I really enjoyed that, and now I'm wondering if 4.4 is a high enough score. O, yes, did I enjoy that! This little brewery with its tap at the Queens Head in Herefordshire, uses only local ingredients and was founded in 1987 by husband and wife team Gaye and Steve Dunn. A rare and enchanting beer.

It pours a rather dark beer with a nicely remaining delicate and nicely lacing light beige head. Interesting aroma which is mainly sweet, chocolatey, bready with hints of fresh cut grass and faint compost. Pumpernickel and chocolate in the taste. Unmemorable malt profile. Definitely overly sweet with hardly any bitterness. Smooth. Medium bodied. A beer with some nice, pleasant components. But the cloying sweetness makes it a bit dull and ruins its qualities. Dissapointing. As expected, there are a lot of residual sugars in the finish. Thanks a lot Stefan!

But the beer is really light boddied. Taste is a vague roasty, woody notes in the far background. Foam looks like soap bubbles and fade away directly. Rather wattery and artificial. Too sweet is not but taste sweetly fake. Beer seems over-rated to me... Pass your way on that kind of beer. Even Oetker Kostritzer seems better to me. Heineken Boehmische Brauerei should do better, espacially for the price at supermarket. Only the stikker on the bottle is nice. Ended up in the sink...

Gold Crown Premium Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gold Crown Brewery;I bought this bottle from the brewery. There’s not a lot of head from a pour into a pilsner glass.

Overall, it’s drinkable but generic and leaves little impression.

Gold Crown Premium Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gold Crown Brewery;Bottle from brewery-Pours a deep golden with a short lived white fizz, but there’s a lot of lace. Fresh, floral hop nose, spices, lemons and lime zest, biscuit and cookie. The flavour profile is a leafy green hop flavour, grass with lemon and biscuit cookie at the finish. Finishes bitter and crisp. Well made, and at the price, there’s no reason why this wouldn’t be a mainstay for me.
Gold Crown Premium Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gold Crown Brewery;Bottle (341ml). Via trade with Matt7215. Very pale clear gold, large white head that runs away quickly - looks kind of dead in the glass. Pretty decent aroma - light cereal grain oiliness and soft grassy hops - some biscuit - yeast? Tastes the same - sweeter, only lightly bitter, medium-quick finish and a bit chewy, lightly carbonated, nice and grainy - a decent version of what tastes like a classic Canadian brew, with that Euro hop character added in. Very decent.

I wish I had drunk it on a hotter day

Zlatopramen Tmavé Výčepni 10°;Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Zlatopramen (Heineken);(Bottled) Clear, very dark reddish brown with a medium, foamy and beige head with not much lace. Mild, roasted-malty aroma with coffee and hints of licorice. Roasty, neutral, slightly burned-malty flavor with hints of coffee. The finish is dryish and slightly ashy with the coffee more evident. No aftertaste to speak of. Almost medium-bodied, yet slightly thin palate with a bit foamy and lemonadey carbonation. Pretty decent dunkel for the ABV. (Bottled, rated Jan 15, 2004, was 5-4-5-3-12=2.9) Dark red color with medium, off-white head. Malty aroma with a hint of perfume. The first sips taste dry and chalky, but after that the flavor changes to sweet. There’s a lot of roasted coffee in the flavor. Overall impression is a bit watery - perhaps this could use somewhat higher ABV.

Watch City Kingpin Imperial Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Watch City Brewing Co.;One year old. A deep dark stout with a thin brown head. In aroma, peaty chocolate, boiled veggies, so-so. In mouth, a light sweetish malt with chocolate malt balss, light alcohol, not bad. On tap at Boston Beer Summit, Jan. 15 2011.
Watch City Kingpin Imperial Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Watch City Brewing Co.;Pours an oily opaque black with a small creamy froth of beige head. Has a sweet toasty dark caramel and chocolate nose with some roasty coffee notes. Starts with good rich fullness and sweet dark malts with some plum complexity and a touch of roasty tartness and bitter balance. Finishes slighly drier but still full bodied. An enjoyable imperial stout.
Watch City Kingpin Imperial Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Watch City Brewing Co.;Bottle dated 01.22.08 claiming 9.8% ABV. Sweet balsamic aroma. Very mellow charred coffee flavor that was very lightly sweet. Hints of black olive. Pretty nice.
Watch City Kingpin Imperial Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Watch City Brewing Co.;Thanks to the efforts of Rob (RooftopRogue) and ClarkW. Pours out jet black with little in the way of a head. Rich roasted coffee aroma with hints of anise, molasses, raisins, and a wisp of chocolate that carried over to the flavor. Rich and robust in the mouth with a warm, alcohol feel as you swallowed. Creamy and flavorful. Thanks, Guys!!
Watch City Kingpin Imperial Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Watch City Brewing Co.;Thanks to ClarkVV a few of us in Champaign, IL where able to taste this beer. This beer produces a serious aroma consisting of licorice, molasses, and alcohol. It was black in color and it failed to produce a head. This beer offers the palate a sweet licorice taste that fades to a bitter sweet flavor as the taste of alcohol appears. This beer fades smoothly leaving the taste of oatmeal lingering on the palate. It actually held its own fairly well on a night packed with the heavy hitters of the stout world.
Watch City Kingpin Imperial Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Watch City Brewing Co.;Bottle courtesy of Rob (rooftoprogue). Poured on the night of Edward’s (brooklynboy) surprise tasting. I’m not sure what the last rater was thinking, but this is great stuff. Held its own against the likes of Yeti, Alesmith, Expedition, Southhamption Imperial, and about 20 other stouts rated above 3.95 on this site. A great example of a East Coast style. Lots of French Roast Coffee, a lush mouthfeel, raisan, notes of molasses, and full bodied. Great creamyness, possibly from oats? Reminded me a bit of an imperial Kalamazoo. Nice work to WatchCity.
Watch City Kingpin Imperial Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Watch City Brewing Co.;GABF 2003 - The beer is a dark opaque brown with a brown head. It's a bit too thin for an imperial stout, and the flavor is rather sickly-sticky-sweet for my tastes.
Watch City Kingpin Imperial Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Watch City Brewing Co.;22oz bomber from the brewpub, bottled date 12/05/2002. Pour is jet black, with a small dark brown head which quickly recedes and leaves almost no lace. Aroma is roasty, doughy, sweet, with some grape raisin hinting in the back. Flavor is a good punch of sweet chocolate cookie, hints of the grape and raisin, and ends with some good roasty character to it. Full body, slight touch of alcohol in the end, long lingering roastiness adds a good finish.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;Same bottle as Hopdog, Weeare138. Tomdecapolis, and Egajdzis. Thanks steve. Pours a nice amber, slight haze and a very thin head. Aroma of spcies like cinnamon and nutmeg, warm apple pie, floral hops and caramel malts. Flavor is also loaded with spices, more cinnamon sweet gale, nutmeg and slight ginger root. Spices get a bit overwhelming, but is nice in a small sample. Could never drink a whole bottle of this stuff.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;Thanks to hopdog for this... Bottle has a keg label on it, stating it is 9.1 abv, vintaged ’03. Appears a hazy orange with a small white head and tiny bits of lace. Smell is flowery, sweet caramel candy, with cinnamon and nutmeg standing out. Taste is of spicey, sweet cinnamon with dashes of nutmeg. Mouthfeel is of spicey garbage, along with a half-decent malt balance that just isn’t making up for everything else that is lacking in this brew.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;22oz bottle acquired in trade. 2003 vintage. Poured a deeper and slightly hazy amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, lots of spices (nutmeg and ginger), and some dark fruits. Tastes of caramel, ginger, nutmeg, and dark fruits. Light alcohol in the finish.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;Poured a hazy amber color with a small, off white head that quickly diminished, leaving light lacing on the glass. Aroma of spruce, ginger, light dried fruits, and caramel malts. Taste was full of spices, cinnamon, light ginger, caramel malts, some nuts, light wood, and the alcohol was well hidden.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;Thanks to hopdog. Pours an orange amber with not much head. Aroma was very spicy, almost along the lines of a Christmas Ale with the nutmeg and all spice along with some caramel. Flavor of the same with maybe more of the yeast.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;2004 bottle, aged a year at the brewpub and sold there for $8.95 a 22oz. Consumed on 12/22/2005. This will be the last bottle I buy from them until I get some assurance that they have corrected their bottling issues. It’s almost as if they have tapped a keg, served half of it and then let the other half sit for a year and the bottled it. Upon opening, there is no carbonation, with a sour and tart mix of spices and old, stale malts. Bready and very medicinal from the nose, with plenty of spoiled fruits. Pouring the dirty, muddy, flat, uncarbonated brownish-date colored liquid and taking a sip, it is intensely oxidized, with muddled maple, brown sugar and caramel malts thick and sluggish in a water medium. 95% oxidation flavors and 5% beer. Truly despicable that they are selling these bottles.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;More of a critique than a rating, but some things have to be denounced. This was the 4th Watch City bottle I’ve tried in the last year, 4 different products (spring saison, biere de bordel, obscurite triple brown being the other ones) and they have huge oxidation problems with their bottling line. For having been at the pub, I know they are very good brewers, I consider their scotch ale as one of the best I’ve had, but those bombers they sell for takeout have been at least regularly highly oxidized, usually very low fills that barely reach the bottle necks and very expensive 8-9$. Clark sent them an email and nothing has been done, bottles still being sold, so he suggested I do enter the rating. It is of a headless muddy brown color, flat and without carbonation. Fruity oxidized, earthy nose grows into a nightmare in mouth where total syrupyness fmor the malt strikes heavy oldish spoiled apples and penny-like oxidation that eradicates all the pleasure.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap at WBUR’s brewers offering. Good nose, fruity, Plum, raisin, apple come to mind. Nice orange brown color. Small to no head. Sweet, spicy, fruity flavor. Same as aroma with maybe a little pine. Medium bodied, fruity dryish finish.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;Art of Beer Fest ’04. Dark brown with a slight haze and a small off-white head.Fruity and spicy aroma. Sweet malt flavor with a hint of caramel and butterscotch.
Watch City Saturnalea Solstice Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Watch City Brewing Co.;A little too sweet with caramel and butterscotch flavors. Quite tangy and a little sour, but not very well balanced.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Poured a nice golden color and had a typical IPA scent and flavor. Enjoyed the nice citrus bitterness.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;On tap at the brewery, pint size. Very ho hum for the style. Nonetheless enjoyable. The usual players, namely citrus and pine hops. Average mouthfeel.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Pours a slightly hazy copper color, with an inch of nearly white foam. Good lacing througout the glass. The aroma is full of candied peach and mild hops. The malt is light toffee and mildly fruity. It blends into a pronounced pine/citrus hop bitterness. The aftertaste is full of that same pine/citrus. Not quite medium body and smoothly carbonated. I would have liked some more malt, but still this beer is nicely drinkable
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;From Growler: Nice amber orange with small white head. Piney hop nose with peach , green pineapple and more. med weight with light sweetness and drying bitter finish. Creamy vanilla/peach flavor iwth light pine though a bit light in the mid palate. Great quaffing IPA
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Dark Orange Coloring With Big Off White Head. Nice Citrusy Orange Aroma and Hops. Heavy Hops on the Tongue to Begin With...Then The Orange Flavors Come Out Very Nicely...Very Rich Flavor...Like Sucking Juice From an Orange..Dry and Fruity Ending. Excellent IPA !!
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Hazy orange color with a medium head. Very nice hoppy aroma with a strong hit of orange. More of the same in the taste, but definitely on the sweet side. There’s a strong malt balance to the hops as well. Certainly not to style, but a damn tasty brew in my opinion.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Very hazy appearance, deep amber hue, nearing on orange, with an acceptable film of froth above. big, juicy aroma, dripping with fruit, cherry pits, drizzling nectarines, brimming over with berries, jumping with juicy fruit. On the palate, a big blitz of hops, and fruitiness, but there’s an overwhelming, how else can I put it, plasticene feel? ...a little soapy?...Just a little sticky-icky, and rubbery, too. Big, beefy presence on the palate, rounded and rimmed with just slightly bitter hoppy flavor, ...I like it okay, but it needs some work.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;St. Paul Winterfest 2/8/03. Excuse me, but I got a little sauced this night and was unable to read alot of my notes. I remember her lace she wore and her tastey snatch.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Nice overall hoppy bitterness, a bit on the watery side at the Pittsburgh location.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Anniversary IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Brewed by the Minneapolis location and served at Winterfest in St. Paul on Feb. 8. I had tried this brew a year ago on the night they tapped last Spring. I remember it being quite tasty. This time around it had a little bit of a diacetyl finish. Floral, perfumy hops in the nose. Initial mouthfeel is pleasant with fruity hops. But this brew must be heavy on the finishing hops and light on the bittering hops because the bitterness was only skin deep. Had a little bit of a homebrew feel to it as well.
Granite City Dear Abbey Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Granite City Food & Brewery;Cloudy dark yellow with a fizzy white head. Banana bread and bubble gum aroma and taste. Decent.
Granite City Dear Abbey Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Granite City Food & Brewery;GABF:2003 earthy, alcoholic, bitter for the style, carmels, not enough texture and body, good.

Granite City Dear Abbey Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Granite City Food & Brewery;"This was my ""South Dakota"" rating, taken at the GABF in 2003. The address of the brewery was then changed to that of the corporate office in Minnesota. Dark amber. Coriander, cloves, orange and lemon in the nose, but dominated by banana. A bit lacking of carbonation, but the big banana flavor and bread flavor is nice."
Granite City Dear Abbey Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Granite City Food & Brewery;Color is a liquidy off purpley brown with a thin cream colored head thats foamy and fades to leave tiny spots of lace. Smell is a bit faint of sweetish type malts with some raisin and fig, yeast brings out a bit of candy-like notes of toffee and honey glaze. Taste is uneventful unevenness with bland character, weak malts, light raisin and dried fruits of grape and fig, far too sweet, uneven and unpleasant sour notes dart all over. Very light body for a abbey dupple, nearly watery feel and was just plain and boring. This needs alot of help.
Granite City Dear Abbey Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Granite City Food & Brewery;MABR-Brown color,Malty aroma ,caramel and light fruit presence.Alcohol upfront in the taste that turns to a malty flavor with a bitter sweet after taste where the alcohol seemed to reappear.very nice brew I wish i could get more.
Granite City Dear Abbey Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Granite City Food & Brewery;Copper color.All of the qualities of this beer are subdued. Not much in the aroma, not much in the flavor. What little aroma present in the beer was of roasted wood. heavy on the palate.
Granite City Dear Abbey Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Granite City Food & Brewery;Another taste at St. Paul Winterfest 2/8/03. She was very stanky and I think everyone there knew it...including her. Orange in color..sweet but not too sweet. if you know what I mean.
Granite City Dear Abbey Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Granite City Food & Brewery;Served at Winterfest in St. Paul, MN on Feb. 8. Sweet, somewhat hoppy aroma. Flavor is way off. Has similar flavor profile to the Schultheiss Original Berliner Weiss. I believe it is better than the Schultheiss (which may excite those who like it), but it still isn't good.
Herkimer High Point Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Pours a clear brown (dark lighting so hard to see color), thin creamy head. Moderate malt aroma, no hop. Good malt flavor, some sweetness. Medium body, light hop bitterness. Pretty good, but their Alt is better.
Herkimer High Point Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;On tap at Herkimer Pub & Brewery. Dark brown, ruby lowlights and a thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, dark malts, and a hint of chocolate and caramel. Thin bodied brew finishes up dry. In between it’s uninspiring with roasted malt and light chocolate.
Herkimer High Point Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;On tap @ Herkimer. Dark red/brown appearance with a light tan head. Sweet brown malty nose. Slightly hoppy, somewhat nutty, brown malty lager flavor.
Herkimer High Point Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Appears darl brown, cloudy, reddish tint. Holding tan head. Aroma of light nuts, pecan and almond. Flavor is mostly of a toasted malt, some coffee, a tiny bit of toffee and sugar. Mostly watery, coffee palate. Not reminiscent of a dunkel, but rather a dunkel gone scotch ale or stout. Light, carbonated mouthfeel, heavy coffee taste on the finish.
Herkimer High Point Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub on 05/31/2009.

Rather sweet beer overall. Flavor is sweet malt and chocolate some roasted nut. Little bit of hops in the finish. Pretty decent dunkel. Service at the bar could be a little better though.
Herkimer High Point Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;This looks like my kind of beer. It even smells and tastes like my kind of beer. Lots of fresh (not burnt) malt with a nice balance of hops and just a dash of vanilla/toffee. The trouble is that it tastes like they took this nice beer and then mixed it with water. There’s a good beer in there, but it takes some work to find it.
Herkimer High Point Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Sampled at ABR 07 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Pours a semi-hazy dark brown brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that quickly dissipates to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of roasted multi-grain malt, some flowery hops and a touch of vanilla. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with flavors of dark roasted caramel malt, some flowery hops, some mild fruit character and a touch of vanilla. Finish is light, semi-dry with a multigrain malt aftertaste. Probably the best sampling from Herkimer at the ABR.
Herkimer High Point Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;ABR 2007. Dark brown body with no head. Roasted malts on the nose and similar taste. A little ight on the finish.
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;Dark brown liquid with a diminish lid of dark tan/brown bubbles. Roasted and black malt scents with just a bit of ash in the background. Light sweet malt mix with smoky malts. Fuller feel that gets trimmed by a bit of acidity. Bits of iodine add a somewhat peaty dimension. Sweet finish and linger. A smoked porter with training wheels.
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;12oz bottle. Black brown body, rusty beige head. More roast in the aroma than smoke, Pretty weak example of the style. Sort of tastes like a homebrew version of Stoned Smoked Porter. Cheapish feel to it. Drinkable, but unimpressive.
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;Black with a brown filmy one finger head. The smell is a bit boozy with some smoke, hops, and burnt malts. The flavor on the other hand is a very smooth blend of smoke, licorice, chocolate and malts with no booziness! Body is also pretty light with no carbonation and a very creamy feel to it. I never heard of Mantorville Brewing before I had this beer, but this is a pretty good smoked ale! I’ll be on the lookout for more offerings from them in the future
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;12 oz. bottle. Pours oily black/brown with a quick little khaki creamy/foamy looking head that leaves a small ring around glass. Aroma has subtle, noticeable smoke and peat along with some good roasted malt and dark fruit like plum, raisin and fig. Taste has a peat/smoke flavor along with nice bitterness and a tangy plum fruit finish. Palate is medium and slick with a dry finish. Very surprised by this beer, quit enjoyable!
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;Bottle. Black of course. Aroma has roasted grain and coffee. Roast in the flavor, with more coffee, as well as very mild acidic quality. But I do not pick up the smoke in the flavor or aroma.
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;Has a nice smokey roast and coffee flavor. Has a boozy smokey taste, not bad. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;(bottle) Pours jet black with light red around the edges and a very dark tan head that towers in the glass and takes quite awhile to recede. Aroma initially is very sweet and similar to concord grape juice, with some black licorice and chocolate, yet the smoke is very subdued. As this warms however, the smoke becomes far more apparent, and more roasted malts make their presence known. When cold, the flavor is very weak, with just a bit of smoke in the flavor coupled with an odd sweetness. Initially the beer was overcarbonated which made drinking it quite difficult, and the mouthfeel was very thin. I would suggest giving this beer a lot of time in the glass, because when it warms the aroma and flavor get more smoky, chocolate and dark fruits appear in the flavor, and the carbonation lowers to an appropriate level.
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;I just visited Mantorville, MN to check out the little brewery in this charming, history rich small town. I meet with owner/brewer Tod Fyten to check out his brewery and talk beer. While I was there, I was able to get a six pack of the newly bottled Stagecoach Smoked Porter that is no longer under agreement in Black River Falls, WI. This is only the second time it’s been bottled and is now bottled in Duluth, MN which stays true to its Minnesota roots. So...lets give it a try. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a black, thick viscous liquid with a nice tight mocha head. This one is as dark as night. In the nose I get notes of chocolate, coffee, peat smoke, and tobacco. There is a good amount of sweet roasted malts that blend well around the palate and finishes with a touch of smokiness. This almost has a spongy-like mouthfeel that starts out very smooth and ends with a little carbonation bite. Overall, this is a very enjoyable porter that I would recommend giving a try.
Stagecoach Smoked Porter;Mantorville, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Mantorville Brewing Co;Rich and bold flavors from a dark brown body, though the smoke notes (not intensely smokey, just roastsed) are paired with a lactic/sour twinge that is less than ideal for my taste. Bottle.

Pierlala Ursel;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;(Bottled, BBE 31.7.2009) Clear golden with a medium, foamy and cloudy, lacy head. Aroma is quite original with cookies, coconut, ripe fruit, and lambic-like tartness. Pale-grainy maltiness and quite evident tartness in the flavor, with hints of caramel and Xmas cookies. Almost medium body, pretty foamy carbonation (but strangely it suits this one). A very strange brew, and very hard to categorize. To me, this feels like 70% Xmas-Orval-spiced tripel and 30% lambic, but your mileage may vary. BBE is gone a few weeks ago, but I doubt it matters much.

Pierlala Ursel;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle, 33 cl. (bought @ Bierloods) Almost clear darkgolden color, with white head. Aroma fruits, malts, bit yeast. Medium body. Taste sweet, fruit and alcohol touch, bitterness end.
Pierlala Ursel;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Nose of grains, malt, cocos, a sweet smell that is characteristic for the brewery; later some citrusfruit notes too, and other yeasty aromas. Colour is dull (yeast somewhat in suspension) orange. Very fine, slightly irregular white head, quite stable. Sweet taste, with typical fruity, orangey-bitter surrounding. Like it or loathe it - I could do with a little less sweetness. It is not cloying. Retronasal gets notes from orange-filled chocolate. Definitely alcohol in the mouthfeel, reasonably full-bodied. The taste keeps evolving, in the aftertaste, the flavours turn to some kind of fruit-liqueur, quite pleasing. To be honest, this brewery gives me the creeps for its unending label-story. Pierlala is a labelbeer for the town of Ursel, probably Augustijn. But, as the hands are shown, there isn't much wrong with the beer itself. You could get much worse..."

Tustin American Pale Ale;Tustin, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tustin Brewing Company;Tap at Tustin, A nice way to finish an evening of drinking, but this one is mild and bland a suitable beer for those venturing to the hop side, but not enough punch and too much malty finish for me.
Tustin American Pale Ale;Tustin, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tustin Brewing Company;On draft. Clear golden pour, with a white head and some lacing. Moderately hoppy aroma, with flavors of caramel malt, bread, light hops, and some citrus. Not a very interesting pale ale, rather bland.
Tustin American Pale Ale;Tustin, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tustin Brewing Company;Draft. Pours gold with a white head. Fruity and lightly piney hops, with light malty sweetness. Bright and clean and drinkable, with great hops flavor and not a ton of unnecessary bitterness. All those nerds below me clearly don’t know how to drink beers, with one was pretty damn good.

Tustin American Pale Ale;Tustin, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tustin Brewing Company;Sparkling gold color, white head. I smelled some hops in this along with biscuity malts. But the flavor left me wondering where the hops were. Malty with spent hops on the finish. Meh.

Happy Hours;Dali, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yunnan Dali Beer Group (Carlsberg);Absolutely horrible. No aroma to speak of, a VERY pale yellow color, and virtually no taste. Beer-flavored water at best. Skip this one if you ever see it.

Dali Beer 12º;Dali, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yunnan Dali Beer Group (Carlsberg);Bland unexciting aroma of malt. Yellow color that is not very attractive. Good carbonation though. A mild chemical taste, that might be green tea, but I'm never sure with Chinese beers. Heavy flavor of rice. Avoid
Dali Beer 10.5º;Dali, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yunnan Dali Beer Group (Carlsberg);Big bottle. Thanks A. Pours gold, two second fizzy head. Nose of acetaldehyde, flavour has some Asahi dryness going on. No vegetables at least. Finish is rough. Asian beer is just as bad as I remember it, the North Americans rating Bud and Coors as the worst they’ve ever tried really have no idea.
Dali Beer 10.5º;Dali, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yunnan Dali Beer Group (Carlsberg);Poured from 470 ml bottle at restaurant in Lijiang, China. Clear bright yellow with tiny white head and fair lacing both of which dissipate quickly. Looks exactly like . . . Well, you know. Mild ricy aroma once the beer warms a little. Taste of rice. Not strong. Unpleasant astringent aftertaste. Thin body with high carbonation. Unpleasant mouthfeel. An absolutely dreadful beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Dali Beer 10.5º;Dali, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yunnan Dali Beer Group (Carlsberg);Golden with a soft sparkle. Appley aroma bears perhaps some lightstruck notes. Fizzy, malty, grainy. Kind of sweet.
Dali Beer 10.5º;Dali, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yunnan Dali Beer Group (Carlsberg);Another generic Chinese beer. For all of the different beers in this country, you'd think they'd taste a little different. Anyway, a malty aroma, golden color, mild carbonation, and generally uninteresting flavor. But a 22oz is about $.68
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);330ml bottle. Poured a very thin pale yellow with absolutely no head at all. There was very little aroma to speak of and the taste was watery and thin - no substance to this beer at all.
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Awful corn fired watery mess with a nasty metallic aftertaste. Not even a proper kick due to low ABV. Cheap and grainy. Bad.
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);...bottle. Didn’t realize this was a mid-strenther, but couldn’t really tell. Watery, light bodied mouthfeel, with hints of malt. Other than that, nothing, it was cheap, but still not really worth it because it has no alcohol, there are other better choices if you just want to get ripped.
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Good head,gold colour beer,carbonation good.Head back to lace cover.Aroma good hops and malt a mushroom smell.Flavour bitter,hops,metallic taste bitter finish as well as metallic.
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Sorry Sully from Stanmore. This beer is very ordinary but I’m reasonably sure that it is not mid-strength. I’m drinking one at the moment (oh dear!) and it says 5% alc. vol.
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);This is a very average beer. However, if you are on a tight budget is very good value for money - how many beers do you see for less than AU$25 per carton??
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);bottled. standard yellow, fizzy stuff. light body, cardboard, a hint of bitterness, that’s all
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Mid strength beers are the lost soul of the beer world. They meander from pub to pub trying to ply their wares to those drinkers who can’t choose between full strength and light. At this ABV you are getting one standard drink which means that the allure for designated drivers is not there either. In keeping with the XXXX style of midstrength this one is called gold, because it is valuable or desirable? No, more likely that it is metallic and would appeal to sheilas.
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);"This beer is the midstrength version of the Haagens regular malt lager, and I COULDN’T PICK OUT A DIFFERENCE! Pale golden, clear, medium head. Pretty boring. Sweet malt is really all you get for flavour (the same as all corn-adjunct, over-processed pale lagers on the market). I wouldn’t choose to drink it again if an alternative were available, but I wouldn’t turn it down if the beerfridge was empty on a Friday night. This is my standard review for all ""two-star-or-less"" piss. Surprising, given this is supposed to be from an ""independent brewer""-- it doesn’t taste much different from the macro brewers lagers."
Haägen Gold;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);a good drinking beer good overall flavor and texture dosent have the body of regal but a good midstringth beer
Pizza Port Shark Bitten Double Red Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Hmm, the beer we tried was called Shark Bite Imperial Red Ale... Not sure if that’s the same beer or not, but it was tasty! Loads of malt to balance out the incredible amount of hop presence. This one is thick and syrupy, like liquid gold. Smooth and very mellow in spite of how big this beer is. Very nice.
Pizza Port Shark Bitten Double Red Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Clear, deep red with a short off-white head. Hoppy, citrus aroma. Good pine and resin qualities as well, with very little malt. More flavor that the Shark Bite, but still nicely balanced. Grapefruit, oranges, wood, malt, and a little caramel.

Pizza Port Shark Bitten Double Red Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottled, snagged from BevMo. Good tasting brew, hangs somewhere between a good Red and a good single IPA. More malty and smoother than a full IPA, but a little complex in flavor like and IPA. I have only been to the PizzaPort site once, and I am way overdue for libations down that way...

Pizza Port Shark Bitten Double Red Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Damn good amber ale. Hoppy, but not too hoppy. Seems almost to be their flagship ale, the restaurant is rarely without it. And I can’t seem to leave without having one every time. Malty enough to satisfy hunger. Hoppy enough to make you hungry. Huh?
Pizza Port Shark Bitten Double Red Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);"On tap from the brewpub. Tasted during trip to California.

Pizza Port Shark Bitten Double Red Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);On tap at the 2005 OBF. Pours mahogany with a small off-white head. Big citrus hops in the nose giving this beer a very crisp, long trailing, bitter finish. Malts tasted kinda caramel and cerealy. Nice beer, but the bitterness just stays with you forever.

Pizza Port Shark Bitten Double Red Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Poured a nice bubbly 1 inch head at the Oregon Brew Festival, that faded quick.

Pizza Port Pillbox Pale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Resinous green hops oversee their citrusy friends in a quite quaffable number…Pineapples floating around for good measure help to balance it all out with their intrinsic sweetness…A competent and tasty thirst pharmacist…
Pizza Port Pillbox Pale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);"(Nitro Draft: Pizza Port in Solana Beach, CA) A light style pale ale, mellow like an English pale ale, and kind of boring actually for a Pizza Port beer; It’s on nitro, so the pour is a full glass of creamy white head that eventually settles to a half-inch thick, white, creamy head; Very mellow flavor, lightly malty with some mild bitterness and citrus; Light, smooth and creamy on the palate; The mild nose is lightly hoppy with a bit of citrus; Light golden color; Lacing is more clumpy and dense than fine and delicate; NOTE to ratebeer admins: even the Pizza Port beer menu calls this a pale ale"
Pizza Port Pillbox Pale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);On tap@Solana beach pub: Rich golden color with a small (bar pour) creamy white head. Nose is sweet with a hint of citrus. Flavor starts light and sweet followed by a touch of light grapefruit and a lightly bitter finish. IPA? More of an extra pale IMHO. Good with pepperoni pizza with extra cheese.
Pizza Port Pillbox Pale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Served on nitro, it poured extremely smooth and fluffy. Aroma and apperance are more like a Pale than an IPA. Slightly bitter and fruity. Finished more bitter than expected.
Pizza Port Pillbox Pale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Light gold color. VERY large creamy head. The pour looked like a blond Guinness. Aroma is a touch citrusy and fruity. My nose made a huge dent in the foam while testing for aroma. A very creamy, medium bodied IPA. Fruity and a touch sour. Malts are fruity with a touch of banana. Hops are spicy and floral. Sort of understated for an IPA. Very creamy. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with a touch of banana about halfway through.
Pizza Port Pillbox Pale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Yummy hops, honey, and gardinia in the nose. Most of wich goes into the mouth with mellow resins, a little musk, malt, fresh hop flowers, and a hint of vannila. Finishes with a thick and toasty charactor but still manages a dryness. Unfortuanatly I think the nitro killed a little of this.
Pizza Port Pillbox Pale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);This was listed as a Pillbox Pale on the board but while I was drinking it I classed it as closer to an IPA and am therefore figuring it's the same beer. Poured from the cask it looks like a cloudy Boddington's, never really clearing up, with a good thick enduring foam. Sweet lemon and orange aroma, creaminess on the palate but relatively light in body. Sweet fruity and lightly biscuity malts, lemon hop flavors and a hint of honey. Finishes fairly dry with a touch of grapefruit.
Pizza Port Pillbox Pale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);This was a very nice PA. It was the perfect brew to start off a night of hard beer drinking. Very nice hops up front, but it ended up with a weak watery taste, kind of like a reverse mullet- all party up front, business in the back.

Green Flash Nut Brown Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;Green Flash Brewing Company;Bottle. Light brown, clear, thin tan head. Sweet, almost a little syrupy aroma -- heavy malt. Medium body and carbonation. Strong nutty taste and finish. A little too nutty for my preference.

Green Flash Nut Brown Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;Green Flash Brewing Company;One of my least favs of gf beers, it smells like yeast and toasted malts. Taste is bitter malts and slightly wheat tasting. It’s ok but not my fav.
Ortliebs Vanilla Porter;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;A great porter. This recipe made the transfer to Ortleibs Brewery and Grille at Sunnybrook. Excellent vanilla aroma, and a smooth, dry, vanilla finish.
Ortliebs Vanilla Porter;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;What an excellent example of a flavored dark beer, just about black in color with an awesome soft lacy tan head that followed the beer all the way down the glass, rich malty profile, the perfect amount of vanilla in the flavors & aftertaste to blend everything together, sweet malty aftertaste, very smooth, very drinkable, could have sat in there all night & drank this one, awesome porter
Ortliebs Winter Warmer;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - English;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;This is a good winter warmer. I had this recipe lasy Christmas at Sunnybrook, and they have promised to make it a yearly brew. Well worth trying if you are in the area.
Ortliebs Winter Warmer;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - English;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;A little below average when it comes to this style of a seasonal, amber in color, soft lacy white head, more of a hoppy profile than a big malty one that provides a lot of the alcohol associated with this style, a little unbalanced toward the hoppiness
Kirner 1798;Kirn, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirner Privatbrauerei;pours a clear amber color with an decent head. Aroma of malt, mild citrus and grass.

Im Antrunk erstaunlich frisch und gehaltvoll, einem guten Export ähnelnd. Leicht röstmalziger Geschmack, schön rezent und hopfig-herb ausklingend.

Kirner 1798;Kirn, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirner Privatbrauerei;The beer in the glass is amber-colored, with a beautiful sparkling head.

Kirner 1798;Kirn, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirner Privatbrauerei;Small head. Pretty straightforward. Not much on character. Some good hops. That’s about it.

Kirner 1798;Kirn, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirner Privatbrauerei;Pours light amber with small head. Nondescript aroma. Starts out okay-ish while cold, but as the beer heats up it quickly loses carbonation and gains a rather unpleasant funky metallic flavour. Not good.
Kirner 1798;Kirn, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirner Privatbrauerei;Das mit Abstand beste Bier der Brauerei! Die Schaumentwicklung ist zwar mies, das Bier selber allerdings ist durchaus gut trinkbar. Der Mittelteil besticht vor allem durch de süß-herben Geschmack, ehe es im Nachgeschmack sekündlich malziger wird und genau im richtigen Moment aufhört, noch malziger zu werden. Ordentliches Bier!

Kirner 1798;Kirn, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirner Privatbrauerei;Bottled thanks Bierkrug! Almost clear amber, rich firm head. Some metal shows up in the nose, between doughy malt and grassy hops. Dry and crisp with slim body and rounded mouthfeel. Doughy malt lies as a firm foundation, the salty grassy finish becomes gradually more bitter. Notes of blood and metal lies on a distance and ruins some of the fun.
Kirner 1798;Kirn, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirner Privatbrauerei;Bottle. Amber color, thin, sugar, moderate carbonation. Nothing that stands out in the end. Easy to drink.
Flying Fish Love Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flying Fish Brewing Company;OBF. Very nice mix of dark fruit and caramel malts. Cherries might add another dimension, but they don’t jump out at you. Still, very nice Dubbel.

Flying Fish Love Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flying Fish Brewing Company;OBF 2008. I thought this was just going to be the dubbel they bring every year, but the cherries added a nice twist to it. I didn’t get a lot of cherry flavor, but it did tend to add a good sweet fruit flavor to the finish that before I read that this had cherries I thought tasted like pie. The spices blend well with caramel tones and a sweet fruit flavor to give this an interesting pie like flavor.
Flying Fish Love Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Very interesting beer, Belgian style.. Nice cherry undertones. Well balenced carbonation.

Light hazy pale golden colour. Cottony white foam. Jelly fruity, with floral uk hops in aroma. Flowery, berry-ish hop flavour with light bitterness. Incredibly fresh for being this old.

Bass Dukes Ale;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);Coors have taken over the famous Bass Museum which makes Worthington White Shield and other historic ales. Part of the Bass/Worthington history is the annual brewing of a Royal Ale. On 3 July 2002 The Queen and Prince Philip arrived in the town of Burton on Trent by Royal Train to celebrate 1,000 years of brewing in the town as well as 100 years of the production of Marmite. Marmite is made from surplus brewers yeast, and was sent out to soldiers serving in Mesopotamia (Iraq) where vitamin deficiency diseases were common. After visiting The Abbey Garden where monks first brewed beer in Burton around 1002 AD, they moved on to The Bass Museum and started the mash for Queen's Ale and Duke's Ale - a tradition started on 22 February 1902 by King Edward VII. The beer is a lovely mahogony colour and has a rich fruit cake and alcohol aroma and taste with a good sharp bite of hops to offset the sweetness. A very smooth and tasty but not too complex beer which leans toward a Barley Wine, but is less assertive.

Herkimer Vienna Country Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Draft @ Brewpub: Copper, no head or lacing. Nose of ripe canal water and malt, light caramel, some diacetyl. Dry mouthfeel but a sweet flavor, odd. Not that good.

Not a lot of aroma: a bit of malt, just a touch of roasted nuts. Lightly roasted malt and just a hint of hops on the palate. Refreshing and not wholly undrinkable.

OHaras Dubbel Trouble;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Pours auburn brown with a nice copper/red color when held to the light. About a 1/2 inch head that diminishes quickly with minimal lacing. Slight fruity, raisin aroma. Mild bisquit malt and candi sugar flavor. Definite yet mild Belgian yeast character to both aroma and flavor. Nice mouthfeel, medium body, slightly sticky and mildly carbonated. A nice beer. Serving type: growler
OHaras Dubbel Trouble;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;The beer is a beautifully clear auburn brown that really shows off some reddish copper color when held up to the light. About half an inch of light tan foam recedes to a thin ring in a minute or so, but the etching at the bottom of the Chimay glass keeps a steady stream of tiny bubbles slowly rising to the surface. Scant lacing. Aroma of candied fruit and a little bit of bread. I like the flavor - toasted and biscuit malt, light candi sugar, and a tangy fruitines that reminds me a little of gooseberry. A hint of black tea tannin in the finish and into the aftertaste. Medium body, gentle carbonation, quite a pleasant beer.
OHaras Dubbel Trouble;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Like the name for sure, but didnt like the beer as much. Not really my style of beer in the first place. Once again, a bit to sweet for my tastes, but still drinkable.

OHaras Dubbel Trouble;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Clear deep copper. Nose sweet and spicy, lots of caramel and candy sugars. Tastes of candied raisins, bit nutty, lots of sugars. Some fruitiness, berries. Strong stuff, but good.
OHaras Dubbel Trouble;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Growler poured to the very top, good job, guys. Sweet caramel malt spills immediately from the aroma...on further inspection, wide-open, earthy, dark fruits, raisins, nuts, nice...sweet and lovely... Deep brown color, with burgundy highlights, with nice, if short -lived, fizzy brown head. Taste: sweetness again, big, rich malt, caramel and mellow fruit, light spice, ...and absolutely delcious. Some grit in the texture, some give and play, a tasty dance on the tongue. Fullish body, sweet, fruity finish...solid. Might lack a touch of complexity, but it’s simplicity is reward enough, if the flavor is this fine. An easy-drinking dubbel, impossible to stop drinking it. I like this quite a lot, it’s a respectable dubbel, and I’m happy that the first beer I’ve reviewed out of the city of St. Cloud, MN is such a gutsy and tasty one.
OHaras Dubbel Trouble;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;The winner of the St Paul Winterfest 2/8/03. I describe her as very sweet. Problem is when a guy describes her as very sweet you know that means she isn't very good looking. She had orange hair and gave no head. A sour puss..GAY! I don't understand why she won.
OHaras Dubbel Trouble;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;"Co-winner of the traveling Showshoe Award at Winterfest in St. Paul, MN on Feb. 8 (along with Cywrens Song Chocolate Raspberry Stout from Hops Restaurant & Brewery - Eden Prairie, MN) for best of show. I was less than enamored by this brew. It had a hard alcohol aroma (vermouth?). Very sweet to the taste; the alcohol is not overbearing. Not bad, just too sweet."
Green Mill Knockadoon Irish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Compared to the Goldflint, it is more aromatic, less watery, Also there is a little more hops in here, but still not that much. a little bit of spiciness that livens it up a little from very boring to lightly boring.
Green Mill Knockadoon Irish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Draft @ Brewpub: A dull amber color, light head and nice lacing. Nose of light malt and hop, not much there. The flavor is all band aid, super woody and medicinal. Horrible.
Green Mill Knockadoon Irish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;On tap at the St Paul brewpub (sampler). I would normally expect an Irish Ale to have an element of red in the colour. This was decidedly golden in appearance. A touch of smoky malt in the aroma. Smooth and malty of the palate, with a more apparent smokiness. Not much hop in evidence. Drinkable, but nothing special.

No lacing, exceptionally mild and inoffensive malt in the aroma. A little bit of caramel malt, but not really enough to give it much character. A very little bit of peat in the finish, but no where near enough to give it character. Light bodied and very average. What makes this Irish? Well, at least it isn’t green.
Green Mill Knockadoon Irish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Copper color with no head. Dusty hops aroma.

Green Mill Knockadoon Irish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Winterfest St. paul 2/8/03. I am Irish so I may be biased...but she tasted good...she's a red who who wears lace. A tough combo.
Green Mill Knockadoon Irish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Served at Winterfest in St. Paul, MN on Feb. 8. Aroma is malty and sweet.

Gerulfus Tripel Merendree;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Colour of old gold, clear; very fine lacy white head, stable. Nose is slightly spicey and sweetish - some madeirisation? - though not old. Very little aroma, really. taste of orange rind, high percentage of unfermented sugar; sweet surrounded by bitterness. Very rounded, full-bodied. Alcohol prominent. In the aftertaste, the non-hop bitterness becomes obstructive. Again one of Van Steenberge's labelbeers for a community in its neighbourhood.

Aroma speziato, pungente e acidulo con sentori di salvia, limone, cannella e forse chiodo di garofano; gusto inizialmente acidulo che evolve subito verso un amaro prepotentemente erbaceo con forti note di erbe medicinali e spezie, che ricreano però un bouquet decisamente spiacevole. Corpo lieve, effervescenza debole, setosa ma anche un po’ acquosa. Non fa per me."

The foam is moderate and chunky, the aroma offers blackcurrant and raspberry, and a lot of other fruits, but the aforementioned black currants and raspberries are the main theme. The taste is a fine blend of various berries with the sweetness of the berries featured. It does not have much other than berries to offer, and you can miss a little fruity acidity, now hop bitterness is omitted. It is actually fast boring, although it initially had good rates.

Westons Marcle Millennium Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Marcle cider is an alias for Westerns. Not sure about the millennium one though. Light golden and very flat, subtle, sweet and with a bitter aftertaste. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Westons Marcle Millennium Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;I should have known something was up with 8.4% ABV content. The best way to describe this stuff is medicianl. It sort of reminds me of the first time I tried a single malt with my father-in-law. It is quite rough on the nose as the alcohol hits you from square one. The drink is not too distasteful, but the aftertaste really put the hammer on me. Probably the best way to describe this cider is that it is strong English cider that perhaps my palate is not quite ready for.

This has a real farmhouse character, wonderfully rough and tart and an absolute contrast to the standard Gwatkin Golden Valley cider just consumed. I wish I knew how a scrumpy was differentiated from a standard cider, its lovely but coarse, dry but tart mmhhh.. it would go well with a bit quality of cheddar. Good stuff. A6 A4 T6 P3 Ov12 3.1

Cambridge Golden Ring Abbey Pale Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cambridge Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear golden-light orange color. The head was white and left some lace on the glass. Unusual aroma that included the likes of apple cider and a bit of honey. Not what I expected. Light to medium bodied. Delicately sweet up front with mild bitterness at the end. Fruit forward flavors including apple, lime, and subdued orange. The fruit flavors were supported by some spices, predominantly clove, which were initially muted, but grew in intensity somewhat toward the end.

Cambridge Golden Ring Abbey Pale Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cambridge Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Light, clean Belgian ester nose. Almonds and citrus. Pours a clouded amber, thick and meaty with a rim in off-white. Wow. Intense hop flavor, actually very forward and mixed with delicious phenols. Really grassy and parchingly dry in the hops. Fresh and dank. Reminiscent of marijuana strains. High carbonation actually lifts this a lot. The malt is hidden beneath a wonderful blossom of hops and yeast flavor. A nice beer. Maybe a touch out of balance, but something I’m really digging.

Cambridge Golden Ring Abbey Pale Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cambridge Brewing Company;Slightly cloudy golden body with a small white head.

I didn’t feel any of the advertised wild yeast that many reviewers got. I was looking forward to drinking a Golden Ring but ended-up regretting it. Same goes with many men wearing a golden ring.

Faint aroma of hay and caramel with some floral notes. Lightly fizzy in the mouth with medium carbonation, some gentle bready malt flavours, but no real hop presence, a good balance between the soft sweetness and mild bitterness.

Seabright Old Okole {Oh Ko Lay};Santa Cruz, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Seabright Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub ages ago; review from notes. Pours a clear amber color with a firm tan head. Citric sweet aroma -- candied oranges, caramel, pine. Flavor is much the same, lots of deep sweet maltiness and a strong fruity hop profile. Plays well off the alcohol notes but this is a little tough to get through a snifter. Palate fatigue from all angles -- boozy, sweet, thick. A nice offering in extreme moderation."
Seabright Old Okole {Oh Ko Lay};Santa Cruz, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Seabright Brewery;A fairly well done barleywine of the hoppier variety. Nice malt body, bit of alcohol burn in the finish. Doesn’t greatly stand out, but it’s a nice barleywine.

Fruity and piney hop aroma and a good amount of caramel as well. Malty flavor with some deeper caramel and dried fruit, but a big hop flavor and bitterness come together with smooth alcohol in the finish to really balance things out. Moderately fruity but very resiny and piney. Full bodied. After the last couple years of sweeter barley wines, I like the hoppy balance of this one. Definitely similar to something like SN Bigfoot.

Terminal Gravity Bucolic Plague Barleywine;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Tap at Horse Brass in two different years! 02 and 05. Both versions were very tasty though different, with a much more pronounced earthen/pine hop presence in the 05. The 02 was a smooth malt bomb, delicious meld of caramel, brown sugar and dark fruit. The 05 had all that but a little less pronounced and with more hoppiness. Would drink both versions again in a heartbeat.

WinterCoat ESB;Sabro, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;WinterCoat;July 2017 - Bottle share at LKS. Thanks Leighton! As 'WinterCoat ESB'. Dark brdown, orange hue, translucent, foamy off-white head. Aroma is pretty phenolic and smoky, mega phenolic, burnt grass, the soil under a garden incinerator. Body is light and frothy with soft carbonation. Taste is more of the same – phenolic, smoke, lightly woody. Obviously not meant to be like this and wouldn't do well if judged to style/for flaws. Objectively, I don't mind the smoky vibes that much but the thin body spoils it. (5-4-4-2-11=2.6)

John Smiths Magnet (Cask);Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);First tasted this in the Woodsman, Burneston in June 1986. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper red in colour with a thick creamy white head. Strong metallic taint in the short aroma. Creamy smooth mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt base gives digestive biscuit base with tart fruit notes of woody redcurrant. Aggresive bitter hop resins and hard water salts add to the astringency building up in the aftertaste. Finish is harsh and metallic with a touch of malt. Would avoid this one.

Robinson Lager;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);"Light yellow in appearance – a little lighter than your standard micro lager. The almost-nonexistent aroma is barely inviting: traces of malt and sugar, and no hop character. The taste is quite lemony, and there’s even a dusting of lemon on the lips at the end of the pint. Overall very light and simple; more annoying than refreshing."
Robinson Lager;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Dry, touch of malt. Acidic hops, vinegar was added? Could it be cheap white wine? Trying to be crisp, but why brew this? Like their pilsner wit more carbonation.
Robinson Lager;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Very malty nose, pale yellow, tiny white head. Slight malt flavour, watery, lifeless. Poor.
Robinson Lager;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);"Very light malt aroma, some aromatic hops but to faint to have some effect on me. Medium body, some cream, with slightly unusual flavour. Not sure what kind of hops they used, but my feeling tells me that must be something I do not drink to often. I believe highly acidic hops makes that ""strange white vine"" taste as C.Khaki mentioned below. Interesting pilsner/lager ."
Robinson Lager;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);A fruity aroma with malts, pale gold in colour. The head is faint yellow in colour with large bubbles that dissapears quick. It has hints of white wine in the taste which I find really strange. Alot of carbonation in the mouth with a faint lingering bitter finish. Nice but odd with the wine taste.

Sacramento Babylon Barleywine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sacramento Brewing Company;Draft 2006 vintage on tap at SBC brewpub. Copper color with lacy white head. Brown sugar/molases in the nose. Buttery feel on the palate, mild hop bitternesss which I like in a barleywine.

Sacramento Babylon Barleywine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sacramento Brewing Company;Draft at the Oasis in Citrus Heights (Sacramento). 100 IBU. Rich malty aroma with resiny hop. Very dark mahogany color with fizzy carbonation. Very roasted caramel with pine/resin hop. Definitely some heat, but it does not interfere. Finish is the sweet goes away and leaves all that wonderful bitter. It is a tad harsh.
Sacramento Babylon Barleywine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sacramento Brewing Company;Samples of the 2005 and 2006 brews at the Sacramento Brewing BW festival. The 2006 version was totally lacking in BW character, perhaps due to the use of lager yeast. There was no discernible maltiness, it was way too bitter (overhopped), and there was an unpleasant petroleum-like finish. The 2005 version was much better and truer to the BW style - slightly sweet and moderately malty with a flowery honey overtone. My rating is a composite (overal for 2005 is 13, 2006 is 8.
Sacramento Babylon Barleywine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sacramento Brewing Company;"4 ounce sample at Sacramento Brewing’s Barleywine Frestival. 2005 Vintage - 2 years old. Faint, lightly vinous, lightly boozy aroma. There are also somelight fruit notes and no hops to be found. Beautiful transparent garnet-amber body with a nice light tan head. Fruity, sweet start with some booziness and grapey vinousness in the middle. Finishes with some dry hops and tannins. Too thin and watery IMO. Seems kind of minty and ""green""."

Hebridean Celtic Black Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Porter;Hebridean Brewing Co.;This is very very poor, tastes like cheap home brew with dye in it, as a native Stornowegian trying it in bottle the County Bar I am ashamed. May I suggest the misguided amateurs who concocted this travesty take a wee trip down to Thwaites (home of Thwaites Tavern Porter) and see how the professionals work.
Hebridean Celtic Black Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Porter;Hebridean Brewing Co.;Bottle, from The Highland Bottle Shop, on the train from Inverness to Plockton 21/10/13. Very dark mahogony brown with a thin light tan swirl atop the surface. Nose is dark fruits, bready malts, fruit cake, earthy. Taste comprises cardboard, dark fruit tang, faint cocoa, light tarteness to the fruit. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, drying finish. Sub par home brew-esque state of affairs!

Taste of sour malt with an aftertaste of sparkling spring water. Not really what I expected from a porter but refreshing.
Hebridean Celtic Black Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Porter;Hebridean Brewing Co.;"Bottle from a restaurant in Stornoway. Has a strong bread and barley aroma, very little head and a black body. Flavour is a watery mess of nothing followed by a hint of malt; palate is all water.

Full Sail Old Boilermaker;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;98 draft. cloudy opaque dull brown and orange body with a small off-white head. surprisingly bright nose for something that’s presumably been sitting in oak barrels for over a decade, and the expected signs of oxidation are happily absent. grain bill seems to have more pale malt than most vintages of boardhead i’ve had (which were more dark caramel in color). though it’s turbid and yeasty, the malt is succulent and decadently chewy, the hops balance the sweetness and both the level of alcohol present and the bourbon and oak flavors themselves are well-matched for the body, weight and sweetness of this beer. call me surprised, i wasn’t in the mood for anything like barley wine and certainly wasn’t feeling like bourbon barrelled barley wine, but this stuff impressed me. legit.
Full Sail Old Boilermaker;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;1998 vintage on tap at Fredfest. Pours murky copper with a decent beige head anda fruity aroma. There is a delicious fruit, toffee and vanilla flavor that is mellow as can be.

Full Sail Old Boilermaker;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;Tap @ FredFest... Holy crap!!!! This was a buzz beer right from the gates. Half pours only allowed this to last about a half hour into the fest. Poured clear, golden with an off-white head. Despite being a 1998 vintage, this still had so much heat going. Lots of whiskey flavors, oak and wood tones, creme-brulee, malts, and big time sweetness.
Full Sail Old Boilermaker;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;98 vintage. Goodness. This beer was brewed when I got married. That’s perspective. Sherry nose, amazed in the complexity between caramel and wood. Sublime, more impressed at how this beer as stood up, velvet as a fine port, melodic. Visceral. Wood note has crescendoed, and the bourbon seems to have become sweeter and condensed and taken on notes of cherry. Applause all around.

Glacier Big Woody Barleywine;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Glacier Brewhouse;On tap at Glacier brew house. This was poured into a wine glass. The appearance was a dark brown color with no head and no lacing. The smell had a big fresh boozy sweet vanilla. A light sweet woody traces my nose nicely. The taste copied the smell and added a big boozy punch on my taste buds in the aftertaste. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly good sipping quality about it. The carbonation was smooth as a good barleywine should. Overall, this was a pretty good barleywine that I would have again.

Glacier Big Woody Barleywine;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Glacier Brewhouse;This is marketed as a different beer than the regular Big Woody, and the alcohol percentage is different, so I think it warrants a new entry.

Pours a clear copper with a small tan head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass.

Broadstone Priorswell Porter;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Porter;Broadstone;Gravity Cask, Catford Beer Festival. Acidic as hell - almost like a lambic. Blackcurrant. Dark as night. Oak qualities and some ripe, damp earth. More interesting than pleasant, though it is pleasant enough.
Broadstone Priorswell Porter;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Porter;Broadstone;(Cask condtioned). Sampled at the Wear Valley CAMRA beer festival, where it was served at room temperature with no carbonation. Dark ruby colour, OKish porter with just too little of everything.

Santa Barbara Grim Reaper;Santa Barbara, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Cask Version. Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty, sweet and fruity. Medium bodied barley wine. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are slightly bitter. Nicely balanced. No alcohol bite. A little mild and frankly kind of uninteresting. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Santa Barbara Grim Reaper;Santa Barbara, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;well, it doesn't really give me the barleywine feel, cause i'm not sure if it really is one. It kinda gave me a slightly hopped up vegetable beer jacked on alcohol. Decent.
Santa Barbara Grim Reaper;Santa Barbara, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Tap @ brewery. Little head. Alcohol nose with hops very present. Light amber esp for the style. Good mouthfeel at first but as it warms the sweetness becomes cloying. Rather one dimensional.
Santa Barbara Grim Reaper;Santa Barbara, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Tap @ Toronado Barley Wine Festival. Amber color with a brown head. Vinous, dark fruits, and lots of hops. I like it. Brewed in November 2002 and sampled in February 2003. I had it twice and liked it both times.

Valley Brew Steamroller Wheat;Stockton, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Valley Brewing Company;On tap at the 2003 Toronado Barleywine Festival: Malt liquor with a dollop of cream. Gah! Metallic. Not good. What I imagine a barley wine brewed by Budweiser would taste like.
Mia and Pias Blast Off Barleywine;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Sampler at M&P. Supposedly aged in Gentleman Jack bourbon barrels, this barley wine was complex, flavorful and smooth to drink. After all the trash we went through, this was a welcome end to the evening.

Mia and Pias Blast Off Barleywine;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;On nitro tap at Green Dragon which led to a discussion about the pros and cons of nitro taps. Red amber beer. Thick intoxicating aroma almost makes you drunk. Creamy airy body, of course. High alcohol. Seems to be lacking in character and definitive flavour profile.
Mia and Pias Blast Off Barleywine;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Pours amber with a small white head. The brewer warned it might be a bit undercarbonated, but it was a lighter bodied barleywine, so it didn’t feel to heavy anyway. Soft palate, smooth caramel and a subtle spiciness to the hops. This was aged in bourbon so it had a nice buttery character, not overwhelming, but very complimentary. This wasn’t over the top, but just a solid easy sipping barleywine, no excess alochol, just smooth and mellow.
Mia and Pias Blast Off Barleywine;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;[2006 Lucky Labrador Barley Wine & Big Beer Festival] 4oz Taster – This was a cloudy dark amber color. Very sweet and simple profile. Has a peach flavor coming off the brew. Liked the flavor and the rich malts. I was thrown by the little complex flavor that this beer should have. Seemed to come off light to me.
Mia and Pias Blast Off Barleywine;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;"The words ""Blast off"" will forever by associated by me with Robert Esmie and this beer won’t change that. Hazy amber colour. Old (oxidized) smell is chewy and peachy with thick, fat malts. Quite sweet and simple profile, again a bit peachy. Decent flavour but lacks complexity and flavour development...which you’d expect a 3 year old sample to have."
Mia and Pias Blast Off Barleywine;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Draught at Rose and Raindrop, Portland (2003 vintage). Clear pale brown. Nutty roastiness and grapefruity hops up front. Sweet, mature and full bodied. Restrained aromawise, flavourwise it has loads of toffee and alcohol and some crystal malt flavour. Lightly salty finish with fairly low bitterness.
Mia and Pias Blast Off Barleywine;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;This is a relentless barleywine fron the beginnging and never lets go. Delicious sweetness on the patale, big and malty with alot of alcochol, but never cloying. Lots of fruity and yeastiness coming through in the finish with alot of hop bitterness.
Mia and Pias Blast Off Barleywine;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Sweet start, red fruits and slightly herbal, mid palate bitterness and some warming alcohol, somewhere between a malty british barleywine and maybe a Lagunitas product, pretty damn good from this tiny southern Oregon brewery.

Dunkertons Black Fox Organic Cider (Bottle);Charlton Kings, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Dunkertons Cider;500ml bottle.

Dunkertons Black Fox Organic Cider (Bottle);Charlton Kings, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Dunkertons Cider;"You might disregard my opinion since all I've had is American hard cider, most of which I've made myself. I have never tasted anything like this, and I truly wonder if this bottle's journey to a bottle shop in New York state has altered its character and intention. It smells great; I like the first taste and the sticky astringency in my mouth afterward, but the mid to aftertaste reminds me of musky sheep. I do not enjoy it, but I want to since its my first English cider. Next year, I'm coming to England to see if my palette is just dumb, this cider is especially funky in nature, or if it somehow went bad across the Atlantic."

Dunkertons Black Fox Organic Cider (Bottle);Charlton Kings, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Dunkertons Cider;Bottle. Waitrose. Was slightly shocked that this is no longer made at the original mill in Pembridge, but in Cheltenham. I remember visiting Dunkertons, pre RB days and parking in the shittiest, muddiest car park ever, and watching the antiquated machinery in action, and absolutely loving the place. Hey ho, that’s progress, I suppose. Anyway, this pours pale gold, with a light haze. No head. Nose has woody apple, akin to a ripe Russet. Apple cider lolly. Wood shavings. Touch of savoury smoke. Some wet leather funk. A bit spewy and pissy. In a good way. Taste is sweet, with a leathery, funky dryness. Bit of cardboard. Semi dry on the palate. Very easy drinking. Low carbonation. Funky and woody finish. How this has got such a low average score, I don’t know. Also, this is probably in my imagination, but this feels cleaner than a Pembridge made version? Still great, though. Need to drink more cider.

Gold, fluffy white head that thins quickly, low condition. Some fairly chunky sediment in the bottle. Fruity nose with some apple citric notes and a smokey starchiness. Thin in the mouth with some chalkiness and a chemical/metallic note throughout. Aftertaste has a lingering nastiness like sucking a leaking battery. Sediment in the bottle smelled of decomposing cabbages. And I thought Malmö was bad.

Boulder Creek Dizzy Lizzy Barleywine;Boulder Creek, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;2/19/05. On tap at Toronado Barleywine Festival ’04 in San Francisco, CA 2/19/05. 2004 Vintage. Dark caramel brown-red. Another oily appearance for another big bad barleywine. Things are starting to get a little samey, and that might be why I really couldn’t get excited about this beer. Somewhat leathery nose with funky fruit and faint bitterness. Crazy rising flush of a finish. Dry with a silly alcohol-liqueur sweet edge. Woody sharp and some unwelcome sourness that does not match with the malt in any meaningful way. It’s ridiculously unbalanced and has little of interest apart from its slick texture and the action in your mouth. Not a good beer-- not awful, but not much.
Boulder Creek Dizzy Lizzy Barleywine;Boulder Creek, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;Draught, Toronado. Body is dark amber. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel, molasses), lightly hoppy (flowers), with notes of sherry, wood, maple, whisky, and wort. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic. There’s some raw worty scent lurking in this one, which carries some vagueness into the mouth experience. Some nice elements as well, though, so it’s ok, but not a standout.

Consumed at home Saturday 7th November 2015. Pours gold but it is a little hazy. When you drink an Orval, then Brussels Beer Project Babylone and also Sierra Nevada Torpedo followed by this, it has to be said that this is found wanting a little in the flavour department, it’s fine just a rather ordinary beer that is a little thin and lacking in flavour a little, I guess it may be regarded as subtle I think thin and watery with a limited malt and hop profile.

Jarrow Joblings Swinging Gibbet;Jarrow, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jarrow Brewing;500ml bottle as a Christmas gift: This one was an easy going, inoffensive and fairly average bitter that was easy to drink but done little to catch my imagination or make it memorable. Whilst certainly drinkable, it somehow seemed a little plain and basic sadly and as such it’s not one I’m likely to pick up again I’m afraid.
Jarrow Joblings Swinging Gibbet;Jarrow, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jarrow Brewing;Cask conditioned at Harbury Beer Festival ’14. Brown with white head. There is a caramel note within the malts, smoothing rather than over the top, breadcrust hints, baked malt then a pleasant leafy, fresh hoppy note with a woody finish. Good stuff.

Fruity hop aroma. Nice dried apple and rich tea biscuit flavour. More hop in the finish. Definitely at the hoppy end of the English bitter spectrum, and not out of the ordinary, but strangely pleasurable.

Jarrow Joblings Swinging Gibbet;Jarrow, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jarrow Brewing;Crystal clear amber beer with a head that sustains. In this bar anyway.

Durham Bonny Lass;Bowburn, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Durham Brewery;Cask. Deep ruby ale with a thick light tan head. Nose is incredibly malty with a light grassy hop. First mouthful is full of malt with some hay/strawlike notes but then out bursts the hoppiness. Really well balanced and makes the sweetness get blasted by the bitterness and then finish with a nice bittersweet dryness.
Durham Bonny Lass;Bowburn, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Durham Brewery;[Cask from The Three Judges] Deep amber colour with a small head. Aroma of caramel and toasted malt, lots of esters, berry fruits. body feels on the watery side, fruity palate, touch of dryness.
Durham Bonny Lass;Bowburn, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Durham Brewery;Aroma guives honey a touch of roasted malts, grassy. Taste gives more grass than expected, but to be honest this beer is durhamed out its nut.

Durham Bonny Lass;Bowburn, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Durham Brewery;"(Cask conditioned). A brand new beer from the enterprising brewers of Durham, sampled at the Wear Valley CAMRA beer festival. (Room temperature). CAMRA stated the ABV to be 4.2%, brewery website says 3.9% (possibly not updated - they speak of the beer as a project in the making). CAMRA write ""Bonnie"" (which is logical), brewery website says ""Bonny"" - I guess they have their reasons. Low (natural) carbonation. Reddish brown colour. Malty aroma and flavour, moderate hops. The North East English style is really a marriage between English bitter and Scottish ""heavy"". Not a bad brew (quite good, actually), but a beer as malty as this would profit on a higher ABV."

Greenshields Hefe-Weizen;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Big, very dense white head on top of a golden, crystal clear body with decent carbonation. Loaded with bananna esters and phenols. Very buttery and light. Wheat does stand tall and proud. Buttery wheat cloys for quite some time. Really a good interpretation of a German Wheat.
Greenshields Hefe-Weizen;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Yeasty wheat aroma. Smells authentic. Good flavor, malty and yeasty and with the typical hefe flavors. The only complaint is that it has a weak finish (hops not satisfactory) and that the body is not crisp enough. I know that a hefe is not really crisp, but that is the best description that I can give. Still, not too bad, and one of their better beers, even if it is seasonal.
Blackawton Headstrong;Newton Abbott, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Blackawton;Cask. Golden, cloudy with a short head. Lovely floral hoppy scent. A bit thick and sticky in the mouth.

The aroma was very malty and earthy. The flavor was fruity, with only a faint bitter finish. I’m not sure if the beer was flat, or just very softly carbonated, but it wasn’t that great.
Blackawton Headstrong;Newton Abbott, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Blackawton;Cask conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Hazed amber with white head. Pretty basic bitter, however i think it was a little tired, there was a sharp yeastiness, old ale type flavour. Malty, fruity and a touch sweet.
Blackawton Headstrong;Newton Abbott, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Blackawton;Bottled. Pours clear gold to murky amber, depending how much yeast wriggles into the glass.

Gilded Otter Naked Under Me Kilt Scottish Ale;New Paltz, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;On tap at the Otter. Pours a mostly clear ruby hued cola brown with a thin lightly tanned beige head. No real big aromas, but nothing off putting, so I guess that’s a plus. Light caramel and malt. Kind of watery, faint sweet malt flavor. Finishes up with a bit of a metallic twang and a bit of an acrid roast bitterness.
Gilded Otter Naked Under Me Kilt Scottish Ale;New Paltz, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Pint pour @ the brewpub. Color is dark brown but can still make out that it is a clear beer. Aroma is green off the bat, too young, its mainly a very youthful metallic sweetness. Taste is the same, way too young. It also has a very thin body and weak body. This would be the most disappointing beer I have had from this brewpub.
Gilded Otter Naked Under Me Kilt Scottish Ale;New Paltz, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;"Very dry, earthy, peaty, little sweetness; rather odd for a Scotch I thought but the house profile seems to be on the dry side so whatever. Sweeter/maltier on the nose than the tongue, slightly thin but quite decent."
Gilded Otter Wallkill River Dark Wheat;New Paltz, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Clear dark, faint sweetish nose, malty-sweet, no carbonation or hops to speak of, very slight stale mown grass character, bland and flat.
Hinterland Framboise;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hinterland Brewery;"Super ruby color with a rich, white, lingering head. Aroma of raspberry of coarse, but also cherries and citrus (I did have this as a ""half and half"" over the wheat). Full berry flavor comes through, not really tart and definitely not sweet. Very dry and clean. Hate to say it but I rate it over New Glarus."
Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Nitro tap. Clear golden. Easy going going grain nose. Flavor is sweet grainy malt with light honey graham cracker and a light grassy bitterness. Nitro really adds a nice dimension. Wouldn’t have thought.
Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Tap at OSS. Nitro pour. Clean and easy, not unlike a Boddingtons or similar UK draught. Steady foamy off-white head. Smooth, cream golden malt. A little watery, not much depth. Hyper-sessionable light body. OK. Sublime. Simple. Brewhouse bland aroma. OK.
Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Draft at HopCat Madison. Pours crystal clear gold with Guinness style foam that slowly settles - mesmerizing.

Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;On tap. Golden pour with the expected thick head, which does not go away. not much aroma - slightly astringent and floral. Flavor is a good balance of malt and some floral hops.

Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Backlog rating on 8-15-2012 at 800 Degree Three Fires (Fort Wayne, IN) This nitro beer pours a lot of foam and then is reduced to a small creamy smooth white head that is fully lasting, transparent yellow body, very little carbonation observed, and a generous amount of lacing adorns my glass. The aroma is biscuits, malt, hops, and a suggestion of fruitiness. The flavor is sweet, malt and mild hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and this beer is medium bodied. This beer has mild English hops and is very quaffable.
Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;[Tap] Pours a clear brown color without much head. Nose is of chalky malts and maybe a hint of nuttiness. Toasted breads, light grass and caramel in the taste. Smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation levels. Nice and sessionable.
Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;On nitro at WOB. Creamy gold pour with a thick white head. Light earthy citrus hop aroma. Creamy malt body with a touch if hops. Very good.
Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Tap. Yellow pour with a monster white nitro head. Slightly bready, mostly a little grassy hop kick late. Easy drinking. Nitro was a good call with this to add a visual and palate element to an otherwise kind of ho-hum beer.
Hinterland Pub Draught;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Hinterland Brewery;This draft brew poured a small sized head of cascading foam white colored bubbles that were and left behind a uncarbonated transparent orange colored body and an excellent lacing. The weak aroma was hoppy and malty. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of creamy smooth malt. An OK brew just nothing special.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;Bocks are not a style that I drink a lot...and haven't had a lot of them to compare too. This one seems better than average, but I have had some with more flavor and balance. Somewhat of a complex flavor, with caramel, toffee, bread, light fruit & maple. Gives it a sour and tart aroma. Enjoyable for sure.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;Clear dark brown body with a thin tan head. Light aroma of grain, maple, and tea. Palate is a bit thin for a bock. Flavor is pretty mild. A somewhat sweet entry of maple and biscuit leads to a lightly bitter tea finish. Not bad. I was expecting more flavor, but it’s drinkable.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;12 ounce bottle from a Pick N Save. Dark brown, poor retention. Aroma of maple, nuts, tea, caramel. Taste is tart cherry and brown malts. Hints of raisin. Thin. Seems like some infection here that has stripped out all the flavor. Hints of maple emerged after I typed that entire previous sentence. Sad. Coulda been great. Checking the bottle for a best by date, and.... it's completely illegible. Turns out this is bad but I still respect this brewery... for now.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;I would pin this as more of a porter or maybe a schwartzbier than a bock but whatever. It's pretty good. It is mildly roasty, smooth and very pleasantly drinkable. I think their might be a faint woody tone from the maple but I don't know jack shit about beer so bite me.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;Pretty brown ale, tasty, drinkable… if it weren’t on the label, I don’t think I’d detect maple syrup. Pours dark brown, clear, effervescent, with a big, creamy, long lasting head. Aroma roasted grain. Taste starts faintly sweet, with a roasty dry finish. Medium body palate. Overall very pleasant, drinkable beer… nicely balanced winter brew.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;Bottle in cellar. Poured at home in a snifter. Deep brown with a modest off-white head. Aroma is big maple, biscuit, brown sugar, caramel, cocoa nibs. The taste is similar with cocoa nibs, nuts, caramel, burnt wood, and Wurthers candies. Medium body and carb. Slight bitter finish and then sweet.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;Draft at Fishale. Nice dark chestnut color with a head of tiny tan bubbles. Light aroma of chocolate, caramel malt and oddly enough crayons. Flavor is okay for a bock but I’m missing the maple. Fine.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;"Pours a dark brown color with tan colored head. Maple, molasses, sweet dsrk fruits, raisins and dates on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with maple syrup like sweetness."
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;Dark mossy aroma, dubbel-esque. Clear dark root beer black-brown. Thin khaki head. Dry, woody, a little dark malt comes through. Earthy moss tones and some tannic acidity. Medium body, a little astringent. Didn’t like. Growler County.
Hinterland Maple Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;Tallahassee, Fl - ABC Fine Wine & Spirits - Betton - pint bottle. Deep, dark brown pour, thin, but persistent khaki colored head that clings to the edge of the glass. Aroma has a hint of maple sweetness, some dates and raisins, could be a bit bolder. Flavor is solidly bock-like, raisins, dates, a hint of chocolate, just a wee-bit of the advertised maple. Decently thick mouthfeel. Not bad, just nothing jumps out about it.
Rock Bottom Imperial Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Imperial;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Sampled on draft at the Pittsburgh location this beer poured an oily black color with a medium sized creamy brown head that lingered forever and produced good lacing. The aroma was a pleasant mix of coffee, bakers chocolate and toasty malts. The flavor was a wonderfully complex mix of tangy malts, sweet chocolate syrup,coffee, vanilla, fruity hops, port wine, rum, anise and leather. The finish was incredibly long with notes of chocolate, vanilla and rum standing out. The body was thick, smooth and oily - coating the tongue and refusing to leave. Incredible.
Rock Bottom Imperial Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Imperial;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;A very fine beer. Deep mocha in color, with strong mocha/coffee notes mingling with chocolate malts, roasted nuts, and a pleasntly warming alcohol flavor coming through.
Rock Bottom Imperial Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Imperial;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;On tap at the Lucky Lab big beer fest. Excellent stout, very rich chocolate and coffee flavor with a big bold roastiness. Smooth on the palate with coffee notes trailing off in the finish.
Rock Bottom Imperial Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Imperial;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Not bad for a chain brew, this was black with the usual tan head, malty aroma, and roasty flavors, and a very slight hop flavor.
Rock Bottom Imperial Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Imperial;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Wow, after reading the other two ratings i wonder if i had the same beer.

Rock Bottom Imperial Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Imperial;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Deep charcoal. Frothy foam. Mocha laden aroma, with undertones of baker's chocolate, light caramel, and leafy hops. Velvety palate. Flavors of cardboard, acidity, roasted malt, mocha, and a long bitter charcoal finish. Lacking in mouthfeel, but quite full of flavor.
Rock Bottom Imperial Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Imperial;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;A decent imperial from a chain brewery.

Brew It Up! Northern Mild Nut Brown Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Brown Ale;Brew It Up!;I’ve had this in the bottle and on tap on several different occasions. On tap would probably be my favorite. My rating on this will be on the bottled version. A medium sweet (undefined) aroma. Reminded me a bit of smelling a sugar bag, with a touch of vinegar. Appearance is a chalky brown, off-white head with a medium thickness to it. Flavor has that odd acidic/vinegar like quality, but mostly it’s lightly roasted, with a touch of nut and malt to it. Easy to drink, but I think I’ll stick with this on tap.
Brew It Up! Northern Mild Nut Brown Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Brown Ale;Brew It Up!;Bomber from Brew It Up. It’s too bad this brewery gets a bad rap on the ratings system.

Magic Hat Nail Biter;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Roasted malts and chocolate in the aroma.

Magic Hat Nail Biter;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I also sampled this at the Extreme Beer fest in Boston 2004 and it was delicious. Similar to a few of Magic Hat seasonal offerings, (they love experimenting)roasted coffee, chocolate, sweet & dry so many tastes, they do so much with their flavors but they all have their distinct style. A bit watery but it doens’t take away from this excellent brew, just makes me want more!! Another winner form Magic Hat!
Magic Hat Nail Biter;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Dark, dark brown with a thin, tan ring of bubbles. Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and white toast. A touch of dark fruit pops it's head up from time to time. Moderately thick body. Roasted, bitter flavor dominates through out. The alcohol, while not imperceptible, is difficult to find except for it's warmth. Towards the end, the hops really contribute pine, citrus and additional bitterness. I think a little time to mellow would really help this one out. Subduing the intense bitterness and bringing out the fruit would really make this amazing.
Magic Hat Nail Biter;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Extreme Beer Fest 2004: Dark ruby color without any head.

Magic Hat Nail Biter;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"On tap at Bling Tiger, NY - I was a bit skeptical about this one, considering I'm not all that fond of their Heart of Darkness Stout, but I must admit I was really impressed - this beer is very, very, very much like Storm King, but a much thicker mouthfeel - this beer truly is ""chewy"" - sweet, but it has a lot of hop bitterness that actually lends itself well to the chocolate/coffee flavor going on - some cherries and plums in the mix - what's this? it burps up the taste of pine? quite odd - great if you can find it."
Magic Hat Nail Biter;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"On tap at Three Needs in Burlington, March 2. Thick espresso-shake-black, very stable medium-brown head. Wonderful aroma first seemed to be that of raisins, but later was more cherry-chocolaty with hints of French vanilla. Medium-sweet flavor, more chocolate than coffee, nice bitterness towards the end but also hints of metal. A little on the thin side in the body (oh Magic Hat, thou art close to a great brewer, but put some BODY in thy brews!), finish nice & roasty-toasty; goes down just a little bit too easily, like its just fading away. A good, not great, Imperial; the Thumbsucker whiskey cask-aged version I had tonight is a bit more complex and interesting, but both are worth trying if you can get your hands (or at least thumbs or nails) on them."
Eureka Black and Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;The black wasn't black enough and the tan definetely wasn't tan enough. It was more like pond water. I have to give it to the gluek brewery, they are very proficient at sucking. Hey, if your going to suck, mine as well do a good job of it. Tastes just like the other eureka's, there's no point in describing the taste, for its reputation speaks volumes.
Eureka Black and Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;"OK....i was in the liquor store. I read the tag carefully...it said and i quote...""Black and tan""...a bock mixed in with a brown ale...and what the hell does this wind up smelling like....yeah, you got it. It smells like g'DAMN HONEY AGAIN!!!! Every single You Reek Ugh beer smells like honey!!!!! This one however has the distinction of also smelling like robitussin and nyquil. As if it matters (understanding you obviously know whats coming if youve read this far), the appearance is a clear and lightlly carbonated orange thing with a forced mini white head. The taste makes me wanna bust out the milk.... Imagine this if you will...you're watching Seinfeld and Kramer enters the room...you know that surprised look he would have on his face...well yeah, that was me standing aghast after i sipped this putrescence of liquid. It begins with a strange...well i wouldnt call it bockness, more like a grainy malt. Literally, straw, and dirt along with corn!!! Blegh...then this dry nasty malty ending that reminds me of roasted dung beetles (yes...im running out of ways to describe how bad this is). Terrible mouth feel, and very bad beer. So this is why they are so close to the budweiser....."

The aroma is quite weak, mostly fruity, with some malty notes. Dry on the palate, with a pleasant carbonation level. Medium to thin body. It’s grainy and fruity in the mouth, with some bitterness towards the end. Short fruity finish with some bitterness. Rather boring this one. 131122
Kemphaan Blond;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;Bottle @ Scooper Tasting in Ulfborg. Pours cloudy yellow with small and quickly vanishing white head. clear aroma of hops, yeast and vegetables. Bitter, hoppy flavour, with pronounced notes of citrus and a good deal of yeast.

Ryburn Luddite Stout;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Ryburn Brewery;1. Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich (JDW) 25/01/2002 Dark coloured and strong in alcohol with some fruit aroma. Smooth on the palate with a roast malt finish. 2. Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich 13/04/2004 Dark coloured slightly rich on the palate and fruity. Smooth slightly roast dry finish.
Ryburn Luddite Stout;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Ryburn Brewery;Cask at Briar Rose (JDW) Birmingham. Wonderful, wonderful stuff. Even my non-beer-drinking wife liked the taste of this. Viscous black, gentle dryness, gentle roasties, just outstanding.
Ryburn Luddite Stout;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Ryburn Brewery;Cask@Catford Beer festival. Can’t complain with this one, top quality. Coffee bean, riasted malt, lightly tart and acidic, with a nice roasted bitter chocolate finish, tasty indeed, thanks to spiesy for the recomendation.
Ryburn Luddite Stout;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Ryburn Brewery;Very dark brown, opaque colour. Strong coffee aroma which carries through onto the palate, where roasted malt and chocolate also put in an appearance. Quite dry and very smooth, with a good depth of flavour and some sweetness. Long, dry malty finish, with some bitterness in the aftertaste. In a festival dominated by average bitters and thin milds, this stood out. Excellent stuff. Cask, Catford Beer Festival.
Ryburn Luddite Stout;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Ryburn Brewery;Cask Conditioned, Masque Haut, London. Black as the night with a dark brown scummy head. Supper roasted flavour, juicy and scrumptious. Was very impressive. It looked like an imperial sitting in the glass. Wonderful stuff.
Ryburn Luddite Stout;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Ryburn Brewery;Cask-conditioned @ JDW. Coffee roast and a touch of fruit and some woody aromas. Quite dry and thin with minimal bitterness. Served far to cold but didnt improve much as it warmed.
Ryburn Luddite Stout;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Ryburn Brewery;JDW Faversham. A good roasted barley flavour and a dark dark dark colour. A strong mild. Not much going on - pleasant but boring. [2.5] JDW Welling. Black with dark mahogony edge barely visible. Coffee coloured creamy foam head. Soft roasty notes which emerge clearly with chocolate and coffee flavours in the finish which ends abruptly leaving only a memory of the flavour. Hops and dark malts play together throughout. A spanking good ale. [3.7] JDW Rochester Third time for this one, and it just gets better every time. Bags of roasty, coffee flavours in a smooth and dangerously drinkable base. Touches of wine here and there. Interesting edges and corners. Served in perfect condition. This is top drawer.
Ryburn Luddite Stout;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Ryburn Brewery;"(Cask conditioned). Sampled at the Wear Valley CAMRA beer festival. (Room temperature, low natural carbonation). Listed there as a stout (I would even say dry stout, though it's a tad sweeter than the Irish ones), but another local CAMRA website claims that a beer named Luddite has been judged as a ""strong dark mild"". I'll leave that to the category freaks. Anyway, this beer is pitch black with a delicious roast aroma and flavour, but the mouthfeel is a bit thin despite the relatively high ABV. Add a little nitrogen, and it would compete with draught Guinness (or rather: Beamish)."
Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;this is interesting... bits of acetic acid, buttery feel, butterscotch. Gone wrong to the point of curiosity.
Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;Light amber, no head. Lacks aroma, bit fruity. Sweet, slightly sour fruity bitter. Not good.
Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;Amber coloured. Some grassy hops, and a hint of sulphur, in the aroma. Dry, hoppy flavour, with a touch of fruit. Slightly sharp finish. Decent enough, but there’s not really much to hold the attention. 500ml bottle (bottle conditioned) from the Beer Seller, Lincoln. Best before 31 Jan 2005.
Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;Bottle. Not much of an aroma, maybe some grainy malt and a touch of lemon. Palate is thin and boring, slight lemon tang and grainy pale malt.
Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;Bottled at The London/Joet Gathering Chez Chris_O. A little bit of hop was discovered lurking at the back of the aroma of this amber coloured bitter. The taste was crisp and clean with some abrasive hop but otherwise was very plain and ordinary.
Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;Bottle & Chris’ Place Miurky gold. Aroma is malt with strong tobacco pouch, sheesh. Flavour is malty, slightly fruity and buttery and then some ashtray.
Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;Cloudy orange beer with a foamy off-white head. Quite odd aroma with some hop, grass and fruit. Harsh and sharp flavor. Hayish, yeasty and citrusy. Not a beer for me.
Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;Bottled: Unclear orange coloured. Has a small beige head. Light hopped and light spiced aroma. Apart from some hop characters the flavour has some fruity and sweet notes. Ends on a medium bitter note.

Poachers Trail;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;A hazy orange beer with a small white head. The aroma is spicy and yeasty. The flavor is very yeasty with notes of caramel and coriander.
Damon Premium Pils;Bocholt, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens;Bottled. Gold, moderate head and condition. Nondescript nose, some malt in the soft body and a thin dry finish. One of many lagers made by Martens, possibly weakend for English tastebuds but still better than most UK 4% lagers, that’s no recommendation though.
Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;Half-pint, gravicask at Cowes Ale House. Clear amber-reddish body, filmy layer, scattered lacing. Moderate smell of slightly roasted caramel malts. Decent caramel fruity flavours. Mid-dry bittersweet end. Satisfying.

Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;Mørk nøttebrun. Bobleaktig filmskum. Klar. Lett nøttearoma. Smaken tørket frukt. Tørr syrlig avslutning.
Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;Bottle from Garsons, Titchfield. Dark amber strong ale with a malty taste. Not as hoppy as I was expecting
Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;Unknown origin or method of dispense, early April 2017. I like this, even double-fisted with a Citra. Fat cream collar over clean bronze. Nose a touch coppery but flavour is subtly red vinous with a Rodenbach-like aged tang with iron and caramel. Bitter balancing finish. Subtly complex silky bitter with mysterious Belgian streaks.
Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;Quite thick with a caramel maltiness. An aftertaste of bitter hops but not as strong as you expect.

Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;Fra håndpumpe på The Mossy Well, Muswell Hill (London): klar rødlig kobber med ok skum. Igjen en god, maltdrevet øl hvor Fuggles og Goldings bidrar til den fine smaken med urter, jordtoner og hint av citrus. Lang og god ettersmak. God kropp med krydderfornemmelser og noe bær i anslaget.
Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;Cask at The Green Dragon, Leek (JDW) A clear amber colour with a medium off white head. Aroma of toffee, bready malt, some sticky fruits, slight orange peel and subtle earthy hops. Taste of toffee, bready malts, fruit, some brown sugar, a hint of orange and subtle earthy hops. Medium bodied and soft carbonation. A soft, bittersweet, earthy hop bitterness in the finish. Nothing wrong with this at all. A typical British premium bitter.
Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;.Pours a dark amber colour with ao small creamy off white head. A pale toffee and light malt aroma, a rich sweet brown sugar toffee and malt flavour. A smooth and lingering hoppy oily resinous bitter finish.
Goddards Ducks Folly;Oakfield, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goddards Brewery;Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys London as Goddards Ducks Folly, 5.2%. Dark amber, translucent, still, foamy white head. Aroma is bready, musty dried sugars. Body is light, smooth with tingly carbonation. Taste is resinous, British- hops forward, floral and bitter resin, wood chip and bitter herbs, soft malt backbone backing it up. This is an unashamedly old school properly bitter bitter. I quite like it.
Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;I can’t agree with the lightly flavored as it was bursting with a nice raspberry aroma and flavor. It managed to cover up most of the cool yeast from the base wheat, otherwise pretty solid.
Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;Can smell the raspberry, which is a good thing. Cloudy wheat beer appearance with a slight pink tinge. Tastes of raspberry and wheat beer. Not too tart or sweet.(k)
Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;A very weak representation of a fruit beer. Aroma is nice if you put your nose close enough. Body is light and raspberry flavor is too. Could have used greater amounts of fruit. Finish is light and boring.
Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;Pours a clear light amber color with a white head. Sweet raspberry flavoring and a bit of sugar. Some grassy hops underneath, a bit of soda water, and a bit of malt. The flavor is a touch watery, almost like soda water. Raspberry, a hint of sugar, very mild malt, and a definite grass note and mild bitterness.
Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;Sweet raspberry flavor with some banana only a little tart. This was given to me by a friend it was good.
Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Clear light yellow, lacy head. Aroma-raspberries. Taste-raspberries, wheat, well put together. Good beer.
Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub. Cloudy light orange with a small white head. Banana and bubblegum up front with some fresh tart raspberries, as well as some artificial sweet raspberry behind. Flavor has the bananas dominating withthe sweet and tart raspberries behind, still sort of artificial but no longer very sweet. Minimal bitterness. Light to moderate prickly caarbonation with a light to medium body. Actually, pretty good--pleasantly surprised.

Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap. Poured a hazy yellow color with a small white head. Aroma of banana ester and of course raspberries. Flavor was tart with a sweet raspberry finish. I generally don’t like fruit beers, but this was a solid offering.
Lengthwise Double ZZ Razzberry Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lengthwise Brewery;Notes of banana and bubble gum with a raspberry sweet/tartness too. Flavors of initial tartness then raspberry, then banana. A little lingering sweet/tart thing. A nice fruit beer.
Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;Nice yeast presence in this one that makes the nose and mouth pop with some banana and clove. Otherwise standard.
Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;Bit different for a wheat beer. Has an atoms of bananas and you can taste banana too with a slight warming aftertaste of cloves. Pretty good.. (k)
Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;Banana and clove are typical of a Hefeweizen, but the light body is too sweet and lacks that refreshing finish typical of the style.
Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;A hazy light yellow pour with a white head. Very heavy clove spiciness on the nose. A touch of bubblegum, moderate banana, and some sweet wheat bread. Taste is also heavy on the clove with a mild banana note. Some good malt and wheat sweetness, mild citrus peel, and a light bitterness.
Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;It has a citrus tone to it, even without the lemon they with it. I really wanted to love it, but I ended up wishing it was...well, just better.
Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;My Bottom Line: Citrus fruit, banana esters and crunchy wheat coalesce in this American Weizen’s doughy body, forming a perhaps generic, but quite enjoyable pint. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam surrounds the cloudy blond. -The cushy mouthfeel is one of this beer’s most endearing features. -Both the aroma and flavour profile are straightforward and well developed. -Light hop bitterness concludes each sip. On tap at Kern River Brewing.
Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy yellow. No head. Aroma-lemon, banana, clove. Taste- much the same, on the light side. Crisp, lightly sweet.
Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub. Cloudy orange with a small creamy off-white head, fading to a film. Loads of banana in the aroma with some faint spicy clove notes. Flavor is much the same with just a little bit of lemon. Big wheat finish with bitterness around a 2 or so. Light prickly carbonation with a medium body. This is not an American Wheat--this is one banana-y hefe.

Lengthwise Harvest Moon Wheat Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap at the brewpub in Bakersfield. Poured a really nice cloudy yellow with a white head. Aroma was banana and cloves. Flavor was a bit of the same, but also a bit on the sweet side which was surprising. The banana was not overwhelming which was nice. Decent wheat.
Lengthwise Kern County Crude Porter;Bakersfield, California, United States;Porter;Lengthwise Brewery;Not robust as described. Had all the requisite parts, but not a big enough beer to be a nitro blend. Probably would have liked just co2, but the blend makes it come across a bit weak.
Lengthwise Kern County Crude Porter;Bakersfield, California, United States;Porter;Lengthwise Brewery;Pleasant enough, but the flavour is a little weak. It’s very dark, perhaps black, with a thin head. Quite fizzy too.
Lengthwise Kern County Crude Porter;Bakersfield, California, United States;Porter;Lengthwise Brewery;A very dry porter. Chocolate flavor and aroma with a fairly light body. Roasted malt give a slight burnt finish.
Lengthwise Kern County Crude Porter;Bakersfield, California, United States;Porter;Lengthwise Brewery;Black in color with a creamy khaki head. Coffee, roast, and dark chocolate open things up on the nose. A bit of earthy hops, licorice, and maybe some cocoa powder. The flavor is almost chalky and astringent. Lots of roasted malt, some dark chocolate, and a coffee ground note, too. A hint of dark fruit as the beer warms.
Lengthwise Kern County Crude Porter;Bakersfield, California, United States;Porter;Lengthwise Brewery;probably one of best and most consitant offerings from Lengthwise. Slight acidity from roast malts but not a detriment, actually blends nice with sub flavors of coffee and caramels... Not sweet, again slightly on the raosty side and maybe moving from a porter to a stout.. Give it a Robust porter for style, My personal guess is the name may help in marketing a dark beer with body to a location where it is rarely less than 95F in the Summer months.
Lengthwise Kern County Crude Porter;Bakersfield, California, United States;Porter;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap the brewpub. Dark amber-brown, decent dense head. Aroma-roasted malt, hint of chocolate, coffee. Taste-earthy, creamy, roasty, cocoa and coffee notes. Somewhat low carbonation. Very creamy, smooth mouthfeel.
Lengthwise Kern County Crude Porter;Bakersfield, California, United States;Porter;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub. Clear deep dark ruby with a one finger cramy beige head, good retention--as a nitro should have. Loads of unsweetened chocolate up front with some moderate roasted malts. Flavor is much the same with hints of caramel and smoke, though the finish did turn a little burnt and ashy. Bitterness peaked around a 3 in the dry finish. Light prickly carbonation with a medium body. Not too bad.

Lengthwise Kern County Crude Porter;Bakersfield, California, United States;Porter;Lengthwise Brewery;Nitro pour. Dark brown with a lasting creamy tan head. Light roasted malt flavor, mild sweetness, with an earthy bitterness. Seemed a little thin, but the body was creamy from the nitro. Pretty okay.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;On tap at the Hungry Hunter. Poured a gold/orange color with a small, white, quickly dissipating head. Aroma of citrus hops. Flavor was good. Malt base with a citrus tart finish. Medium body with mild carbonation.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;On tap at the Hungry Hunter in Bakersfield. Really carbonated at the outset, but bubbles fade fast. Orange/straw colored. A bit of hops on the nose, but nothing much. Flavor is ok, but hops aren’t the first thing you taste. Slight chemical twang is a little offputting.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;Bright cloudy orange body with a very fast fading head. There’s really no aroma at all - slightly bitter, hints of citrus and hops, but not anything in particular to put my finger on. The flavor is more of the same, except here ther is biting lemony-tartness that isn’t balanced by any pleasant hoppiness or maltiness. There is some mustiness, mildewy flavor to it, making it not such a pleasant beer experience overall.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;Bottle from IrishBoy (thanks!) - cloudy orange, with a small, fizzy head - mildly tart aroma of peaches and citrus - tart and acidic up front - some notes of hickory and grainy malts - mild orange sweetness and some lactic qualities - finishes with peaches lingering tartness - an off bottle? - if so, it appears to be common with this beer.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;This pale ale pours a medium orange gold color from a 12oz bottle. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is citrus, peaches and apricots. A medium bodied American Pale Ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Lots of apricot and peach flavors. Hops are mild and somewhat herbal. More in the style of an English Pale Ale, Perhaps a little off, kind of buttery and the peach thing, but drinkable, Nice balance. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;12 oz bottle a freebie from IrishBoy - Pours a hazy amber color with a half finger thick off white head. Aroma is citrus and herbal hops. Has some malt character, but has a lingering bitter presence with an odd twang. Light to medium body. Worth a try. Thanks Richard.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;12oz bottle from IrishBoy. pale orange with a spectacular white foamy head, Malt aroma with a hint of citrus. Carbonation is good, tastes a little off. tastes a little moldy.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;Body is a light copper and gold with a very thin white head. Aroma is very malty, with caramel, and is earthy. Taste is mettalic, and has a bit of a twang to it perhaps a slight infection, but it might just be how it is, some caramel, is also presense, with some grapefruit.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;From a 12oz Bottle. Pours the color of coppery straw with a thin layer of wispy white head. Buttery diacetyl aromas saturate my nostrils, but the sweet corn and stale canned pineapple notes that greet my nostrils from underneath aren’t too pleasant either. Medium bodied, thinly carbonated mouthfeel. Seems too underattenuated to me, making it less drinkable, but at the same time, not a whole lot of flavor seems to be going on. Lots of stale fruity flavors with only a faint whisper of hops in the final smack. Needs more carbonation, crisp maltiness, and some sort of hop character to give it a better clean, refreshing character. Needs less body and buttery character to improve the drinkability. Not the refreshing, easy drinker I was looking for.
Old River Brew Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old River Brew Company;I got a bad bottle. Something happened, me-thinks some dirty bottles or fill lines. Tarnished brass in the glass, nice little white head says healthy. The nose has a flat almost wheat-malt element that tries to hide some soured fruit notes. This reminds me of a cross between lambic and madeira. Oxidized/ Diacetyl notes of butterscotch don’t add the character I usually enjoy. The dried apricot turns to soured orange rind. The finish is soured and tangy. While I will try to revisit this I can’t help but think this is either past its prime or flawed before it left the brewery.
Slottskällans Imperial Stout;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Imperial;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottle from 2016. Black with small shortlasting head. Aroma is roasted and licorice. Taste is roasted, licorice, chocolate and some vanilla. Sweet, but not to sweet. Nice and drinkable.
Slottskällans Imperial Stout;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Imperial;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);1 finger off-white head. Deep, dark brown beer. Aroma is raisins, mint, light coffee, charcuterie, fruity and herbal liqueor, salty liquorice and lots of hops of the citrusy and peppery variety. Not up my alley at all when it comes to this style but very different and weirdly pleasant to sniff. Taste is dark chocolate, charcuterie, leather, tobacco, light soil, black pepper, light mint, light chili, slight black tea note and citrusy hops at the back. Semi-watery mouthfeel. Low bitterness. Very low carbonation. Barely any alcohol in the taste at all. Overall: Such a weird stout. According to the bottle, the recipe has remained unchanged since 1999 but this feels way more experimental than traditional. Even though I rate this so low, it does have some sort of charm to it and it doesn’t taste bad. It’s just so far away from where I want my Imp. Stouts.
Slottskällans Imperial Stout;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Imperial;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);February 2016. Probably from a Systembolaget in Stockholm. Drinking whiskey and Ribena in a deep bubble bath aroma. Some juicy zwetschgen and blueberry once the mad whipped beige head collapses. Flavour more smokey wee dram tipped in Ribena and blueberry juice. impressive oily smoked wood under berries. Bubblegum and humbug. Falls far outside the modern US-biased definition of what constitutes imperial stout. I like it.
Slottskällans Imperial Stout;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Imperial;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottle. Black, with dark-reddish tinge against light. Malty (roasty malts, coffee, dark chocolate, burnt sugar, toffee, liquorice, vanilla). Fruity (dark fruits). Sweet and very smooth. Less extreme than other Imperials. Really enjoyed this. An excellent beer! (2008)
Slottskällans Imperial Stout;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Imperial;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottle as a gift from Albin ( ratebeer name Wanabe_me ) awsome bro ! Thnx very much ! Pours very dark brown, close to black. Creamy, bit darker , good sized head. Smell is darksugar. palmsugar pops to mind. I had some palmsugar that had coffee aspects, this scent reminds me of that. Doesn’t smell like there’s actual coffee in this, but I do get the aspects... The sweet, earhtyness, factors are really strong, and very attypical for an impy. Taste is sugary, aromatic, again that coffee-like-palm-Sugar aspects. a certain dryness ( roasty ), a certain bitterness. rather sweet, a thick, sugary ( special Sugar ) mouthfeel. it’s definately off the charts compared to any other imperial stout I’ve had. it’s not comparable with anything I’ve had before, accept of one of my homebrews, with loads of Palmsugar in it ( hence the constant remembrance of it ) Accept for the fact this is many, many times better in both quality and taste. I really enjoyed this, but have a hard time to view this as an imperial stout, since it’s so different. I’d be very curious to find out how this is brewed, is it indeed palmsugar? This seems like it could have a style on its own. I applaud it ! Thnx very much Albin, I enjoyed this more that I thought i would !
Slottskällans Imperial Stout;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Imperial;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);A pitch black beer with a miniscule light brown head.

High Desert Amber Lager;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;High Desert Brewing Company;The beer pours from the growler with a pale tan colored head. Lightly hazed, with a bright copper / pale amber color. There is a cracker like, nice lager like maltiness up front, some touches of metallic hoppiness, Nice cracker like maltiness, touches of caramelized malt character, metallic hops, some touches of herbal character, slightly menthol character,as it warms perhaps a touch of . The beer is quite light bodied, but has some light heft to it that sits a bit on the palate. Quite smooth. This is pretty nice, much better than I might have guessed.
High Desert Amber Lager;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;High Desert Brewing Company;ReRate-i had this about 2 weeks ago and it as not very good-lots of butter/diacytl thing going.
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;A rich caramel base flavor with a dry smoky aftertaste. Excellent with food or by itself.
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;Really tasty. Not a very strong aroma of roasted malts and caramelized sugar. Dark like a Porter with a thin head. Good weight with a smoothness that filled the mouth. Strong burnt sugar with malts and a slightly bitter finish. Well done and balanced.
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;"Dark, almost burnt, concentrated amber color. The head is thin and has a light brown tinge to it. Aroma has an interesting fruit character to it that is berry leaning; but is very subtle. Rich, sweet, malty notes, deeply caramelized, slightly nutty, deeply caramelized notes, and a touch of umami richness from the contrast notes. Sweet, a bit on the rich side, though not overly heavy. The beer has a nice dense, concentrated malt character to it, a meaty, chewy beer with lots of melonoid character. The beer has a touch of spiciness in the finish that seems more grain / malt related than hop, but it could be a touch of that too. The bitterness balance here is quite light, there is just a touch of it here in the finish so that this doesn’t get cloying. An incredibly satisfying beer, especially after driving the entire day."
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;From a growler. Translucent pour with a small head. Aroma is sweet, with wheat and fruit. Moderate sweet, slight bitter. Roasted malt, caramel, nuts, some apple as well, and a little chocolate. Finishes sweet, with a little more chocolate. Medium body, a little syrupy. Very enjoyable.
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;"Sweet, almost raisin-like aroma with some red apple notes. Deep brown in color with a bit of off-white head. Flavor freatures that red apple peel taste; moderately sweet with a hint of roast flavor."
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark brown/amber with a thick tan head. Aroma of chocolate and some roast too. Flavor also chocolate and roasted malt as well as lager malt/yeast. Sturdy palate for a bock. Pretty good, an enjoyable bock. 7/4/7/4/14 [3.6/5]
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Brown with an average sized off-white head. Aroma is of wheat, sweet malt, light fruit and a hint of roastiness. Taste is the same.
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;"The Dark Bock had been on tap for awhile when I went to High Desert, but, luckily, I got one of the final pours before High Desert was officially out of the stuff. I would agree with just about all the other reviews on here: dark brown with a decent off-white head; really malty aroma and taste; high drinkability; generally a pretty solid beer. However, the body seemed a little thin, and, even though I thought it was tasty, it didn’t really taste like a bock at all to me, maybe a little too chocolatey and sweet. Still, the Dark Bock is one of High Desert’s better efforts."
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;10 oz glass at the brewery. Rather dark brown with some head. Sweet aromas that really gave away its bockiness. Very malty aromas. Flavor was still very sweet. The alcohol came in at the finish and was very well recieved. I like this brewery.
High Desert Dark Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;High Desert Brewing Company;Dark amber body with a silky tan head. Caramel and toffee aroma with some sharp fruitiness underneath. Has an interesting berry quality. Tasty cookie malt flavor with medium sweetness. Light roasty note. Medium smooth palate. Not too cloying. A solid bock.
High Desert Bohemian Pilsener;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;High Desert Brewing Company;"Sampled August 2014 A steady pour from the growler into my teku glass produces a fat, one-finger thick, pale, almost light tan colored head. The beer is a copper color that shows a lightly hazed, golden tinged, lighter version of the same when held up to the light. The aroma has a sweet, almost honey like malt character to it up front, and this is backed by a slightly spicy, somewhat herbal hop character. The hop character has a nice lemon zest note to it that melds well with the light herbal notes The beer has a solid, herbal and grassy hop character to it that also contributes a biting bitterness from beginning to end. The bitterness does a good job of drying things out in the finish to help balance the up front cracker like, slightly hay leaning, and chewy rustic bread character that the pale malt contributes. Suggestions of lemon zest, hints of sage, a slight peppery note towards the finish, a bit of lemon pith as well, and a lightly herbal leaning woody note. The body of this beer is nice, it has a certain texture to it that keeps it from being overly light, it has a certain chewiness to it, but it is quite quaffable. This is one of the better beers, and likely the best, that I have had from this brewery; I am pretty sure this batch is pretty fresh, which certainly helps, both the malt and hop character are quite brightly presented here."
High Desert Bohemian Pilsener;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;High Desert Brewing Company;Tap @ High Desert. Pours a clear golden appearance with a small, off white head. Honey, chewy grainy, herbal, fairly earthy aroma. Moderately sweet, pale malty, grainy straw, lightly fruity, honey flavor. A little syrupy. Ok.
High Desert Bohemian Pilsener;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours a beautiful straw gold with a nice retentive white foamy head. Weaker on the nose, but hints of light malts, grass, and light hops are able to be picked out. The flavor: outstanding! Extremely crisp, extremely hopped Nobley, lots of straw and grass...this pilz rocked! The Noble hop note lingers with the sour grass...and its great! Definitely check it if its on...
High Desert Bohemian Pilsener;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;High Desert Brewing Company;Deep straw color and tight sudsy white head with abundant lace. Strong burnt butter and butterscotch in the nose. Initially overpowers any hop or malt aromas. Some bready malt gradually comes out after some warming. Considerable nuttiness in the flavor. Firm spicy hops and a nice bitter finish. Medium body with a lot of palatable texture. A solid Bohemian Pils but could be better balanced if the diacetyl was toned down.
High Desert Bohemian Pilsener;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;High Desert Brewing Company;Spot-on. Pours a lite gold with a thick tight white head. Malty munich aromas with a fresh saaz aroma. Gotta love those noble hops. Nice sweetness and a smack of APPROPRIATE diacetyl. A good bitter finish. The best beer I had at the brewery and one of the best American made pilsners.
High Desert Bohemian Pilsener;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;High Desert Brewing Company;tap at brewpub: well, this just about completes my High Desert beers. This was a very good pilsner-great straw/hops aroma, appearance of golden yellow with lots of carbonation-flavor full of saaz-y hops-hop burps much like an IPA! highly hopped and spicy-another good brew from my hometown brewery.
High Desert Pale Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;High Desert Brewing Company;A vigorous pour into my teku glass produces a voluminous, fat-three-finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a bright amber color that shows a brilliantly clear light amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells fruity, with sweet malt, it has a backing hay like malt, and a touch of green beer / herbal character, with the finish having an amped up dried hay grain character. The fruit character has notes of not quite spiced cider. The beer is sweet, malty in a pale malt sort of way and finishes with a touch of husky, dried hay character and a solid cracker like maltiness. The beer has a spiciness to it, that somehow seems a bit like green chile (though just a suggestion), hoppy and herbal, perhaps even a hint of menthol, perhaps even something a bit like cinnamon, and definitely a touch of black pepper in the finish. There is some slight fruit character that leans towards green apple, perhaps a touch of pear even. The body is chewy, a bit viscous, and definitely sits on the palate a bit, and is about right for a Bock, but may be a bit on the thick side for a Pale Bock, sometimes, but it is satisfying non-the-less. Definitely tasty, but it seems to be a bit out of parameter for your typical Pale Bock.
High Desert Pale Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;High Desert Brewing Company;Cloudy pour. Aroma was light, with both malt and hops. Surprisingly hoppy taste, with light sweetness - well-balanced. Not what I expected from a bock, but very good.
High Desert Pale Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Copper in color and slightly hazy with a small off-white head. Aroma is of wheat with a hint of hops. Taste is surisingly hoppy for the style, but not too much so.
High Desert Pale Bock;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;High Desert Brewing Company;Ya know, im not a fan of the bock style at all, but this definately changed my attitude all for good!!! Take Dead Guy Ale and make it more hoppy-thats what you have in this beer. i will be going to this place weekly!!!
High Desert Amber Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;"Sampled August 2014 The beer arrives from the tap with an amber tinged, nicely tan colored head. The beer is a clear, amber color. The aroma has a nice hop fruit character to it up front that smells of grapefruit, a bit of guava notes, tart tangerine zest, and some Curacao orange character. Towards the finish there is a hint of supporting toasted nutty whole grain malt character, and some grain character that accentuates a dried hay like note that also might be in the dominant hop aromatics. This has a nicely biting bitterness to it that gets more pronounced through to the lingering finish. The finish also has a linger citrus zest character that leans towards not-quite-ripe oranges, ruby red grapefruit zest, and even a touch of Meyer lemon zest. The body of this beer is quite light, perhaps a touch on the thin side, which helps to make this quite quaffable. Really though the malt character is not quite as rich as one might expect from something called an Amber Ale; on the hand this makes this more sharply hoppy. The malt character plays a supporting role here, there is a touch of toasted nutty red malt character, and a bit of whole grain cracker like notes. I wasn’t expecting something that was so hop focused, this is definitely a nice surprise, and a beer I am enjoying."
High Desert Amber Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;Draft - Caramel and some floral hops. Clear copper with a rich head. Caramel, roast malt and a little aromatic hop bite. A really well balanced and flavourful amber, that doesn’t lose site of the malt. Very well done.
High Desert Amber Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;growler-pours a foamy light tan head and amber color. Aroma is herbal hops, some light/medium malt. Taste is spice/herbal hops, some light/medium malt-honey.
High Desert Amber Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;Amber pour with frothy off white head and lace. Light caramel with no hops. Light caramel flavor and a very light bitter. Medium bodied and fizzy.
High Desert Amber Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;Good easy drinking beer with great floral hop aroma. Does have a long lasting flavor profile. A good beer for this small pub
High Desert Amber Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;ReRate-this batch has a better body than the one i had back in september of 03. much rounder and the malts are more pressent. tap at brewery: im with Andrew exactly on this one other than the palate. THe palate was just a bit thin to be great, but thats kind of the problem with most amber/red ales. Aroma and hop flavor were great though.
High Desert Amber Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;"The hoppiness really stood out for a beer that is classified as an ""amber"". The taste was smooth and sweet and it led to a unique complex hop finish. Not indicative of the style, but a solid beer from this random little brewpub in Las Cruces, NM"
High Desert Brown Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;"The beer is a clear brown color that has some red highlights to it and it is topped by a frothy, tan colored head. Toasted, brown crackers, touches of dark fruit, maybe a hint of herbal hop character. The beer has a light sweetness to it up front, which accentuates a solid berry like fruitiness that is backed by a toasted, well browned, whole grain bread crust character. The finish has a light herbal note, a light bitterness in the finish, and perhaps a touch of roast character that lingers a bit on the palate with a coffee like touch. There is a fullness to the body here that clings just a bit to the palate, a bit on the chewy side, but certainly a quaffing brew. Quite a tasty brown, perhaps a touch on the fruity / sweet side, without being overly of either; I am a bit of a Brown Ale fan though, so take my judgement here with a grain of salt."
High Desert Brown Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;Rich brown color, cloudy. Earthy aroma. Slightly sweet with the expected nutty flavor. Lighter than most brown ales, with a little hoppiness. Not a bad beer, but just didn’t excite me at all.
High Desert Brown Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;[At GABF 2004] An unclear brown beer with a fine orange head. The aroma is sweet and primarily roasty, while the flavor is sweet with hints of nuts. More powerful than an English Brown Ale, but lacking something compared to its American cousins.
High Desert Brown Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;tap at brewery: hmm, i was kind of discouraged by this ale. Pours a nice deep mahogony color with a little red around the rim of glass. aroma was slightly sugary/spice/with a hit of earthy tones(grass), not common in brown ales. flavor was slightly nutty, a tad leathery also. palate was just a tad thin. not a bad brew.
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;Draft - Caramel and grapefruit hops. Clear gold with a rich head. Pine, resin, orange and some caramel in the finish. A well balanced IPA that although has nothing exciting is nice and easy to drink.
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;"A vigorous pour from the growler produces a two finger thick, pale tan colored head in my teku glass. The beer is a rich amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich copper-amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a huge toasted, nutty malt character to it up front. There is a soft citrus hop character, a touch of herbal hop character, but really this is surprisingly not hoppy; it is like an old school IPA from the 90s or earlier, but by todays standards doesn’t seem to have much hop character to it at all. It doesn’t even smell like a malty IPA, more like an amber ale. This does have a big bitterness to it that provides a bite to my first sip. There is lots of malt flavors here; sweet, caramelized, sweet tea, nutty toasted malt, and lots of English biscuit character. Soft citrus notes play up a grapefruit character, caramelized tangelos, some menthol notes that also provide a palate presence, and an herbal, woody, not quite rosemary like character all perfume the mostly more dominant malt character (at least for an IPA). A weird beast, definitely not at all what I expected, seems to be an American take on an English interpretation of an IPA. Certainly not bad, but I was hoping for a hop fix, and this certainly doesn’t fit that bill."
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;"Piney floral hop aroma and taste. Taste continues with the hop flavors coating the mouth nicely and giving a nice lingering bitterness. A nice moderate IPA. Notes: Called ""Fresh Hop IPA"" at the pub"
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;Had this on tap at their pub in Las Cruces. Pine/citrus aroma. Clean taste with a nice bitter hop bite. Very good, but I liked their ESB a little better.
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear orange with a white head. Aroma of caramel malt, sweet orange, citrus, and some odd malty notes that are difficult to describe. Flavor of caramel malt, iced tea, piney, orangy hops, some acetone, and mineral notes. Just kind of odd tasting - from what it’s hard to say, but a disappointing IPA (and it’s fresh hopped too, oh well). 6/4/6/3/11 [3.0/5]
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;growler-pours a retaining light tan head and gold color. Aroma is pine/citrus, some medium malt. Taste is pine/resin hops, secondary medium malt.
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;growler pour thanks to jwattsrugger. A nice smooth ipa. Classic yellow orangish color. Nice citrus notes. very drinkable.
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;Growler thanks to Jcwattsrugger. Pours like chunky apple cider. Tons of hop sediment. Nose and tastes of dry hops and caramel malt. Slightly bitter.
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;On-Tap- Served a copper color with a small head with a bit of lacing. Aroma was primarily of pine with a hint of citrus. Starts with a nice hop tang. Flavor of some citrus and a bit of biscuit. Quite refreshing. Fairly medium body, crisp and clean. Seems to be well balanced. Very drinkable. Enjoyed enought to get a growler to take with me.
High Desert IPA;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;IPA;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Amber orange in color with a decent sized off-white head. Aroma is of light citrus and grain. Taste is not quite hoppy enough and a little watered down. Mostly just grain.
High Desert Peach Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;High Desert Brewing Company;Draft - Huge candied peach aroma. Clear gold with a thin head. Tastes very similar to the smell, although some grain peeks through mid palate. Finish isn’t cloyingly sweet, but mellow peach. This is way to sweet and is that sweet beer for people who don’t like bitterness.
High Desert Peach Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;High Desert Brewing Company;"The beer arrives from the tap with perhaps a light haze, though it may just be the dim bar and the fact that the beer is so cold I can’t really get rid of all the external condensation. The beer is a light gold color and is topped by a fluffy, pale tan colored head that leaves lots of lacing stuck to the sides of my glass. The aroma is dominated by the peach aromatics, it is noticeable as soon as the beer is handed to me and pretty much overwhelms anything else coming through. The beer is quite cold, on the dry side, well carbonated with an effervescence, and finishes dry and a touch astringent. The peach flavor becomes more prominent as the beer warms up and boosts the perceived sweetness just a bit. Soft straw like grain notes, and maybe a touch of cracker describe the malt presence here. This is light bodied and quaffable, though it is not to light. What I expected, peachy, refreshing and simplistic; not a bad example of a fruit beer, though not overly interesting either."
High Desert Peach Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;High Desert Brewing Company;Tap @ High Desert. Pours a clear, yellow appearance with a white head. Spicy, fuzzy peach, a bit floral, fruit forward aroma. Slightly bitter, a touch grainy, peachy flavor. Probably would be refreshing on a hot day, but nit really anything special.
High Desert Peach Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;High Desert Brewing Company;Pours clear with a thin head. Aroma was very peachy, sweet without being cloying. Tastes of (surprise!) peaches and malt. Light finish, just a touch of hops. While I enjoyed this beer, it’s just not my style of beer. Too light and sweet. My wife, on the other hand, had 2 pints.
High Desert Peach Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. It was so good that I only got pints of this beer (3 of them) because it was too good to pass up. Pours a clear light orange with a white head. Aroma (please ignore the prior rater) is SUPER peachy. It smells like a fresh peach. Sweet, but not artificial. Flavor is again, very peachy, whole peaches not just the juice with just a hint of the background wheat malt. I think I’m drinking a peach. Best peach ale ever because it really tastes like actual peaches without the sweetened juice. Awesome stuff. 9/4/8/4/16 [4.1/5]
High Desert Peach Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;High Desert Brewing Company;tap at brewery-good wheat beer here-not a lot of peach flavor-mainly ads sweetness to the brew. not to shabby
High Desert Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;Draft - Light sweet grain and a bit of citrus. Clear gold with a rich white head. Wheat and some sweetness with a clean finish. Decent, but nothing special.
High Desert Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;The beer pours from the growler with a one-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head. The beer is a brilliantly clear, copper hued color. The beer has quite a bit of buttery character, lots of malty character, but not much wheat character that I was expecting. the buttery notes really seem to dominate here. Soft caramelized malt character, no real wheat character, a touch of metalic character, and a soft buttery note that becomes a bit morenoticeableas the beer warms up. The body is fairly light here, but definitely has a viscous quality to it. Not bad, but a pretty standard wheat beer.
High Desert Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;Tap @ High Desert. Pours a clear yellow appearance with an off white head. Straw, grainy wheat, a bit fruity, slightly herbal aroma. Light lemon fruitiness, fairly dry, a bit grainy flavor. Not very exciting but it’s easy to drink.
High Desert Wheat;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;good refreshing wheat brew in this desert climate here in New Mexico. just plain good and refreshing. ReRate-pours semi-cloudy light orange hue with a nice white head-fluffy. Aromas of citric hops ( i dont remember that much hops in this beer), red wheat, pale malts. Smells like a very fresh crisp beer. Flavors are hoppy, pale malts, grainy sweetnes and decent palate. A very respectible wheat, even after the fact I thought it sucked when I had it the first time.
High Desert Stout;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Stout;High Desert Brewing Company;Decent stout. Roasted malt aroma but not strong. Dark and creamy looking with a thin head. Smooth and lightweight palate. Felt like a milk stout. More roasted malt flavors with some sweetness and a slight hops bitterness. Nothing unique though but very drinkable.
High Desert Stout;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Stout;High Desert Brewing Company;"A steady pour into my teku glass produces a one-finger thick, lightly browned, dark tan colored head. The beer is a rich black color that is quite opaque. The nose has nice roasted nuttiness, lots of roasted grain, chewy burnt grain husk, and just an overall, smooth rich maltiness. Touches of dark chocolate, a solid toasted whole grain character that becomes more prominent as the beer warms up. Smooth up front, but then a bitter, sharp roasted character kicks in towards the finish, and lingers nicely on the palate. Black, concentrated, malt-sweetened coffee, charred malt, burnt dark chocolate. Bitter hop notes meld with the roasted, bitter malt notes. There is a light malt sweetness to the beer, which really helps to balance the roasted malt character. Overall the roast character is kept really smooth here, it is sharp / biting in the right ways. The beer is quite quaffable, light enough, but still definitely a stout with enough palate presence, heft, and viscosity. The malt sweetness that is here even seems to provide suggestions of vanilla after the beer warms up quite a bit. A rich toasted nutty note, lots of rich dark maltiness, malted candy notes (without being overly sweet), and burnt caramel brittle are all more noticeable as the beer warms up. This is a really well balanced and easy drinking for a standard Stout; I really like how smooth it is, but still has enough of a bit and sharpness from the roast character to keep this interesting. There is a burnt smokiness to this brew that lightly influences both the aroma and the flavor. This is defintely a beer meant for drinking throughout an evening."
High Desert Stout;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Stout;High Desert Brewing Company;Tap @ High Desert. Pours a dark reddish brown appearance with a creamy brown head. Roasty malty, cocoa, a bit herbal aroma. A touch fruity, very roasty, slightly smoked, dark chocolate flavor.
High Desert Stout;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Stout;High Desert Brewing Company;Roasty aroma. Black in color with tan head. Flavor is quite roasty with slight red apple peel under tone. Roast flavors coat and linger.
High Desert Stout;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Stout;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours black with a thick tan head. Aroma of very roasted malt. Flavor of tons of parmesean cheese (it’s like I’m eating a carton of cheese), some roastedness. Smooth palate. Decent stout. I don’t know what my finding of parm cheese in this beer means but it did take away from my enjoyment. 7/4/6/4/14 [3.5/5]
High Desert Stout;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Stout;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours a fairly dark black with a bit of reddish brown hints near the edges. Low retentive white almost tanned head. Very sweet roasty aroma, small hints of coffee. Flavor starts malty malty malty and never really goes anywhere else. Slight roast is there...ever so slight hint at burnt coffee, and ends in a very subtle hop note. Good, but would almost be better billed as a sweet stout!
High Desert Stout;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Stout;High Desert Brewing Company;aroma of coffee and rich roasted malts. Super sweet and hoppy. Palate is somewhat thin, but the flavors make up for it. Nice roasted finish that has a real nice kick.
High Desert Stout;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Stout;High Desert Brewing Company;Dark, nice head. Unground coffee bean aroma and taste...not overly complex but VERY good. A crispy hop finish emerged as it warmed.
High Desert Scottish Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;Amber-copper in color with descent white head. Malty sweet aroma and taste. Taste also has a touch of alcohol and a bit earthy.
High Desert Scottish Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Light brown with a tint of red and a small off-white head. Aroma is sweet malt and toffee with hints of leather and peat. Taste is of peat, light hop notes and caramel withe a hint of maple.
High Desert Scottish Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;tap at brewery-Im not a scottish ale type of person, but this one was a solid brew. pours a deep red color-slightly hazy. Aroma of currant, earthy hops, and alcohol soaked fruits (this batch came in at 7%). Palat was thick and chewy-flavors of peat, earth hops, rich malts that tingle the tongue. A solid offering from my local brewery.
High Desert Scottish Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;High Desert Brewing Company;Probably the most average of all of the brews I had there but it still kicked ass! The aroma was of sweet maple syrup. The taste was a bit hoppier than I expected. Also had some hints of alcohol before the clean, non-lingering finish.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Pours a hazy golden orange, little to no head and lacing. Pine, floral notes, hints of lemon. Balanced taste, both bitter and sweet. Hoppy, sweet citrus, hints of resin, grapefruit. Really nice imperial IPA.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Golden cloudy colour. Small white head that clings to the glass. Earthy grapefruit hops. Sharp bittering hops as the beer enters. Soft maltiness, but it drowns in the hops. A little one dimensional perhaps. Papery and salty finish.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Aroma of pine, floral and light citrus. Pours hazy yellow orange with a small but frothy head. Taste is bitter with nice pine and floral. Very intense and bitter.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Nice orange pour. Aroma of hop and grapefruit. Similar taste with the perfect blend of caramel malts and dry bitter finish. A really well built beer.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Draft. An amber beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma has notes of citrusy hops and grapefruits. The flavor is sweet malty with strong notes of hops lending it notes of grapefruit, combined with notes of over ripe fruits and alcohol, the latter leaves a burn in the mouth, before the very bitter finish sets in.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Had this at the Portland Int’l Beer Fest in July 2010. Colour... apricot-orange with no head. Nose... sweet, strongly grapefruit-like hops. Palate... cloying, sweetly coating yet bitter with orange slices, lemon drops, Sour Patch Kids and a long bittersweet finish.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Tap at GABF 2009. Pours a hazy bright orange with a nice fluffy sticky white head. Aroma is very piney, sappy, sticky resinous dank hops, with lots of citrus oil and grapefruit- modest malt backbone. Flavor is orange zest, pine resin and tar, white pine sap, mint and lots of fresh citrus fruits- decent malt backbone- lightly sweet, and a resinous bitter finish. Nice!
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Light orange with a fizzy white head. Huge hops aroma with caramel and grapefruit hiding in the background. Tastes of hop resin and more resin, orange, and caramel. Not overly bitter and reasonable smooth for what it is.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Draft @ the brewpub. Nose is just a torrent of pungent, resiny, dank stickiness. Cotton candy, papaya, mango, weed, light background of a wet cellar - sure smells like Amarillo, though not sure. Honestly - the nose can not be improved on. Taste is a slightly subdued version of the nose to start, sticky and fruity, with a mid-range of a tannic, almost vinous bitterness that’s more evident as it warms. Finish is crisp and clean, carbonation is perfect. Enough body for substance, no lingering sweetness or stickiness. Just enough caramel/biscuit malt to balance. Awesome beer. Damn close to a worldbeater when it’s fresh like this.
21st Amendment Double Trouble Imperial IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Yellow brown and cloudy color with a creamy off-white head. Thick lace. Aroma is nice and strong with grapefruit and strawberry with floral notes and some hops in there as well. Flavor is mostly hops, less fruit than I would like. Some strawberry and grapefruit flavor in there. It’s supposed to be 100 IBUs, but I thought it was well balanced. Medium bodied. I like it, but I wish it had a creamier mouthfeel. Doesn’t quite feel like a double IPA to me.
21st Amendment Belgian Strong Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;21st Amendment Brewery;Listed as 21st amendment strong ale at mad mex robinson so I guess this is where it goes. Quite dark but bot brown. Sweeter perfumy aroma. Wew, strong alky impact on the first taste, certainly no effort is made to hide the alky, after all it is a strong ale. Quite flat from the tap. Finish is bitter medicine, over the top.
21st Amendment Belgian Strong Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;21st Amendment Brewery;Tap. Dark mahogany brown color with a tan head. Dark malts, slightly sour, caramel and toffee, and very little spice that I usually expect in a Belgian Strong Ale.
21st Amendment Belgian Strong Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;21st Amendment Brewery;Medium brown color. No head. Somewhat yeasty, although it almost tastes and smells more English than Belgian. Some alcohol in the nose. Caramel flavor. Some plum. Mild bitterness in the finish. Medium body. Not the best Belgian-style beer but nice to see the attempt.
21st Amendment Belgian Strong Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;21st Amendment Brewery;I think this is the first time that I have had an american brewpub beer which truly resembled one of the darker trappist beers. Taste was average though, lots of plum, raisin, and yeast. I really appreciated where they were going and it was a good beer, but dont expect a truly trappist taste.
Sonoran Nut Brown;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Sample @ Brewhouse in Phoenix Medium sweet aroma along with some roasted nut as well. Dark body but add some light and it has an amber color to it. Left some good lace on the small sampler glass. Decent roasted nut flavor with the added sweetness well blended together made this a good brew. Smooth and enjoyable beer.
Sonoran Nut Brown;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;"This beer is lightly hazy, amber tinged, brown color. It is topped by a wispy tan colored head. The aroma is certainly malt focused; there i sa nice mix of raisin notes, toasted and sweet malt notes, some biscuit type aromas and perhaps just a touch of roast character. Overall the aroma is quite nice. The taste finishes with a nice nutty note that almost picks up a hint of roast character. There is some caramel / toffee sweet malt notes up front and it is joined by a nice, supporting spicy hop note. This beer is nice, soft, easy drinking, yeat flavorful, Norther English in character, but definitely better than Newcastle."
Sonoran Nut Brown;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;"On tap at brewery: This has some hazelnut and roasty flavors, but overall, it’s fairly subtle, no, boring; I didn’t catch any creaminess in the palate, but there is plenty of astringency. Just not that good."
Sonoran Nut Brown;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Aroma had that caskiness to it along with standard brown ale nuttiness. The mouthfeel was super creamy, but I thought it was lacking flavor. The flavor intensified as it warmed but it was still just a plain old brown ale.

Ehnle;Shrewsbury Beer Share, 2nd Oct 2017. 0.5 litre bottle taken my me: Five of us split the bottle. Cloudy dark golden pour, white crown. Bananas ruled the nose, vanilla ruled the flavour.

Big Time C. Brown Brown Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Time Brewery;Quite dark in appearance, almost porter like. Really great chocolate aroma with just a touch of burnt toast. Sweet flavor with a light roasty finish. A solid brew that I am going to return to next time at Big Time.
Big Time C. Brown Brown Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Time Brewery;I had this on both regular draft and nitro taps--and it was suprisingly good--though not outstanding. Mahogany bodied with a nice layer of cream and an exciting sweet rounded brown ale and chocolate aroma. Light chocolate and carmel form one half of the dichotomy and the hop backbone the other. These disparate elements--clash and coalesce--playing off each other delectably. A good find from Big Time.
Big Time C. Brown Brown Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Time Brewery;Looked like a cloudy cider...almost like toilet water? Not very attractive IMO. This beer was just weird from start to finish. Not a typical brown as far as taste, it had a weird maltiness, followed by a very sour finish....yuck!
Big Time Chocolate Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big Time Brewery;Frothy, thick beige head sat atop this dark brown/black beer. This beer tasted like melted choclate ice cream....the creamy texture and sweet choclate flavor said it all the way. The finish had definite notes of alcohol.
Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;Poured from a bottle. I Must admit it was my first cream ale ever and I found it’s mild taste without bitterness quite enjoyable
Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a clear brown-amber with a small, creamy, long lasting, off-white head that leaves curtains of lace. Mild, sweet aroma of caramel malt, brown sugar and leafy hops. Sweet flavour of bready malt, caramel, sour dark fruit and a hint of nuts with a dry, bitter hop finish. Light to medium body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Ok.
Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;Rating #1826 - 2015.07.09 - Russell Tap Takeover @underground_edm. Amber pour, decent white head. Aroma of toffee malt, grassiness. Taste is sweet, light, refreshing. Little character beyond the aforementioned sweetness.
Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;On tap @ The Local. Clear light Amber, compact white head. Grainy with a bit of caramel, thin and bland. Who put this on the site as a mild ale when the brewery itself calls it a cream ale? Who cares. It’s pretty featureless regardless.
Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;Poured from 341mL bottle. Clear copper colour with minimal off-white head. Some toasted caramel malt on the nose. Mild malt, nut and bread taste. Light body.
Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;Not bad. Pours an iced tea color. Some roasty aromas and flavors. A touch of coffee on the finish. Pretty good for a cream ale.
Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;On tap at Underground. K, cheating here. Took 3 sample glasses and dumped them into one glass - Apx 4-5oz. Medium amber. Everything from here on are in the light or faint category. Smellz - toasty, grains, random citrus, mostly malts. Flavz: very similar with more obvious malts and less grain. Watery was expected. A pint could be drank in three big chugs.

Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;341ml bottle pours a pale amber color with a finger of white head that disappears quickly leaving no lacing. Aroma is light malts and hops. Taste is malty sweet with some unflattering hop bitterness. Not one of the better cream ales out there and not recommended.
Russell Cream Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Russell Brewing Company;Enjoyed on cask at St. Augustine’s. A bit of carbonation here, just tapped cask. Some colour in the body and even a bit of red. Smooth, some flavour, Ok drinkability for a basic mild ale.Tad of hops and malt.Decent cask.

Robinson Cream Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Robinson Brewing (Canada);highly carbonated into the bottle and not pasteurized so short shelf life. This was fresh and tasted like the fresh drafts we had in college. Three malts-sweet, but not a Creemore. Dry aftertaste.

Robinson Cream Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Faint floral hops aroma, copper, small vanilla head. Malt flavour, hoppy after taste. Smooth, nice session ale.
Robinson Cream Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Faint aroma hard to tell what it is since there isn't much here. Light brown, dark gold in colour. Light malty hopy taste with a slight bitter finish for something that has hardly any visible carbonation it foams up in the mouth quite a bit. Its a toss up between being smooth and bitter. Decent for the style but I don't have alot of knowledge about cream ales.

Gold Crown Dark Premium Ale;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Gold Crown Brewery;This beer has a nice tan head with a rich dark colour.

Thick light brown foam that goes to a thin lace around the edge of my glass. Malt, sweet dark caramel with a very, very subtle roasted bitternes. I can almost taste the alcohol when the bitter aftertaste kicks in. Creamy, smooth, bitter in the finish. Refreshing though. There is nothing overpowering about it and it relativly mild all the way through.

Mia and Pias Rods Rodeo Red;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;possibly the best they had on, which was a surprise. Nice balance between darkish and caramel malts and brighter and earthy hops.
Mia and Pias Rods Rodeo Red;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Sampler at M&P. This had a nice flavor.... for a barley wine. Seriously, it tasted like a barley wine. Would even be a decent barley wine, but its not supposed to be.
Mia and Pias Rods Rodeo Red;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Sampled draught at Mia & Pias Tap Room, Klamath FallsRuby brown color, off-white head, nose of caramel corn & light roast.

Mia and Pias Rods Rodeo Red;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Mahogany with a foamy tannish head and spotty lacing. Roast and bitter aromas. Some funky one as well. I’m not spending too much time on it. Flavor is better with the roast coming out with some caramel and bitter hops. Medium bodied with a tangy palate and bitter tail.
Mia and Pias White Pelican Porter;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Porter;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;high scores so far, but there was something wrong with ours. Weak nose and body, and a very unpleasant plasticky aftertaste. Least favorite beer in a long while.
Mia and Pias White Pelican Porter;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Porter;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Sampler at M&P. Pretty standard Porter, but after all the trash I waded through to get to this one it made it taste that much better. Previous description says it all.
Mia and Pias White Pelican Porter;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Porter;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;One of the best Mia and Pias beers i’ve had, smooth chocolate, medium roast, very smooth palate.

Crown City Espresso Stout;Pasadena, California, United States;Stout;Crown City Brewery;At first I thought this was going to be a very enjoyable beer. Dark opaque blackish brown color with a creamy beige head (not on nitro). Moderate lacing. Roasty, barley aroma with a substantial coffee component that made me anticipate the first sip. The flavor started off well - roasted coffee flavor with a light chocolate aftertaste. Light acidity and mildly astringent. Moderate mouthfeel and carbonation. Dry finish. Then it warmed up and pulled a Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde on me. It became very acidic and quite astringent. The nice flavor vanished and I was stuck with half a pint of beer that I didn't want to finish. The rating reflects the transformation. Some work and this would be an excellent stout.
Mia and Pias Otto Mulligans Irish Stout;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Stout;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;decent irish stout with a semi dry malty finish. Light roast and chocolate on the nose and flavor. Thin, but tasty.

Mia and Pias Otto Mulligans Irish Stout;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Stout;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;I have to agree with some other reviews--this stout comes off a bit thin. Especially for a Guinness-style stout, it misses the mark. The flavor itself could be nice if the consistency were heavier.
Mia and Pias Otto Mulligans Irish Stout;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Stout;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Sampler at M&P. Beautiful black beer with lasting mahogany head. Could be a flavorful beer but had a strong hint of diactyl. Disappointing.
Mia and Pias Otto Mulligans Irish Stout;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Stout;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;I’d had this beer a few times before and been indifferent about it, feeling it was a bit watery. Then, low and behold I try it again and wham, they changed this thing into a beautiful beer. What once was, well like they say, very guiness-like, now was rich, heavy bodied, and had a well done smoked character to it. Chocolate malt flavor, roasty and rich, very well balanced with a light smoked finish. Very nice stout, please stay with this recipe.
Mia and Pias Otto Mulligans Irish Stout;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Stout;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Draught at alehouse. Black with tan head. Aroma of chocolate, roast barley. Notes of coffee, chocolate and toast in the mouth, with a disappearing finish. In the style of Guinness, it’s not quite up to draught Guinness from Ireland. It will do in a pinch.

Good dense white head leaves a coating, foamy lacing behind. Light citrus hop aroma with just a touch of caramel. Medium bodied. Malty with a light sweetness.

Mia and Pias Henley HayFeweizen;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;nope. outside of the cloudy look and the lemon, this is weak sauce. No distinct yeast or wheat character, just beer flavored water (though less offensive than the porter). Boooooring.

I wouldn’t hold it against them (maybe the retailer and distributor) if they just dated their stuff so the average consumer could decipher it, but they didn’t.
Steelhead Hopasaurus Rex;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Draft - Caramel and candy floss hops. Clear gold with a rich white head. Bitter, caramel and tons of orange with a light booze finish. Proper old school imperial.
Steelhead Hopasaurus Rex;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Thick foam. Beautiful copper. Umm, yea, so this is hop heaven. Lasting grassy grapefuit rind bitterness long lasting on palate. It’s like several hop varieties are fighting each other in a good way for my approval. Well done. Makes me want to go to Eugene, OR again.
Steelhead Hopasaurus Rex;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Golden amber with a very earthy and sharp hops and the end. It’s a not overwhelming taste but a great double ipa. Curious about the brewery and it’s association with steelhead.
Steelhead Hopasaurus Rex;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Bottle, as McKenzie Hopasaurus Rex. Pours clear amber with a medium off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a nice residual and good lacing. Aroma is light, buttery with notes of citrus, caramel and pine. Flavor is medium sweet and medium bitter, not really that well defined, smooth and easy to drink but undistinctive. Lingering harsh bitterness gives away the IBU, but the ABV is pretty well masked.
Steelhead Hopasaurus Rex;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;floral, grass, citrus, vanilla, banana, orange, hazy, white foam, medium sweetness, very bitter, lightly sour, medium body, sticky, average carbonation, long finish, all in all very drinkable IIpa. balanced enough to cover up alcohol, but not mind blowng as far as complexity. aroma reminiscent of a highland scotch when glass is empty and warmed, must be the malts.
Steelhead Hopasaurus Rex;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Bottled as McKenzie Brewing Co. Hopasaurus Rex IPA. 100 IBU, 9.5% ABV. Dark orange-brown pour with a good sized off-white head. Nice retention and lace. Heavy caramel and barnyard malt aroma with resiny, earthy hop elements in the background. Smells sweeter than it tastes. Light sweet, medium bitter flavor. Full body, creamy-sticky-oily texture and a long, yet subtle bitter finish. Malty style versus aggressively hopped. Good beer.
Steelhead Hopasaurus Rex;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Bottle with the McKenzie label. Pours hazy light copper with a foamy off-white head. First impression was resin aroma, next was non-citrus fruit, then citrus. Full bodied. Almost chewy. Very hoppy with a fair amount of brown sugar background. I’m going with earthy/resin/citrus for hop flavor. It’s pretty smooth - the hop burn is mild, but the hop impact on the mouth continually increases. It finishes very, very hoppy. Nice!
Steelhead Hopasaurus Rex;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;An imperial-style India Pale Ale. Extra deep gold color, extra strong, extra bitter, extra aromatic, extra everything. This was a very delicious IPA, rich and smooth with ample amounts of flavor and malt character. The hopping is so aggressive, but it never gets out of hand, it still stays balanced, right into the finish.
Kelley Brothers 5th Tower;Manteca, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;Tap @ the Bistro's Double IPA Festival. Swampy and murky amber brown color with a tan head. A grainy texture with hop fuel like peat bog. Some toast in the flavor.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;2002 Bottle via Indiana_Red: Way past it's prime but fun to try. It's lost its acidity and fizz. Flavors of sweetness and vegetables. Clear brown color. It was just fun to try something this old. Probably amazing back in the day.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;22oz caged/corked Bottle Clear redish brown. No head. Lost most of its carbonation over the last 16 years or so. Some woody soft maltiness and a litel wet brown paper character. but lacking almost all of the sour I assume it started with. Past its prime for sure....likely past its drink ability even.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle in Seattle. Very well past it’s prone. No head, mostly still, dead fruit and cherry nose. Oxidized, vegetal. Not good.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;"Deep rich brown coloured body with a lot of movement and some finer sediment floating around with a thin off-white head. Aroma of sour grapes, tons of earth, nuts, caramel, yeast and a noticeable bit of chocolate. Medium-bodied; Assertive earthy malt bite at first with a lot of chocolate, peanuts, yeast, alcohol, prunes and even more figs. Aftertaste is complex but on the earthy and nutty side with a lot of sugars, some of them caramelised and a good dose of alcohol noticeable to finish. Overall, a good, but not amazing beer - definitely nice to try, but I was expecting a bit more complexity and/or interesting flavours - this was just an abbey dubbel with more of a focus on malt, definitely belongs in that category. Still nice to sample, this a day before heading back out to Bottleworks to see what rarer beers I can find. I sampled this 33 cL bottle (NOT stubby as shown in picture, slender like most belgies) purchased from Bottleworks in Seattle, Washington on 25-April-2009 sampled at home in Washington (the real Washington) on 10-January-2013."
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;Quite dark color, medium foam. Aroma is caramellish and toffee, some bready yeast. Flavour is too sweet for me. Medium body.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;330 ml bottle shared by dbsdelight- thanks again, Dan! Dan said he found this at Corral Liquors years ago for $1 a bottle. 2004 vintage with a slim shape like a Struise bottle, not the Duvel-shaped one in the picture. Pours a clear amber with some sediment that hazes it a bit and a small off-white head that settles into just a ring. Aroma of brown sugar, toffee, dried fruits, candy apples, and a little Belgian yeast. Flavor of caramel malts, toffee, brown sugar, nuts, dried fruits, and rust. Light-medium bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, malty mouthfeel and sticky finish. Interesting beer that has held up okay since 2004 but probably won’t last any longer.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;Pours a hazy brown. Smells of bread and apple juice. Very sweet with a moderate bitterness. Lots of caramel aromas.Light alcohol touch. Also aromas of dates. Bready. Fullish bodied. Soft carbonation. Over the top.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;2004 Bottle pours hazy nut brown color with thin tan head. Aroma is nutty, raisin, plum, dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is more raisin, nut, dark fruit, bready, and finishes semi dry. A pretty tasty brew. Not quite a 4 though.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;Pours burnt orange. Nose is tart fruit, cherries, plum, grapes, some burnt caramel. Flavor is yeast, tat fruits, some funk, sweet fruity esters, toffee.
Bottleworks Van den Vern Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle. Pours cloudy reddish brown with a huge lasting beige head. Tart apples on the first sniff, followed by bread and raisins. Rich malty taste of dried fruits- apple, raisin, date, fig- bread, and spice. Subtle and smooth with a sweet and slightly bitter tobacco finish.
John O Gaunt Coat O Red;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John O Gaunt;Bottle conditioned, from The Offie in Leicester. Faintly hazy chestnut red, thin and quickly dissapearing head and minimal condition. Low sweet worty malt and gentle hop in the nose, sweet caramel and more worty sweetness in the mouth. Slight beefiness in the finish. Tastes like the priming sugar didn`t ferment out.
John O Gaunt Coat O Red;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John O Gaunt;Plain caramel bitter with a well hopped caramel aroma and a fruity hopped flavour. Overall a slightly above average bitter.
John O Gaunt Coat O Red;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John O Gaunt;Bottle Conditioned. From Bottles, London. BBE Feb 2004. Yep - a bit of fruit. I've not been impressed with John O'Gaunt in the bottle - perhaps they will be better in the cask. The three beers I've had have been thin and less than mediocre. All too many British brewers try bottle conditioning and fail big time. Bitter seems to be a damned awkward beer to condition in the bottle. This spilled up on opening, disturbing the yeast so you get it in the glass if you want it or not. There is possibly a reddish tinge, but it's mostly a muddy, murky brown. Some thin, slightly sharp, fruit on the nose. Thin to medium body with a slight harshness that becomes quite irritating, leaving a bloody taste in the mouth. Some fruit, but really not much in the way of quality flavours. Very poor. Nice labels - shame about the beers.
John O Gaunt Coat O Red;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John O Gaunt;Cask Conditioned at The White Lion, Fewcott, Oxon. Reddish amber beer with thin head. Dry malty tobacco flavours with a juicy sweet malt finish.
John O Gaunt Coat O Red;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John O Gaunt;A bitter from a relatively local micro brewer. This has a sweet biscuity aroma, slightly smokey, too. Flavours are of juicy, fruity malts followed by a good degree of dryness and some smokiness. Good story on the label as well!
John Harvards Holy Smoke Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap@John Harvards, Boston, Ma. Not bad, but a bit thin and uncomplex when you compare it to Schlenkerla. Some bacon juice smokeyness, with touches of caramel and chocolate. Sweetish.
John Harvards Holy Smoke Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap @ brewhouse: body is like a porter. Aroma is roast with chocolate, hints of coffee. Finish is chocolatey roast with a smokey feel. Enjoyable.
John Harvards Holy Smoke Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Found my notes on this from the Wayne, PA location. Poured ruby, with aroma of smoke, malt, and some cabernet. Tasted malty, with smoke, peat, cabernet, and cognac overtones at the finish. I enjoyed this beer.
John Harvards Holy Smoke Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Deep ruby/chestnut colour. Light smoke colour. Light smoke aroma. Smoky flavour to start with a mellowing finish. Average rauchbier.
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle. Very light citrusy hops aroma. Hazy gold with no head. Citrus hops and biscuity barley malt flavor. Medium body, flat carbonation. Considering this brewery went out of business about 2 years ago, I wasn’t expecting much from what was obviously and old bottle.
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Pours brassy gold with a short, off-white head. Scent is crisp citrus and water. Taste is malt....barely, borderline bitter. A bit flat. Probably would not have been bad when fresh.
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours dark golden in color. A bit citrusy that trails off at the end. Fairly crisp.
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle.A gold pour white head a fruity aroma taste of citrus feels very thin almost like water but finishes clean and smooth
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;22 oz bottle This was picked up in Indiana and I think it might have been infected at some point. Regardless I will leave a rating until I can get another bottle (if that ever happens). This had some promise but in the end was marred by the sourness that I am pretty certain is not intended. Fortunately it was a fairly inexpensive experiment. Aroma / Appearance - The foamy head that took over the entire glass was the first warning sign. Eventually though it did settle into a golden yellow body that sparkled like champagne. Yeasty and bright the nose was somewhat crisp. Whether or not they meant to it ended up smelling like a typical Jolly Pumpkin release. Flavor / Palate - Here is where the problems really begin. Sour apple juice is the primary player in something that seems flawed from the get go. If you get past that it seems to have some promise. I just hope that it is not indicative of the remaining bottles that I have yet to open like the stout.
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Pours golden with a thin white head. Arom is of citrus hops and malt. Mouthfeel is thin. Taste is carmel and malty with a bitter hops aftertaste.
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear light amber with a slightly off-white head. Aroma is dominated by malt notes giving a grainy aroma, some molasses and caramel present. Flavor is dominated by malts as well, slight piney undertone, but mainly a grainy biscuit flavor.
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Pours dark orange with a mostly receding off-white head. Notes of soapy hops, cheese, pear, citrus and acidity. Medium bodied with soft carbonation.
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Found this one bottled at a liquor store in St. John, Indiana, as part of a mix 12 pack of various beers from Indiana brewers. Very citrusy brew overall, with plenty of lemon, lime and grapefruit in the nose and flavor. Pucker-dry finish. Not bad!
Mishawaka Lake Effect Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Maybe a bad bottle - virtually flat beer with no head, almost no carbonation. tasty though, with pleasant maliness mixed with slight hops / spice finish. Will seek out a new bottle to re-rate - with more lively carbonationt his brew would be quite good.
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Hazy gold pour with thin white head. Acidic malty aroma. Citrus , sweet malts, and a small hop presence
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;bottle - Poured lightly hazy gold with almost no head. It had a light citrus and malt aroma. The flavor had a considerable citrus character with some sweet malt. I don’t know what happened to the carbonation though at least, despite the unusually high amount of fruit flavor for this style, I don’t think it’s infected. However, this beer makes the third or fourth bottle that I’ve had quality problems with of the eight beers I’ve tried from this brewer. That’s not a good record.
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of stfun. Pours gold and hazy with a huge white head. Smells soapy with touches of light citrus and perfumy. Tastes of citrus and slightly watery (as is fit for this style). A little too lemony for a kolsch, but a nice light drinker.
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle straight from the brewery: Pours a clear pale golden with a small, stringy-lacing wispy white head. Aroma of semi-sweet, grainy pale malts and the slightest hint of fruity esters. Body starts about average for the style with a very mild flavor and grain husk notes before a slightly more bitter and drier crisp finish. Pretty drinkable and close to style, but that’s about it.
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;fizzy, simply overpowering effervescence, or maybe the lack of flavor is the worst part of this beer. The beer wasn’t awful, but for the price of a pint, i could have bought several pints of any random light macro brew without losing out on quality. Summed up: reminiscent of bud light at twice the price and twice the fizz.
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker. This beer poured a very pale golden color with very lively carbonation bubbles floating around and a huge white head that would not go away. It took about five minutes to get the whole bottle into the glass due to the overwhelming amount of foam. The aroma was made up of sweet pale malts and some light citrus and lemon. The flavor was very light and crisp with a slightly sour lemon note. The mouthfeel was expectedly thin with good deal of carbonation. Average at best.
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;From the bottle this pours a pale yellow body with a thick fizzy head. The aroma is pale sweet malt and lemon grass. The latter turns into lemon juice in the flavor and dominates the drink. Nothing I’d care to repeat. Pat’s Liquors, Porter, IN
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle. Sweet and slightly grainy aroma, not really appealing. Clear golden body is heavily carbonated with a soapy white head. Crisp medium body, slightly oily. Taste is biscuity, bready, and slightly grainy, sweet and malty with a touch of citrus but no hops or bitterness. Can’t call this a Kölsch, but can certainly drink it.
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Tap at brewery: Geez go figure, served way too cold even for a Kölsch, finally after waiting about 20 minutes able to taste. Well it is a bit grainy and has some sweet malt background with almost no bitterness minus a hit of citric twang. Drinakble but hardly to style.
Mishawaka Kolsch;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Bright golden yellow with more haze than I’d expect in a kolsch. Very mild fruity sweet, citrus aroma. The flavor was also very sweet, but still very drinkable. A bit of a drier finish would be ideal. Nice silky body. Middle of the road.
Müllerbräu Heimer Leicht;Pfaffenhofen/Ilm, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Müllerbräu Pfaffenhofen;Bottle looks very simple, but okay. Beer in the glass deep golden, zippy, nice head. Starts mild but not washy, fine hoppy-dry notes. Not as bready as other beers of this style. Finish well balanced, a bit moldy, but still okay. Better than exspected!
Müllerbräu Heimer Leicht;Pfaffenhofen/Ilm, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Müllerbräu Pfaffenhofen;It’s golden with rapidly vanishing head. The aroma has notes of celluloses, old grain and hay, the flavor is slightly sweet and quite bitter in a harsh way and notes of malt, grain, light fruit, and the finish is slightly bitter/harsh. The body is quite full considering it’s a low alcohol...
Müllerbräu Heimer Leicht;Pfaffenhofen/Ilm, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Müllerbräu Pfaffenhofen;Definetly one of the better low alcohol/calory lagers I have tried: Pale and heavily carbonated, but with a nice rocky head. The carboard in the nose is very effectively masked with a good load of bitter and aromahops, likewise is the taste dominated by hops. Body is fuller than expected. Really nice brew actually.
Maxlrainer Aiblinger Schwarzbier;Maxlrain, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schlossbrauerei Maxlrain;50cl bottle. It is a good dunkel with dark ruby colour, medium, beige head, and low Co2. Taste is coffee, dark fruits (ex. blueberry). There is smoke in the end of gulps. Nice.
Maxlrainer Aiblinger Schwarzbier;Maxlrain, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schlossbrauerei Maxlrain;50 cl bottle. Rather a dunkel than a schwarzbier.

Medium to low body, average carbonation, thin texture

Maxlrainer Aiblinger Schwarzbier;Maxlrain, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schlossbrauerei Maxlrain;"50cl bb11/2017 merci idiosynkrasie for catering to another preferred style. - Somewhat of a misnomer, going by the smaller print and Bierartbeschreibung ""Dunkel Export"" here. Immediately betrays its Dunkel pedigree in its stewed maroni caramel nose, some straight up cooked barley soup and Schwarzbrot sourness - no real intensely aromatic Schwarz roast. More Dunkel export and diluted caramel sirup in taste, tolerable but standard, with an grassy bitter finish that partly makes me question this Schwarz’s origins in a lighter export. Not bad as such that..."
Maxlrainer Aiblinger Schwarzbier;Maxlrain, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schlossbrauerei Maxlrain;500 ml bottle, served in mug. Pours brown-reddish with medium-sized head.

Taste of sweet roasted caramel malts with hints of vanilla, chocolate and liquorice; taste is quite sweet; not much bitterness (thankfully); alcohol well hidden. Medium body.

Bootleg Raging Bull;Margaret River, Australia;Porter;Bootleg Brewery;When poured, the Bootleg - Raging Bull immediately announces its intent. A rich loamy head accompanies a dark nectar of a beer, with an immediate scent of coffee and fruits assaulting the senses. On first taste, the rich coffee is apparent, but surprisingly the 7.1% isn't. The lingering sweetness of the underlying dark fruits tempts the palate for just another sip. Definitely work a taste. Frangimus
Bootleg Raging Bull;Margaret River, Australia;Porter;Bootleg Brewery;Bottle @ home. Pours a deep reddish brown / black appearance with a dark brown head. Some burnt sugar, dark grapes, plums, dark chocolate, and light coffee in the nose. A bit on the sweet side. Kind of gooey mouth feel. A touch medicinal. Thick brown sugar.

OHaras Pantown Pale Ale;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Pours a clear light gold, topped by an inch of very frothy soap-sudsy white foam. Good head retention, excellent lacing. Noticeable citrus hops in the aroma - not bad at all. Flavor - fresh citrus hops and caramel malt. No real complaints from me, except that they could have been a bit bolder. Body on the light side, but excellent carbonation that compliments the hops. Citrus and a hint of pine hops in the aftertaste. Let’s call it a dumbed-down version of a West Coast pale ale. Bump up the body a little, and this would be a very nice beer indeed.
OHaras Pantown Pale Ale;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Sampled draught at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis, October 7 2006. Light amber with little head and a touch of lacing....faintly fruity, PNW-hopped aroma, fresh but very light and indistinct....clean and refreshing body, moderately fruity and moderately dry towards the finish, but metallic traces near the finish seriously hurt this beer for me....overall, rather dull.
OHaras Pantown Pale Ale;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub in St. Cloud. Light copper pour with a white spongy head, good lacing. Fresh lake water aroma, not much else comes through. Brief hints of hoppines, with some citrus undertones.

My expectations weren’t too high considering the relatively low ratings of Ohara’s other brews. However, with the small volume of ratings and solid experience I personally have had with 2 of 3 other Ohara’s brews, I’m not ready to write them off yet. Some bitterness evident; enough to keep the palate interested. Session qualities. Well balanced; moderately sweet. A little thin, but above average for a brewpub beer."
OHaras Sids Irish Stout;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Stout;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;In a bottle in Dresden, not that flavourful or complex for a stout. Basically bad for the easiest style

OHaras Sids Irish Stout;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Stout;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;"""Just called Oharas Stout, but I think this is it. Didn’t do anything special for me.

Raccoon River Tallgrass Light;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Raccoon River Brewing;I’ll just ask why? On tap at the brewery with nothing to it at all. For instance, I rated flavor low not because it’s bad just because there’s no flavor. No aroma. Did I ask why?
Raccoon River Tallgrass Light;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Raccoon River Brewing;On tap @ Raccoon River. Light yellow appearance with a white head. Nice sweet pale malty lager nose. Quite sweet, slight soapy pale lager flavor.
Raccoon River Tallgrass Light;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Raccoon River Brewing;Tap. Very pale pour with a white head. Mild aroma and taste - some corn character and little else.
Raccoon River Tallgrass Light;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Raccoon River Brewing;I doubt there’s any lagering going on with this one, but Golden Ale/Blonde Ale doesn’t seem appropriate... this beer is very pale yellow with a white head. The nose is sweetened corn and lemon, with a fresh but flavorless introduction, quick dissolving into a thin, mildly buttery, forgettable twang... there’s some light notes of fruit, but still, there’s really not much in there to be found. Bland, simple, mailed-in for the Bud drinkers, so no surprise it’s not the best beer in the world.
Raccoon River Tallgrass Light;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Raccoon River Brewing;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden color with white head that left only a tiny bit of filmy lace. Light sprucy hop aroma accented by a hint of honey. Malty cereal grain flavor. There was also a peculiar industrial cleaner type flavor lingering somewhere in the background. Crisp and dry on the tongue.
Raccoon River Tallgrass Light;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Raccoon River Brewing;On tap at the brew pub. The body was pale yellow with a thin white head. The aroma was grassy with some carrots and lemon zest. The taste was watered down green bell peppers with slight spice in the finish.
Raccoon River Tallgrass Light;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Raccoon River Brewing;Draft-4 oz. sampler--Looks like and tastes like most light lagers. Gold color with no head, slight aroma, and the soft corn taste. It least it tasted fresher than most light beers.
Raccoon River Tallgrass Light;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Raccoon River Brewing;On tap at the brewpub during the 2006 Crescent Moon Beer Bus Trip. Pale blonde in color. Flat with no head. Tastes like a BMC that sat around until the next morning opened. FLAT. Diacyl and metallic finish. Very corny. It sucks.

Raccoon River Vanilla Cream Ale;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Cream Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Tap. Very light yellow pour with minimal head. Nice aroma of cream soda. Dies on the palate - tastes unfinished. Good start, but this could be developed into something nice.
Raccoon River Vanilla Cream Ale;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Cream Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Average light gold color. Nice vanilla aroma, could be used as a room freshened. Enjoyed the vanilla flavor, hops did not clash. Palate rougher than I thought it should be.
Raccoon River Vanilla Cream Ale;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Cream Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Draft at the brewery. Very pale yellow colored body with just the slightest haze possible. Flavor is strange vanilla syrup, stenchy and sour bread and cereal grains and some simple, sour and stale saltine crackers. Nose has some notes of burnt pepper and burnt almonds... the cream ale element is fairly easy to see, there’s some light milky notes, even coming off as cream soda, and if I had to say something nice about it, I’d say that vanilla is a good thing to put in a cream ale, since it actually works without being difficult. But overall there’s not much to get excited about.
Raccoon River Vanilla Cream Ale;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Cream Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Eh.... Tastes and smells like lightly fermented cream soda, almost no beer flavor whatsoever. Certinally not my thing.
Raccoon River Vanilla Cream Ale;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Cream Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden color with thin white head that left a bit of lace on the glass.

Raccoon River Homestead Red Ale;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Filtered rusty red colored body with a small near-white head. Nutty, chewy caramel malt base with some honey and caramel candy sweetness across the middle, and a bran and dog food note that develops across the back. Astringent and coarse texture, with some harsh burnt peanuts in the finish. Hop presence is nutty and bready up front, but gets consumed in the dog food bran malt flavor in the back. Forgettable.
Raccoon River Homestead Red Ale;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Draught at the brewpub. Clear orange-red color with off white head that laced the glass. Light fruity aroma (plum and fig) accented by a hint of toasted bread. Fruity flavor with malty caramel and toast notes. Reminded me a bit of a fresh-tasting Bass Ale.

Raccoon River Bandit IPA;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;IPA;Raccoon River Brewing;Tap. An awful example of an IPA. Light gold pour with nearly no head. Aroma is slightly skunky. No malt balance - not that there is enough hops to need it. Boring.
Raccoon River Bandit IPA;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;IPA;Raccoon River Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a mostly clear, golden colored body with a thin, creamy, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is sweet lemony citrus and a lighter caramel. Some grainy pale malts and a light floral. Flavor is similar. Grainy pale malts with a light caramel and a decent hop backing. Some lemony citrus and a light grapefruit with some pines and florals. Pines grow slightly into the finish to give this an almost moderate bitterness as it dries with a light residual sweetness. Medium length aftertaste following a light to medium body and light carbonation. Overall, an okay ipa. There is a decent hop presence to this, but its nothing special. A bit thin feeling and slightly sweet at times. Eh...
Raccoon River Bandit IPA;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;IPA;Raccoon River Brewing;Fresh growler courtesy of CanIhave4beers. Pours amber/gold and slightly hazy with a lasting, generouse white head. Smells of juicy citrus, ginger, coriander, spicy, perfumy. Tastes of grapefruit, grassy, peppery, some juicy fruit gum, melon, honey, a touch of resin, bitter finish. If I were local, I’d be drinking multiple pints of this one weekly.

Raccoon River MacCoy's Scotch Ale;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Raccoon River Brewing;On tap at the Festival of Iowa Beers. Pours light bronze with slight head, nice rich toffee aroma but way lightweight for a Scotch ale. Sweetish light flavor, but I could taste none of the peat I expect in this style.

Raccoon River Stonecutter Stout;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Raccoon River Brewing;Poured black with a nice beige head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. Taste was coffee, chocolate, and lactose sweetness. Could have used more hops to balance it.
Raccoon River Stonecutter Stout;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Raccoon River Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Deep, rich black colored body with a nice-looking dark brown creamy espresso head. Heavy char, roast and smoked malt all over this thing, and the body is somewhat thin so it’s comes across a little like soy sauce and the drippings of an intense campfire put out with a jug of water... the liquid smoke and charred meat and wood almost make it too much to deal with, but over time I developed a fondness for just how rich, smoky and black this thing is.. it’s pervertedly charred and smoky, but honestly not that bad. Oily and astringent in the finish... wouldn’t be considered anything great, but it’s good for what it is.
Raccoon River Stonecutter Stout;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Raccoon River Brewing;Draught at the brewpub. Carbonated. Opaque black color with khaki head that laced the glass.

75th Street Hefeweizen;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;75th Street Brewery;quite an unimpressive attempt, especially when compared with the american wheat they make. mouthfeel is almost foamy. hazy yellow color, and a flavor so underwhelming that it fades from memory as fast as it fades from the taste buds.
75th Street Hefeweizen;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pour a hazy yellow with very little head in a plain ol’ pint glass. Smells just like a banana boat, or at least what I’d imagine a banana boat would smell like. Some spicey phenols and some citric character. Banana is still up front in the flavor. Phenolic and yeasty. A nice hit of bitterness. Some DMS. Doughy on the palate. It hit the spot this time.
75th Street Hefeweizen;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;75th Street Brewery;Strong aroma with banana, clove, and lemony citrus. Dark, cloudy golden in color and a medium head. Very apparent wheat malt flavor, along with the spicy, estery yeast and pervasive citrus which carries through to the sharp finish. A by-the-numbers German Wheat, but doesn't really suffer for it. Very citrusy and served with an un-asked for slice of lemon. Why anyone would want it is beyond me, this one is very lemony as-is.
Southampton Imperial Russian Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;Bottle at the DC Spring RB Tasting. 2010 vintage. Thanks nimbleprop! Poured a really dark, virtually pitch black color with a small/medium sized tan head. Aroma was lots of rich malts, some age is found on this one, but not nearly as much as I would have expected for it being a 9 year old beer. Bakers chocolate, roasted malts, some dusty attic. Unadulterated. Chocolate. Roast. Super solid. Really good even 9 years later.
Southampton Imperial Russian Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;2010 big thanks to nimbleprop. Big roast and dry the way I like impy stouts.

Southampton Imperial Russian Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;2014 bottle #199/550. Not much pop on the cap and little carbonation on the pour.

Southampton Imperial Russian Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;"From Sep 2006 Poured from 22oz bomber(2005) a very dark brown/ with a very large head of foam that shrank slowly leaving just a fine layer. The smell is hugely sweet..I note caramel and chocolate with a pretty big nose of alcohol. I know it's still summer but the aroma gave me visions of sitting in front of a fireplace with a few feet of snow outside....err... I digress. The taste is really big on roasted malt, coffee, caramel, and chocolate and is sweet as all heck right up to the finish where there's a bit of hop bitterness and some alcohol warmth. After a few sips, I noticed more bitterness from the chocolate and coffee flavours so the over all sweetness of this stout calmed down a bit and I was able to enjoy it more. Good and tasty stuff but I could not drink more than 1 of these at a time for sure. ;^) Bottom line: This is a very tasty RIS that one should try given the chance. My thanks to Nutbrown for this sample!!"

Southampton Imperial Russian Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;Bottle thanks to Jim M. This was a hell of an extra. 2011 vintage. A: Pitch black with an extremely dark mocha head and legginess. N: Burnt brown sugar, licorice, smoke, toast, coffee and espresso, smoke, earth, lots of rich cocoa, marshmallow - even a bit of woodiness despite not being barrel aged. I could go on - but I kind of stopped rating it just to enjoy it.... T: Very sweet and substantially bitter and roasty. Very well balanced. M: Huge silky body, thick, creamy, very light alcohol presence, and soft carbonation. O: This is a tremendous treat. Unlike Vanilla Rye, it’s potent without breaking one’s will to drink. I really wish this was easier to get it, because it is fantastic.

Mostly characterized by the roasted malt, some more burnt malt and the related bitterness. Good final, as usual. Very interesting and quite original, I would call it 'Cappuccino lager'. [2002-01-16, 7-5-7-4-14] Dark amber lager. Malt aroma, light but nice. Delicate texture, malt taste, rather sweet for a lager. Good final, stronger than the usual dunkels.
Seeland Lago Mio;Nidau, Switzerland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Seeland Bräu;Beautiful dark brown and bright colour, few foam. Complex and dense aroma of malt, yeast, chocolate and hazelnut.

Fliegerbier;Schwäbisch Gmünd, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Engel Brauerei;Comes in a wacko aluminium bottle. They obviously has spent much more money on the packaging than on ingredients or training for the brewers. The nose is full of alcohol and grain. Pours pale yellow with brief head.

Fliegerbier;Schwäbisch Gmünd, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Engel Brauerei;My parents bought me this beer in Berlin in 'das Kaufhaus am westen' or something like that.

Indeed a bit more sweet and fruity. Alcoholic palate.
Fliegerbier;Schwäbisch Gmünd, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Engel Brauerei;"Typical pilsener appearance, clear golden with rapidly disappearing head. Strong and sweet nose and flavour, obvious alcohol. Should be different from ""Engel La Bière de la Grande Armée"" and ""Engel Frohe Weihnachten"", but that's perhaps only by the label."

Being a staff member of a beer pub I was able to get hold of it, and in my opinion it was the best ""springbok"" i've tasted this year made by dutch breweries. It had a lovely clear and goldenbrown color,fruity nose, and a nice hopy aftertaste(their new brewmaster originated from la Trappe) likes bitterness in his beers."

Holsten Fusion Kurrant;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);From a Bottle.Pale gold in colour,no head,fruit and berry aroma,chemical sweetness that was too much for me.
Holsten Fusion Kurrant;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Sometimes as a beer lover you have to make sacrifices and this was one of them. A very poor attempt at a fruit beer which thankfully seems to have been taken off the shelves at least in England.No doubt the brewer who produced this did it under duress from the Marketing and Finance people.I can think of no other reason.Personally I would rather resign than have my name associated with this apollogy for a beer.
Holsten Fusion Kurrant;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Bottle: Light, golden color. There is basically no head to it, and what is there fizzes right away. There are currants in the aroma, but it also smells strongly of pine. Syrupy taste of currants, with something else there also. The other tastes completely mask what I'm sure is a completely non-descript lager. I like fruit beers, but this is a disaster. STAY AWAY! (So much for bringing something back from England that looked different: it was!)
Holsten Fusion Kurrant;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Bottle. Gold colour, no head and moderate condition. At least they avoided the temptation to make it purple. Raspberry and blackcurrant mask any obvious beer aromas, save for a slightly lambic acidity. Saccharine sweet and harshly chemical in the mouth. Dry and sharp on the throat in the finish.
Holsten Fusion Kurrant;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);The incorrect spellings are as they appear on the bottle! This smells more musty than fruity, in fact it smells plain wrong. Looks like a flat lager. Flavours are syrupy and chemical. Sickly, nasty stuff - this is not a beer it is a terrible alcopop exercise. The finish clings to the roof of your mouth, a reminder of how bad this is. Please, drink a lambic!

Schön hefetrüb im Glas, Geruch leicht wässrig. Der Antrunk ist wässrig mit recht viel CO². Dabei kaum Aromen wahrnehmbar. Im Hauptteil ist eine leichte, in Ansätzen erkennbare Hefenote auszumachen, die in der omnipräsenten Mineralwassernote leider (komplett) untergeht. Der Nachgeschmack ist typisch Mineralwasser, schön feinperlig, angenehm mild und absolut neutral. Ganz in Ansätzen ist nach einiger Zeit auf der Zunge noch ein letzter herber Nachklang auszumachen, der aber auch durch die Kohlensäure hervorgerufen worden sein könnte. --> Als Bier: Grausam! Als Mineralwasser mit Bier-Aroma: Super! Das Ganze hat 12° Stammwürze und nur 3,3% Alkohol - da hat man ein tolles Weizen unter Garantie mit 1/3 Mineralwasser aufgegossen... sowas gehört verboten!!!

Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Hm. Tastes like Holsten with lemon juice and sugar poured into it, which is precisely as bad as you’d think.
Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);The third fruit beer from this brewery that I had the misfortune to try.Just as bad as the other two-like them it has nothing going for it.Only suitable for under age drinkers on a saturday night somewere very boring.
Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Lemon pledge aroma. Watery mouthfeel. Bit to sweet. Not much in the way of beer flavour. Not unenjoyable but would not make a repeat purchase.
Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Color is a light clear golden yellow, thin white loose head that fades fast to leave a thin ring and very tiny spotty lace. Smell is soapy musty lemon, straight up weird and not to pleasant. What lacks in smell makes up for it in the taste. Its a quick little surge of lemonade, not to sugary but pretty darn sweet, partially artificial like those lemon drop candies. Actually alot like that but much quicker. Thin creamy feel and lightly crisp and quick. Over way to soon, I need more. Don't know what to think of this one, a bit hard to finish even though it plays around with a refreshing quality thats a bit nice, but its just to strange for me to really like. This concoction may have been the brain child for the Malternative style lemonade drinks, who knows?
Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Aroma is very strong lemon smell almost over-powering. No head, clear in appearance. Carbonation bubbles. Flavour is very lemony. It doesn't seem like a beer taste, but more like a lemon drink with beer added. This is more a shandy than a beer.
Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Pale yellow w/ very little head retention. Light lemon, pepper, & skunk nose. Sugary, syrupy feel. Taste like sugar water flavoured w/ a lemon syrup (kind of has a Mr. Clean thing going on as well). Might be getting some hops in the finish, but I'm not sure.

Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Maybe my opinion was affected by the fact that I drank a bottle after several hours of yard work on a Sunday afternoon, but I actually didn't think this beer was horrible. Yeah, it's a mediocre Euro-lager, slightly skunky due to the green bottle, mixed with some artifical tasting lemon flavour. But it was a lot less offensive than I expected, and did a nice job quenching my thirst. I won't be rushing back to the store for a case or anything, but as a fruity summer drink, it hit the spot better than any alcopop.
Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);They can keep this beer back in Europe. Pale yellow with no head. Light skunky aroma with of course lemons and citrus, artificial at that. Sweet with a slight bitterness that hangs in the roof of your mouth and the back of your tounge. I belive I am starting to have an ill feeling, sugar water.
Holsten Fusion Citrus;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Pale yellow, with a light white head.

Flavour is likewise a little bit off, but I think that's what they are aiming for so it is a bit of a tough call. If you you like Corona, you might like this.
Robinson Dos Tontos Mexx;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Part of the appeal of Mexican lager is that it comes from Mexico. The taste does not factor into the equation. Take away the exotic, warm locale, take away the clear glass bottle, and what you have left is imitation piss. Very unpleasant stuff, this.
Robinson Dos Tontos Mexx;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);"Medium grass like aroma light hop nose. Like they suggested on the label it is light gold in colour and this is what they were going for. Nice white head with small beads that didn't vanish in 30 seconds. Moderate carbonation. Yes it is quite ""quaffable"" Although I never had it with a lime it is a nice light lager. It is a bit bitter in the finish. It could do with a little less bitter then it would be more ""quaffable"" But overall I would say it is quite decent. Way better then any Corona could ever hope to be."

Court Avenue Kaplan Hat Hefeweizen;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Murky soft yellow. Swirling the yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle and pouring it made the murky swirls drop down into the glass, eventually dispersing and transforming this beer from a transparent yellow runofthemill beer beer into a cloudy, almost perfect looking hefeweizen. The smell was quite sweet, citrus everywhere, big lemons and grapefruits, punkcy. Taste is a little less exciting. A bit bland, smooth oranges and lemons, not as acidic as the aroma hinted.

I do love the way this beer smells.

Excellent head retention. Delicious chocholate and roasted coffee flavor. Nice malt character to the body. Previous tastings of this were not as impressive. Currently the best of the Court Ave ales.
Court Avenue James Polk Porter;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Porter;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Dark mahogany color with a dense light tan head. Faint malt aroma. Dry vapid and insipid malt flavors. Only slight coffee and chocolate. Very boring ale.
Court Avenue OLearys Irish Red;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Court Avenue Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub during the 2006 Crescent Moon Beer Bus Trip. Mahoganey amber color with an off-white head that produces good money. Hoppy with a great palate. Very earthy flavor- downright Hobbit-like.
Court Avenue OLearys Irish Red;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Very dark red with a cream-air head. Roasty caramel with a tight bitter finish. Quite good!
Court Avenue OLearys Irish Red;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Court Avenue Brewing Company;A wonderful color, amber red hits it right on the nose. More hops than I expected (not necessarily a bad thing) but still weak.
Court Avenue OLearys Irish Red;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Deep copper color with a hint of ruby. A liht small tan head. Light floral hops aroma that turn a bit more malty as it warms. Thin feel. Watery malt and hops flavors. Just plain thin.
Court Avenue Winter Ale (Schwarzbier);Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Draft at the brew pub. Clear reddish-orange color. Thinnest of thin off white head which didn’t leave any lace. Aroma was of very weak brown sugar and nothing else. Tasted of lightly toasted bread. There was also a fruity note, kind of like grape candy and some cherry. Dry with delicate bitterness at the end. Eh, not my bag.
Court Avenue Winter Ale (Schwarzbier);Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Court Avenue Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. The body was hazy dark brown and rust colored beer. This was topped with a thin white head. The aroma had malty caramel with some fresh bread. There was also a little bit of pancake syrup. The taste had some dry wood and cinnamon. There was also some toffee. This was nicely done.
Court Avenue Winter Ale (Schwarzbier);Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Super dark, reddish brown with a beige head. Robust cooked caramel aroma. Sweet finish. Good warmer.
Court Avenue Winter Ale (Schwarzbier);Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Bark brown color with a smaller light tan head. Some lace. Dark and dry malt flavors dominate and carry through and linger. An interesting brew that seems so lure you to have some more.
Waitrose Strong IPA;Bracknell, Berkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waitrose;Picked up from Waitrose, Thame in a 4 pack. I am assuming that this is the same beer it was 5% as I recall and poured light brown, I hate beer in cans but being at a Festival (Toweresey nr Thame) convienience are sometime sone of the overiding factors. Fairly bland, lack of malt and hops, pity I had another four to drink really.
Waitrose Strong IPA;Bracknell, Berkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waitrose;From a bottle.Light brown in colour,poor head,toffee and bread,hard to finish,if only their beer was as good as the food.
Waitrose Strong IPA;Bracknell, Berkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waitrose;Bottled. Copper bronze moderate head and condition. Very pleasant aromas of caramel and hops that reminded me of some American IPAs, malt and hops are well balanced in the mouth but a metallic note develops into the hoppy finish.

Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);250ml bottle pours a bright golden color with a small white head that dissipates almost immediately. Aroma is syrupy sweet with some orange. Taste is sweet with some orange and mild hop bitterness. Medium body and light carbonation. Not a very good beer.
Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);250ml bottle. Horrible. It was only a quarter liter and I was already drunk and could barely finish it. It would be a fight between this and Coors Light for worst beer I’ve ever had.
Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);What is with the French and their obsession with ruining beer by adding things that just don’t belong? They’ve done it with tequila, with congnac, and now with Grand Marnier. Although I’m willing to bet it’s orange flavouring despite the claim that there is 5% Grand Marnier in the beer. Starts off a golden yellow with no head to speak of. Aroma is lemon-lime soda (that’s right, not even orange in the aroma!) mixed with beer-in-the-carpet smell (you know what I mean). Flavour is sickly sweet with an artificial orange taste mixed in with a harsh poor quality pale lager. COME ON! Does anyone honestly think this is GOOD?!
Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);"Clear bottle, best before date: 28/02/04; eye: orangy with yellowish reflections, no head per se, no effervescence, clear; nose: orange, madera, alcohol; mouth: in that order Grand Marnier, sweet Grand Marnier, finale all sugary, medium boyd, thin and syrupy texture, not that carbonated; overall: too sweet FRANÇAIS Bouteille transparente, meilleure avant : 28/02/04; oeil : orangée avec des reflets jaunâtres, pas de mousse pour dire, pas d’effervescence, claire; nez : orange, madère, alcohol; bouche : Grand Marnier, Grand Marnier sucré, finale tout en sucre, corps moyen, texture mince et sirupeuse, pas très carbonatée; en résumé : trop sucrée"
Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);(Bottle 33 cl) A beer with 5% Grand Marnier - well, that’s a first. Beautiful deep amber, not much head. Pronounced orange-flavour from the added liquor and lots and lots of sweetness. But actually quite delicious. The label is printed on the bottle. 191203
Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);Clear and fizzy. Taste much cake. Fine foam and escaping with imperceptible bitter. To understand.
Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);"very pale yellow although slight head with lots of lacing. It is the taste that leaves something to be desired. tastes much like fake citrus flavoring (similar to Labatt’s Lager and Lime). considering its elevated alcohol content, this beer belongs more in a ""cooler"" category of which it would be scoring some high marks. As a beer, however, it is sorely lacking."
Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);Medium yellow in colour. This is quite possibly the worst beer I have ever had. Aromas of model glue, skunk, and Grand Marnier. If it were possible for an orange to fart, the smell of that fart would be the same as the smell of this beer. Ridiculously sweet flavors of orange and alcohol. Thin bodied and disgusting. I don’t mind Grand Marnier in my coffee, but it DOES NOT belong anywhere near a beer! The epitome of a drainpour.
Gayant Madison;Arques, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);Blond color. Sweet aroma, citrus fruits and honey, more Cointreau-like than Grand Marnier… Similar comment for the taste, sweet. Not a good idea!
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;22oz bottle. Aroma is rich malted barley. Sour flavor. Just like a Siletz. Some chocolate, malts. Tart? I like the Spruce Ale much better than this offering, nothing can survive in that one.
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Bottle courtesy of patrick767 at Fort Wayne Winter Gathering. Small tan head with virtually no lacing, opaque, no carbonation observed, and a dark brown hue. Nose was malty, lightly roasty, hoppy, sour/tart and chocolate. Flavor was sweet, chocolate, malty and sour/tart tasting.Smooth, watery mouthfeel and light in body.What’s with the sour/tart nose/flavor? Infected or was this the intent of this beer?Weird and didn’t like it for that reason.Next!!
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;This bottled brew from a Patrick767 at a rating party poured a head of foamy fine to medium sized dark brown colored bubbles that were and left behind a opaque dark brown colored body and a poor lacing. The aroma was hoppy coffee and dark malt. The semi-flat mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of sweet and dark malt. Off the mark old tasting flavor. Not one that I would likely drink again.
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;bottle - I don’t want to take credit for supplying this one. I’d guess it’s a bad bottle, but I see a number of other raters have noted a certain off, sour flavor, so I think they have bottling/quality issues. Anyway, it smells like roast malt and chocolate. However, while the taste has some dark chocolate in it, it also has a bad, sour element that says infection to me. A date on the bottle would have been nice, but I don’t think it was all that old. Too bad. It looks good and even smells pretty good, but it’s downhill from there.
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Mahogany dark beer with a foamy beige head. Dusty chocolate in the nose with an odd tartness. This beer had hints of rancid orange juice. Tart cherries, funky chocolate, odd orange rind. I can’t tell if this is supposed to be funky or not, but as many others have noticed it, I’m guessing it is on purpose.
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Bottle: Courtesy of patrick767 at the local tasting. I’m wondering if there is something just naturally off with this brew or if it’s a bad bottle. Either way here it goes. This looked nice enough...a dark mahogany colored brew with no head. The first thing that hit me was a sour metallic aroma that was overpowering. There was some slight malt and chocolate notes there but they were just getting beat down. This pretty much tasted just like it smelled except for some mild woodsy notes to help it. Overall I’m not impressed and don’t think I’ll ever seek this one out.
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Pours murky brown with a small tannish head. The aroma has some spice, tinniness, roasted chocolate malt and lightly soured cream. Medium / thin body with lightly spritzy carbonation. The flavor starts with sour dark fruits and light chocolate. The finish is lightly spice and roasty, but still sour. Meh....
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;From a 22-oz. bottle--Poured a thick brown-black body with a small tan head. Nose of toffee, coffee, molasses, and sweet malts. Flavor was bitter and piny as well as malty and sweet. Tart and roasty finish. Quite good.
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Bottle. Deep brown, with a thing light brown head. Sweet, malty aroma, with coffee, toffee and molasses as well. Bitter, coffee bitter, with a sweetness that seems to come from molasses.
Siletz Black Diamond Imperial Porter;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Pours dark bown with a thin tan head. Smells of roasted malt but little else. Tastes thin and watery with a ton of bitterness and some sweet qualities, but not nearly enough to balance out the bitterness. No fruit hints to speak of. This does not taste at all like the other Baltic Porters I’ve sampled over the past 6 weeks.

Sterre Aalter Vooruit;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle. It pours a clear, golden body and a dense, off-white head. It’s rather sugary on the nose, with fruit syrup and some piney hops. It’s quite dry on the palate, but tastes quite a bit like white sugar. Medium body, pleasant carbonation. There’s fruityness and bitterness too in the flavor, but it’s still a rather boring one. Yet another generic Belgian style ale that I don’t see a use for. 120622

Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;BCTC 2015. Pours a hazed amber with a medium sized white head. Soft malt, light oxidization, cranberry on the nose. Medium bodied, sweet, oxidization, fruit. Tart and oxidized on the finish, a bit weird.
Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"Poured from a 12oz bottle bottle into a tulip glass. A - Brew pours a dark Amber with a medium-bodied off-white head. A - I smell semi-sweet cranberries and straw. T - The attack of the sip brings a small amount of tartness, but the moment I gulp is when the full puckering effect sets in. This is followed by a taste subtle cranberry sweetness that continues through the finish. Brew has plenty of cranberry flavor, but is not overwhelmingly sweet or tart. Very well-balanced and refreshing. P - Beer is well-carbonated. The opening bite of carbonation and tartness work in harmony, grabbing your attention right at the start of the sip.

O - I picked this beer up on a whim when in visited my home state of WI for Christmas (I’ve been living in Memphis, TN for the last 5 years). I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the brew. The Brewers were faithful to the true flavor of tart WI cranberries. I’ve tasted too many disappointing fruit ales that were packed with sugar. This beer was well-balanced, tart, a tinge sweet, and refreshing.

Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Bottle. Amber with a beige head. Fermented cranberry and hay. Tart enough to keep the artificial sweet at bay with a heavy cereal finish.
Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Aroma is cranberry sauce, yeast and malts. The flavor is cranberries/cranberry sauce, malts, mild sweetness and a tart finish.
Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Honestly this smell is amazing!!! The taste, another story. If you are looking for a strong cranberry taste and no beer, this is what you want. Very sweet/tart finish! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Bottle. Reddish amber pour. Cranberry juice on the aroma and taste. Slightly metallic. Okay.
Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Orange with a slight rosy hue. Smell is cranberry and waxiness, very similiar ot ng fruit beers. The flavor is tart, good cranberry, flaovr, light malt backing, light and refreshing. Not bad.
Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"Proudly claims on the front of the bottle ""made with real Wisconsin cranberry juice."" Pours a reddish brown color with a thin head. Scent is mostly that of cranberries and earthy grains. The cranberry flavor is quite evident in its flavor. It is nicely complimented by the malts and wheat used as well. Taste finishes a little tart and dry. The taste is better than average but I can also see people saying this beer is too fruity for them. I like the taste but I find the texture to be a little to thin where more carbonation is needed. A nice fall season beer from Wisconsin cranberries. Fall doesn’t get much better in Wisconsin!"
Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"Purchased at Breeze Thru Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI; enjoyed during a relatively lazy and unusually moderate Saturday afternoon in mid January. Appearance is a relatively light amber with a bit of a red hue, light white head. Aroma of cranberry juice, with a light bready malt. Taste is like a crisp cranberry cider, slightly sugary, with a crisp finish. I’d consider this more of a cider than a beer, and it’s kind of enjoyable. I don’t mind it."
Wisconsin Cranberry Special Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Combination of tart fruit and malty cracker reminds me of nothing so much as the nostalgic but not quite pleasant taste of communion wine and wafers. I love cranberries, and I love beer, and while this is balanced, it’s kind of boring. I might like it more paired with some heavy holiday food.
Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);What, I've never rated this? One of the first beers I had from Toronto. Black pour really rich and creamy with a bit of roasted sweetness and coffee finish, balance and refreshing enough to drink as a beer not just dessert, good.
Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Dark brown with a thick tan head. Nice and roasted coffee aroma with a slight hint of cream coming up at the end. Good roasted barley notes as well. Subtle coffee at the start that builds up as you drink. Nice and roasted without tasting burnt. A bit thin-bodied but really good flavor.

Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);"From Nov 2007 Another brew I got in a trade with autumnaldave. Thanks Dave! It pours from 341ml bottle a very dark brown with just the slightest reddish hue and a near 2 finger head of tannish foam. It recedes to a fine layer over time and it has some good lacing. The smell is nice..I get coffee , roasted malt, and a touch of chocolate. The taste kind of fooled me; The first thing I noticed on my palate was a dark chocolate flavour followed by coffee(yeah, it starts to take over after the first sip) and roasted malt and there's some sweet malt kicking it up in the backgound. There's a bitterness there that I figure comes from both the coffee and the dark chocolate and it's absolutely delicious. The mouthfeel is medium bordering on heavy and the carbonation is light. Very easy drinking, this son of a gun, and so smooth on the tongue. Man, I could kick back a few of these. To tell you the truth, I'm not a huge fan of coffee)I prefer tea) but the few ""Coffee"" brews I've had have realy impressed me.... Bottom line: Another very nice Porter that I can only recommend. Thanks again, Dave. It was another excellent sample to throw in as an extra!!"
Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Thanks to Luc for this one! Pours a very dark brown with a medium beige head that leaves good to very good lacing. Nose is of coffee for sure but not quite the bright and freshly roasted one you’re used to. Maybe it is the mix with all the roasted malt and sweet milk chocolate (lactose?) that is throwing me off, though. Taste is lightly ashy, a bit acidic and offers more chocolate and that lactose sweetness. Body is light, carbonation moderate and it feels a little bit thin overall. Still a fair coffee porter.
Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Sampled from a 12oz brown bottle this beer poured a black color with a huge foamy dark brown head that lingered and left good lacing. The aroma was vanilla, brewed coffee, toasty malts and moderate bitterness. The flavor was rather bitter with sourish brewed coffee, roasty malts and floral hops. Long finish. Medium body. Ok.
Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);An easy go-to of porters, I often pick this up when having a couple over company. Deeply coffee but still light on the tongue, Mill Street always wins in wafting aroma. Be happy to hold this and sip it back, letting the sweetness settle on one’s tongue.
Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Half a finger of tan head, fades quickly and clings to edge of glass. Dark brown colour. Aroma is strong of cold steeped sweetened coffee, roasty. Very strong coffee flavour, thin and slightly acrid. Strong roast, dark bitter chocolate in the finish. Med carbonation. Nice coffee beer, but the porter character is very subdued,
Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle from the brewpub in Ottawa. Pours hazy very dark brown with creamy, stable light tan head. Clear aroma of roast and malt, with estery notes and touches of coffee. Roasty flavour with notes of coffee and malt and touches of oats and hops. Subtle hints of metal. Estery and slightly coffelike and lactic aftertaste. Decent.
Mill Street Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter - Flavored;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Black with a large beige head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, vanilla, dates. Medium-light bodied, creamy mouthfeel, slightly sweet on the palate with only a hint of coffee roast/bitterness. Taste is chocolate with a hint of coffee with vanilla creamer.
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Single can purchased from mom & pop store in Kindersley, Saskatchewan on 06/02/2012. Colour: Light yellow with low white head lacing. Nose: Sprite, trace barley, yeast is around but not dominant....quite light. Taste: Light sweet, light bitter, light sour. Typical light beer, but without the pungentness and dominant sweetness of some. Barley is quite noticable and welcome.
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);341mL. For some reason, this is quite an improvement over GW Pils and Lager simply because it does have some sort of flavor and that would be quite an unexpected jolt of DMS/cooked sweet corn. Pour is light yellow with almost no carbonation. No head formation. Still, yellow water. A rare 1/5 for appearance. Nose is big DMS. Taste combines DMS with cardboard, and tannic astringency. Oatmeal is somehow present in the body. Really one of the oddest beers I’ve had. Certainly not good, but interesting and not really offensive.
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Cannette 341 ml. 4%. Couleur jaune pâle paille. Assez légère mais goûte le malt et est rafraîchissante. Bonne light.
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);One of the best light beers I’ve drank. It’s got aroma, flavour and feels good. 3.5 for a light beer? Well, yea, when compared to other lights. Dumped out of can on to carpet...carpet soaked up beer very well. Kidding. Standard Canadian lager aroma and colour/ cap. Tasty beer considering - not to sweet, a good ammount of barley, grass and the faintest hint of hops. Fairly smooth with a decent carb attack, light bodied and some dry wheatish finish. This doesn’t seem like a light beer. Western puts out good brew that I’m finding myself drinking more and more.
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Can. Beers of the World Live, NEC. Light gold with a small head. Aromas are grain with floral, soapy notes and some citrus. Flavours are light grain with prickly notes. Soft on the finish. Dull.
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);I’m not usually in the habit of drinking light beers, but this was in the fridge and I’d never tried it before... Pale gold, decent head that vanishes under the attack of lots of carbonation. Not a lot of aroma to speak of. Surprisingly flavourful for a light beer-- pale malt with some soft apple notes. Very watery palate, but it seems that you can’t escape that with light beers. In the end, when compared to its light beer peers, this was very good, but compared to standard pale lagers, it comes across as weak (hardly surprising).
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Pale gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Not a lot of aromatics with this one... perhaps a wiff of malt and chemicals. Although the palate is as watery as you’d expect from a light beer, the flavors (again with the light malt) are not too muted at all. You could do a lot worse.
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Poured with a small foamy head that lasted till finish. Pale golden in color. Lots of carbonation. Smooth taste going down with little after taste. Great for a hot day sitting on the patio
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Pale golden color...foamy head...highly carbonated. This beer is probably GW’s best beer. Its light, smooth flavor was hardly barely noticable and it had no aftertaste. For a light beer I think it fairs well. A good lawn mower beer.
Great Western Light;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);It is a nice beer to go with desserts. Ice cream is best. It is a good beer if you have a bbq or a pit party.
Brook Farm Cider - Medium Dry (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Brook Farm Cider;50 cL bottle. Pours hazy yellow with a small white head. Aroma is crisp apple fruity and slight acidic. Sweet apple fruity and slight sulphorish to medium dry apple fruity into the finish.

Brook Farm Cider - Medium Dry (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Brook Farm Cider;"Had a real hard time figuring how to get this cider listed. I believe it to be made by a relatively small orchard/cidery in one of the remote sections of the West Country. Regardless, this was without question or reservation, one of the best dry, English ciders I've ever tried to this point. Its color was pale and lightly clouded. Its aroma was unique to the fact that it matched its tast of raw apple peels. I can't say that I've ever made that assimilation before, but that was the impression I got. One of, if not the, sweetest of all the English ciders I've tried which was classified as ""Medium Dry"". Subtle aftertaste which reminds of those wonderful peels again! Well worth going out of your way to track down."

Very dark reddish brown colour with a beige head. Roasted malt and coffee aromas. Very full, fruity taste, with coffee flavours along with a very slightly tart baked apple and toffee tastes.

Pours a clear, deep copper color with a small off-white head. The aroma is faint. Notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, chocolate, and booze- but all are stronger in the flavor. Medium-bodied, with a malty, uneven mouthfeel and low carbonation. Didn’t really work for me.

Masthead Storm Brew;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener - Imperial;Masthead Brewery;Rates very well for appearance, with a nice, long lasting head (somewhat surprisingly.) Aroma is mainly alcohol with some toffee and rum. Flavour is also pretty alcoholic, not much malt and finishes quite bitter. Actually tastes a lot like my stock of 99 Coopers Vintage (!) but I don't really like that either.
Masthead Storm Brew;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener - Imperial;Masthead Brewery;AIBA 2003: Not particularly interesting, a bit bland for such a strong brew, sweet and malty, with a slight hit of alcohol at the end, aswell as some rusty metal, no length.
Masthead Storm Brew;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener - Imperial;Masthead Brewery;Very faintly hazy, dark honey amber with a large lasting beige head, Faint biscuity malt and chemical metallic aroma. Medium-strong plain sweet bready malty and medium bitter flavours hold the alcohol at bay until it breaks through at the finish. Unlike the description states it lacks any real complexity and any definitive hop character. It's really just a slightly above average lager with a high ABV and that alone does not justify its existence.
Bottleworks Tripel Krullekop;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;04’ bottle from Duane. Hazy/muddy orangish/dark yellow. Slight vegetal character up front in aroma, backed by tons of cani sugar/candied fruit. Flavor on par, huge candi sugar, very cloying. Sticky mouthfeel.
Bottleworks Tripel Krullekop;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle. Color is a hazy orange with a sparse head. Aromas are grassy and sweetly fruity. I’d agree with others that pears and peaches are good descriptors of the fruit aromas. Flavor is pretty much on par with the aromas... sweet fruits and a bit of a yeasty and grassy undercurrent, all of which give way to a warm alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is fairly thin, which works well for the crisp flavors that it is working with.
Bottleworks Tripel Krullekop;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Pours bright orangish golden with a mostly receding wispy tan head. Aroma of peaches, alcohol, pear, and citrus. Taste of pear, peach, fruity esters, citrus and higher alcohols. Full bodied, lightly sticky with lush carbonation. A good tripel, although it’s lacking some refinement.
Bottleworks Tripel Krullekop;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle from River’s Bend. Poured cloudy yellow with an average fizzy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate yeasty, sour citrus and small alcohol aroma. Medium body with thick particles. Medium sweet & sour citrus flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Solid beer.
Bottleworks Tripel Krullekop;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Thanks for the bottle, Duane. Dark gold and orange body with a light white head. The aroma is perfume and sweat with some peach pie. The taste has some nice peach pie and cinnamon. A highly carbonated body complements the sweet and slightly funky beer. That nice note of peach continues throughout the beer. Nicely made.
Bottleworks Tripel Krullekop;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Thin white head on top of nearly clear golden body. One empty, the bottom of the bottle contained all the yeast, therefore a clear look. Aroma was of honey and sweet cotton candy. I expected the same for the body, but found that to be quite dry and bland. Actually disappointed, because this lacked the flavor that the aroma lead way to. Bottle was from 2002, so maybe it lost some wallop after time. Will try again if I can find.
Bottleworks Tripel Krullekop;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Got this one thanks to dmac621. Pours out a strange very cloudy orangy color. Little oxidized, but other than that the aroma is very sweet. Taste is of some sweet fruits, honey and yeast, also little alcohol on the finish. Not bad, but not great
Bottleworks Tripel Krullekop;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;2002 bottling. Cloudy yellow color with a tight white head.

Ortliebs Uncle Alberts Amber Ale;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;Another great brew now available at Ortleibs Sunnybrook ballroom. This one has a nice amber color, aroma of malt and caramel, and a great finish.
Ortliebs Uncle Alberts Amber Ale;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;Excellent amber-style ale, perfect amber color, thin off-white bubbly head, very balanced aroma with lots of both sweetness & hoppiness in the nose, the flavors were the same way, very balanced, sweet malty profile up front, but then the spicy hops took over toward the finish, rich malty aftertaste with the dry hoppiness as well, all around a great balanced beer that was very drinkable
Ödmans Bitter;Göteborg, Sweden;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;As a fan of Tawny-ales I really recommend this! Appearance and flavor is top-class. Really nice work done from this small brewery.
Ödmans Bitter;Göteborg, Sweden;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Pannrummet Kök & Bar;This is the first time I get the chance of testing a beer that is only 10 days old. In a couple of weeks it will probably get even better. The aroma and palate from the Golding hops was like a meadow in May. The colour a bit dark amber with a little cloudiness ( 10 days after fermentation stopped)I´m really looking forward to the development of this bitter.

Mort Subite Witte/White Lambic;Kobbegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Tiny 250ml bottle from Perla in Lazur, drunk overlooking the Sea Garden in Burgas on a hot, windy August evening. Pours lightly hazy straw with a thick white head that didn't last, heavy lacing and some rising carbonation. On the nose, ripe apricot with hints of herbs and citrus. In the mouth, sourness from the start but mingling with the bitterness by the end, rising sweetness, light flavours similar to the aromas with a sharp finish. A Witbier with a dose of Lambic. Not bad.
Mort Subite Witte/White Lambic;Kobbegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Het zurige dat de gewone Lambic zo lekker maakt, zit ook in de witte. Past net iets minder goed. Not bad though.

Chesters Hard Apple Cider;North Stonington, Connecticut, United States;Apple Cider;Chesters Hard Cider Company;An odd cider. Normal, mild aroma of apple juice. Light gold color. Flavors of sour apple and sugar, as well as a light spice I can’t name. Unfortunately none of these flavors are very good.
Chesters Hard Apple Cider;North Stonington, Connecticut, United States;Apple Cider;Chesters Hard Cider Company;I thought this cider had a little too much of an alcohol taste to it. It was okay and drank easily like ciderguy said, but I'll still stick to the ACE Pear.
Chesters Hard Apple Cider;North Stonington, Connecticut, United States;Apple Cider;Chesters Hard Cider Company;This was a rather obscure find. It had a mostly fabled existance but was eventually tracked down in Central Illinois at a place called Friar Tuck's in Springfield. After tasting it, it probably was more meaningful as that ever sought after enigma which was destined to never be found. Regardless, it was found and unfortunately disappointing. It was basically flat and exceptionally sweet with an aftertaste I wasn't sure would ever go away. It was a slightly clouded pour with a aroma of stale fruit. With the exception of the aftertaste, it drank rather easily. If you have a chance to find it, try it and see if you agree.

Żywiec Niskoalkoholowe;Żywiec, Poland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Zywiec (Grupa Żywiec - Heineken);"The aroma is hoppy, a little malty; not pleasant as such, but not offensive, as is often the case with pilseners.

Portsmouth Porter;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Portsmouth Brewery;2004 draught. Appearance shows a dark brown/near black body with a tinge of violet peeking through near the edges of the glass. Low head retention. Aroma seems quite bitter and black with lots of coffee, though a bit more roasty and full than the Smuttynose. Flavor turns out to be not dominated by black malt and instead is quite roasty and coffee-like. Some good sweet tones throughout and though this is a pretty dry rendition, it dosent get too bitter and astringent. As it warms the body produces an almost velvety sensation on the palate. Ends with good bittering hops, not overdone. Lightly nutty and has hints of mocha. Medium to medium-full body and little to no thinning.

Heidelberger Weihnachtsbier;Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Heidelberger Brauerei;Bottle from my Advent calender. Beautiful clear Amber beer with medium sized white head. The aroma is a mix of several light notes that I find hard to identify, only the malts are intensive. Light body and a dry bitterness. Some caramel, honey, some different malts and a sour component that gives the taste an interesting direction. Drinkable, but I find the beer is lacking some punch.

Donnington SBA;Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Donnington Brewery;Rather disappointed in this beer which I must have first drunk over 40 years ago and if my recollection is correct certainly liked then. Appearance is a little muddy, which is how I recalled it. Flavours were toffee, a certain amount of diacetyl with medium-high levels of bittering hops. Where it fell down for me was in the conditioning which was almost non-existent,. I haven’t been too harsh though as this could have been due to shortcomings at the pub. One I will look out for in future to give another chance.

Pietra Strong;Furiani, Corsica, France;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasserie Pietra;Bottle 330ml BBE 2013 (Saveur) Deep amber-copper color, good creamy white head. Mostly cardboardish-papery aroma. Medium-bodied. Sweetish, some odd milky twist, cardboardish. Sweetness covers alcohol, but late burning notes. Past its prime, don’t know if it was any good younger.
Pietra Strong;Furiani, Corsica, France;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasserie Pietra;Bottle 33cl, a clear amber beer with good head. Nose is on barley sugar and grain.

Pietra Strong;Furiani, Corsica, France;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasserie Pietra;bottle from Saveur-Biere. Clear amber colour with a red glow. Full-bodied, good malty base, quite tobust with a sharp hoppy touch. Interesting and quite nice.
Pietra Strong;Furiani, Corsica, France;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasserie Pietra;Small bottle. Gift from Gitte, brought home from Bergamo, Italy, actually. Low grey-shaded blond head. Brownish red body with good clarity. Clean and dry, toasted malt aroma. Herbal and tobacco-like notes from the chestnut added, both in aroma and flavor. Medium full, fairly sweet malt body. Alcohol is noticable, not disturbing. Slick texture. Medium strong body. Finishes drier than the initial flavor. Not an archetype Vienna, yet a tasty and interesting one.

Pietra Strong;Furiani, Corsica, France;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasserie Pietra;"Oggi in Antica Latteria in Via San Luca, vedo passando che hanno la Pietra Strong; siccome non la trovo spesso in giro, ho deciso di fermarmi (avevo mezz’oretta) e bermi una birretta in santa pace. La Pietra Strong è una birra molto semplice, con carattere poco interessante e un calore alcolico elevato, che mette in ombra anche il sentore di caldarroste della sua controparte normale; esso si manifesta nel pieno delle sue potenzialità soltanto nel retrogusto."
Pietra Strong;Furiani, Corsica, France;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasserie Pietra;Bottled 0,33L. Creamy and compact head, good adhesion and duration. Scorched dark red color, much fizzy and lightly load. Determined alcohol scent, toasted malt, dry wood and ash. Prickly and harmonious taste. Overbearing bitter with decided hoppy notes. Balanced end, a lot smoked and balmy. Amazing. Thanks to CEZ for this beer.

Wild Duck Duckwheat Hefeweizen;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wild Duck Brewery;Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied hefeweizen. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are slightly spicy and mild. Not your typical hefe, it has a lot of hop bite to it and not much of the banana and clove flavor. Nice balance. Smooth flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is slightly bitter.
Wild Duck Duckwheat Hefeweizen;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wild Duck Brewery;Mildly opaque, straw colored and a tiny white head. Light and zesty nose, wheat and some sewwt fruitiness. Light, refreshing and clean. Pretty wel hopped, but hey it is the PNW. Nice, well drawn out finish. Lively carbonation and just a bit of cloying.
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;Opened bottle and there goes the foam! Poured to a Hazey dark orange color leaving behind a smell of a rich coco. Taste almost earthy and a hint of some citrus fruits.
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;Hazy dark amber color with a medium frothy white head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Modeate citrus hoppy aroma and hint of chocolate. Medium body. Medium bitter flavor with a medium biiter finish of moderate duration
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;Bottle opened with a load hiss and poured with a huge head, like the whole glass was head. Pours a lightly hazy amber with golden notes and a huge foamy off white head. Aroma of grapefruit, pine, caramel, cardboard and nuts, some citrus. Flavor of grapefruit, bitter hops, probably the most extreme hop bitterness I have experienced. Also getting some pine and other mixed citrus notes, caramel and some toffee. Very tingly mouthfeel. I think some infection may have set in on this one. But still ended up being a decent IPA.
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at Three Cellars in St Francis, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-hazy golden orange brew with a thick and lumpy off-white head that slowly dissipates and stays thick throughout. Aroma of citrus zest, a touch of oranges, mild caramel malt and a touch of toffee. Taste is medium bodied, well-carbonated with flavors of light caramel and apricot flavored malts, grapefruit and lemon zest with some toffee. Finish is semi-bitter that quickly disappears to a mild APA light bitterness.
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;DLD. Pours a clear orange. Bitter and quite hoppy. Hints of plant sap and resin. Medium to light bodied. Long bitter finish. Medium carbonation. OK
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;Poured a volcanically effervescent amber with a voluptuous frothy white head that would not stop erupting. Had to place the bottle in the sink and pour it over a duration of several minutes. Nice initial aroma of pine and grapefruit rind with a bit of sweetness. Taste follows with dry notes of rind, grass and a bit of bitter earthiness with a touch of toffee sweetness. Slightly spicy. Extremely bubbly body gives it almost a hoppy-tripel feel. While it is likely that the foam phenomenon was more due to the bottle’s age than its intended construction, I must admit it added a bit of liveliness to what could have been otherwise a forgettable beer.
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;"pours dark apricot, no head. sweet grapefruit aroma. the taste has a certain hoppy bitterness, with citrus flavors. finishes bitter. my reaction to this relatively simple IPA is ""nice. what can i say?"""
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;"Had to wait for this one. I guess they ran out, but two weeks later it was on tap. Not a big IPA, maybe a little conservative, especially with the hop choice. I like a little more body, too, and this one seemed a little thin, more like a regular pale ale than an IPA. I don’t know; just so-so for me."
King IPA (USA);Pontiac, Michigan, United States;IPA;King Brewing Company;Nice hoppy scent, but not enough in the actual beer. Still, you could probably grab a six pack of this for a good night.

Sakara Classic;Giza, Egypt;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Al Ahram (Heineken);I was told that this beer has replaced Sakara Premium. I never expected to find such a good beer in Egypt. Dark golden colour with a very fine head. Nice hoppy aroma with herbal notes. The flavour is bitter and hoppy with intersting spicy and herbal notes. It is also very refreshing. If you go to Egypt: Drink Sakara Classic!
Dodging Duck Starducks Espresso Stout;Boerne, Texas, United States;Stout;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;Sampler at the brewpub in Boerne, Texas. ~ 4 oz pour. Pour is cloudy muddy black brown with really no head. What exists is light tan. Aroma is soft coffee, roasted malt and pine hops. Fresh nose. Taste is gentle fresh coffee roastiness, blended nicely with the roasted malt and bright spruce and pine hop notes. Really nice integration and balance. Finish is mineral chalky, residual and lasting. Yum. Palate is medium to full bodied, carbonation is light and fine giving the beer a really soft feel. I really liked this beer.
Dodging Duck Starducks Espresso Stout;Boerne, Texas, United States;Stout;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;It’s the only blender on the block that can puree a brick ..

Full Sail Slipknot;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;From Apr 2008 I got this at LiquorMax in Ft Collins, Co. This pours a clear very bright amber gold(2008) with a 2 finger head of foam. Very good head retention and some very nice lacing. The smell is of floral hops with a big dose of grapefruit, some fruit, and some sweet malt hiding in the background. The taste has the grapefruit right up front with some bready notes and some caramel malt sitting on the side and giving some balance and actually ends up dominating the finish. There's also quite a bit of fruitiness to this DIPA that adds both bitterness and sweetness to the overall flavour. Mighty nice this one. Pretty darned easy drinking as well. With this one, the taste is much better than the smell would indicate. It has a medium to medium light mouthfeel and the carbonation is fairly lightly done. Another very nice, very tasty, very drinkable brew from Full Sail. Imagine that! Cost: US$3.41 What a bargain!!
Full Sail Slipknot;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle 12 ounce bottle poured to wine glass Amber, appears clear, big white foam that slowly disappears Smell: hoppy but not as hoppy as other northwest IPA Taste: bitter Feel: good carbonation, good follow through, dry finish, bitter aftertaste Overall: very good beer with nice aroma, balance taste drank: Wednesday, May 03, 2017 6:03 PM

Full Sail Slipknot;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Slightly hazy copper wth a lasting off white rocky cap. Big balanced aroma between sticky piney and floral and orange rind hops with a big pale malt and slight caramel maltiness. Big stern but balanced flavor that leans floral and citrusy but is malty and full and biscuity enough to back it up. A little standard but damn tasty, full and balanced.

Full Sail Slipknot;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear orange copper with creamy off white head leaving sticky lacing. The aroma is dank and tropical fruit. Medium mouth, juicy hop, dank, lingering resin finish, very good.
Full Sail Slipknot;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours clear coppery amber with a thick and rather persistent pale buff head. Aroma delivers a strong note of resiny and slightly woody hops, as well as orange and grapefruit notes. Bold flavor ramps up these tones and adds more wood, as well as notes of malt and pear. Finish has just a hint of spice, while body is firm and smooth yet fizzy and lively. Slip one down your throat - you will knot regret it.
Full Sail Slipknot;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Gold. White head. Drinks like a mild beer with medium light body and full bitterness. Not really an imperial.
Wild Duck D-Fault Alt;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Wild Duck Brewery;Golden copper body with a thin white head. Complex nose, initially alcoholic, but unfolds a vast array of hop notes, primarily citrucy, spicy and fruity followed by a flaked barley hint and some caramel malts. Tasted equally complex. Dry finish. Lacks a bit in body, cleans up too quickly. It makes me want another sip right away. Exceptional complexity and decent balance.

Cooperstown Poison Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap in a plastic cup. No points docked for that. The color was that of an Arizona sunset with the discoloration of the polution creating an almost orangish/pink hue. At least thats how it looked to me in the cup. There was a shallow puddle sized creamy froth. Reminiscent of an AZ rain. Medium nectar with nice mellow effers. Aroma was light with fruity flowers. Flavors are real easy going, bright and fruity with a nice bittering on the finish. A perfect sessionable Pale Ale for the hot days of AZ. I had a few cups of this. I highly recommend it.

Trafalgar Prince Of Wales Cream Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Tall nice bottles that block light. Not widely available Average for the brewery and this style, which is a big notch up from national brands. Satisfying pour and taste.
Trafalgar Prince Of Wales Cream Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;May 2001 - another decent offering from Trafalgar... Big smooth head on it. Goes down easy. Could use a touch more hops for my tastebuds but its an enjoyable beer.
Trafalgar Prince Of Wales Cream Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"For a cream ale, this beer wasn't too bad. Perhaps the ambiance of the Price of Wales Hotel helped. As for the details: clear amber w/ a finger of off-white foam; mildly malty nose w/ a light spiciness; light body; Mild malt flavour but balanced (for the style) toward its earthy, hoppy finish."
Trafalgar Prince Of Wales Cream Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Golden-orange colour, slightly hazy, with a respectable but short lived white head. Aroma is mild, malty and slightly fruity. Body is on the light side, and not as creamy as the style should be. Flavour isn't bad, but seems to lack direction - it's kinda malty, kinda fruity, kinda bitter, but none of the flavours really come together. And the finish is somewhat sour.
Trafalgar Prince Of Wales Cream Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Aroma of melted plastic. A bit cloudy yellow with almost no head. Sour, slightly malty ale.
Trafalgar Prince Of Wales Cream Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Aroma was hoppy and sweet malt. It was golden in colour with a thick head that lasted for a bit and was a pillowy light straw colour. There was sediment in the last part of the bottle, I supect that wasn't supposed to be there. There was more sweet malt in the flavour then anything else. Little bitter and little hops. I didn't find this beer mild or pale as the style suggests. I found it more rich and dark. I'm getting the impression that this beer style varies quite a bit. Someone else who rates this let me know.
Lancaster Winter Warmer;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;"I can't overstate how impressed with this beer I am. For the most part, I try to stock up on Great Divide Hibernation and Great Lakes Christmas around the holidays. Unfortunately, it's been hard to find ""enough"" of either near Philadelphia. Based on the can and the description, I decided to give this a try. I have to say that it's right up there, and very similar to, Hibernation. It's very malty with just enough hops to make it interesting, beautiful caramel color. The head is a beautiful tan with dark ruby body. Taste is caramel, vanilla with notes of chocolate chip cookie. I won't pass this up next year."
Lancaster Winter Warmer;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;DATE: January 3, 2018... OCCASION: Thursday on a short week--can't beat that... GLASSWARE: Mad Elf snifter... pours a dark purplish body rife with barnacles of bubbles... its head is a brief surf of off-white rush that settles to a nondescript pencil-thin rim... deep plum and berry are released early, with hints of boozy bourbon wood and thick roasted malts... syrupy thick, moderately lively, intensely warming, and mildly alcoholic... it's agreeable enough to mask its weight... a woody pulp pervades, with cherry, vanilla, rum, and medicinal varnish... caramel comes late... this is bold, biting with its heft and malt... Lancaster runs out a reasonable example of this style, though its flavor profile is not as diverse as some better offerings...
Lancaster Winter Warmer;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Caramel, coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts are in the nose and taste. Very smooth at 9% and certainly a sippin beer. Love the wolf label design, too. Cheers!
Lancaster Winter Warmer;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Pours brown, amber with a tan head and an aroma of caramel and malt. Tastes of sweet caramel, wood and malt upfront with a moderately bitter body and finish of hops. The alcohol is fairly well hidden within the sweet malt and hops with a hint in the finish. It’s medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Based on the appearance and aroma, I was expecting a scotch ale-like taste but it is much different. I’m a big fan of a caramel, malt backbone and this balances well with the hops and further adds to the complexity with some wood and does deliver as a big beer. The wood and resinous hops make this an earthy beer. This is well done!
Lancaster Winter Warmer;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Bottle. Pours clear reddish brown with large spongy beige head, spicy caramel malt aroma, adequate carbonation, bitter caramel malt taste with cinnamon and cloves, thin body, long spicy bitter finish.

Poured from bottle. Dark red brown with small head. Smell is big spicy caramel malt. Dark and somewhat fruity. Taste follows with huge caramel malt flavor. Lots of warm spice rounds it out. Slightly sweet with some bitterness. Reminds me of fezziwig but a lot bigger. Medium palate with lots of spice on the finish. Big, warm and a bit boozy. Overall I love it! Perfect beer for a cold winter day watching movies with a cat in your lap. Reminds me of Old Fezziwig on steroids. Also, it’s incredible with fresh oatmeal chocolate chip cookies!! Wonderful and I’ll have it again next winter!
Lancaster Winter Warmer;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Smells of spice and wood with a murky Amber coloring. Initial taste is wheat with aftertaste of spices (nutmeg cinnamon). Nice winter treat!

Dodging Duck Artful Dodger Barley Wine;Boerne, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;Ray was kind enough to seve me some of this stuff out of a growler before I left. Hops, grapes, and yeast in the nose. Flavor was very full and rich....came together very nicely and masked the 9.5% exquisitely. More balanced than the barleywine brewed 30 minutes up HWY 281 from Dodging Duck.

Nose is malt sweet, buttery, citrus crisp and clean with the start a pleasantly malt sweet, top is fair to middling in its feel. Finish is crisply acidic, hops are persistent in their spicy bite, tart and droughty aftertaste, to be a 100% honest this is the first beer I’ve sampled from them that I liked, the rest were not even worth my time to review.

Beer Works Double Vision Belgian Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Beer Works;Served in a tulip glass, with class (does this also save them on ounces doled out?). Rosy bodied and flowery tasteing, like I stuffed my mouth full of a field of wildflowers. Not exactly what I was expecting. Some grape flavor to the brew as well. I liked it, but probably would have liked the flavor influences combination re-jigged a little differently. Crafted well enough that the high ABV doesn’t hit your brain too hard, however.

Unoffensive. It is what it is, and what it is isn’t for me. I’m sure plenty of people probably want beers like this, but I don’t really know why a micro-brewer would choose to appease those people.

Oak Creek Micro Light;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oak Creek Brewing Company;December 2011. sampled at the brewpub. Pale yellow color with a white head. Malt, hay and hops. Too light to be really enjoyable.
Oak Creek Micro Light;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Pale yellow pour, white head. Had this at OC. Flavors of watery malts, light faded hops, but it lacked any offensive or awful flavors that are often found in light beers....for the style it was pretty ok.
Oak Creek Micro Light;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Not really any odor or color to this but it has a decent inital flavor. This really tastes more like a pils than a pale lager to me. Crisp and refreshing. Light but sessionable on a hot day.
Oak Creek Micro Light;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oak Creek Brewing Company;"On tap at Brewery & Grill in Sedona. Very light color with a small but durable white head. Aroma of a very light pilsner; i.e., less corn and more hops than a typical macro light. The flavor starts with a promising faint hop note that quickly fades. Clean and refreshing but, as is to be expected, not much here in the way of flavor or aroma. Still, way above average for style."
Oak Creek Micro Light;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oak Creek Brewing Company;U know the place your at is a touch touristy when they have a micro light on the beer flight. Anyways pours yellow with white head. Tastes grassy, lemon, grains, light hop bitterness.
Oak Creek Oatmeal Stout;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oak Creek Brewing Company;"Sampled 1702, Tucson; November 2011 Arrives from the tap with a lightly browned head that sits on top of a deeply, dark brown, almost black colored beer. When held up to the light it is mostly opaque but does show some brown hues around the edges. The aroma smells of smooth roast, buttery diacetyl, perhaps a touch of dark chocolate, a toothsome toasted grain character, some brown bread whole-grain notes, and some cold pressed roasted coffee like notes. The diacetyl seems to dissipate a bit after some time, though it never disappears from the nose entirely. The beer has a soft sweetness to it that lingers through the long finish; this is boosted by a hint of noticeable diacetyl derived buttery character. The roast flavors are quite smooth and well integrated; it provides a touch of bitter roast malt character, a richly roasted mocha coffee note, lots of dark chocolate and a well integrated, dark malt sweetness / maltiness that provides a chewy quality to this fairly light bodied beer. This is actually light and quaffable, but still has a creaminess and texture to it (perhaps provided by the oatmeal) that provides enough viscosity to keep this from seeming watery. Despite the noticeable diacetyl, this beer is actually fairly good; it would have been better without it, but there is not so much that it severly detracts from the overall character of this beer."
Oak Creek Oatmeal Stout;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Perhaps the best brew made by OC, at least of those that I’ve tried. The oatmeal stout pours a fairly straight black color with a tan head that sustains itself quite nicely and provides a solid coating of lace around the glass. The aroma was of coffee and roasted malts. The flavor did not finish lactic or dry, but with a light bitterness from the roasted malts. This beer doesn’t run away with excess sweetness, thankfully!
Oak Creek Oatmeal Stout;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Muddy brown (not a deep, rich brown, but the brown of a swollen river). Some roastiness in the aroma, and some yeast bitterness in the aroma, as well. Not a bad oatmeal stout. Some richness in the middle, some sourness in the end, malts throughout (albeit mild). Prett decent.
Oak Creek Oatmeal Stout;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Hazy mahogany with minimal head. Aroma is sweet caramel malty, with faint roastiness. Taste has a nice roastiness, good coffee tones, mild bitter burn in the swallow. Decent beer.

Krombacher Pils Alkoholfrei;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;I'm not much of a pilsener drinker, but (fwiw) this is my favourite n/a brew in that category. Additionally, it's inexpensive. I don't really miss alcohol in the flavour, don't detect much wateriness or excess sweetness, either - so this is what I normally drink when I want a pilsener. It captures the style as well as numerous 'standard' brews, and I certainly don't know of any other n/a pilseners that come close to it. Bearing in mind that pilsener is such a difficult style to excel in anyway and that a 0.5% ABV target increases the problems immensely (much more so than for fruitier styles), this one gets high marks from me.

Krombacher Pils Alkoholfrei;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;Bottle, 330 ml. I'm in the hunt for drinkable, 'real beer-like' non-alcoholic beers. There are two ways of making alcoholfree beers: 1. Interrupted fermentation (that's why most of the non-alcoholics have a half-fermented smell and taste). 2. Boiling method, when the alcohol is boiled out from the fully fermented beer. This one was made with the 1. method, and it's surprisingly good, looks like a beer with a deep golden colour and a decent head. Good carbo, intensive malty and hay aromas with some sweet background. Taste is just OK, a bit sweet and sour, watery palate, but not a disaster. One for drinking, but if u have to drive, or simply don't want to get alcohol, choose sparkling water.

Veltins V+ Lemon;Meschede-Grevenstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei C.& A. Veltins;Sampled from 0.5 l can from local 'LIDL', best before August 2018. Slightly hazy, greenish yellow with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, white head. Sweetish, slightly artificially and quite fruity aroma of lemonade and hints of grapefruit. Rather sweet, a bit sourish, quite fruity and a slightly artificial taste of fresh lemonade and some grapefruit, followed by a short, minimally bitter, slightly tart finish. Medium body, a little astringent and moderately effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Pretty good, refreshing Radler actually, less sweet than many other industrial examples and by far not as artificial.

So - yellowish colour, with almost no foam. Smelling like a citrus lemonade with grapefruit. The same taste and with no traditional aftertaste. I would say if you have no other choice - try this, but I would focus another sorts of beer, but this exemplar is still drinkable.

Tring Fiddler George;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;This beer has a good deal of pine hops on the nose along with, oddly, some alcohol vapours. This is a bitter beer that suffers from a thin mouthfeel. Average.
Tring Fiddler George;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;"Pale amber with a fruity hop aroma. Smooth and easy to drink. As the earlier reviewer remarked, hoppy on the palate without much bitterness, so finishes rather soft and lacks a little ""grip"". No sweetness in my sample though. Distinctive ""Cascade"" hop notes, but I later learned that this beer uses Bramling Cross, a British variety (although, in fact, originally derived from a cross between a Golding variant and a wild Canadian seedling) with a pronounced ""American"" character. Well made and very pleasant, but nothing spectacular. Not quite sure what Tring are aiming at here as they alredy have a 4.2% bitter and a couple of ""summer"" ales in the portfolio. Handpump, The Crosse Keys, City of London, July 2003."
Tring Fiddler George;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Sampled cask conditioned at both Akkurat & Oliver Twist, Stockholm, Sweden. Interesting experiment, drinking the same cask ale within half an hour on two different pubs. It was amber coloured, and at Akkurat it had a pronounced flowery hop aroma, which was less obvious at Oliver Twist where it was sweet, but the soft, whipped cream mouthfeel at Akkurat was not there at Oliver Twist, where it was more watery and fruity. Also the hop aromatic finish was more powerful at Akkurat, but at both places the bitterness was rather low. I believe this was the last beer from a big shipment that both pubs racked, and somehow Akkurat got the better hand this time, however I know both places do their utmost to assure good quality of their cask ales. Rating stated is the one that was served at Akkurat.
Gudrun Rauchbier;Falkenberg, Sweden;Smoked - Rauchbier;Carlsberg Sverige;Bottled. The pun towards a certain Swedish leftist (now ex-)politician gets very obvious once you see the label. Orangey amber colour with fine head. Discrete smokey nose. Clean hard maltiness, rather sweet. A pleasant smokiness creeps up on you and lasts into the salty finish. Between the lines you could tell that the Akkurat staff weren't really that happy with the ingredients they could use at the experiment brewery. Probably the best lager ever to come out of a Carlsberg brewery though...
Bush Shack Wheat Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Enjoyed the trip to Bush shack but this takeaway wasnt as good. It could have been the wrong label. Mine was not a dark wheat. Had no wheat beer character at all. Nutty Caramel, thin, even slightly soapy. Will have to try this again to give it a fair chance. Have a few more of their beers to sample yet. Beer wasnt infected but think in wrong bottle?

Bush Shack Wheat Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);12 Jan 06 - The irst wheat beer I’ve had with a chocolate grain aroma. Cloudy medium brown-orange colour (What colour should a wheat beer be ?), with a good head and lacing. Grainy malt flavour. Thin and hoppy chocolate finish.
Bush Shack Wheat Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Okay, this rating is probably not reflective of the brewer’s intentions, as the product I tasted HAD to be off-- it was undrinkable! Fom the bottle it poured a dirty orange-brown (bad start for a wheat beer). Sour aroma, and VERY sour palate-- had to spit it out and dump the rest. Both bottles that I got from the brewery were like this. A disappointment.
Bush Shack Wheat Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Interesting beer. Dark copper colour with a big wheat beer head. Aroma of roasted malt jumps out of the bottle which is kinda weird. Milo and roast malt phenolics are the main aromas - they definitely aren’t using a German or Belgian wheat beer yeast here. Tastes very dry - malt sweetness is completely absent, but there’s a fair old hit of charcoal in the finish which reminds me a fair bit of Uerige, oddly enough. Not a whole lot of flavour but it couldn’t have been easier to drink - I nearly inhaled the entire glass in one go and I wasn’t all that thirsty. High carbonation but it kinda works. I think that either they’ve changed the recipe significantly or, like mutant suggests, this is a mislabelled bottle. I’m tipping the former, as it seemed like there was a bit of wheat malt flavour in there. Nice.
Bush Shack Wheat Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Bottled. Cloudy pale yellow. Loadsof lactic acid up front. Medium bodied with clean mouthfeel and notes of lemon and heavy citric acid sourness that completely dominates. The lactic/citric acid character is Berliner weisse style, but it’s less crisp and fresh than Berliner Weisses. Sure, it’s an interesting, and fairly refreshing beer but the sourness goes abit overboard and it gets very one-dimensional.
Bush Shack Wheat Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Dark reddish colour with a big, loose beige head. Slightly sweet aroma. Strong dark caramel taste which is a bit yeasty. It is a bit roasty and somewhat bitter. Quite a mess yet quite drinkable, if that makes any sense. On reflection, due to the appearance, maybe this is another beer in the wheat bottle. I don’t know.
Bush Shack Wheat Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Drainpour :( Suprisingly dark golden colour with slight hazy when cold.

RJ Le Cheval Blanc Sainte Paix Fraises;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;Huge strawberry aroma with an underlying bready yeast. Hazy golden body with fizzy white fully-diminishing head. Good malt base with a tart yeast flavour. Fruit could be more assertive but is definitely there. Some sulfur/phenolics also apparent in the finish which seem to build the more you drink. Very high carbonation is perhaps a bit over the top for my taste. Overall, this is my favourite of the Sainte-Paix series. (Note: This beer was marked retired when I sampled it - not sure whether it has been re-issued or whether this is an old bottle but I picked up the bottle yesterday at a local bottle store with a good reputation - Depanneur Rahman).

Panil Barriquée (Sour);Torrechiara (PR), Italy;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Panil Birra Artigianale - Birrificio Torrechiara;March 2018 - Keg at Moor Taproom, Bermondsey. As 'Panil Barriquée'. Pours a dark brown, hazy and opaque, foamy light brown head. Aroma is oaky, prunes, papery cranberry. Body is light with tingly carbonation. Taste is a little better than the aroma - lots of tangy plum and redcurrant, cranberry. Has a papery, somewhat acidic finish. Not bad. (6-4-7-3-14=3.4)

Panil Barriquée (Sour);Torrechiara (PR), Italy;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Panil Birra Artigianale - Birrificio Torrechiara;Moved rating from mistaken European entry. Typical Flemish Red look, with very creamy carbonation with a dense brown-tan cap that looks great. Aromas dance with mineral and sour fruit, it just FEELS sour. Taste all sour fruit with a pretty dominant acidity, very acetic. Indeed some lemons and dry, dry cider, mysterious sour fruits, plus wet stone and slight earthy pungency, Really too light with nothing deep, complex and fruity in the body to counter the sourness, hence not all that great or interesting. Still pretty OK though. This acetic ale would (and still may) make a great Carbonnade Flamande. Rating added 4/22/2011 (updated 4/25/2011)

Light roasted Malts, chocolate, hint of coffee and a cherry-like sourness. Spectacular aroma. Taste.... Not so spectacular, aggressive sourness follows a light sweet entry and fades into a herbal bitterness. The second sip is better. Roasted malts, chocolate and some coffee, light riped fruits.
Panil Brune;Torrechiara (PR), Italy;Dubbel;Panil Birra Artigianale - Birrificio Torrechiara;"Assaggiata il suo alias ""agreste riserva"", prezzo 10 euro, formato 75. Totalmente sbagliata la sua classificazione e etichettatura, leggendo i commenti non sono l’unico. Floreale e fruttata all’olfatto, subito acida e aggressiva in bocca, note di ciliegia, praticamente una lambic. Retrogusto asciutto. Avrebbe il suo senso se una sapesse che birra compra. Pessima figura del produttore."
Panil Brune;Torrechiara (PR), Italy;Dubbel;Panil Birra Artigianale - Birrificio Torrechiara;Bottle. Brown color, beige head. Aroma of caramel, butter, diacetyl and sugar. Flavor is buttery, sweet with a sour base. But infected overall impression.
Panil Brune;Torrechiara (PR), Italy;Dubbel;Panil Birra Artigianale - Birrificio Torrechiara;Brow bodied. Butter, sticky toffee, white chocolate. Bleh. Taste is also pretty bad. Somewhat sweet and dry ending. Either a brewing error or just not nice. (Bottle at Colin’s De Molen tasting)
Taller Pils;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);My first Ukraine rating. Funky, skunky monkey smell. Pale goleden/yellow with a Ukraine sized snowdrift of a head on it. Watery and vaguely cereal laced. Nice steady gas release, but not much flavor or body. Yet I could see it being a good warm weather quencher lawnmower beer.
Taller Pils;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);Bottled, now brewed by Chernigivskiy Pivokombinat (4.7%). Bright golden. Neutral aroma. Sweet with notes of cereals and peas. Clean, hard mouthfeel. Useless.
Taller Pils;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);"Good label, nice big bottle, gold. Brown bottle, not green like the pic here. Tart and grainy lager aroma. I agree that you should drink this cold. Tart malty flavor with some astringency. Has some character, but not the best beer in the world. Zippy carbonation with some ale-like qualities in the finish. This is a marketing dream-name: Bartender: ""What'll it be?"" Patron: ""I'll have a Taller Beer, please."" Announcer: ""They always go for the taller beer."""
Taller Pils;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);Bottled(500ml). -quite good golden coloured beer with nice head, fruity aroma with hints of hop, bitter finish

Taller Pils;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);Golden color. Unbelievably rich head. Hens food aroma with some maltiness. No bitterness. Standard Ukraine Pils...
Taller Pils;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);A non-dry, yet crisp pilsener that's a touch rough. It's flavor smacks of the Eastern European/Soviet taste that's rather malty for a lager. Moderate fizz. Lacks the delicious yeastiness of some of the Baltic States lagers.
Taller Pils;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);Had it on tap during Spring celebrations in Kyiv. Very fresh but not remarkable.
Taller Pils;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);very crisp, clean tasting. not as harsh as some of the other pils i have had out there. another good one from yantar brewery.
Blue Star Pale Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Rated based on notes taken 29 Apr 2012 -- On tap at the brewpub, this is a very nice solid Pale ale.

Blue Star Pale Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub in San Antonio where it was listed as Cinco Peso Pale at 5% ABV. Appearance: Pours amber with a semi-durable head that leaves good lacing. Feel: Near medium body and medium carbonation. Flavor: Appropriately hoppy. Some malt flavor with a dominate input from hops. Moderately bold for style. . O: good but not great.
Blue Star Pale Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Star Brewing Co.;This pale ale is very aromatic displaying toffee, vanilla, and flowers. The body and bitterness are in perfect balance. It comes through with a long finish which is definitely Cascade. A solid brew, enjoyable.
Blue Star Pale Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Location: Draft at the Brewpub, 1/23/14 Aroma: The aroma is light hops, a little citrus, with floral and caramel notes Appearance: This beer pours a copper-orange color with a small head Flavor: The taste is much the same with some light sweetness and light bitterness Palate: The body is on the lighter side, with a clean finish on the mouth Overall Impression: There isn’t too much to say here. It is a fine APA, but nothing special. It is both on the simple side and on the light side.
Blue Star Pale Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewery. Pours a light golden with some light amber highlights, clear, average head with average retention. A one dimensional aroma from Cascade hops, typical grapefruit and orange-peel like aromas with a little light caramel malt in the background. Flavor like the hop aroma is also a bit one-dimensional, very light candy-like sweetness, some cracker-like malt notes, and a medium amount of bittering. Another example of a very simple pale ale recipe which has been executed fairly well. This beer has a clean finish however it either needs more finishing hops to carry it or it might have been an old beer. Weak overall.
Blue Star Pale Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Star Brewing Co.;(Draught) Pours a hazy golden body with a medium white head. Aroma of citrus, florals, and caramel. Flavor of florals, biscuit, orange juice, and grass.
Blue Star Pale Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Copper with whisps of off-white head. Mildly hoppy and balanced malt body, the hops definitely feature tho. Aroma is mildy hoppy.
Blue Star Pale Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. The beer pours an orange-white color with a white head. The aroma is very well balanced. I get some caramel and toffee malt as well as some pine from the hops. The flavor is more of the same. The beer is very well balanced and the malt keeps the beer from being bitter, while still allowing some hop flavor to come through. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub in San Antonio. Appearance: Pours golden with a semi-durable head that leaves good lacing. Feel: Light body and near medium carbonation. A bit watery, Flavor: Good balance. Light-roasted grain flavor with a complementary touch of hops. Too mild. O: Certainly not a bad version, but this is a style I seldom like much. Still, better than their similar Texican.
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;The beer pours blonde with a good head. The aroma is a little thin, but displays both hops and malt. The taste is grainy though not as dry as a continental pils. The finish is spicy, but could be spicier, and pleasantly long. One of the better domestic pilsners I have drank.
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Draft sampler with a white head. Aroma of malts, yeast and grain. This one tasted funky to me, my least favorite of the brewery.
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of biscuit malt, as well as some yeast and lemon notes. The flavor is a little bit different. I get the same biscuit and lemon notes, but I also get some grain and banana notes. The banana is actually quite strong and was unexpected and doesn’t really go with the other notes. Creamy, medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This tastes more like a hefeweizen blended with a pilsner.
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Golden-clear in color with slight white head. Clean tasting with a strong body...a smooth pils.
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. Pours pale yellow with a medium white head. Good head retention. Nice American style pils. Not very European at all. Crisp and clean finish. Good pilsner.
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On draft at the brewpub in San Antonio. Pours a cloudy dark golden Ripe banana yellow with light golden yellow hues when held to a light source and a one finger frothy white head with decent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Slightly hoppy aroma with subtle bready yeast, pilsner malt, crisp light fruit notes, grass and straw. I’m picking up some apple and pear which along with the bready yeast notes provide an interesting balance in the nose. Surprisngly full bodied for the style but still extremely refreshing and quaffable. Very similar to the aroma with a nice touch of bready yeast adding complexity to the crisp light fruit notes and pilsner malt. Hints of apple and pear along with hints ob earthy grass and straw. I’m not the bggest fan of this style but I really enjoyed this beer.
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;"Had as ""Summer Pils"" : pours a mid cloudy yellow .. . medium head . .lacing is prime time mr klein .. . a touch of the sweet side, a little soapy in the back .. but a good summer refresher .. why is there so much sand at the beach? i prefer brick .."
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;"Very pale urine colored. Head left seom decent lace. Nice Saazy nose. Very thin. Dryness shows up very late. Except for the ""water"" element, it really isn’t that bad. Not."
Blue Star European Pilsner;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blue Star Brewing Co.;"Not what I expected. Good yellow-orange view with superb head. But a ""model paint"" scent and unusually acidic flavors detracted from this otherwise smooth, mouthy beer."
Blue Star Spring Bock;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Awesome amber beer with outstanding caramel malt character. A hint of cloves? Very good beer. Ask for this one first!

Very dry (for a Helles), fine and slightly hidden restsweetness. Again banana, but hardly sweet. There’s a lot of iron in the water, but I didn’t trace it in the head.

BIt bready, breadcrust, again banana in the aroma. Sweet, quite sweet-bready, coloured malts and melanoidins, ripe banana, some filandrous exotic fruit (taste, not feel), sweet roots.

Zils-Bräu Dunkel;Naurath, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauhaus Zils;This one is preety good as well from this out of the way pub. Nice looking beer that is for sure. Taste is a bit off for me but it is good.
Zils-Bräu Dunkel;Naurath, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauhaus Zils;On tap at the brewpub. This beer like the Helles has a very mixed bag of ratings. Again I think the brewmaster is playing around with the process. This beer poured a cherry brown clear color, with a nice soft tan head. A fine looking beer. Aroma is roasted malt and dark fruit. Taste is more roasted malt, and sweet fruit. Palate is dry with some sweetness. I think that this was their best beer.

Drinkable but thoroughly average.

Dominion Irish Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Dry;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);At the Brewery - a creamy, smooth drink, light enough to drink without feeling stuffed at the end of a pint or two. Not going to change your life, but a yummy brew, none the less!
Dominion Irish Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Dry;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);(02.03.06) On tap at Old Dominion brewpub, Ashburn, VA. Black hued with creamy off-white head. No discernable carbonation. No aroma. Medium bodied stout that starts with light sweet malt and roasted malt flavor. Finishes dry with light lingering roasted malt bitterness.

Dominion Irish Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Dry;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Dark brown with a small, thick brown head (nitro). This one smells of mild roasted malt, mild coffee, smoke, chocolate, with an aroma that is mild overall. Upon first taste, I’m quite surprised at how thin and watery it is. Taste is mildly bitter with hints of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, slight hints of smoke, perhaps even a bit of wood. Overall it’s dry and mild.
Dominion Irish Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Dry;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Dense black colour, with a moderate, creamy head. Very dry, with roast and smoky malt and hints of chocolate. Quite tasty. Smooth palate, but there’s not much body to it and the overall feel is a bit weedy. I’d rather got used to stouts being a bit bigger than this in the US. On tap at the Dominion brewery.
Dominion Irish Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Dry;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Had this on draft at Dominion on 11/21/04. Black body with a small dense tan head. Is this on nitro? Nose is roasted malt, light coffee and a pleasant underlying sweetness. Taste is roasty, sweet, light coffee, and some bittersweet chocolate. Body is smooth and creamy with a light oily feel. Hint of bitterness. Finishes with more roasted malt coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Nice beer!
Dominion Irish Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Dry;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Poured a chestnut brown color with a tight, creamy, khaki head and left light lacing on the glass.

Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;From the file last updated in 2010. Pours dark brown. Aroma is dark malt and chocolate. Flavor is dark malt and chocolate. Not bitter.
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;This beer comes compliments of beerguy101 without whom I’d probably have at least 100 fewer ratings. This beer pours a brownish red color with a somewhat impressive head, tan in color at least for a sweet stout. Good lacing as well which was surprising. The aroma is mildly malty...definitely sweet with chocolate, coffee and vanilla with a hint of oak and twigs. The flavor is medium to somewhat full bodied, nice flavor development, long lasting somewhat wet finish. Heavy chocolate grains, coffee and cocoa. A dash of cherry and licorice mixed with oak chips caps off this sweet stout.... wonderful balance, light and milky texture as it warmed....a shame this company went out of business...true its only one beer I’ve tried, but it would have been nice to have tried more.
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;"It was the zesty BeanDip that gave me this beer! I think she got it from her beer of the month club, which in turn got it from a distributor, which obtained it from the brewery in Richmond, VA; and that’s how I acquired this beer!!! THAT’S CRAAAZY!! I poured maybe 3oz of beer liquid into the glass and I got a caramel colored head the filled the remaining 6” of the glass? The body is a dark crimson brown, waiting for the head to settle……… Aroma is full of cream; sugar + milk = cream, notes of chocolate and sweated coffee, again waiting for the head to settle…………. Watery palate, kind of chalky, the flavor is ummm, bittering & dry coffee and more coffee, nothing exciting going on here, however I would really like to visit the Main St. Brewpub! Thanks for the experience BeanDip!!!"
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;bottled-Huge head (took up almost half my glass). Smells and tastes exactly like it's title: sweet and stout. Also has a slightly burnt, chocolatey taste. Nice dark color typical of most stouts. It's not bad, but I've had many better stouts. I might pass on another bottle - unless of course there wasn't anything else available!
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;"Bottled - Sparse head with some bottles; little to none with others - what gives? Head is either nonexistent or a thin ringlet. Excruciatingly thin body for stout; wispy mouthfeel does not fit for the brew style. Over carbonated. Dark brown with reddish nuance. Nice burnt roasted flavor. Aroma is best aspect: coffee-like toastiness. Slightly below average due mainly to physical properties, but I guess I would drink again considering it's local. Slight extra credit for being within walking (stumbling) distance from my place."
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;No real nose. Sweet rice milk taste. Decent to drink, but artificial. Watery feel for the mouth. Uninteresting.
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;It's a pleasant enough beer to drink, but certainly nothing special and not worthy of a beer of the month club that costs $44.95. Very light in color and body for a stout.
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;Pours a nice color with a rich aroma of roasted malts. Unfortunately the beer hits it's climax before you taste the first sip. Very watery palate with a very dry roasted malt flavor profile. Nothing sweet about this stout as it has no discerning characteristic other than roasted malt.
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;A deep garnet on the pour, the head miniscule, the color “Who Cares”, the lace “MIA”. Nose, sweet, lightly toasted grain, not much else. Start sweet, top “Cadaverous”, finish bland, dry aftertaste, Watery, a bit of hops, I guess this passes for beer, but just barely!
Main Street Beer Sweet Stout;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Beer Co.;Pours very dark brown with an inch thick tan head. roasted malt nose isn't big by any means, also there is a slight green pepper aroma. This is terribly thin and watery. Yesterdays cold cup of coffee!! Slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Poor quality stuff. No alcohol in it either... Maybe this IS last nights coffee!

Wild Duck Russian Imperial Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Wild Duck Brewery;Completely opaque, black as night. Thin light brown head. ALCOHOL and some serious roastedness, but hop presence is discernable as well. Some grainy notes, lots of dark cocoa, bitter and ALCOHOL. A smokey whiskeyish character stands out in the mouth. Great roastey finish, surprisingly sweet as well. floral tones fade in and out of the roastey alcoholic brew. Its got some power, but I was left waiting for the massive warming effect I thought an imperial stout aught to bring.
Wild Duck Russian Imperial Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Wild Duck Brewery;Only had a few ounces of this, but it was memorable. Super heavy on the tongue and very rewarding. Had a nice & aromatic, licorice ambience to it. Brutally intense and very attention-getting. Nice and deep alcohol nip in the finish.
Koedo Beer No.1;Kawagoe-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kyodo Shoji Koedo Brewery;With the swanky label and odd shaped bottle I thought I'd be in for a rare treat. A good Japanese craft beer. What I got was an average pilsner. As 90% of all Japanese beer, a clear golden color with a slight white head. Some mild hops in the nose with a brief sweetness quickly followed by bitterness. Crisp finish and easy drinking. Better than the typical Macros but I was expecting more. Great bottle but the beer wasn't worth the time or effort to find.
Bush Shack Yallingup Old;Yallingup, Australia;Old Ale;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Tasting from early 2008. On draught it produced a muddy, deep, matte brown with a few stray bubbles rising here and there. Holds a short, creamy pad of white for the length but manages little lace. Meaty, pumpernickel, and warm rye bread nose with a little Bovril and grain husks thrown in. Quite light in the mouth given the pronounced aroma. Carbonation is soft, quite smooth in the swallow. Chocolate malts dominate, some mild yeasty notes late, a good lot of whole-grain bread and Bovril. Malty, dry length has just a little smoky roughage. Better as it warmed, just a light sugary sweetness comes in to balance the dry. Not bad at all. Would have liked to compare the draught to a bottled sample. (On draught at the brewery, Yallingup)
Bush Shack Yallingup Old;Yallingup, Australia;Old Ale;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Dirty amber-brown, cream coloured head. Fizzy and thin, but roasted malt is present in the form of toast and toffee. I liked their other dark selections better.
Bush Shack Yallingup Old;Yallingup, Australia;Old Ale;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Murky light chocolate colour with a light tan head. Aroma of malt and caramel.

Kingston White Tail Cream Ale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Kingston Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. Is this a lager or a cream ale? For my first Kingston Brewing Co. beer, I think I should’ve thought about it a little more...
Kingston White Tail Cream Ale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Kingston Brewing Co.;On tap- Tapped a golden liquid with a one finger short lived head. Pale malts and grains fill the nose, and lead into grass and a similar apple aroma that I found in the cask offering. Taste is of sweet grains and pale malts with only the slightest hop coming through, giving way to some biscuit. Finishes a bit thin and seems to be more of a pale lager than the cream ales I have sampled in the past (eg. McAuslan Cream Ale). I’ve heard they are going to start selling this one through the LCBO somehow, and I have to wonder why.
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;2004 bottle shared by greg, the bottle was actually stained on the inside of this thing, pours a light clear brown with no head at all, the aroma has some dark fruit with a little bit of spice, kind of like a dark red wine or something, the flavor is flat and uncarbonated with some cardboard mixed in with the fruit, the abv comes through as well, well past it’s prime but still cool to open up!
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;2004 bottle cracked open in 2013. Way oxidiized, sherry port aroma. Somewhat watery, seems like the body has fallen out from under it. Raisin, prune, brown sugar. Past its prime, very deteriorated, but still drinkable.
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Bottle from nuplastikk...thanks Greg! - Pours clear amber with a ring of white head. Wow is this oxidized. Smells like sherry and port, with some caramel notes. Taste is the same--pretty sickly sweet with some caramel and sherry and a long sweet malty finish. Slick and fairly thick with very little carbonation.
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;dark golden body with a creamy tan head. considerable lacing. smells sweet, bread, caramel and some citrus hops. tastes earthy. doughy. of caramel and butterscotch and slight bitter and citrus hops. definetely pear in their. dries your mouth out. more hoppy than I would expect. does this make sense for this style?
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Orange, grapefruit, and black pepper in a light, yeasty aroma that never comes together. Hazy, orange-copper coloured body is topped by a low off white head that recedes to a light cover with plenty of lacing. Strong grapefruit character and some mild butterscotch in the fairly simple and sweet flavour. Moderate soft bubbled carbonation to the lightly astringent medium body. Bottle (trade, Aug-05) sampled with MartinT, Olivier_MTL, Rastacouere and Siroy. Thanks, Kinz!
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Nicely lasting off-white head covers the hazy caramel pour. Slightly buttered (Ringwood?) nose is lightly yeasty, rather bready and mostly floral. The aromatics are generally low, leaving a globally sweet feel. Maltiness appears mostly faint in mouth, the grapefruity/orangey hops thus appearing pretty sharp. Growing astringency gets chalky after a few sips. Light-medium bodied, fine soft carbonation. I had never heard of the brewery and can’t say this one convinced me to particularly seek the rest of their lineup.
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;"Any first impressions? -A veil of head covers the faded cardinal red. -Cranberry juiciness and subdued maple sweetness make for a timid lure. -Delicate fruitiness evokes mangoes, cranberries, and pomegranate, but all overall there isn’t enough malt sweetness or hop flavor to hook me. -Carbonation is active for a barley wine, attempting to hide the lack of maltiness. What if you dig deeper? -Barely any hops in the aroma, which is surprising. -Black pepper lurks behind the shy fruitiness. -Some resinous hop bitterness follows diluted grapefruit. -Lack of personality and of plain old tastiness will make this one disappear from memory real fast. Bottle; 2004 vintage."
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Wiilliamsburg Brewing has gone out of business, but some examples of this beer might still remain in select markets. 2002 Vintage. Grand Illumination Ale pours to a beautiful, deep, murky, caramel color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. The nose on the beer is complex and aromatic, with big aromas of sweet, caramel malt, toffee, pipe tobacco, some flowery hop aroma, and peppery waves of alcohol. The palate is lush and full on the tongue, with huge complex malty and fruity flavors. Sweet malt, caramel, toffee, butter scotch, and subtle hints of jammy fruit, coat the tongue, and slowly slide down the throat. Grand Illumination finishes with more of those complex malty and fruity flavors, then ends with a warming, sweet malty and peppery alcohol burn that lingers. Grand Illumination Ale is a very complex, very delicious, very warming, comforting barleywine, just perfect for the Christmas/Winter season. Again the brewery has closed, so this beer has become even more rare.
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;(12oz bottle, 2004) Lightly hazed copper body topped by smallish beige head. Aroma is sweet, caramel, chocolate, orange, cranberry. Taste is sweet, chocolate, caramel, fig, light grapefruit. Smooth, watery medium body, surprising in its capacity to hold and hide the alcohol as well as it does (I would never guess the ABV within 2 percent). Definitely on the malty side of the style.
Williamsburg Grand Illumination Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Bottle: Deep copper, somewhat cloudy, with a thick beige head that fades to a small coating on top of the beer that lasts. Aroma: light apricots, figs, lightly tart apple/cranberries, citrus/floral hops, and a sweet cloying malt that comes through towards the finish. Taste: mild citrus hops, lemon grass, though this is not very hoppy or bitter for a barleywine, syrupy malt, caramel, light toffee, bitter grass, and a hint of cardboard. There’s a barely percievable hint of sourness in here that doesn’t taste like it belongs, perhaps it’s a bit infected but I can’t be sure.

Garley Altmärker Narrenbräu;Gardelegen, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Garley Spezialitäten Brauerei;Is pretty close to a Dortmunder or Helles although it is sligthtly more bitter than a typical member of theese styles and there is a slight honeyish sweet note which I suspect comes from the oat. Other than that a pretty well balanced, fullbodied, smooth and easy drinkable beer- but all in all not overly exiting.

Bathams Special Strong Ale (XXX);Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Strong Ale - English;Bathams Brewery;Sampled 24th November hand pulled at The Swan Chaddesley Corbett.This is a Christmas seasonal offering from this brewery and is brewed differently every year so this is the 2012 version.First off,this beer is done no justice at all in the bottle(though it can be good).On the hand pull this beer is a delight.It is generally brewed once though in recent years 2 or even 3 brews have been done if capacity permits and even these can differ in flavour(and strength).This one,or was it 4!,well,,got to get it when its there! was mid brown in colour and similar to last year.(2009 it was a lighter golden colour).It sports a creamy off white head which stays on the glass.Aroma is of malt with some fruitiness and also alcohol featuring this year for some reason or other as this one isnt as strong as last years.Anyone fortunate enough to be able to drink the draught form will know what i mean when i say beware,the 6.3% is a very conservative rating!!The malt taste remains throughout as does the fruity background.The hops are there too and the alcohols there for sure.Great tasting beer.
Bathams Special Strong Ale (XXX);Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Strong Ale - English;Bathams Brewery;Brown 500ml bottle, best before the end of June 2011, drank and reviewed on a snowy afternoon, 30th Nov 2010. Poured into a ’Batemans’ badged UK pint sleeve. Good amber body with a creamy, light tan coloured head of foam. The head left some good lacing as the beer level dropped. Aroma reminded me of sultanas and raisins, so a Rum hint within the smell, along with a heavy wiff of yeasts and alcohol. The taste is sharp and crisp, with the currents already mentioned coming through in the aftertaste. The alcohol is just about held in check, but not quite. A tinge of cinnamon also appears as the initial flavours fade in the mouth. In other words a Winter Warmer sort of beer. Very drinkable and a good warming brew, it fortified me for the walk into town through the cold and falling snow.
Bathams Special Strong Ale (XXX);Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Strong Ale - English;Bathams Brewery;Bottle @ pre-GBBF shindig, August 2009 as Special Strong Ale. I like Bathams as a brewery. They are ultra traditional and have a small chain of pubs in the Midlands. Nothing much has changed at Bathams for decades, beer range included. Unfortunately, the bottled version of this beer didn’t work too well for me. Copper colour. Odd musty notes & a little cardboardy. Not really a strong ale. Not horrible but not too appealing either. Probably an old bottle but there was no BBE date so it is hard to know. Must try to find this one from cask some time.

Bathams Special Strong Ale (XXX);Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Strong Ale - English;Bathams Brewery;A Mes rate: bottle at the ever brilliant Chris O’s Pre GBBF Extravaganza. Russet colour, just about holding on to an off white film. Sweet and puddingy. Lots of spice, Something vaguely meadish about it. Faint peppery bitter finish with more pudding. Uneventful and not great. It did however give me the opportunity to use the words puddingy and meadish in my notes. :) WIN!

LaConner Bottleworks IV (4th) Anniversary;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;LaConner Brewing Company;22. Thanks, Riverside! Wow, what an unexpected delight to see emerge from the Bottleworks cellars.Crystal clear rubied amber. Nice loose creamy tan film with a little bit of body to it. Enormous orangey zesty nose, just a ton of life to the aromatics. Tangy caramel there as well. Creamy medium still body. Beautifully aged candied fruit hop combined with a slightly tanied malt base...what a beautiful pairing. Hops still show some fruit skin bitterness but none of that acetic lingering resin. So the sweetnesses really get a chance to work together, but in a subdued state so that neither is overpowering. Great, great beer after 6 years of mellowing.
LaConner Bottleworks IV (4th) Anniversary;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;LaConner Brewing Company;22oz bottle that I picked up at the 10th anniversary release at Bottleworks last week. So this one has intrigued me for sometime and when I saw it on the shelf, I had to grab it. Holding the bottle up to the light, you can see a good amount of ’debris’ in the bottom from what used to be a whole hop that was placed in the bottle when it was bottled. Reading about others having gushers, I get this one colder than I normally would have and open it up over the sink ready to act fast...but this one opened with a slight hiss and absolutely tame. Pours a cloudy orange light mahogany color with zero head. I am wondering if this bottle may be bad. I raise this glass to my nose and immediately greeted by malty biscuit notes and hints of hop resin! I take a sip with a bit of trepidation. Pleasantly I am greeted with some light carbonation. Taste is semi sweet bready malt with some notes of orange zest and bittering hops on the back end. As this warms, the 9.6 does show up a little bit. Amazing how well this beer has held up and how it can still have such hop presence being 6 years old. Wish I would have gotten to try this one when it was fresh just to know how much it has really changed, but super impressed with how this beer tastes right now. Glad I picked this one up and it was a nice way to end my day.
LaConner Bottleworks IV (4th) Anniversary;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;LaConner Brewing Company;22 oz. bomber, and man, people aren’t kidding - this one sprayed all over. I’m really wishing I’d opened it over a bowl and saved all I lost - it ended up with somewhere around 14 oz left. One other thing - there isn’t a hop cone in the bottle. There are five or six hop cones in the bottle. Trevor (at Bottleworks) held it up to a light for me, and there was a good two centimeters of sediment at the bottom. Insane. Anyhow, once it calms down a bit, it pours a very murky orange amber with a small head. The nose hits you with a ton of hops, and an equally staggering malt contingent - the caramelly, syrupy malts that remind you of cap’n crunch when they’re mixed with stale hops. Very bitter aftertaste. Huge, huge flavor. Man, would I have loved to try this fresh. Quite an experience - this one really put a smile on my face, for the novelty if nothing else.
LaConner Bottleworks IV (4th) Anniversary;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;LaConner Brewing Company;"This is a crazy bottle. Noted with a """"DH"""" on the bottle cap. I’m guessing Dry Hopped. There is an entire hop cone in the bottle! The bottle gushed upon opening, but I salvaged what I could. This is an insanely hopped beer. The concept is pretty simple, with the entire hop cone in the bottle. But it seems nobody has thought or done this since. This bottle has aged a bit in the fridge and stll is as hoppy as hell. Absolutely amazing. I’m still stunned at the flavor and the concept."
LaConner Bottleworks IV (4th) Anniversary;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;LaConner Brewing Company;22 oz gushing bottle into a 2 oz Snifter glass. We popped this one as a little inventory celebration. Upon uncapping this brew literally sprays EVERYWHERE! Quickly pouring it into the snifter reveals a gorgeous deep orange hazed color with golden notes when held up to light as you see hop chunks floating around in the brew. A very foamy white head sits up top and retains throughout the experience. A blast of Northwestern hops of all sorts comes through in the aroma: citrus, resin, pine, and more. It’s balanced with a light sweet malt characteristic as well. The flavor starts in with the sweet malt (as it should) and immediately is overtaken by all sorts of floral and citrusy hop madness. Very in your face, and a very resiny feel on the palate (along with chewing hop chunks, or catching them and spitting them out). A bit of carmalized malt is present throughout the body, but this one is straight hopped up to the core!! A beautiful bitter finish ends this guy with all sorts of hop flavors running over your palate. I never had this fresh, but I think it’s aged fantastically!!!

LaConner Bottleworks IV (4th) Anniversary;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;LaConner Brewing Company;Thanks to Pitonka for sharing this one. Dry hopped bottle! Huge gushing beer! Heavy orange color, small white head. Aroma is huge resinous hops, citrus pine, the whole 9 yards. Flavor is more huge hop kicks, decent malt back to it.

LaConner Bottleworks IV (4th) Anniversary;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;LaConner Brewing Company;Bottle (dry hopped): Cloudy dark straw, moderate sudsy white head, loads of hop petals floating about, spotty lacing.   Huge, yet soft hop aroma.   Floral, but not in the bitter sense.   Moderate bitterness, floral, caramel, bloody tasty.   Strong hop flavor at the finish, slight heat, but definitely easier than it was in March of 2003.   Big body, moderate mouthfeel.   Tangy finish, slight citrus, sweet, and nothing like the brash example it was earlier.   Mellowed out very nicely.   Simply enjoyable! &nbsp Glad I got this as a freebie from Kevin at Bottleworks.

Clear straw in colour with a thin white head. Zesty grassy notes present in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a slight digestive biscuit note with hints of gooseberry fruit and kiwi. Strong floral notes of hop resins flood the long aftertaste with pine resin evident. Finish is bitter sweet with hops still present in the mouth. An ok session bitter but not as complex as similair strength bitters out there.
Goachers Fine Light Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;Cask at GBBF 2010. A dark golden beer with a thin yellowish head. The aroma has notes of citrusy fruits, malt, and hops. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, and hops. I find it boring.

Goachers Fine Light Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;Cask at the Trafalgar with Mes, 25th April 2008. Orangey gold in colour and served in great condition, but it was downhill from then on. Slight aroma of creamy vanilla and tastes of nothing much. Average weight and utterly bland and forgettable. A waste of money.
Goachers Fine Light Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;A Mes rate: Gravicask at the Trafalgar. Slightly hazy pale gold with a thin white head. Bland aroma of straw and some light chlorine. Flavour is less offensive but very bland. Pale wheat and straw with a light sourness at the back of the palate and some corn in the finish.
Goachers Fine Light Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. ’Light’ being the operative word... Gold with a small white head. Very little aroma. The taste is also rather thin. A slight, not unpleasant biscuity malt flavour is not enough to tempt one into spending a full session with this brew.
Carlsberg Light 2.7%;Copenhagen, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Brewery;Moderate foaming which is renewed from the bottom of a relatively high carbonation. Regularly malty flavor featureless carries the flavor go in an equally anonymous hoppy bitterness, although just manages to bring the beer in reasonable balance. Easy to drink and thirst-quenching has been the only real positive to highlight.
Carlsberg Light 2.7%;Copenhagen, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Brewery;Tap. Light Clear golden, small white head. Hay, grain, a whiff of grass. Flavor is light sweet brewmash, grass and a light flowery, very light flowery finish. Watery texture. Tiny body. Bland but quite drinkable compared to most macro low alc’s.

Carlsberg Light 2.7%;Copenhagen, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle 33 cl. Yellow pour with a fair white head. The aroma is best but a bit hop sensation too. The taste is sweetmalt, hints of grain and a comfortable hoppy finish

Carlsberg Light 2.7%;Copenhagen, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Brewery;Can from the grocery store in Reykjavik. Pours a clear, pale gold body with a moderately sized, fizzy head. Dissipating. Aroma is dominated by floral and herbal hops. Little to no malt aroma. Very pleasant Saaz-ish hop character. Sweet, lightly bready pils malt comes through first in the flavor - somewhat candyish. Cut with some of the hops, but they play a lesser role than in the nose. Light, crisp body with bubbly carbonation. Dry, lightly bitter finish is surprisingly clean. Overall a pleasant, clean summer beer that hit the spot after a busy day. If the flavor had matched the aroma in its balance the beer would be much better.
Carlsberg Light 2.7%;Copenhagen, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Brewery;"A pale yellow-golden beer with an average white head on top.

Du Minot Crémant de Pomme;Hemmingford, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie du Minot;Corked bottle Very pale color, fizzy, no head. Mild aroma, but the flavor is delicate, nice, with very light residual sweetness. In France there are ciders with similar ABV but more character. Elegant, light though.

Aroma brings out dry apple skins and some champagney notes. Flavour brings out light sweetness from the apples, with some champagne character and a little leather. Not as complex as the Rose version, but this works pretty well. Moderate-to-heavy carbonation. Good, but nothing special.
Du Minot Crémant de Pomme;Hemmingford, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie du Minot;Light green. No head. The aroma isn’t much. Sweet, lightly fruity, maybe a bit funky as well. Bit fizzy. So for me, maybe not the greatest balance but it does have more character than the average cider of this type, with a bit more than the usual acidity in the finish.
Du Minot Crémant de Pomme;Hemmingford, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie du Minot;A very light blonde cider with aroma of sweet apple jam, light mineral notes, light acidity, pleasant.

Du Minot Crémant de Pomme;Hemmingford, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie du Minot;"Bottle (750 ml). Split 4-ways. Clear white-ish golden with a foamy quickly vanishing white head. Aroma is of fresh McIntosh apples along sugary - not artifical - notes and mild grassy presence. Taste is mildly acidic with again fresh McIntosh apples flesh and mild grassy notes. Light body, but never watery. Big persistent bubbles, never too agressive, but giving a nice ample mouthfeel. Apple flesh finish. I was impressed by how present the apple is in this one which is not often the case with low abv cider. This is quite tasty and extremely easy to drink. Good job on the mouthfeel as well, I think there’s not another cidery doing a better job than Du Minot with ""bubbles"" in Québec. The free 1 oz sample you can get at the cidery won’t give justice to this one, it’s worth buying a bottle to give it a proper try."
Bulldog Amber Waves;Fresno, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Bulldog Brewing Company (CA);No head and a fairly dark reddish brown color.

I drank it right after, waiting the bus to Lausanne. In my point of view, it is a drinkable lager, but you don't have expect nothing exciting about this beer. The color is gold, transparent, average carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste is watery, some malt, some hop, but the sensation is in the mouth boring, the aromas are not so generous.

Sarmat Dobriy Shubin;Donetsk, Ukraine;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;An extremly broad taste and bready fillingness overwhelms you in this very dark brew. Its almost pitch black, but still not thick like a guiness. Its a black pilsner, if now that is possible. The best beer i have ever drinked. This one beer isnt favouritized by the inhabitants as they like bright pilsner beer, and Sarmat creates many brands of those. They are though far off in quality from this one. Strangely its a pretty rare to find beer even in Russia and Ukraine. But its worth the chase. I tried to figure out what ingredient was this incredible flavoured enchantment coming from. The best i figured i think its based upon a summerdrink they all make at home there, non alcoholic water they put in a barrel and add a piece of bread into it. A chilling drink. Now that is pure speculation but there is something incredibly bready in its flavour. Maby they use real baked dark bread into the brewing process. This is the absolute favourite beer of mine. It actually is so much finer than any other i have ever tasted, its the absolute best one so far. I ran into it on a trip to Ukraine, and ever since i would never miss out on a dobre shubin going there. Dobre means Good, and shubin is a familly name. They are found in either half litre bottles or 2 litre plactic bottles.

Sarmat Dobriy Shubin;Donetsk, Ukraine;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Nut-brown with an ok head. Some prune-aroma. A bit burnt, bitter flavour, (but it could come from the smoking Russians surronding me).

Sarmat Dobriy Shubin;Donetsk, Ukraine;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;"""There is a legend in Donbass about the mine ghost - Good Shubin (Dobry Shubin). At the end of the XIX-th century there was a mine foreman, Shubin, who worked in one of the Donetsk mines. He had the unique intuition and he could foresee collapses and methane blowout. Before every shift he came down into the mine to listen to its depths and to warn about any possible danger. Ever since miners believe in existence of a good mine ghost and even ask him for aid"". This was from the label. Sourish, no head, almost undrinkable."

Described as a ""Milk stout with chocolate aroma and taste"". Poured an almost opaque black with ruby tints and with a one-finger light tan foamy head that retained well and laced well. Carbonation virtually nil. Aroma of sweet caramel, nice moderate strength roasted grain and chocolate. Taste of chocolate with the chocolate taste coming more prominent as it warms. Medium to high body. Smooth with a syrupy mouthfeel and sweet chocolate on the finish. One to sip and savour. Very nice and different."
Bush Shack Chocolate Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Listed as a milk stout. On draught @ Bush Shack brewery, Yallingup. Muddy dark brown, opaque, with fine carbonation rising up to a dollop of whipped tannish cream that lasts. Thick chocolate mudcake and icecream nose, quite nutty, rich yet dusty with a little hint of wood and yeast. Quite meaty, chunky in mouthfeel, full and rounded with a smooth finish. Light tannins and rust notes peak out under some robust chocolate malts and a flavour eerily reminiscent of velvety chocolate icecream. A hint of wood and roasted nuts in the aftertaste, linger long amongst the sweet chocolate, giving good balance. Better warmed up a little, the carbonation very light, the sweetness restrained from offsetting it. Not exactly session stuff, but it has come a long way from when I first tried it half a decade ago. Cleaned up and tasty, a nice ale.

Bush Shack Chocolate Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);21 Jan 05 - Sweet choc well rounded malt aroma. Dark brown-black colour, good brown head but doesn’t retain well, with suds lacing. Sweet choc lightly roasted malt. Tangy, thickish mouthfeel. This beer could offer more complexity.
Bush Shack Chocolate Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Dark ruby colour, foamy head doesn’t last at all. This reminded me far too much of Chicos. When I first smelled it from the bottle the aroma jumped out at me, but when I poured it into the glass I thought that it was a more authentic cocoa-ey aroma, but that didn’t last long. Smells like artificial chocolate flavour - choc topping/Chico - and not much else, perhaps a bit of yeast. Tastes SWEET. Like Mackeson’s or Sweetheart stouts. Blech. This is Chico-flavoured soft drink with some roast malt astringency, and I don’t really like Chicos. No good at all. Lucky they do some other good stuff.

Bush Shack Chocolate Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Coffee/chocolate milkshake aroma, brown colour with a generous lasting head and good brussels lace.

Bush Shack Twisted Lemon Lager;Yallingup, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);"On draught @ Bush Shack Brewery, Yallingup. Produced up lightly hazy, a sunny yellow with few and far between carbonation and a quickly diminishing head. Predominately grainy nose, barnyardy and dusty with a sly hint of lemon and an earthy, honey sweetness. Very clean on the palate; lemon candy atop bready, gritty grains and musty, pleasantly sweet honey. Finish is dry, crisp and dusty. The body quite light with moderate carbonation. This works and I don’t know why. Tangy, refreshing sweet/sour mix that is balanced but light. A handful of US hops wouldn’t go astray though!"

Bright pale yellow, clear, huge foamy head. Really stinky aroma-- my father-in-law said it smelled like his fermenting homemade wine, so I think they may want to clean their lines! Fresh palate (in sharp contrast to the aroma), a light lager backbone with some citrus oil zest and hints of honey. Average but enjoyable.
Bush Shack Twisted Lemon Lager;Yallingup, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);"This came in a wheat ale bottle with a handwritten ""sour"" label on it.

Midnight Sun Monk's Mistress;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;22 oz bottle poured. Thanks, Wyatt! Alaska beer night! A treat to try such a praised belgain strong from these guys. A dense, jet black pour, moderate tan foam head. Aroma is more modest than expected, dark fruit, raisin/plum, soft spices.

Well put together, and wonderfully complex. Love it.

The pour is a nice darker garnet tinted brown color with a thick light tan head that slowly falls down to a dense cap with a couple spots of lace. The aroma is pretty good. There is a strong Belgian yeast right up front with a darker fruitiness and a bit of sweet malt happening. This one is intense. There is a bit of oxidation on the front of the nose, and it does come off a little cardboard-y. The flavor is much of the same. The fruits are light and sweet with a nice yeastiness and a strong bit of sweet malt after that. The oxidation exists here as well. The mouth feel is medium bodied and softly carbonated with a sweet fruitiness and a pretty good yeasty finish. Not too shabby. 7 4 7 4 15

Midnight Sun Monk's Mistress;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Too sweet. Much prefer a tripel. The beer is. Not bad, but the sugar is just too much.

Southampton Imperial Baltic Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Baltic;Southampton Publick House;"Well...it is what it is. One of those beers that is good, tasty, drinkable, but forgetable. I like the flavor, a little rusty of a mouthfeel, but the chocolate malt aftertaste is decent. Appearance is semi-thin....dark brown, but not quite coffee black. I haven't sampled a lot of Baltic Porters yet, but this seems to have that European-porter feel to it. Worth the try and the price was right, but think I'll be bored of this by the time I finish the 6-pack......................................UPDATED 3/15/13: Sampled a single after two years. Better than I remembered from the review. Upgraded a point on appearance and mouthfeel. Not ""bored"" at all from this beer. It is good stuff."

Garley Bock;Gardelegen, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Garley Spezialitäten Brauerei;Bottle, 6.5%. Citric and sour aroma, a bit unpleasant. Clear dark brown colour, fizzy head disappearing completely. The flavour is malty, but also a bit sour and quite clearly infected. Almost drinkable. Unexpected from such a big brewery.

Some cooked vegetables in the aroma, but luckily they disappeares rather quickly, and are replaced by some alcohol, malt and a roasted note.

Actually surprisingly light for a bock, with a small body. Or else I’m enjoying it too cold. Sweetness yes. Bitterness, yes. But this bock doesn’t make the bells peal. 250903

Nose is roasted malt, smoke, coffee, and tiny bourbon notes. Taste is roasted malt and a bit of booze. Not a great taste as far as complexity. The palate is oily and medium bodied. Decent stout I suppose.

Deschutes Glass Butte Imperial Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;My first Deschutes and I went straight for the Imperial. It was lighter in color... my Imperial Stout better be blackety black!!!! Very plain coffee roast nose and slightly chalky and bitter (which is good). Not a strong Imperial Stout, although it did boast 9%.
Deschutes Glass Butte Imperial Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;Aroma seems to lack a strong character, slightly chocolatey. Flavor begins slightly bland, then a bourbon/chocolate flavor follows. Not a lot of hop character, another imperial tasted at the RAF that seemed a bit thin for the style. Smooth mouthfeel, soft finish, average for the style.

Deschutes Glass Butte Imperial Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;Real Ale Fest - Smoky/salty aroma. I want to rate this one higher but it really tasted more like a porter (malty chocolate roast) rather than a imperial stout. Seemed light...maybe they are going to tweak it a bit?
Deschutes Glass Butte Imperial Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;(On tap at Real Ale Fest - Chicago) Smoked Polish sausage aroma flows from the opaque body. Milk chocolate and plum flavor, but the body is a little thin. Finish is smooth and roasted and helps to round out a pretty good imperial stout.
Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;Aroma is powerful and extremely pleasing. Deep orange/red color, with a fine, full head. Small particles everywhere in the brew, even with a half pour, but it’s a 5 year old, bottle conditioned beer. Flavor is extremely malty and concentrated. Caramel, toffee, a bit of roast, with hints of cherry and other fruits. Aged malt character is truly outstanding and it’s not overwhelmingly oxidized. Immensely chewy. Best aged beer I’ve had in a long time.
Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;Bottle, dated September 1, 2002, purchased and savored at Choice City Butcher and Deli, Ft Collins, CO. I am not sure how Russ procured this, but thanks. Pours cloudy brown with a spare, rocky, light brown head, diminishing, spare lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (caramel, chocolate, toffee), average hops (flowers), average yeast (dough) with notes of dates and honey. Full bodied, creamy and alcoholic texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Long duration, moderate sweetness, acidity and bitterness.

Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;"Cask; 2003 RAF: Cloudy rust color. Frothy foam. Lightly smoked aroma. Hints of dark grape, bread, and caramel. Thick palate. Full bodied. Smoke flavors overrides plum, candied fruit, and yeast with a hint of iron and raisin. Underlain by a mildly coarse hop presence. Reminiscent of Bell's Batch 5000 with more barleywine-like aspects. Highly impressive."
Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;Wow! It is amazing how much flavor and uniqueness can be stuffed into a 4 ounce glass!!!! Warm sugar cookie dough dipped in rum, rolled in hay, drug through a field of oats, dipped in rum again, and finally poured into my glass with a hops-infused cherry on top. (Jeez, that sounds like I just stole this out of DaSilky1's notebook!)
Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;Bells comes through again. Dark fruit with aged oak plum. The alcohol is strong and warming. Bitterness in the end, sweet in the front.
Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;A beautifully unexpected highlight of the RAF for me. Sweet molasses cookie aroma, rich and comforting. Doughy texture, bready and wonderful. Medium orange-amber hue. This is going to sound rightfully cheesy, but I can tell that so much love and care went into this...maybe they helped craft it together?
Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;cask (RAF): swamp clouds of brown...aroma defined in chocolate wedding cake drizzled with candy carmel, sugar cookie, and port wine..onslaught of thick smoke and an evident chocolate foundation..super silky smooth mouthfeel and a semi-bitter finish..nice.
Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;Malty aroma. Flavor is chocolate/carmel. Hoppy as one would expect from this brewery. This is not one of their better beers IMHO, as the complexity of the malt pales in comparison to some of their masterpieces. ABV covered smoothly, just not a lot going on in the malt.
Bell's Wendy and Larrys Wedding Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bell's Brewery;Cask: Clear orange brown. . . fairly large toupe bubbles through on the medium sized head. Sweet hops up front, rolls into caramel and honey. Sugary mouthfeel but still has a solid malt presence. Flavour diminishes quickly, but still another solid offering from Bells.
Mogollon Horny Toad IPA;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mogollon Brewing Company;May 2010: No Horny Toads mentioned on the font. One of 24 taps in the Greenroom, Flagstaff, just a few miles from the brewery. Amber/orange in colour, very little head on my pour. Hops, hops and more hops seemed to be the over riding theme with this hoppy IPA. The hop mix/blend/interwoven combination however produces a very drinkable beer. Can’t call it well balanced because someone forgot to put any malted barley into the brew! Pity we didn’t have time to visit the brewhouse.
Mogollon Horny Toad IPA;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mogollon Brewing Company;Draght. Had a pint of this at a friend’s house tonight. Very, very good. I’ll be looking for this in the tap rooms.

Mogollon Horny Toad IPA;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mogollon Brewing Company;Tap at Papago. Hazy amber-orange color pour with a nice head. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops with some caramel malt in the back. Flavor is pretty balanced between sweet and bitter. Not mind-blowing, but good.

Mogollon Horny Toad IPA;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mogollon Brewing Company;Sampled at GTBF. Muddled orange-copper pour with a 1/4 inch eggshell head that left a bit of lacing.

Mogollon Horny Toad IPA;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mogollon Brewing Company;On tap @ 1702 - Poured a slightly hazy golden color with a thin white head. Light layered lacing.

Mogollon Horny Toad IPA;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mogollon Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Clear reddish-orange color with an off white head that laced the glass. Smelled of malty caramel, light sprucy hops, and vanilla. Dry on the tongue with moderate hop bitterness, especially at the end. Pleasant malty caramel and vanilla flavors, but only minimal flowery hop flavor.
Mogollon Horny Toad IPA;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mogollon Brewing Company;Poured with the amberish color and with a huge and nice head (concave up). Very nice presentation.

Govnors Public House Heaven Hill Imperial Stout;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Govnors Public House;I could really notice the alcohol in this one. Not an high ABV but present. Not really imp stout, but smoother and a tad thin.
Govnors Public House Heaven Hill Imperial Stout;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Govnors Public House;Nice rich roasty aroma/... like from a chocolate smokestack/... but I want my damn Imperials/... blackety black/... My first and last ratings rap! This had a big smoky sweet nose but lost it after that. It was thin and watery. Nice aftertaste of whisky and bakers chocolate.

Govnors Public House Heaven Hill Imperial Stout;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Govnors Public House;Sweet cherry alcohol aroma, small bits of chocolate, though a pleasant aroma, it was hard to find. . . Dark brown, small thin toupe head. Dark chocolate flavours with some sugary alcohol - pretty mild for 8.9%, missing the thickness and veinous qualities one would expect from an Imperial stout. Too much sugar and not enough fruit.
Govnors Public House Heaven Hill Imperial Stout;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Govnors Public House;Chocolate/whiskey aroma. Very chocolatey malt flavor. Bourbon kicks in towards the end. Again , aging this type of beer in bourbon barrels does seem to provide a finish that drowns out the malt. Where is the fruit? Not very imperial.
Govnors Public House Heaven Hill Imperial Stout;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Govnors Public House;Pours a light brown color and you could see right through it. The aroma was pretty nice. Roasted and malty. Creamy alcohol, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, a little oak and some coffee. Worth drinking, but not the best, to be sure.

Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;"Draft. I am absolutely sure I had this one, though my notes I’ve kept from my trips to Capitol City over the last year or so have disappeared. What I remember of it (I distinctly recall having a Wee Heavy on tap because of the ""odd"" name) is that it poured a brownish color, had a quite refreshing flavor. Notes of caramel, touch of alcohol. I’ll see if I can’t update this in the future."

Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;On tap at ODBF 2004... This beer rocks!... Sparkling clear, mahogany ale with a small, creamy, beige head. Weeping lacework. Aromas of molasses, maple syrup, toffee, port and wood. A hint of smoke. Decently balanced flavor. Sweet and malty, but also tangy and well-bittered. Full-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, semi-sweet, astringent finish. Well done!
Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;On tap at Old Dominion Brewfest. Pours a dark reddish auburn. Aroma is roasty. Taste is sweet with caramel malt, a good dose of hops, brown sugar, chocolate, dark fruit and smokiness. Noticeable alcohol content but it doesn’t negatively impact the brew. Mouthfeel is very full, round and creamy. Nice.
Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;Dark brown pour with a reddish tint to it. For a scotch ale, I like to taste a bit of peat butt didn’t notice any in this. Medium bodied and a bit smoky. Dried fruits and light caramel tastes. Nothing remarkable.
Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;Deep brown with a purple-ish tint, very little head, lots of toffee, caramel & sweet malty flavors, very smooth & drinkable, a slight hint of smoke in the finish along with more malty caramel flavors, a nice Scotch ale
Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;Setting: Served on tap in a pint glass at the brewpub. Appearance: Über-dark crimson - almost black - topped by a modest off-white head that goes to a film of small bubbles right quick. Leaves small splotches of foam as remains of the day. Aroma: Caramel and toffee malt sugars with hints of prunes. Flavor: Intensely malty and sweet. Caramel and pruny/plum flavors dominate the mouth. Kind of a simple taste. Some roasted or smoked malt flavors would have been welcome. Palate: Rather heavy in body with lingering sweet aftertastes. Overall: A little bit on the cloying side with the sweetness, but not horrifically so.
Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;Had this on draft at the Manayunk event. 8% alcohol. Pours dark brown, with aroma of malt and toffee. Tastes very malty with an underlying sweetness. Slightly tart finish. This is a scotch ale, but it has some flemish sour and some belgian dubbel qualities. Nice complexity. One of the top beers at the Manayunk event, in my opinion.
Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;a nice dark ale. a tad bitter with a heavy flavor. Never got a scottish feel to it... more of a strong ale or a bitter. Still a good starter beer...
Capitol City Wee Heavy;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;"Super dark brown colour with a thin light brown head. Sweet aroma of chocolate, coffee, plentiful sugars and roasted malt. Medium-bodied; Roasty flavours favouring sweet malt and some bittering qualities. Aftertaste shows the coffee and dark chocolate flavours while still having sweet characteristics. Overall, a nice beer-sweet and still roasty-well done and a good one to try this season! I had this from a growler purchased from the location in Shirlington (Arlington), Virginia by my sister's fiance. I tasted this on 30-November-2003."
Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);Bottled from the Greene Kiing brewery shop. Aparently they brew it there now too. Funny colour for a wheat. Hazy golden copper with little head. They must use a weissen yeast with this one cos it has those banana esters along with some peachy, orange notes too. A little thin. flavor has plenty honey and wheat. some lasting sweetness. the first taste was good but ultmately forgettable.
Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);Bottled version. Dunno what to think, don’t look like a wheat beer, and only vaguely tastes of one. I might have enjoyed it better if it was labelled differently.
Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);Well, was not really a Weiss Bier, and they never said so, but it was a little far from the fron flavor, the wheat.
Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);This is a seriously strange beer. Starts with an aroma of cloves and peat, however changes to light fruityness, canceling out the peat, then later on back to peat, with cloves and little wheatyness all the way through. Taste starts harsh smokey peat, however changes as with the aroma to a far smother peaty fruitiness. Reminds me of a scotch ale in some ways, however maybe needs a little more refining.
Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);[bottle from asda] pours an orangey yellow colour with a quickly diminishing head. The nose is fruity, some peach notes and a little citrus fruit, smells pretty industrialised though. body is a bit weak, sweet finish.
Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);"VERY light style of wheat beer, no head (which is disappointing ) Lightly spiced nose and also on the palate, this bears little resemblance to ""classic"" wheat beers."
Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);Bottle from Sainsbury’s. Clear yellow with white head. No yeast. Fruity orange / banana aroma. Spritzy mouthfeel and yes, there it is, a smoky peaty flavour. Classic ’Northern German’ wheatbeers must be clear and smoky then - Kristallrauchbier, no less. Actually its drinkable but that house character of Belhaven’s is beginning to annoy me somewhat. (Try using different yeast if you’re going to brew different ’classic’ beer styles, guys?)
Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);(Bottle 50 cl) I find the back label’s claim that wheat beer originates in Northern Germany rather amusing. Wonder what would’ve happened during the war if the British general staff had lacked the same sense of geography. Would they’ve been looking for Hitler in the Eagle’s Nest around Flensburg somewhere? Anyways, I remember having this for the first time at the Copenhagen Beer Festival in 2003 concluding that the Scots should keep away from producing wheat beers. After having finished this I haven’t changed my opinion. This amber-coloured, slightly hazy beed has an oddly smoked character - pretty much like whisky-malt. Indeed a very different wheat! 250104

Belhaven Wheat Beer (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Wheat Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);Bottled. A lightcopper/dark gold coloured beer with a thin lemony floral aroma. The taste is wheaty and a bit perfumed. Drinkable if unspectacular.

Rock Bottom Long Beach Diabolical Dubbel;Long Beach, California, United States;Dubbel;Rock Bottom Long Beach;DraughtThe beer as it forsakes the keg a tea color, hazy and the head portly in size, light tan in color and the texture semi-creamy, as it erodes the lace forms a nice concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt with hits of caramel, fresh and clean to the senses, start is sweet, and has a nice malt profile with the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is entertainingly acidic, the hops gratifyingly spicy, nice dry and lingering aftertaste, a fine representative to the style.
Rock Bottom Long Beach Diabolical Dubbel;Long Beach, California, United States;Dubbel;Rock Bottom Long Beach;Bottled (RAF). Pours a pretty standard reddish brown color with little head. The aroma was crazy good and dominated by crab apples, raisin, plum, toffee and candy sugar. The flavor was just a little flat. This could have been really good if the flavors matched the nose. Unfortunately, it was unable to do so.
Piece Wing Nut;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Had on tap at Piece. Served in a tulip. Freshly tapped that day. It’s been a while since this was brewed so I was definitely excited to have it. A: Pours a hazy amber color with a thin white head forming on the pour. It recedes to a thick ring and sticky sheets of lace are left down the glass. S: Piney hops with a slightly fruity sweetness melding in there. Caramel and bready malts balance this hop bomb out. T: Great semi-bitter hops resinous hops are upfront with some mild pine flavor. It mixes nicely with some mango and pineapple citrus sweetness. The hops are taken back down to earth by a nice caramel malt body. M: Medium bodied, slightly sticky in feel with a nice prickly carbonation. O: This had some great hop flavors and it was very refreshing. Easily drinkable for the ABV. It seems Wingnut is back and better than ever. Get it while it lasts.

Piece Wing Nut;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On draft at brewpub, poured a darker golden color, aromas of citrus and pine hops, and some light malt. Flavors are the same with a touch of caramel on the back end, nice beer overall.
Piece Wing Nut;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Gold copper with a small head. The aroma is mostly citrus and pine, with light caramel malt.

Piece Wing Nut;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Enjoyed on tap at Piece while having some beers with a friend on a crowded Saturday night. Appearance is a dark but bright gold with a rich white head that laces. Aroma mostly citrus and pine, more citrusy than other IIPA’s. Taste is very citrusy and bitter, more hoppy than malty, surprising for an imperial ipa, thought this one was pretty good. Would gladly enjoy again!
Piece Wing Nut;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at Piece. Pours a hazy deer amber with a near white head that dissipates slowly to the edges. Aroma has grassy and pine hops with a slight old fruit note and backing sweet grains. Flavor has sweet grain up front with a nice hop note with resin, pine and a bit of grass.
Piece Wing Nut;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Aroma of hops. Nice lacing. Ok head on this one. Dark amber pour that is kind of cloudy. Creamy mouth. Taste is pretty sweet at first. The hop notes take over at the end and really balance this out. For 9.5% alcohol, this is too easy to drink. Nicely done.
Piece Wing Nut;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Reviewed from notes. Pours a moderate orange amber color with an off white head. The nose is citrus with a bit of rind and some mild spicing. Maybe herbal qualities. Taste is citrus and orange. Fairly bitter with a finish in the dry side.

Rock Bottom Chicago Uppa Kriek Without a Mash Paddle;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;RAF 2003: Bottle. Hazy strawberry shade. Sticky, chunky foam. Medicinal aroma alongside notes of whiskey, wood, sour cherries, must, and leaf. Buttery flavors followed by sour cherry pie filling. Finishes with a touch of coconut and acidity. A respectable example, only lacking in acidity and malt depth.
Rock Bottom Chicago Uppa Kriek Without a Mash Paddle;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Bottle RAF. Doesn't seem to be a true kriek. A musty aroma with hints of yeast. Mostly-lambic type flavor witha hint of cherry. Just not enough of the classic yeasty, musty, cheesy lambic flavors for me.
Rock Bottom Chicago Uppa Kriek Without a Mash Paddle;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Bottle at the RAF 2003: Hazy pink orange, thin white lasting head. Thicky musty aroma, very natural. . . Reminds me of wandering around in the creek behind my house when I was younger. Some pretty nice farmhouse aromas as well - grass, stone, and wood. A very natural sour flavour, tart and bitter, some acidity like orange juice and a little metallic in the finish. Overall a very interesting selection and one I enjoyed.
Rock Bottom Chicago Uppa Kriek Without a Mash Paddle;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;A beer of nostalgia for me. Aroma brought me back to picking cherries as a child during the middle of June...chasing away the blue jays and stepping on moldy fruit, stubbing my toes on the pits. Tasted exactly like past-the-prime cherries I've nibbled on: nuttiness of the pit, as well as the juicy bite that consumes the mouth. The thing is, I don't want a beer to taste like this. I don't eat those cherries anymore because...I know better.
Rock Bottom Chicago Uppa Kriek Without a Mash Paddle;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Hmm, well there was some bite to this. I mostly tasted fish, which is not a good thing in this instance. Some sour mash thrown in for good measure.
Rock Bottom Chicago Uppa Kriek Without a Mash Paddle;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;This was way off style, almost like a plain-old lager with some cherry juice added. The Belgian yeast didn't help a bit. Totally unbalanced, not even close. I'd prefer one of those teeth-gritting Chapeau Banana beers before trying another Rock Bottom attempt at a fruit beer.
Rock Bottom Chicago Uppa Kriek Without a Mash Paddle;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Poured a golden color with just a touch of pink from the cherries. A well-formed head again with little red hue to color it. Dry and musty with a strong sour kick. It didn't seem quite right, maybe a bit accelerated to achieve the sour they were looking for. An interesting beer that was well worth drinking, but something was just a little off.
Marin Abbey Special;Larkspur, California, United States;Dubbel;Marin Brewing Company;On tap after an 8 year hiatus. Pours with a clear, light bronze hued body with a lasting off-white head. Aromas are grainy, wheat, cereal, warm and malty, with mild esters (very mild for a dubbel). Flavors are of fig newtons, malty, nutty, soil, mild esters. Odd fruit flavor that I can not place. Persimmons maybe? Very lively bubbles, dry on the mouth.
Marin Abbey Special;Larkspur, California, United States;Dubbel;Marin Brewing Company;Re rating this based on tasting at brewery. aroma is cereal. The beer is warm now. Flavor is banana. Finishes sweet. Original rating: On tap at streets if London. Rating this based on a sip of my brothers beer. Aroma is of banana. Some caramel. Flavor is really similar. Finished slightly dry, and is thick and oily.
Marin Abbey Special;Larkspur, California, United States;Dubbel;Marin Brewing Company;A very good belgian style. Pours a deep red, with not much head, and a fruity smell. Very smooth drink, with a fruity aftertaste. Enjoyed. Had on tap at Marin Brew. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Marin Abbey Special;Larkspur, California, United States;Dubbel;Marin Brewing Company;Draft. Brown with a beige head. Roasted malt and spice aroma. Very fruity, malty, spicey, yeasty flavor. Rich and complex. Lingering esters. Medium body and easy to drink.
Marin Abbey Special;Larkspur, California, United States;Dubbel;Marin Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub, my version had fermented out to a solid 7.7. Deep brownish burgundy color. Raisiny aroma, but not strong. Belgian yeast notes were faint in the mouth, woven with dark fruits and a good malt body. It was good, but somehow not quite distinctive enough. Perhaps needs a funkier yeast?
Marin Abbey Special;Larkspur, California, United States;Dubbel;Marin Brewing Company;Cask at the RAF 2003: Great yeasty aroma, though more like a tripel than a dubbel. . . Dark red brown, not too much spice in the flavour, but fruit and malt are very nice on the palate. Though a strange dubbel a beer I would do again.
Marin Abbey Special;Larkspur, California, United States;Dubbel;Marin Brewing Company;The yeastiness didn't seem to mix with the red fruitiness (plum, grape, raspberry) and made it seem like a jumbled mess. Something was missing.
Marin Abbey Special;Larkspur, California, United States;Dubbel;Marin Brewing Company;Deep dark brown. A kind of medicinal rubber quality. Fairly thin in the palate. Dark, malty, and grapes.
Zigs Pachachuti of Machu Picchu;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Zigs Kettle and Brew;"I've had plenty of ""gimmick beers"". Ones with stupid labels depicting the Man Show or Monty Python... Ones with hot peppers floating in them or died green, but this is a different gimmick beer altogether. The gimmick here is to overdo the IBUs to an insane level and let the hophead drown in the bitter trainwreck. The nose was quite nice, a hoppy perfume with enough malt to notice. Sweet malts do make themselves known at the beginning of this ale, but surprisingly, the 177IBUs take a long second or two to gather speed and stregth before they collide on the sides of your tongue like a hop-filled tidal wave. Dry and grassy, the aftertaste lingers on into the next beer that you drink. A neat idea, big alcohol and big IBUs."
Zigs Pachachuti of Machu Picchu;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Zigs Kettle and Brew;I admit it, I got this one for the name at the end of session 1 of the RAF...had no idea of the IBUs. Citrusy sharp, slightly flowery aroma. Enjoyed it because it woke my mouth up after a long night of sweet nectar. Maintained a semblance of balance, but made my tongue numb in a almost intriguing fashion.
Zigs Pachachuti of Machu Picchu;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Ridiculous IBU level at 177. Plus a 9.5 ABV. Surprisingly easy going. Hits the tongue with a malt presence, but then goes into the huge lingering bitterness that would be expected.
Zigs Pachachuti of Machu Picchu;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Zigs Kettle and Brew;cask (RAF): 177 IBUs on the wall with my palate nailed there too..Hello..this beer was hoppy, go figure. mango and orange citrus zeal aroma..scrapped bits of hop resin, tangy pine sap all combine in unadulterated, wacky, off-balanced bitterness...did i mention it was cloudy brown with a thin head..cool...it was a fun ride none-the-less.
Zigs Pachachuti of Machu Picchu;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Absolutely huge piney, floral aroma. Though the hops are pronounced the aroma has some sweet malty sugar as well. Rich orange peel flavours, and other soft fruits like pears. . . nice lingering sweetness from some good malt presence. Very impressive to stay balanced and sport 177 IBUs as well.
Zigs Pachachuti of Machu Picchu;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Zigs Kettle and Brew;A nice balance of malt and hops in this beer. Totally unexpected at 177 IBUs. The malt is strongly caramel and chewy. The hops were citrusy and floral but nearly to the extent I expected. The 177 IBUs are well hidden leaving a statisfying beer to drink.

Dragonmead Woodys Perfect Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;Had this on cask. Pours a dark brown with a foamy off-white head.

Thought not very strong on flavor or aroma, I enjoyed drinking this.
Dragonmead Woodys Perfect Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;"Tap @ Dragonmead: Almost fully black body with not much of a head, only a thin film & a chunky, khaki colored collar around the edges. Aroma has strong notes of bitter chocolate, roasted malt, black coffee, & a hint of brown sugar. The taste has a larger coffee-ish presence; generic coffee bean notes with roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, & a little nuttiness. Bitterly roasted finish, a little watery. Another decent, yet slightly unexciting beer by Dragonmead."
Dragonmead Woodys Perfect Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;My first nitro-dispensed porter - man is it creamy!

Boscos Stout;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);"On cask (Irish yeast), Nashville brewpub. Nice pillowy tan head over a clear but very dark ruby black. Smells like fruitcake and sweet, roasty, dusty coffee. Lighter in body than I was expecting. Some of the roastiness and the deep red fruitiness comes out, but mostly it’s a smoothly sweet and fairly bland beer in the middle, giving way to a slightly roasty, slightly bitter finish that lingers quite a bit. Not quite a dry stout, the appellation ""stout"" is definitely appropriate: this doesn’t fit an a more specific box. Classic."
Boscos Stout;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Didn’t find a entry for their foreign export stout, so I’m entereing my opinion here. On draft at the Memphis locale. Opaque with a nonexistent head. Nice fruity, roasty aroma. Deep caramel, coffee, chocolate notes with a notable warming effect of alcohol. Very satisfying as a desert beverage.

The aroma was really very nice with chocolate, burnt toast, a touch of coffee, and, as Trappist Ales Rule pointed out, a nice amount blackberry jam. A really nice mouthfeel and wonderful balance made this a delightful treat.

Buckeye Beatnik Brown Ale;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Buckeye Brewing Company;This has a great head retention over a clear medium-dark brown body. There’s a big nuttiness in the aroma and flavor, backed up by a solid maltiness one would expect in a robust brown ale. Low hopping. Almost salty in the finish.

Flossmoor Station Framboise De Flossmoor;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Cask at the RAF 2003: Clear dark pink. . . chocolately raspberries. Pretty good flavour for a juice, or kool-aid, but not a good flavour for beer. . . something bad happened with this one.
Flossmoor Station Framboise De Flossmoor;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Sorry Todd, I have to admit that I, too, didn't like the Framboise. Vinegar thinned out with sugar water and blended with raspberry gummi worms.
Flossmoor Station Framboise De Flossmoor;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Unfortunate from a good brewery. I guess it didn't come out as planned. Stale nose with a fake fruity rubbery taste. Some raspberries I think in there.

Flossmoor Station Framboise De Flossmoor;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Garnet red in color. Raspberries and sweet malt in aroma. Alcohol evident with frutiness that takes center stage. Slightly thin and is in need of perhaps more malt to balance. Overall enjoyable to drink.
Flossmoor Station Framboise De Flossmoor;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap RAF: Sweet candy-like raspberry aroma erupts from the glowing red body. Body is smooth and well balanced with a semi-bitter finish. Nice beer characteristics for a fruit beer.
Moon River Apricot;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Moon River Brewing Company;Spicey, fruity nose. Tasted like gardenias and tangy spices. Very different...takes some getitng used to, but very good. Extremely floral in all facets of the experience. The description claimed to have used 200 pounds of fresh apricots.
Owens Golden Eagle Ale;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Owen O'Leary's;Had this in the sampler too, I thought it was way too hoppy and too similar to the red and the ipa. I’d like to think I can tell the difference in styles but they pretty much all blur the line.
Owens Golden Eagle Ale;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Owen O'Leary's;On-tap at the Natick location. Part of a sampler, trying to do my part and explain the differences in beer styles to my woman. Probably a typical and obvious offering to attempt to convert a drinker of A-B products. Hoppy though.
Owens Golden Eagle Ale;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Owen O'Leary's;Draught pint at Owen O’Learys 4/24/06. Pours a bright golden color with a white fluffy head. Nice lacing throughout the glass. Nose is lightly hoppy with some grainy malt tones. Flavor has some light malty flavors nad had more of the hop presence throughout. Hops were very prevelant and controlled the beer.
Owens Golden Eagle Ale;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Owen O'Leary's;On draught at the Framingham/Southboro location, 5/6/2005. Pale-gold, small, rapidly dissipating white head. Aroma of light grass and hay, some grain husks. Flavor is very watery, with a fleeting malt sweetness, low bittering hops, mainly just a hint of grassiness. Finish is just chalk full of soapiness. Once you note the soap, the beer becomes very difficult to finish, as the soap really stands out. Light body, mostly attenuated, lively carbonation. 3/2/3/1/6 Rerate. Wow, this is pretty much a completely new beer. Much more malt body, gives a firmer texture on the palate, and while the carbonation is still too heavy, there is NO soap! Hops are aromatic, of light lemon and herbs, with low bitterness in the flavor. Some minor fruitiness gets swallowed up early, and there is a touch of light honey, with plenty of barley flavor on the end as well. The head was retained throughout the entire pint and even left large lacing. Score is for this version.
Owens Golden Eagle Ale;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Owen O'Leary's;Has a light golden color and a lightly hopped smell. Taste was pretty watery and very Budweiserish. Overall I did not like this beer too much, in fact most of the beers I tried from this place did not sit well with me.
Owens Amber Ale;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Owen O'Leary's;Has a nice amber color and a hopped smell. Taste was again watery malts, but then finished with a nice hop flavor and was more bitter than the their IPA... Overall this was one of the better offerings from this brewery, but still nothing spectacular.
Owens Irish Stout;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Owen O'Leary's;Pours a black from a tap, slightly off-white head. Aroma was nice and roasty malts, maybe a slight hint of smoke, flavor was thin and lactic like a watered down milk stout. Meh.
Owens Irish Stout;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Owen O'Leary's;On draft at Southborough location (Natick location no longer exists). Definitely not as good as their IPA but an OK stout for the style and better than I remember them serving at the old Natick location.
Owens Irish Stout;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Owen O'Leary's;On tap at the Framingham location. Beer pours black/very dark brown. Head is a mocha brown, relatively non-standard for Irish style stouts. Good lacing, which surprised me a bit considering the beer isn’t nitrogenated. The selling point for this beer is its flavor, which has tons of coffee and a bit of smoke mid-palate, finishing with a silkiness and a lingering tart flavor that I assume comes from the rather mild dose of hops. It is a smooth, thin, clean, and rather well-carbonated stout that stands up well on its own, and is divine when mixed with the O’Leary’s IPA in a Black and Tan (even if the stout doesn’t layer well). Wonderful brew that I’m sure I will enjoy again and again.
Owens Irish Stout;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Owen O'Leary's;Got this on tap and found it to be a little undercarbonated but full of flavor. This is a typical stout but with a little less force.
Owens Irish Stout;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Owen O'Leary's;Has a very dark brown color with little carbonation and a roasted malt smell. Taste was again watery roasted malts and finished with a kind of sour bitterness. Overall I did not like this too much or much of the others from this brewery due to the watered down taste they have.
Owens Old Düsseldorf;Westborough, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Owen O'Leary's;Has a nice amber color with little carbonation and a malted smell. Taste, beleive it or not, was not watered down. It was nicely malted and finished very smooth. Overall this was the best beer I have tried from this brewery due to the fact that it did not seem to be watered down.
Rubicon Winter Wheat Wine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rubicon Brewing Company;Smells very strongly alcoholic. Tastes similarly strong, but it’s surprisingly easy to drink. Definitely one to have in small doses. On tap at the Rubicon brewpub.
Rubicon Winter Wheat Wine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rubicon Brewing Company;"looks like a typical bw, smells on the sweet side, with some wheat and cool malts in there as well. not very balanced, but quite tasty. the body is just great. thick and full without being cloying. flavor is a tiny bit hot, sweet, and complex, lots of different sweets here. good stuff. i’d buy in a bottle."""
Rubicon Winter Wheat Wine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rubicon Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Aroma is malty, and gives up some of the high abv. Flavour is so much more floral and fruity. Even burps up fruity! One of the best barley wines I’ve had. Palate is verydry which keeps you wanting to drink more! Best Rubicon beer I’ve had!
Rubicon Winter Wheat Wine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rubicon Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub.

Rubicon Winter Wheat Wine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rubicon Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. This one pours a very rich reddish amber color with a very thin off white head. The aroma is sweet with cherry syrup, oranges, caramel. The flavor is similar with some floral hops and mostly syrupy sweet dark fruit. The alcohol is definitely noticeable. This lacks the complexity of a barley wine.
Rubicon Winter Wheat Wine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rubicon Brewing Company;(Draught) Pours a clear deep amber body with a medium off-white head. Aroma of bread, orange, caramel, and florals. Flavor of orange, cherry, bread, caramel, dough. and toffee.
Rubicon Winter Wheat Wine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rubicon Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub on 8/7/10. Pours clear red/copper with a minimal head. Aroma of caramel (not just caramel malt, but caramel candy) and cherries. Sweet and syrupy flavor with cherry and caramel before a boozy finish. I was digging the sweetness in the nose, but the syrupy flavor kinda turned me off. Still not bad overall.
Rubicon Winter Wheat Wine;Sacramento, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rubicon Brewing Company;"Not an overly powerful aroma, malty and fruity. Dark copper color, tiny head that disapated quickly. Perfectly clear. Interesting flavors, very sweet.... malty and fruity. Strong strawberry taste, some cotton candy. I dont think these flavors were produced with wheat, barley, hops and yeast...... extract maybe? Couldnt tell there was wheat in it. Very syrupy in the mouth. Slight alcohol heat..... but it is 11-12%. Overall this was a very nice ""beer"". Totally unique. Reminded me of a dessert port."

Bison Organic IPA;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;This beer isn’t horrible and it isn’t great. Kinda in between. The aroma is actually nice, very typical of a west coast IPA. The flavor is there but goes away as it doesn’t leave much of an impression. Its alright.
Bison Organic IPA;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;"@ Party Toen / Florence KY - Cloudy medium amber with a 2"" frothy head, many bands and swirls of lace. Taste belies the IBU count - caramel malt begins things, adding butter rum and taking charge all the way through the palate before yielding to smooth, but definite, bittering near the back end of the finish. The hops are sufficient for an IPA, but arrive so late that it seems like this is some other style. Actually quite drinkable, and light on the stomach."
Bison Organic IPA;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;(bottle) amber/orange with whitehead. Floral/citrus hops. Flavor is citrus hops, some caramel malt.

Sarmat Zemlyak;Donetsk, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;"Probably the most popular pilsner brew from Sarmat, in Ukraine. I dont like this one, its pretty annoying to drink. A bright pilsner with a sharp blade is what it is. The broadness in its taste is irritating you somehow and you will quickly understand that this is not what you like to drink. Its made to get drunk by only. I dont like it at all, and are unhappy if im only left finding this in the ""stores"" when im in the east. Bad brew, unpleasant to drink. Crap. You must though understand that the beer brewers in Russia have the hardest possible time to attract market. They will do their best in making quality stuff as 1 litre of their cheapest but quite fine vodka costs as much as one half litre of this brew. They do their best in creating their beers. This one is their worst beer of all."

Sarmat Plzenske;Donetsk, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;A great name, a not so great beer. Golden with a frothy head. Watery with not much from anything.
Sarmat Plzenske;Donetsk, Ukraine;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Yellowish and thin. I'm wondering why they called it pilsner: I couldn't find here any hop aroma or taste. Even malt was uneven...

Durham Benedictus;Bowburn, Durham, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Durham Brewery;0,5 flaske importert av og delt med Ovesen ombord på Fridtjofen nest siste dag i juli: gylden med fint skum som varer. Lett aroma av gjæret plommesyltetøy. Smaken har en elegant bitterhet kombinert med plommer, svisker og annen tørket frukt. Meget god, men på ingen måte det jeg forbinder med en barley wine, til det er den for tørr. Minner mest om en kraftfull belgisk blondine. Alkoholen er holdt eksemplarisk godt skjult.
Free State Bubba's Best Brown Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Fairly thin and wheaty. Dark and sweet, reminded me of the time I tried sorghum. I must give this respect though, because I drank it half-flat and it was still more than decent. Fully flat would be pushing it though.
Free State Bubba's Best Brown Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Very faint aroma, some hop and malt is detectable, though. Chestnut brown in color, clear, with a lasting creamy head. Flavor is balanced between faintly astringent bitterness and bready, light, sweet brown malt with a hint of toffee. Malty, mostly dry finish. Good session ale.

Germinal Blonde;Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie des Sources (formerly: de St. Amand);Bottle conditioned. Opened with a bang, but beer remained stable in the bottle. Mostly bland and metallic lagerish beer with soft wheat notes. There are nice flavours and not so nice flavours, but on the whole the negative points dominate.
Germinal Blonde;Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie des Sources (formerly: de St. Amand);Light malt aroma, average hops contribution but sort of perfumey, citrus, and ? silly putty. Some musty yeasts, honey, and lactic aroma, too. Cloudy light amber, with a few small chunks, topped by decent foamy off-white lacing head. Light, thin body with soft carbonation. Light-medium sweetness and acidity to start, and light salty finish. Some light bitterness in the after. OK, but not a keeper.

Rail House Scottish Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Draft. Dark brown red pour. Aroma is pasties and spice. Flavor is fruity and spicy cinnamon roll fruity.
Rail House Scottish Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Draft flight 8/13/04-Pours a amberish brown with a small head. Aroma of caramel. Taste of the same with more caramel on the back end. This medium bodied brew is not bad but comes across more of an amber instead of a Scottish ale.
Rail House Scottish Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;A Scottish Ale must have a better profile than this. This beer is amber in color, quite pale to the standards. The aroma is mild at best. The flavor is even less so. Any Scotsman would disapprove.
Rail House Scottish Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Draft. Very dark brown with a thin off white head. Smoky aroma with some burnt caramel.

Rail House Scottish Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. The body was rusty, ruddy brown. The aroma was smoky and earthy.

Rail House Scottish Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Available on tap at the brewpub, this beer pours a clear dark amber brew with a light beige creamy head with good retention. Aroma has characteristics of caramel roasted malt, a touch of peat smoke, and some light toffee. Taste is lightly carbonated, with taste of smoked caramel malt and no bitterness. Finish is sweet, soft and creamy. I agree with one other posting, this is more of a Scotch-style than scottish ale.
Rail House Scottish Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the Rail House. Nice deep red/amber color, good thick off-white head. Rich malty nose, some caramel too. Flavor was nothing too impressive but still quite satisfying. More like a Scotch-style than a Scottish....malts dominated taste and nose. This was really a beautiful looking ale though. Sessionable.
Rail House Scottish Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Mothers milk? No, this is better, much better. The finest example of Scottish Ale as I’ve ever had. I have been back numerous times and this beer has never failed me. Enticing roasted coloring, Sensous chocolate/malty aroma, Full unfiltered scotch malt flavor with a perfect finish that leaves the tongue with a satisfying smack to the roof of the mouth.

Smells of citrus fruit: tangerine, grapefruit, with a hint of pine. Taste follows the nose, with a hoppy citrus taste of tangerine and grapefruit, with just a hint of pine and biscuity malt coming through. Medium body and carbonation. This is your typical citrus/pine Pale Ale and a very solid one at that. Nothing special, but perfectly nice and easy-drinking.

Short's Chocolate Wheat;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Porter;Short's Brewing Company;Kind of an odd one. Not really getting chocolate flavors... mostly just tastes like a wheat beer with roasty malt.
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle at home. Smells some what fruity Light white head. Light yellow with bubbles of carbonation. Really can taste the peppercorns. Smooth. Different and above average for the style. Cheers!
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a cloudy bright yellow color with a medium sized soapy white head that left minimal lacing. The aroma was tangy, sweet and fruity with a black pepper note. The flavor was dominated by strong black pepper followed by faint vague fruits and cracker. Long pepper finish. Medium body. Meh.
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle labled as just ""Nicie"". The beer is a clear yellow with a white head of foam. Good head retention. The aroma has notes of moderate skunky notes with hints of peppercorn, dried grass, and orange peel. A bit of pith. Taste has dry, floral aspects. Fairly bitter. Medium body and medium to high carbonation."
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Nicie. Pale yellow-tan body. Not much of ahead, looks like a soda. Medium bodied, thin, mild. Kind an undesirable play on an undesirable style. The peppercorns don’t add much, I mostly get coriander and orange peel. Bland malt tones, not a lot going on. Unimpressive.
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;My bottle does not say spicie, just nicie. Has the by line, tho. $2 @ vintage. Hay yellow color. Smells a tad metallic. Very good soda water like carbonation, zesty. Actually, this comes across like a highly carbonated wheat ale. Becomes a little medicinal in the middle. In the end it finishes a little better than many bitter wheat ales.
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;Backlog entry: This beer doesn’t stick out in any particular way. Alighted with style, somewhat different with the spice.
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;Bottle pour light gold with moderate white head that rapidly dissipate. Nose coriander, lemon peel, peppercorns, spruce. Taste very spicy up front almost like cleaner. Peppercorns, lemon, and fruity wheat.
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;"Citrus aromas are present though not as prominent as you might think from the added lemon and orange zest. Coriander and pepper are clear though again not overwhelming. Not much malt, just a touch of biscuit. Color is a pale yellow with a fairly good-sized white head. Taste is peppery, with light to medium bitterness and fairly dry sweetness. The palate is light bodied, just a bit thin, perhaps just slightly lively carbonation and a long finish that starts with just a light hint of sweetness and then goes into a long peppery finish. Overall while it is not might favorite style, it’s not bad. The lemon/orange zest is restrained; the pepper and coriander start slow but come more to the fore and stay there as you continue to drink. Interesting."
Short's Nicie Spicie;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;Aroma spices/black peppercorns and wheat. The flavor is orange zest, mild coriander, wheat and a citrus/spicy finish.

Dix Scotch Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dix BBQ & Brewery;"Nice, firm but on the lighter voluminious side. On tap at the brewpub, where cowboys speak with an ""eh?"""
Dix Scotch Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Deep orange-brown beer, thin white head. Caramel malt aroma faint cherry aroma with a touch of toast. Thin body. Flavour is semi-sweet up front, thin through the middle, fairly tart finish. No peat, no chewy malts, WTF? Doesn’t really do it for me.
Dix Scotch Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Golden-brown colour. Lightly malty, with hints of toffee in the aroma. Slightly tart, but otherwise a light, clean, vaguely toffeeish affair. Faint cracker note in the finish.

Dix Honey Brown;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Easy brown look with small head and an aroma of honey roast, but wet sock as well. Caramel and honey roast flavor, but rather dank and musty at the same time.
Dix Honey Brown;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Last rating was in 2003 and it’s been that long since a Honey Brown has appeared on the Dix menu. It sucked then but it’s been completely revamped now. Hazy amber-brown colour. Light crackerlike aroma. Toasty, lightly toffeeish malt character. Hints of chocolate. I’d say it pretty much picks up where the last Big Ridge Honey Brown left off and travels further towards the brown ale style. Not bad...I’ll be back over the long weekend to take a closer look at this.

Founders Coffee Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On nitro tap at the brewpub. 5.0% ABV. I was wondering if this was the same beer as Breakfast Stout when I first saw the listing on this site, but Coffee Stout is lighter with much lower ABV and is served on nitro tap rather than being naturally carbonated. I really enjoyed this stout- even though it was served a bit cold the roasted coffee and malt created a pleasant aroma. Flavor was packed with dry roasted coffee beans and nice roasted malt, creating a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Bitter aftertaste. Surprisingly tasty for a beer with nitrogen carbonation and a nice complement to their Breakfast Stout.
Founders Coffee Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at brewery, Nice dark brown with medium fluffy brown head, aroma of fresh brewed coffee, nice roasted malt taste with espresso, and a pleasant finish, very nice.
Founders Vanilla Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);another innovative brew. Nice hints of vanilla to balance out the roasted malts. Great with a steak.
Founders Vanilla Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On nitro tap at the brewpub. 5.0% ABV. Poured dark brown with a classic nitro head (thick, creamy, light tan). Served too cold to detect much of an aroma, but notes of vanilla and light roast were apparent. The vanilla works well in the flavor- I did not find it overpowering, and it added a sweet note to the dry roasted malt character. Thin-bodied but creamy. Certainly not the most complex offering but enjoyable nonetheless.
Founders Vanilla Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap: served way too cold. Nitrous tap didn't do much either. I thought the flavor was fairly dull, not much going on as far as complexity is concerned. Vanilla was not very apparent. I was expecting something sweeter.
Founders Vanilla Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);A nice dark brown with a good sized head, aroma was of roasted malt and vanilla extract. flavor was overcome by the vanilla, and not in a good way, way too much vanilla, made this sickenly sweet for my taste.

Bière La Gazelle;Dakar, Senegal;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Société des Brasseries de l'Ouest Africain - SOBOA;Lager en format 50 cl, avec du maïs, dans le style north american light ... Mon exemplaire était récent, et venu d'Afrique sans passer par les USA. Bouteille verdâtre mais ceci ne pose aucun problème avec un produit industriel, dont la production relève de SOBOA à Dakar. Le maïs me fait penser à des pop corn. La bière elle-même par contre n'est pas très pop … assez corn … et pas du tout rock'n'roll !! La gazelle sautait allègrement par-dessus ce liquide jaunâtre, sur un air rock'n'roll de Stormwind (album de 2001), et s'en allait en rêvant dans le vent du soir ..

DuClaw Old Flame;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Old Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A: Pours a mostly clear copper color. The head sucks - not even a finger high (eggshell shade) and crap retention. No real lacing, either. Frankly, this isn’t much to look at. S: Wow, this seems pretty treacly to me. Brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and vanilla comprises most of the aroma. Some musty mineral water detracts harshly at first, but thankfully seems to calm down some. In its stead, it’s replaced with some fruity esters. The more it warms up, the more estery it becomes. I still think it’s too sweet, but there is some promise within the aroma. T: It starts decently enough: fruit esters hit the palate first. It kind of goes to crap afterwards. Why? Because it finishes with a one-two ’combination’ of must and plastic. It’s not something that works - rather, it’s something that makes me go ""why is this in my beer?!"" There are some faint rumblings of brown sugar and molasses on the finish, too. Take away the off notes, and this would be an okay sweet beer. M: It’s a weird mix of sweet and astringent on the tongue, and it doesn’t mesh well. My tongue is left both overly dried out and overly coated in residual sugar. Add in low carbonation, and this beer doesn’t just taste messy, it FEELS messy. O: Every once in a while, DuClaw will surprise me quite a bit - X-1, for instance. All this does, however, is remind me exactly why I don’t buy 6 packs from these guys. If these guys put as much effort into the main line as they do on their limited stuff...well, let’s just say I’d be doing a lot more local drinking. Wait, it reminds me of another thing to say. I HATE CRYSTAL MALT! This tastes like it’s freakin’ loaded with the stuff. Both are good enough reasons for me to never need to drink this again."
DuClaw Old Flame;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Old Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Drank from the bottle, a gift from a friend. Good solid, olde English style. Has a strong overpowering smokey flavor. DuClaw has better beverages out there.
DuClaw Old Flame;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Old Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy brown with a medium beige head. Aroma is sweet caramel malt, toffee, grains with mild fruity notes. Taste same as aroma with some mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body. moderate carbonation. Finish is caramel malt, grains, some mild toffee notes and fruity with some bitterness on the end foe balance. This brew seems a bit lacking for an old ale. Overall it still not too bad, a good brew.
DuClaw Old Flame;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Old Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;Appearance: dark amber, with a short, thin beige head. Aroma: blast of caramel malts, molasses, some nuts, and booze. Taste: burnt sugar (not in a good way), molasses, caramel, astringent alcohol. Finish: overly burny booze, lingering sweet malts. Notes: Not as good as I’d hoped. Overly burnt and boozy for such a relatively low alcohol content. Low rating could partially be blamed on palate fatigue (Beer, Bourbon, BBQ Fest, Timonium, MD, 2014).
DuClaw Old Flame;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Old Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;"Pours deep mahogany brown with little head. The aroma is like apple butter; fruity and spicy, with some caramel malt. Sweet, rich flavor. Strong in the finish. A lot carbonation in the body. This was pretty good."

New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;On tap at New Albanian, pours a cloudy amber orange with a medium beige head. Aroma brings out lots of resinous hops upfront, followed by caramel bready malt and some sticky toffee. Flavour is along the same lines, with resinous hops galore upfront, and a big caramel bready malt backbone. Excellent interplay between the hops and malt. Chewy and balanced. Really good.
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;Tap. Pours clear reddish orange, small beige head, good residual and lacing. Aroma is piney hops, caramel. Flavor is medium sweet, full bitter, pine, floral and perfume hops, caramel malt. Medium body, some acidity. Lingering bitterness. Meh
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;Comes out of the bottle slightly hazy dark amber with a thick and fine-bubbled buff head. Aroma has malty and fruity components with a snip of hops. Flavor has strong malty and hoppy components with fruity and cloves hints. Mouthfeel has decent viscosity and fizz, and finishes mainly spicy wood. A good elector indeed.
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft/growler from the brewery. Not sure what they’re going for here, but it’s good. A darker amber beer, almost brown, this has a sturdy palate. Nice hoppy flourish in there, but an almost brown ale, malty base. Good on a cool night. (#5880, 12/3/2014)
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;Bomber thanks to Ray. Nose is very piney, earthy, very pungent, strong hop aroma. some honey malt sweetness and caramel in the nose too. Taste is slightly thin, watery and flat initially. Seems like a watered down barleywine honestly. could benefit from more malt backbone and carbonation.
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;Poured from a bomber into a snifter glass cloudy amber with a thin head. Aroma is fruity malty very subtle hops. Flavor is overly bready sweet caramel with a bitter finish. Can’t place what is off for me with this brew. It doesn’t seem balanced from start to finish. Slightly below the average imperial red-disappointed.
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;"Aroma: Malty nuttiness with caramel; a touch of mild citrus. Appearance: Copper red with a patch of bone head. Flavor: A little more butterscotch than caramel; citrus presence builds toward the finish, but can only be described as ""light"" at best. Palate: Medium body, tacky texture, soft carbonation, long finish. Overall: Rather shocked I hadn’t rated this, but maybe it’s been that long. A maltier imperial amber that’s pretty clean, but not too exciting."
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;I am an ale enthusiast. You cannot taste any alcohol sweetness at all. Malty offering with complexity and depth. An absolute treat!
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;Woody, toasty, toffee, nicely bittered. European style bomber, bad label. Aroma is actually a little muted. Dryish, the bitterness really hits you on the back and sides of the tongue. Medium body, long woody finish with some grass and raisin. Not quite what I expected, but decent. New Leaf Market.
New Albanian Elector Ale;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;New Albanian Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: Toasted bread and caramel wade in lax residual sugars, as peppery hop bitterness balances out. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam shrouds the cloudy red. -Fruity touches are also felt. -I have no idea if this bottle was close to being fresh as there is no date on it anywhere. -The hop character is rather muddled. -This is on the sweet side for my tastes in the style. Bottle.
Bonfire Raging Inferno Barley Wine;Northville, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bonfire Bistro and Brewery;MBG Winter ’06. Murky dark copper, minimal head. Nice dark fruits up front, but not much else. Flavor has a strange fruity sourness, almost no malt to speak of, thins out in the finish. Strange take on a BW.

Bonfire Raging Inferno Barley Wine;Northville, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bonfire Bistro and Brewery;Not a whole lot to smell. I put my nose right down into the glass,too. The taste was overpowered by the alcohol and there was an odd maraschino cherry aftertaste.

BJ's Poltergeist;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;This was less than impressive.

Wickwar Olde Merryford;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;I haven’t seen this beer in a long time and there is no reference to it on the Wickwar website, so I suspect it may be retired.

Redruth Blacksmiths Bitter;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Redruth;Can. Copper colour, no head and low condition. After a day at work my trousers smell more like beer than this swill. Slight cranberry juice flavour in the mouth, but that is way too expensive to be an additive (23p per can). Truly a waste of malt and hops, regardless of how little of each they used.
Redruth Blacksmiths Bitter;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Redruth;Redruth is an ancient Cornish brewery that is now under the control of a Hong Kong company that seems to care little for quality. This is a cheap and nasty canned product available in supermarkets. Attractively coloured rusty water. And again... I bought a four pack of this (or was it six?) - I've tried various ways of drinking it - including mixing it with some of my strong home brew. Yesterday I was looking for something light to wash down my meal, and this served quite well.
Le Cheval Blanc Doppelbock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;Luscious toffee and juicy cherries are defocused by a babel of slightly metallic carbonation which quickly benumbs pleasure...Earthy hops and fresh cereal redeem the moment but those furious gas jets are still a bit overexuberant...

Crystall Beer;Roma, Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);During my stay in Desenzano, Italy I drank quite a few of these. This beer poured a pale yellow. The aroma was a little too perfumey for my liking and the taste was a typical low quality European lager skunky taste. This is a beer you drink just to drink - not for the taste. The more of them you have the better they start to taste!

Threlfalls Blue Label Lager;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cains;Can. Watery pale straw, little head. Barely anything decent to taste, awful, bland and weak.
Threlfalls Blue Label Lager;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cains;"Can. Straw gold almost nonexistent head and low condition. Faintly fruity aroma, stale old hop taste and a slightly oily mouthfeel. What is the point? Its too strong to be classed as non alcoholic, too weak and bland to be of interest to anyone, its only redeeming feature is that it is cheaper than bottled water. 89 pence for 4x440ml cans. The fact that Cains have admitted to ""brewing"" this amazes me."
Threlfalls Blue Label Lager;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cains;Threlfalls was a Manchester brewery which was bought out by Whitbread in 1978. Robert Cain who now brew this lager were bought out by Bodingtons in 1985. When Whitbread took over Boddingtons the Cain brewery was closed down. In 1991 the brewery was acquired by The Danish Brewery Group, along with the rights to the Threlfalls and Robert Cain names. More recently, the Midlands based drinks company, Gardner-Shaw, has taken over Cains. All of which leads to some slightly stained water in a can. Was it worth the effort?
Leroy Stout;Boezinge, Belgium;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Leroy;Copenhagen 12/10 2019. 33 cl bottle from Meny, Vermlandsgade, Kbh. S. Simple brown label stating the name of beer and Brewery. 2Stout” in miniscule letters in the background. Pours clear dark brown with a medium-sized light beige head. Bubbly. Settles as thin, almost transparent layer of foam struggling to cover the surface of the beer. No Lacing. Aroma is medium-intense, sweet and with hints of humid basement. Caramel, brown sugar, butter, metal. Some light yeasty odor of basement lurking in the background. Light carbonation. Thin, oily, texture. Flavor has a strong, sugary sweetness. Faint bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and sugary. Lingers for a while. A bit too sweet for my taste buds. Kind of goes with the style.
Leroy Stout;Boezinge, Belgium;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Leroy;Vraiment horrible. La mousse ne tient pas. Le gout est vraiment horriblement sucré. Comme dit sur un autre avis, ca se rapproche nettement plus d'un coca que d'une bière et pour une stout à part la couleur... La liste des ingrédients n'est pas sur l'etiquette et je les soupconne même de rajouter du dextrose ou autre sucre pas cher. Le seul point positif c'est que mon 7eme brassin perso, une stout est bieeeeeeeen meilleur que cette bière là.

Leroy Stout;Boezinge, Belgium;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Leroy;"dd-mm-2019; bottle; at home (bought at an unknown location). The looks of the beer are alright. Big negative feature: the beer foams like crazy. After pouring only a small amount of beer, the glas almost overflows with foam. The light brown foam is frothy and rough and collapses quickly. The beer itself is dark brown with a coppery red glow. The beer is seemingly crystal clear. The beer is a bit lighter than most Stout beers. The aroma of the beer isn't that good. There are some simple malts, giving not much aroma. There seems to be candy sugar or some additional sweeteners, that are little aromatic. No roast, no chocolate, no toast, no coffee. Hops bring a slight herbal note. There is mainly sweet bread malts. Not a Stout in any way. The taste is unbalanced. Waaaay too sweet. The sweetness is also quite boring; seems just like sugar water. Hops are bitter, but the balance is off towards the sweet side. Bleh. The palate of the beer is also bad. Slick beer, medium body and medium carbonation. The finish has sugar water with some bitterness. This beer has nothing good to offer besides the looks. Threw it down the drain."

Barrington Steam;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Barrington MA, on 20 April 2010. Labelled as Stockbridge Steam but I guess this is the same stuff. ABV not stated but OG 1051. Clear amber colour. Good carbonation level - lively but not too fizzy. Not much aroma. Clean and refreshing. Dry and slightly hoppy on the palate. Hit the spot fine - a decent example of the style.
Barrington Steam;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bomber. Pours amber with a pinkish white head. Smells of caramel with some fruity character. Tastes sweet and peppery with some nice fruity hints on the finish. Enjoyable like all their beers.
Barrington Steam;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;22 oz. bottle. Clear amber, small white head. Light fruity aroma, some grain and honey as well. Medium body, very lightly carbonated. Caramel sweetness with little character, some mildly astringent bitterness that results in a fairly dry finish, although some sweetness still comes through as a slight stickiness. To me, thisis basically non-descript and lacking in character.
Barrington Steam;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;"Bottle: Good nose, I get a nutty, citrusy, doughy aroma. Peanut, lemon/lime, sourdough. Clear orange color. Just a minute amount of haze. Sweet and bitter flavors, peanut butter, lite metallic, lemon. Thin and tart, finishes fairly clean. Interesting, not like other ""steam"" beers I've had. I don't like the flavor combination."
Barrington Steam;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;22 oz bottle. Cloudy medium brown, medium long-lasting foamy off-white head. Sweetish nose of corn, grass, light floral hops. Flavor moderately malty, largely dry, somewhat bready, clean longish finish with light hoppiness. I'm finding it hard to say a lot, good or bad, on this one, but overall it's tasty and drinkable, probably as good as the standard (Anchor Steam) for the style, and another quality addition to this under-known brewery's lineup.
Barrington Steam;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Has a light golden color with a sweet smell. Taste is light and slightly sweet, finishes with little bitterness. Overall I have never had a 'steam' beer before so I cannot compare it to others of the style, but it was a light too light for me.
Barrington Steam;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;A very good steam beer. Cloudy and dark tan in color. A bit of hops in the nose. An underlying sweetness that didn't seem to come from the malts behind the hops. Enjoyable!
Kirin Ichiban Maribana;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Draught at Hotel Okuyumoto, Hakone. Clear golden – white head. Light metallic, grainy, hay,straw, light hoppy → pleasant hoppy, dryness, freshness. Plain.

Kirin Ichiban Maribana;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Clear golden color with a huge white rocky head. Mildly sweet aroma with what must be the ""Maribana"" hops. A watery texture, rather weak taste but very smooth. I'd thought this would be better but it's rather bland. Not nasty mind you, just very plain."
Kirin Ichiban Maribana;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Hard to find as it is a limited specialty brew and is now being cleared off the shelves in Japan at cut rate prices to make room for more ""Seasonals"". Clear yellow, good head, not displeasing aroma. Flowery hop character is more evident in this version than from what I recall of the normal Ichiban brew. Perhaps a step above the standard Japanese lager, some nice cereal maltiness is detectable but nothing too assertive. I enjoy Kirin’s brews more than most of the other Japanese brews but it is hard to understand why such large breweries do not take more chances to try to produce more radical departures form the norm as they have the resources and expertise to do it."

Buckeye Ho Ho Ho Triple;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Tripel;Buckeye Brewing Company;On Tap @ Buckeye: Lasting white head on a hazy, fizzy golden body. Laces well. Bready & toasty malts, and a flowery, perfumey hop. Clovey, banana and raisiny grape aroma. Some sugary sweetness and corn aromas as well. Well balanced, a little on the sweet side though. Lightly bitter in the finish an especially the aftertaste w/ some toasty and cereal malt flavors and sugary sweetness. Some moderate plum fruitiness and a light alcohol flavor as well. Medium carbonation, full, smooth body, but well hidden alcohol. Pretty decent beer, but I still prefer the Dubbel.
Buckeye Ho Ho Ho Triple;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Tripel;Buckeye Brewing Company;I had this a while ago, so I'm going on memory. Crystal clear yellowish color, white fluffy head. Aroma was pure belgian, strong in the candi sugar. Flavor was good, but by the end of the snifter is was too sweet for me. Alcohol was pretty obvious throughout the flavor.
Buckeye Ho Ho Ho Triple;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Tripel;Buckeye Brewing Company;One of the most solid triples out of the U.S. that I have sampled. Liquid gold.
Buckeye Ho Ho Ho Triple;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Tripel;Buckeye Brewing Company;From cask at the brewpub 2/21/03. Deep gold, large fluffy head present til the end. First couple of sips were apricot and sugar. Then it settled in to total melon mania - honeydew and cantaloupe. The finish was full of spice and some hops - stuck to my tongue for a long time. (apparently the cask they took to the RAF didn't hold up as well as the one they kept at the pub)
Buckeye Ho Ho Ho Triple;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Tripel;Buckeye Brewing Company;Stinky. I couldn't put my finger on the aroma and my nose wanted no part of studying harder. Vineous, with fuzzy peach skin added to give it a peach wine flavor. Very evident 10%abv!!!
Buckeye Ho Ho Ho Triple;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Tripel;Buckeye Brewing Company;Cask at RAF '03. A surprise triple. Not like the Tincture. More wine like in approach and flavor. Settles into a medicinal flavor, almost like a synthetic basketball. Other notes of apricot and tangerine present.
John Harvards Kirley Qs IPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"Draft at Manchester, CT location. The description of this was ""This unfiltered, amber-colored IPA is medium in body and has a citrus hop flavor and aroma. 5.8%ABV. Pale and Crystal Malts with Centennial and Cascade Hops""...Pint. Piney, sweetish aroma with a grapefruit presence. The aroma is unfortunately rather faint. Moderately hazy/hazy amber color with a frothy yellowish off-white head and badass lacing. Absolutely gorgeous! Light piney grapefruity start with mild hop bitterness. This is backed up by a ton of maltiness. Lots of cereal and cardboardy chewiness in the middle. Subdued grapefruity hop flavors to finish. This is a nice session IPA that won’t kill your tastebuds with hops."

John Harvards Kirley Qs IPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Manchester, CT. Cask conditioned hand pulled. Damn this is great. The beer arrives looking very very dark amber, with a tight creamy hand pulled head, interspersed with some larger bubbles. Just the way I like it. Aroma is mild, with a pleasant understated hop aroma, mild malts, and a touch of fruitiness. Flavor is big and hoppy, with a strong malty backbone to carry the bitterness. Hoppy, but well balanced. Full bodied, with that cask temperature and smoothness I've come to know and love. I wish all beer was cask conditioned, because it would be so tasty that way.
John Harvards Kirley Qs IPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Framingham, MA - Has a nice amber color and a hop smell. Taste is of the hops and finishes with the typical hop bitterness. Overall it is a good IPA, but nothing special.

Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;Draft at the mountain view location. Amber pour, and some white head. Aroma is sweet caramel malt, small amount of bready / biscuit malt. Tasted very standard, but just too sweet in my opinion.
Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;16 ounce sample on tap at the San Jose location. Aroma is quite malty, caramelly with some mild fruitiness. There is also a touch of buttery diacetyl and light metal. Ringwood? Transparent orange-amber body with a small off-yellow head with light lacing present. Slightly astringent start, which becomes quite malty, burnt, and toasty. A little buttery diacetyl is also in there. A light, herbal hoppy bitterness is present in the finish. Pretty boring, and a bit flawed.
Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;Draught. Pours dark amber with a small white head. Aroma is caramel malt, citrus hops, and apple. Flavor is the same, plus a bit of roasted malt. Moderately hopped, with an odd apple maltiness and butteriness that seems like a flaw, although it’s more prominent on some occasions that I’ve had this beer than on others.
Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;(Sampler at the San Jose location) Face Off Red is a red-amber ale with a fleeting white head. The aroma is spicy and herbal, like an ESB. It is medium-light in body, pretty smooth, and perhaps a bit chalky. The flavor is well blended and balanced, with a decent bitterness.
Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;Outstanding amber here. Huge malty aroma and flavor. Tons and tons of roasted malt, very rich beer. Body is smooth and full, but not too heavy. Gorgeous red color. Why the heck is this beer only a 3??? Looks like the rest of the ratings are 7+ months old. Maybe this brew just needed some time to mellow out. Or maybe with the most recent batch they’ve finally got the recipe down. Because right now... it is SUPERB. One of the best ambers I’ve ever tasted.
Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;"Draft at the San Jose brewery. Looks ok; medium ruddy amber with a suggestion of head for a minute. None of their beers really holds a head. At first, this beer seemed sour; there was soap and aluminum in there and it was disappointing. After a couple drinks, though, it started to stake out a bit of a flavor profile--more of a rye-like sourness and a moderately interesting herbal hop finish. Curious about their hop use, there’s never any classic citric bitterness or resinous overtone, and it’s always clingy. May have more to do with their ale/lager yeast alloy, smearing the flavor note there."
Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;aroma is weak. little cinnamon or maple syrup. smell is medium brown to orange color. flavor inital syrupiness but watery & bland. flavor has a bit of spice little corriander. and maybe a little pepper. peppered stout sounds good
Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;Damned nice for something brewed for a hocky arena! I drink more than my fair share of the Tied House Amber and Dark and was pleasantly surprised by this one. We thank the bar guys that poured it in case we needed to try it. It's very much in the family of the Amber and the Dark ales. A bit more hoppy with good if a bit lighter color. I'd still go for either of its cousins, depending (Amber for Pizza at Premier where it's on tap or Dark at the bar in San Jose.)
Tied House Face Off Red;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;Tap. Mahogany color with a tan head. Hoppy aroma with a fruity malt flavor but also kind of light on the palate.

Appalachian Abbey Roade;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Keg at Appalachian, Collegeville, 29/11/13. Dark mahogony brown with a good sized tan covering that retains well. Nose is dark fruits, sugars, toffee, light spice. Taste comprises dark fruits, straw, brown sugars, light spice, dates. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, dry closure. So so, lacks any great character and depth.
Appalachian Abbey Roade;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);"Despite the fact that one of the great attributes of Belgian beers is that they cannot be contained by style guidelines, I discourage anyone from thinking of this as a dubbel. I’ve heard that there’s been some discussion by the BJCP to distinguish between Belgian abbey ales and American abbey ales, which would allow for better classification of this beer. Medium amber with off-white, evanescent head. Smell is spice, yeast, mild light fruitiness (plum). Rather light in flavor and mouthfeel; spice is dominant with slight cherry and plum underneath. Tasty session beer."
Appalachian Abbey Roade;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at the brewpub. Pours a lightly hazy ruby with a medium beige head.

Appalachian Abbey Roade;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);"Cloudy, dark copper color, very little head. Scent of spices, with slight caramel malts. A bit thin, but flavorful, the spices also dominate the taste. Thin and smooth, adequately carbonated. Easy drinker; doesn’t really stand out among dubbels or ABC’s brews."

Carver Polar Beer;Durango, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Carver Brewing Company;Maple syrup and whiskey. Not as thick as one would expect, but some sticky sweetness in the taste. Had a vague medicinal nose that was off putting. While malty it did have a touch of light hops in the end.
Carver Polar Beer;Durango, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Carver Brewing Company;From the description, I didn't expect something so golden. The nose was smokey and sweet...an old pipe tobacco store smell. Maple syrup was the dominant force, as if they held this glass right up to the tapper on the tree. Alcohol seemed stronger than 6%, maybe due to the whisky barrel aging. Whew, I'd put this on my pancakes anyday!!!

Dragonmead Sir Williams ESB;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle. Cloudy reddish brown in color. Crazy amount of carbonation, so the glass was all tan head. Smells of yeast and fruit, with a hint of acid and vinegar. After the head goes down, it has moderate carbonation and a thin, watery body. Sweet and tart, plum-like flavor, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Okay, but I hoping for more.
Dragonmead Sir Williams ESB;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dragonmead Brewery;On cask. Aroma of mild tobacco, leather, and a touch of fermenting crab apples. Appears a hazy orange-brown with thick off white foam and beautiful lace. Palate is filling, creamy, soft. Overall, very good!
Dragonmead Sir Williams ESB;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dragonmead Brewery;Tap: metallic copper-y body with a solid brown overlay, mostly cloudy & topped with a light beige layer of foam that lasts for only a few moments. Aroma is pretty mild with notes of spicy hops, faint toffee, nuts, some polished wood, & an apparent mustiness. Taste is a little strange... Has the base of a brown ale with malty notes of caramel, nuts, toffee, & slight cocoa powder, but there’s a musty, almost wet cardboard note throughout. Not oxidation... just... cardboard-y in a very surreal way. Some zesty & lightly bitter hoppage throughout. The off-flavor was distracting. I’d like to try this again to see if that was just a fluke or what.

Dragonmead Sir Williams ESB;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dragonmead Brewery;bottle. Amber with small head. Fairly average ESB style, which is to say that it’s much better than the other Dragonmead brews I’ve had.

Lovely dark brown body, slight ruby hue to it, on top a smooth tanned blanket of foam. Malty little number all round really, not a lot happening in the hop department with the malty molasses taking complete control.

Nice foamy beige head. Malty aroma with a touch of citrus fruit. Crisp and woody, with a nice sandy dark malt sharp aftertaste.

Big Rock McNally's Reserve;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout - Dry;Big Rock Brewery;This is a bit thin for a stout, but the flavour is prettu spot on. Big rock yeast.... But very clean tasting. I’m not reaaly getting the pepper at all, its sort of a hint of something that could have been there but they made up for it with something else. Not bad but still missinv he bite.
Big Rock McNally's Reserve;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout - Dry;Big Rock Brewery;Pours black with an amazing head. Very nice aroma. Roasted malt and burnt coffee. Flavour is very nutty with strong roasted malt flavour. Bitter coffee in the very fresh, Slightly metalic chocolate and coffee ire present but not over powering. This is a damn rine stout. Dry drinkable and very well balanced this is excellent.
Big Rock McNally's Reserve;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout - Dry;Big Rock Brewery;Draft at the Tongue and Groove. Pours black, pale tan 2-finger head, great lacing. Nose is nutty and chocolatey, very dry, a suggestion of oats perhaps? Flavours are rich, with oats, cocoa, coffee, very thick and chewy.

Big Rock McNally's Reserve;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout - Dry;Big Rock Brewery;We headed out to see a film festival screening of Zack & Mimi Make A Porno, but it was sold out, so instead we hit the Hop-In Brewpub to have a pint. This was on tap. Pours a near-black brown with a creamy light brown head displaying excellent retention and decent lace. Low aromas of roast, chocolate, faint acidic fruit. Creamy smooth roasted malt, chocolate, and a lactic quality make up the palate, which is a tad on the thin side. Overall not a bad beer, but the lighter character had me thinking this was more of a London style porter.
Big Rock McNally's Reserve;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout - Dry;Big Rock Brewery;"Draught at Hop In Brew Pub, Calgary Black color, creamy head. In the beginning the aroma is creamy, with roasted malt; then it shows a light cheesy touch. The flavor has a more evident cheese touch, reminding me Casera (cheese from the central Alps, similar to tomme, but produced with semi-skimmed milk). The final is a bit weak. Not bad, but indeed peculiar."
Big Rock McNally's Reserve;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout - Dry;Big Rock Brewery;"Here’s a recipe for a new cocktail; 1 part water, 1 part Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, 1/4 part fig juice. I call it Big Rock Mcnally’s Reserve! Seriously though, it’s inoffensive but nothing great. That said, I still buy it at the pub, because I love Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, and it’s cheap cause I live in the city where it’s brewed. I also give it points ’cause it’s one of the only stouts I can drink when I’m super thirsty, cause it’s very smooth, like more smooth nitro than canned guinness. There’s nothing WRONG with this beer, but it doesn’t stand out. Drink it! It’s okay!"
Big Rock McNally's Reserve;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout - Dry;Big Rock Brewery;Dark brown colour. Light chocolate and some lactic acid in the nose. Nutty, lightlyl fruity body. Fairly bland. Yeah, not much going on. Which means they’ve hit the mark of imitating Guinness.
Big Rock McNally's Reserve;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout - Dry;Big Rock Brewery;, this Guiness clone was freshly available at Drop In in Calgary, where I had drinks with Presario. Stout style, coffee, pepper, with sour finish. Slightly better than the draft Guiness. Could not drink much

Southampton Double Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Southampton Publick House;This is part of a beer club. Had only one bottle but was decent for the price. Poured great and had a nice finish. Would do again.
Southampton Double Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Southampton Publick House;Very red appearance--I would have expected darker. Excellent soothing, slightly oily palate. An aroma like milk out of a plastic gallon jug that is just at the moment when it will go sour in the next twelve hours...yet as the beer warms it reveals a sticky toffee flavor that is more pleasing. The overall effect of the beer left me pleased but wishing for something that was missing. (on tap, d.b.a., Manhattan)
Southampton Double Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Southampton Publick House;Faint but potent bock aroma with some vanilla notes. Deep ruby brown. A little vegetable/nut, fruity flavor, woody, extremely well-balanced and not bock-metallic. Nice bite to the backend with long finish. Very good.
Southampton Double Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Southampton Publick House;This copper colored Double Bock poured with a thick foamy head, and long lasting lace. Very malty and upfront sweetness, fruity balance followed by a brief hop bitterness. Not as good as the German champions, but close.
Southampton Double Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Southampton Publick House;Draft: Sparkling brass color. Beautiful ring of well retained foam. Exciting aroma of concord grape, glazed malts, soft earthy hop traits, dark honey, leather, black cherry jam, and chocolate covered plum. Delicious flavors of molasses, concord grape, leather, spiced rum, and long spicy hop tinges. Lovely balanced finish with spicy hop undertones and candied malt. A very complex and rich example.
Southampton Double Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Southampton Publick House;Fairly malty double bock, but nothing striking about this beer. Dark amber color, lasting white foamy head. Mild in flavor.
Southampton Double Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Southampton Publick House;Comperable to the good German doppelbocks, but not quite as good as some. Copper appearance with a great-looking head. Caramel in the nose, as well as in the flavor. Slight hops in the long-term. Smooth finish. I would have liked a bit more maltiness, though - I likes my doppelbocks super malty.

Ruppaner Edel Pils;Konstanz, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ruppaner-Brauerei Gebrüder Ruppaner Konstanz;Bottle, thanks Quack-duck. Nice flowery hop aroma, Golden, lacing white head, a few floaties. Flowery hops on straw malt. Minerals, unfortunastely I get a little bit of metallic cabbage as well. Dry sparkly body, pleasant perfumed exit. A schame about the DMS, I hope I just have a odd bottle, otherwise a great aromatic pils.

Ruppaner Edel Pils;Konstanz, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ruppaner-Brauerei Gebrüder Ruppaner Konstanz;Bottle from Quack-Duck, vielen Dank! Yellow with a fluffy head of medium duration. Some straw maltiness in the aroma but above all this beer is full of the lovely, classic aroma of Tettnanger hops, combining grassy and herbal elements. There is also a faint soapiness but it doesn’t manage to blur the picture. Quite high carbonation, light body, bitter, hoppy, aromatic taste. Fast, refreshing, hoppy German pils suitable for the summer time but very enjoyable even during winter. Very good!
Ruppaner Edel Pils;Konstanz, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ruppaner-Brauerei Gebrüder Ruppaner Konstanz;Bottle looks simple but good. Beer in the glass zippy, nice head. Starts mild, modest dry, more spicy. Modest sweet. Finish with some soft-grasy notes, but still well balanced. Quite drinkable. Nice!
Ruppaner Edel Pils;Konstanz, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ruppaner-Brauerei Gebrüder Ruppaner Konstanz;"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and it’s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Ins Glas ergießt sich ein schön goldgelbes Pils mit mittelfeiner, schnell verschwindender Krone. Der Geruch ist hopfig herb, relativ schwach. Der Antrunk erfolgt angenehm hopfig herb, anfangs recht mild, dann zur Mitte wird die Herbe noch etwas intensiver. Das Finish wird dann etwas süßer. Gut abgestimmtes Pils!"
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;"Tasted from a 50 cl bottle in 2006. Typical top-fermented blonde thirst-quencher with creamy, sticky head and cloudy peach blonde colour; malt sweetish, bit fruity, sourish hint with a somewhat refreshing effect, finishing in a herbal Saaz hoppiness. Was nothing too special but certainly not bad in its style."
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottled (from thebelgianbeershop.com). BBE in 2007. Hazy golden colour with huge off-white head. Aroma is sweet malts along with yeast, some grassyness and also mild fruity and wooden notes. Flavour is quite much the same along with some herbal notes. Big yeasty and grassy finish.
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottled. A slightly hazy golden beer with a medium beige head. The aroma is sweet with strong notes of fruit and yeast, but also some dusty hoppy notes, the fruits are mainly peaches. The flavor is sweet with notes of fruit, prunes, and dusty hops, as well as some quite spicy elderberries, leading to a dry and quite dusty finish.
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Has that typical hearty characteristic, as usual, for the Belgian stuff...this one seems a bit smokey on the palate though. Maybe a little bitter and acidic too. Overall, nothing different and unusual than what I had been drinking a lot of at the time (transcribing from notes).
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Pours a hazy golden amber, topped by half an inch of white foam. Okay head retention and lacing. Fruity and slight malty and slightly flowery aroma. Sweetish beer up front with caramel, candi sugar, and some sort of fruit - maybe apricot. Then it is pretty dry and grainy with a bite from the carbonation. The hops are there for balance, but they keep a low profile - more floral than spicy or bitter. Fairly smooth beer, medium body with ample carbonation.
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;"The swing-top bottle is labelled ""11.2 oz"" but looks to be 500 ml, sure enough it turns out to be so as I pour it into my Chouffe tulip....a huge frothy white head ensues, abundantly lacing the glass atop the very heazy yeast-flecked golden body....the aroma is doughy-soft, yeasty-sour with noticeable hints of marzipan and sour cherry, lightly pungent and quite pleasant....body offers lots of sour fruits, a light and refreshing, moderate-to-high carbonation, honey and some faint herbal-grassy notes....nothing much in the way of Saaz hoppiness, but I found this pretty pleasant and enjoyable as a light, simple forget-about-it Belgian ale."
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottle from Super Saver. Hazy deep golden pour with 1-finger off-white head. Aroma of heavy citrus and hops, soem fruit, and some yeasty cobwebby funk notes. The flavor was citrusy, with a fruity malt presence, some lime, apricot, and even some cacao notes as it warmed.
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Pilsner hops and creamy fruit Belgium creamy yeast. Expires in one year. Yeasty malty aroma.

Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottle (Utobeer): BIg spicy estery nose with pepper, allspice, pineapple and lemon. Golden colour with a huge, fluffy head. It kept trying to creep out of the bottle! Body is a little thin. Sweetish fresh fruit notes, with a suprising almost tart grape mid. Spicy, bitter dry finish. Interesting, but not great.
Caulier Saaz;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottled best before 5/07. Pours a clear, light copper color with a huge frothy, white head. Malty aroma with yeasty notes of bananas and spice. This one is a bit strange to me. The flavor is rather thin. It’s spicy and astringent with a dry finish. Nice bitterness.

Kingston Framboise Royale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kingston Brewing Co.;On tap at the BP- This one was brought to me a hazy clouded golden white. (Is golden white a colour? My notes are getting sketchy at this point anyway) The nose shows off tahiti treat and watermelon juice with sweedish berries and a floral component that seems mis placed. The flavour is over the top sweet raspberry with no real fruit juice flavours, just artificial syrups. Tastes like really sweet soda and the finish is prickly. Wow, worse than the pils. Bleargh!

Taste is sweet up front, full of plum juice and beet root sweetness. Goes quickly sour though, with the balsamico dominating the end.

Queue de Charrue (Vieille) Brune / (Oud) Bruin;Ploegsteert, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Vanuxeem;Oud bruin, réalisée par Verhaeghe pour le compte de Vanuxeem (beershop, mais ancien brasseur, rappelons-le quand même), sur le modèle vraisemblable de la Duchesse de Bourgogne, mais un cran en-dessous sur le plan abv avec 5,4 % ici pour 6,2 à la Duchesse ..(mais n'est pas Duchesse qui veut !!). Ceci étant dit, mon exemplaire avait 2 mois de plus que sa date limite, et avait donc gagné vraisemblablement par l'âge ce que la noblesse lui avait retiré .. Brassage avec malts d'orge et de froment, garde en fûts de chêne durant 18 mois. Ce liquide de ma bouteille avait donc au minimum 3 ans et demi depuis son brassage .. c'est beau la bière dans ce cas de figure (on n'est pas pressé, comme pour les ipa que certains veulent boire dans les trois mois … oh misère d'un monde speedé !!). Couleur roux châtain foncé aux reflets auburn, et à la clarté nette, pure. Bulles très fines, en fontaine centrale, très vives et virevoltantes. Mousse brun tendre, très crémeuse, stable à 3 mm. Arômes de chêne, vin rouge, Rodenbach grand cru, pointe de fruits rouges et noirs. 1ère bouche très souple, à la magnifique entame vin/fût/fruits noirs/baies. Arrière-bouche très vineuse, remarquable. 2ème aux fantastiques nuances fruité/aigre doux. Arrière-bouche très fine, longue. 3ème sur un ensemble aux nuances très savantes. Arrière-bouche à la grande harmonie. Longueur qui peaufine toutes les nuances précédentes, avec un fruité très particulier, et du très beau chêne. Jambes fines, denses. Levure d'une belle ligne. Alcool très bien pour son niveau, il a gagné notoirement par le vieillissement de mon exemplaire. Finale souple, très douce. CONCLUSION : exceptionnelle bière, qui donne toutes ses lettres de noblesse (même sans être duchesse) au style de la oud bruin ...
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375ml can. Pours a clear golden honey wioth a rocky loose snow white head. Malt and grain aromas are basic as is the flavour that is quite crisp and clean. Average but okay for a low alcohol beer..
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);i think the contents is 99.9% water. the other .1% is a cheap beer strained throught an old sock.
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Oh this is bad stuff...........do they still make it? I had the misfortune of tasting it when it was released and never again....horrible, should be banned
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Some say they’d, ""rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy"", but this stuff will make them reconsider. Extremely pale, watery, insipid and weak."
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Pale yellow in colour with a thin white head. Thin bodied and highly carbonated. Watery and flavourless. Fizzy mouthfeel. Boring and Bland. Terrible.
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);canned. couldn’t be a whole lot worse - flavourless, very fizzy, yellow, some chemical nasties. dang
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Light straw body, poor head, sweet and boring, a little bit smoother and a little bit sweeter than the gold, lacing, vanilla malt, head lasted well. Hopefully they wont bring this across to W.A.
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Weird, dull, tinny colour with a clumpy head which formed a shape which looked like a crumpled up used condom - looks like they’re using chemical heading agents to me. Very little aroma, but there was a faint tomato sauce tinge to it. Very watery flavour with a hint of brown sugar and apples. No hop character at all. A bit fizzy and bloating. It’s no good, but it’s hardly offensive. Frankly I was expecting more (less?)
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Looks like a beer for 5 seconds then the head disintigrates. Tastes absolutely diabolical, really nasty. Needed a quick single straight to mid off to get away from 487. Nearly got run out.
Tooheys Blue Ice;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pathetic crappy light beer. I probably wouldn't even drink one of these again if I was given one for free.
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Having had Diamond before I can tell you that this is definitely more assertive though only by half an IBU or so. Very little aroma it just sits in the glass with very little character or development. Don’t waste your stomach capacity on this.
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Shockingly void of any real taste, especially for a Molson product. Hard to critique something so tasteless.
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I’m Joining the Club! Pours pale yellow, Sickley smell of sour corn, nice mouth feel light and crisp good body flavour of malt and corn. Not bad, but it has the typical shitty molson pale lager flavour that I have come to hate. Like i said. Nice body but thats it.
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Smells like it might have been made with some grain, though maybe thats just my expectations when it says beer on it. It’s almost yellow, but it’s really just golden clearness. Once the corn smell fades from the sip you just took gives you a hind of almost malt, alcohal and then watery fading so it’s smooth....??? pretty weak. The taste is almost as transparent as the beer. I can read FINE PRINT throught this one. It’s not offensive at all, but it’s not really good in any way either.
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Revisiting this Manitoba guzzel beer after a couple decades. Can sent from trade: There’s really not a lot to say about this beer as it is so indistinguishable from other macro adjunct lagers. Fizzy carbonation, pale yellow, weak heading, cardboard aroma, thin body, fast uneventful finish, annoying dextrose sweetness from extract brewing. Like all mass produced national brands, over priced for what you get.
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A-W-F-U-L. Club is one of those beers that has that strong metallic taste to it ... even when it comes from the bottle. Staw away from it!
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Wow. Piscator was quite harsh on this beer. I had one the other night at the Highlander Sportsplex, and have to admit it was quite undrinkable. I only bought it to rate it, so here goes...
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"And I thought Manitoba was the only place Molson dumped this crap? I guess it’s other places too (unfortunately). This beer is more of a joke in this province than anything else: they used to run some pretty bad commercials about how the beer was ""brewed for people like you"". The commercials are gone, but folks still remember them and laugh. Anyway, the beer is really bad: pale yellow, very fizzy, and lots of gross chemical and mild fruit aromas. The flavors are mostly sharp and grassy, but not in any sort of good way. It vaguely reminds me of those homebrew kits that consisted of a 1:1 ratio between malt extract and corn sugar. Yuck! I’m slightly embarrassed that I can check the ""I can get this beer today"" box."
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);unoffensive Molson product. Aroma is slightly grassy, light fruity notes. Pours straw yellow, head is half decent. Palate is thin. Weak overall flavour and finish. Not a good beer but I've had worse...
Molson Club Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ahh the elusive Club Ale is back up again. It's existance in southern Ontario is unknown. The only time I ever saw it was at the Molson store in Barrie where I bought a case of it awhile back. This to me is by far the only decent Molson product around, which isn't saying much to begin with. Slightly better then Molson Stock Ale. White head and a light golden colour like everything else.
Watch City Washingtons Private Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Watch City Brewing Co.;Cask: Pours a beautiful dark brown and almost opaque, with a thick tan head that sticks around to the end, leaving strong lace all the way down. Aroma is strong roasty malt, coffee, caramel, some chocolate, and some smokiness. Flavor starts with a roasty and sweet malt attack (mostly roasted coffee and caramel), middle gets some hints of chocolate, end is lingering bitter chocolate, and slight smokiness. Very full and lingering in the mouth.
Watch City Washingtons Private Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Watch City Brewing Co.;Cask version: Red-brown color with good lacing, sweet caramel aroma, full bodied, robust taste.
Aspen Meadow Red Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"RE-RATE Ya know, this isn't actually all that bad. It Is a tad light on the flavor, but not all that bad. Nice flavor actually, a bit of malts and maybe burnt carmel; I'm not quite sure, but it's pleasant. I've kinda gotten to like it. It pours with little head (still) but does leave some lacing. The last couple sixers I've enjoyed. Even the carbonation was better than the first sixer I rated. I like this much better than Killians Red, and it's comparable to Leiniekugel's Red, though this is an ALE and Leinie's is a lager. I'd recommend this for a try."
Power Plant ESB;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Decent enough amber color and a big caramel aroma. Rich malt and caramel flavors but zero bitterness. Another bust for the power plant.
Power Plant ESB;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;A great ESB. Very malty with minimal hop presence. The breadiness that Indra has mentioned comes through and stays the whole time. The mouthfeel is a tad on the thin side.
Power Plant ESB;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Fresh, fruity, pleasant hop aroma, with some light caramel, breadiness, cidery apple and pineapple. Darker amber in color, uneven head and slightly hazy with good lacing. More cidery fruity flavors, sweet grain, lightly spicy hop bitterness and some tea-like flavors. Light-medium body, palate on the watery side. Fruity hop aftertaste and sweetness. A little bit much in the way of cidery flavor and sweetness.
Power Plant Tripel;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Tripel;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub. First of all, the bartender called this a ""Belgian White"", but Indra’s description nails this beer to a ""T"", so unless someone can prove otherwise, I’m lumping my rating in with the Tripel. As stated by others, this is not cloudy, but crystal clear rich gold with a white head. Has a slight medicinal aroma. Floral at times. The flavor is sweet and malty. I get a bit of pineapple and plenty of coriander. Good lacing. It’s a pretty tasty beer."
Power Plant Tripel;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Tripel;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Yes, an appropriate glass would make this handsome trippel a higher score. Very sweet but not cloying and pear, apple and toffe notes dominate this brew. Nice.
Power Plant Tripel;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Tripel;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;First of all, served at a very cool temperature in standard shaker style pint glass. Definite points off for that. Lightly floral sweetness in the aroma, some white wine/grape, pear, peach and honey. Very slight head atop a clear, medium golden color. Sweetness and fruitiness factor into the flavor prominently as well, with some green apple and grape. Slightly alcoholic tinge and a lightly syrupy mouthfeel, a little cloying. Finishes with the fruity flavors of Welch's Harvest Blend™ juice, faintly flowery and malty.
McMenamins Bock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;"Had 8oz on tap (under the name ""Bock You Like A Hurricane"") at Dad Watson’s in Fremont, Seattle. The color was ruddy red-orange with slight clouding and a thin white small grained head that left almost no lacing. Smelled primarily of malts and a slight hint of citrus and spices. Taste was subdued sweetly malty, slightly hoppy, slight hints of fruit. The finish was stronger on alcohol than I expected."
McMenamins Bock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;(Draught) 4oz sample at Dad Watson’s Brewpub in Seattle. Deep reddish-orange body with a fully dissipated head. Spiced ginger and cider aroma. Flavour is hoppy, milky and strangely ginseng? Average at best.
McMenamins Bock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Clouded reddish amber appearance. Grainy mlat (animal feed) aroma. Sweet malty, burnt raisin scones, fruity palate, mild hop bitterness in the finish.
McMenamins Bock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Very opaque, deep ruby body with a perfect tight creamy head. Beautiful curtains of lace. Caramel malts and some berries and spices. fitting for a bock. Some mildy roasted notes in here too. Nice and earthy. Alcohol initially, then followed by a bounce from malts to spicy, earthy hop tones. Alcohol stands out a bit too much considering its only 6.2%

Clocktower Fenian Red;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Clocktower Brewpub;Pours deep dark reddish brown with a small white foam. Aroma is rich toffee and caramel with some light pine hops. Taste is a nice sweetness, caramel with a touch of toasted toffee. Beautiful. Then I am looking for a big hop bitterness and this is where it falls flat for me. The hops is subdued.
Clocktower Fenian Red;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Clocktower Brewpub;"Where Purchased: 473ml can from LCBO #310 part of the 12 Beers of Christmas 2017 . Consumed: from a draught glass. Aroma: Smells very malty with a follow up hop smell. Hops are quite subdued for 43 IBU's. Appearance : pours filtered deep red brown with thick head that lasts to the end with sticky lacing which sticks to the bottom of the glass. Taste: Slight sweet and lots of malts followed up by some bitterness. Palate: medium body. Medium to heavy bittersweet aftertaste. Low carbonation. Overall: very well balanced on the intake, but too heavy on hops on the finish. If it wasn't for the malts the hops would have made this beer almost undrinkable. I was glad to try and will probably buy again. MB. The Beer ""Bear""on."
Clocktower Fenian Red;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Clocktower Brewpub;Can: Poured an amber color ale with a medium size off-white foamy head with OK retention and limited lacing. Aroma of grainy malt notes with light caramel notes. Taste is a mix of dry grainy notes with some light dry caramel notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not very exciting.

Clocktower Fenian Red;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Clocktower Brewpub;Belle mousse brunante, sur un liquide relativement foncé et opaque, un peu de conifères en nez mais aussi une bonne dose de caramel. Bouche bien plus amère que prévu, ce qui est bienvenu étant donné l’extrême rondeurs des malts. De ce fait, les houblons laissent échapper des notes quasi tropicales qui jurent (avec succès) avec le noisetté. Avec bonheur, on se rend compte qu’il ne s’agit pas ici d’une autre ennuyante rousse irlandaise. Passablement réussie.
Clocktower Fenian Red;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Clocktower Brewpub;At the Bank st. brewpub location. Pint arrived with barely any head at all, most likely way it was poured from tap. Has a very dark colour, deep reddish look. Has a hoppy aroma for sure. Same can be said for the flavour, as the hops are fairly strong. A bit of a sweetness on the palate and a pretty good, smooth mouthfeel. Not too bad. As an update, had the Cask version. Much more hoppy when not carbonated. Barely any head leads to weak lacing. Has a dark amber appearance. Still nice and bitter, not as flat as you would expect. Slightly wet mouthfeel. Still pretty good.
Clocktower Fenian Red;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Clocktower Brewpub;Aroma: Smelling weakly of malts, coffee and soil. Appearance: A reddish brown clear ale, a warm off-white head, some lacing and curtains. Taste: Tasting of brown bread, caramel and grape-fruit peel. Palate: Little carbonation, soft texture, medium body, dry finish. Overall: More an american red to me, must be some C hops in it. Note: On-tap in Clarence Street Reviewed 2012-03-23.

Aromas are nuts, wood, and caramel. Tastes are coffee, semi-sweet chocolate,and roasty malt. Medium body, good carbonation, and a medium bitter finish. This beer may be a little on the robust side for a typical brown ale but I believe the rate-bee rians (rate-beerites?) have sold this beer a little short. ---Rated via Beer Buddy

J.T. Whitneys Imperial Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at JT Whitneys When I snifed the sampler glass, the first thing that sprang to mind was velvet cake. The dark black body was covered by a thin marbled head. My first impression upon taking a sip was of expresso, creamer and chocolate. It was a little chewy but still a little too thin. Smooth, dry subtly sweet finish. Overall it was good - one that I might have again next year.
J.T. Whitneys Imperial Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;"I should first mention that I’m not a huge fan of J.T. Whitney’s, except when it’s my birthday. As hezron mentioned tonight, I must be more susceptible on my birthday. In any case, I certainly enjoyed this stout. It’s not terrible impressive compared to a Dark Lord, but then again, what is. Pretty good for a brewpub imperial. The aroma starts off with a nice, but subtle burnt raisin aroma. Then, the thin, chocolate body gives quickly away to the low-bitter coffee finish. I enjoyed the lasting finish experience with this ""session"" stout. Thanks to hezron and brigadier for joining me on my b-day."
J.T. Whitneys Imperial Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Black color with a medium head. Burnt malt aroma, but a tad of a sour end.

J.T. Whitneys Imperial Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Not much of a scent to it. A dark brown beer, with kind of a chocolately taste to it. More of a sweet stout than an imperial stout.
Church End Vicars Ruin;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Church End Brewery;Hand-pulled cask @ The Church End Brewery taproom. Little in terms of aroma, but a strong malty backbone. Light in the mouth, fruit cake on the finish. Acceptable.

Poured a clear light amber with a frothy white head and lots of broken lace.

Crystal clear pale gold in colour with a thin white head. Light citrus aroma of lemon drops and elderflower short in intensity. Fizzy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a weak citrus note of burnt oranges and cereal. Strong flavour of hop resins in the dry bitter aftertaste is classic Church End. Finish is bitter edged with hop resins still delivering dry floral notes. A good summer session bitter.

Coach House Dick Turpin;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Coach House Brewing Co.;Deep amber ale. Sweet - hints of sherry, burnt caramel. Very subtle malty bitterness in aftertaste. Consequently tastes rather lacking, due to imbalance of sweetness.

Aroma of toffee, some fruity malt, subtle plum and bread. Tastes of grain, some caramel, subtle apple, bread and some roastiness. Light bodied but a watery texture.

Coach House Dick Turpin;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Coach House Brewing Co.;On tap in the Stockbridge Tap, Edinburgh. A bit of a disapointment to be honest. Looks great with a nice deep red/amber colour. Aroma was sparse but there were hints of the malt and some sweetness coming through. The palate was smooth, really smooth, like silky smooth. It was the taste that was the let down. First impressions were watery, so I had some more but it was still watery. Don’t get me wrong there are hops in there and they crop up occasionally but my overall lasting memory is watery.

Mariestads Julebrygd 3.5%;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;Beautiful foam that is lasting. The aroma is full of both hard roasted malt and raisins. The taste varies over dried fruits, like raisins, prunes and dates. It is perhaps a little early (or late) to rate Christmas beer, but Mariestads Julebrygd can suitably be drunk all year round. It is clearly comparable with Belgian beer, for its yeast have this peculiar richness and taste as just Belgians have expertise in brewing.

Thirsty Bear Black Bear Lager;San Francisco, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Bear Brewing Company;I had this on tap at the Thirsty Bear Brewpub during RBSG 2009 with kp, beerguy101 and beastiefan roasty, yet with a sweet element to it that just didn’t quite work for me.

Thirsty Bear Black Bear Lager;San Francisco, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Bear Brewing Company;Very roasty and toasty. Coffee, chocolate and wood undertones. Really quite hoppy. Full complex and rich. Nice beer to sit and savor.
Thirsty Bear Black Bear Lager;San Francisco, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Bear Brewing Company;I had this on tap. It is a nice schwarzbier-type. It is almost black, with a medium, light brown head that steadily diminishes to a thin top and lasting ring of foam. The aoms is pleasant, mild aroma is toast with hints of chocolate, coffee. It’s dry, smooth, and clean. The taste is similar, on the lighter side for the style, but still with a good fullness and range of flavour. It’s mostly toasted grain with light chocolate and coffoee elements - a bit dry and rather clean, but light on complexity and depth. Ther e is a faint licorice quality but this is weak. It’s still tasty, though, and very drinkable.
Thirsty Bear Black Bear Lager;San Francisco, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Bear Brewing Company;$6 pint at the brewpub. Lots of black patent malts in the nose. Holy ash-tray. ig-time smokiness. This stuff smells like a hybrid of smoky bowling alley and Northern New York white trash. Moderately transparent black body with a light tan head that leaves decent lacing. Kind of thin, watery, and chalky with a roasted, burnt chocolate flavor. A bit musty, too. Not much in the way of hops. Pretty bland, thin, and unimpressive.

New Belgium Love - Felix;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tap at Toronado Seattle. Browish pour, little head. Classic NB sour aromas, not a huge amount of complexity. Deeply tart, not totally dry but not sweet. Exactly what you’d expect the base beer for these others to taste like, but it works a bit better than you might have expected. My favorite NB sour save for Eric’s ale.

Saint-Monon Cuvée Ermesinde;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;Don’t really know what to think of this beer. It is somehow creamy and somehow yeasty and there’s even a little aroma of spices and alcohol.

Saint-Monon Cuvée Ermesinde;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;Strong amber commissioned by Arelbières in Arlon, with thick, creamy, off-white, sticky head and bright copper colour. Spicy and fruity aroma of honey, apricot, pepper, aniseed, ginger, citrus peel, whisky, flowery hops. Sourish onset, then turning sweetish, light citrus, caramelly maltiness, spicy notes, finishing mildly flowery hoppy with warming alcohol, but the spices - typically overused as this brewery so often does - also generate a drying effect. Nonetheless quite an agreeable brew.

Saint-Monon Cuvée Ermesinde;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;Il faut toujours revenir à St Monon pour savoir ce qu’est une vraie bière... Cette cuvée Ermesinde est définie comme une spéciale belge, ambrée du pays d’Arlon. C’est une bière naturelle refermentée en bouteille d’un niveau de 8 % abv. Très belle couleur ambrée rousse moyenne. Aspect légèrement trouble dû à un petit voile de levure. Bulles moyennes partout, moyennement vives mais continues. Mousse beige claire qui vient très vite napper le breuvage, mais va le tenir pendant toute la dégustation. Un peu comme certaines trappistes de haut vol. Arômes de whisky des Northern Highlands, genièvre grand cru, malt noir, avec une pointe d’abricot confit et un soupçon de thym. Superbe. Texture de la 1ère bouche entre doux et structuré, avec une sublime prise sur des nuances de thé premier cru. Arrière-bouche fraîche et pourtant nerveuse sur du malt et du houblon. 2ème bouche à l’équilibre magnifique avec une pointe d’épice, sucre d’orge et candi brun. 3ème prodigieuse, savoureuse, ample avec un équilibre délicat. Arrière-bouche d’une finesse impressionnante. La longueur commence avec un nez de miel fin et une bouche de bois blanc. Elle poursuit sur un whisky Speyside de 12 ans, et quelques fruits noirs avec une légère pointe de cassis. Elle finit sur du malt caramel et des feuilles d’automne sous la futaie, avec une pointe de noisette. La levure est la hauteur de tout ceci et contribue à l’harmonie boisée. Elle n’est pourtant pas trop douce et présente une pointe de sel marin d’une délicatesse extraordinaire. L’alcool est progressif, bien dosé (quoique j’aurais accepté pour cette bière un petit degré en plus parce qu’elle le mérite tellement...). La finale est évidemment attendue comme le Messie, et ma foi (sans jeu de mots) elle confine à l’absolu (toujours sans jeu de mots). Conclusion : une divinité est née (nous approchons de Noël …) et j’ai pu la recueillir dans mon verre. Quel faveur et quel plaisir divin … (non, pas le vin, la bière...). Nous ne pouvons que réciter 3 ave et dire une messe pour ce brasseur, et surtout pour qu’il continue à nous fournir pareilles merveilles. Merci St Monon.
Saint-Monon Cuvée Ermesinde;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;Ambrée opaque, effervescence moyenne, col blanc moyen. Principalement maltée, avec des notes de cannelle, de miel, de banane et une petite amertume sur la fin. Mais l’ensemble ne convainc pas trop...

Beach Chalet Beach Blanket Blond Ale;San Francisco, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beach Chalet Brewery;Slightly fruity aroma. Clear golden color. Not much of a head.

Beach Chalet Belgian Golden Ale;San Francisco, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beach Chalet Brewery;Tap at the brewpub: (Listed as Brewers Special and it was a Belgian style ale, so I’m pretty sure it’s this) Hazy light golden topped by a white ring of head. Very oddly phenolic aroma- clove, plastic, pool water, banana, and a vanilla background. Decent creaminess to the body. Sweet flavor with evident candi sugar mixing with clovey phenolic and banana. This stuff is like a German Hefeweizen with candi sugar thrown into the boil. Not so good, but not terrible.

Eldos Stow Lake Stout;San Francisco, California, United States;Stout;Eldos Grill and Brewery;Tap. Dark brown color with a light brown head. Nitro pushed. Smooth roasted malty flavor and aroma but a rather weak aroma.
Magnolia Smokestack Lightning;San Francisco, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magnolia Pub and Brewery;On tap @ Magnolia, pour is a huge deep black with a puffy brown head that dissolves to nothing. Smells of slight chocolate, grainy coffee and deep malt. Taste is malt forward for a stout, and a nice blend of bitter and succulent sweets. Nice body, and a deepness to it that makes it a sipper for sure

Magnolia Smokestack Lightning;San Francisco, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magnolia Pub and Brewery;Thx! for sharing. Sampled draft @ Delirium Hoppy Loft. Black with no head. Nose is hugely smoked soy sauce, varnish, light nail polish. Taste is glue, varnish, soy sauce, sugar, nail polish, herbal chocolate, heavy umami smoke,… Thick syrup body. Odd with the vanish, nail polish, smoked soy sauce notes,… Potentially polarizing but I am not a big fan of umami forward beers esp. coupled with odd notes like here.

Otto's Double D IPA;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Nice IPA grapefruit aroma is pretty big here. Some pine as well. Bitter end. Golden pour with good head and lacing. Tap at brewery.
Otto's Double D IPA;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Draft at source. Old school DIPA from an old school brewery. Lacing bf and head are strong. Light haze to golden body. Thick not sweet maltiness covers up some bitterness but a drying bitterness still breaks through. Hops are dull and unspectacular. They don't pop or shine like modern versions try. This would have been very nice a decade ago and it's just quaint now.
Otto's Double D IPA;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Pours hazy green-golden with a one-finger white head. Tastes of bitter hops almost like a hopped hefe. It’s full bodied and the alcohol adds to the bitterness. It’s creamy and frothy. The bitter hops and alcohol are an attack on the taste buds. Wow!
Otto's Double D IPA;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Reddish gold beer. Smells pretty floral. Lots of prickly hop flavours, short and bitter, light sweetness in the end but it is fine for balance.
Otto's Double D IPA;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a semi-copper color with a slight transparency about it. Quarter finger white foamy head swiftly dissipated. Mild stringy lace, sliding. The aroma had some dried grassy hops, toast, citrus rind -sweetness, some leather and a touch of earthiness. Malt base was there, slightly stiff. The flavor leaned into the sweetness of the malts and tried to blend in the hops, somewhat bitter and sweet, but that mainly stayed separated. Aftertaste was malty. Finish was slightly sticky. The feel was just a tad under medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine. Overall, west coast styled DIPA? Maybe, in an odd sort of way. Old school DIPA? Perhaps. Enjoyable? Somewhat. Would I have again - only if someone offered me. It wasn’t too far off.
Otto's Double D IPA;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;12oz bottle. Poured a copper color with a small off-white head.

Redwood Lodge Munich Dunkel;Flint, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Redwood Lodge Brewery;Cask at the RAF 2003: Good dunkel colour, wonderful german malt aroma - strong nutty presence, barley, bitter hops. Bit too light on the palate, and could use a bit more to help round out the flavours, not quite as robust as a true German dunkel, but overall well done for the style.
Moor Withy Cutter;Bridgwater, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Moor (-2008);Cask conditioned at the inn on the Green, Bristol. Brown with a slight head. Aroma was slightly malty. Flavour had a bit more malt with a fairly hoppy, dry finish. Served in good condition, this was a decent enough session beer.

A brown coloured beer with a bit of diacetyl and toffee in the aroma. The taste has quite a bit of diacetyl but I think this didn’t detract like it sometimes can do. Easy to drink if not outstanding.
Trinity Special Kolsch;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Trinity Brewhouse;On tap at Trinity Brewhouse, Providence RI, November 2009. No ABV stated. Presented to me as simply as Trinity Kolsch but I guess it was this one as we have it as a Winter seasonal (as opposed to the other one which is down as a Summer seasonal). Extremely pale straw colour. Thin white head. Very light biscuit malt aroma. Light and fresh on the palate. A pleasant enough quaffer. Not sure about the Altbier reference in the commercial description.
Trinity Special Kolsch;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Trinity Brewhouse;Tap- Smells like a normal american macro pale larger with a hint of hop and maybe apple scent. Light apple juice color. Tastes crafy wheat/ hop home made taste. Light and a little fizzy in a negative way. Couldn’t compare it to anything else.
Trinity Special Kolsch;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Trinity Brewhouse;On tap at the Trinity Brew Pub. Poured a lighter yellow color wtih a smaller sized white head. Aromas and tastes of lighter fruitiness, and had a gerneric hoppiness to it.
Trinity Special Kolsch;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Trinity Brewhouse;On tap at the pub, 3/7/03. No head, very light apple juice appearance, followed by a light sour-apple aroma. Sweet/sour fruity (apples & pears) flavor, intensely hoppy and extremely dry and champagne-like finish. This may well be an excellent kolsch, it seems well-made, but I just can't get into this style yet, sorry.
Trinity Devils Bock Batch 666;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Trinity Brewhouse;"Have you ever watched a movie that started out with a BANG! an amazing first scene or two, great photography, music, performances, direction, everything riveting and gluing you to your seat, thinking, ""oh my God this could be a masterpiece!"" and then....as quickly as it started it falls apart? This is that movie in beer form. Very dark brown, nearly opaque, thick pour, thick small creamy head with lots of lacing, huge caramel aroma -- followed by an intensely bitter, thinnish flavor/body that completely undermines the hints of caramel that occasional waft through; at the end it has an off-milk quality that is truly repulsive. I asked the waitress if it was bad; she took a sip and said it was fine. Whatever. I wish I knew what the brewer was thinking when he created this monstrosity!"
Trinity Scottish Ale;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Scottish Ale;Trinity Brewhouse;Draft at the source. Hazy golden brown color, medium beige head. Aroma of caramel, subtle pine, light spice. Taste is rich toffee, butterscotch, nice body. Very tasty.
Trinity Scottish Ale;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Scottish Ale;Trinity Brewhouse;"On tap at the brewpub. This was listed as the ""Scotch Ale"" and was given an ABV of 8-9%, so I’m assuming it’s the same beer. Aroma gave a bit of graham cracker and caramelized sugar, but was otherwise quiet. Flavors expressed a nice dense, tight brownness and dense malt sugars. A touch of butterscotch. Moderately well balanced sweetness and alcohol. I think this was really well put together, but somehow didn’t have the extra edge to make it particularly excellent or standout."
Trinity Scottish Ale;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Scottish Ale;Trinity Brewhouse;Part of a sampler at brewpub. Rating this from memory because it has been awhile since I was there but tried several of the Trinity offerings over the course of a couple of visits where I ordered sampler flights each time. Overall impression was that they made a decent brew in each of the styles they offered but nothing overly spectacular in any of them.
Trinity Scottish Ale;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Scottish Ale;Trinity Brewhouse;On draught at the brewpub. Cloudy brown pour with a tiny tan head. Aroma of brown sugar. Thick mouthfeel, taste of sticky molasses, almonds and brown sugar. One of my favs from Trinity for the winter season.
Trinity Scottish Ale;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Scottish Ale;Trinity Brewhouse;(Draught at the brewpub) Poured deep dark brown and cloud with white head. Aroma was malty and sweet. Palate was full bodied with medium carbonation. Tasted of malts, hops, molasses, metallicness, lightly roastedness, bitterness and caramell. Malty aftertaste.
Trinity Scottish Ale;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Scottish Ale;Trinity Brewhouse;Cask. Vastly superior beer pumped out of the cask. Hops were much more present and gave a subtle undertone of evergreen. Balanced outt he malts and masked the alcohol. Nose was also much thicker and wetter (if wetter makes any sense but it did when I reviewed it into my notebook). More of a creamy, thick mouthfeel. Tough to leave after one pint.

Trinity Scottish Ale;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Scottish Ale;Trinity Brewhouse;I was really taken by the gigantic neverending head on this one. wicked mega sweet with slight maltiness.
Trinity Scottish Ale;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Scottish Ale;Trinity Brewhouse;On cask. Opaque medium-to-dark maple color, big thick lasting bubbly head. Aroma of butterscotch, pine bark, loamy soil. Extremely sweet, no hops to speak of, butterscotch with hints of cherry, vanilla and (faintly) whiskey. Pillowy soft hot-chocolate-with-melted-marshmallow mouthfeel. Alcohol invisible until it warms quite a bit. Awesome, just a notch below the Imperial Stout. This is a brewpub worth going out of your way for.
Willimantic 030303 Heather Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Willimantic Brewing Company;Not bad. Very light bodied, with a mild heather flavor and some semi=present hoppiness. A good beer for summer, or an introductory to good beer. Very easy drinking.

Willimantic Husky IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at Willimantic on the way home from a weekend in Boston for EBF.

Aroma is nice raw fresh hoppy aroma- very floral, citrusy resinous and some pine needle. Grapefruit and pine sap flavor resiny, with a good bready light sweet carapils malt and a raw tacky cohumulone bitterness gets a bit prickly but nice. . Very drinkable. Nice IPA.
Willimantic Husky IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;This was my favorite of all the beers I had there. This beer was a murky straw yellow, but very appetizing. Smooth, bitter flavor but very balanced.
Willimantic Husky IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Enjoyed a pint of this one on draught at the brewpub in Willimantic, CT. This beer pours to a murky, deep orange color, with a tight, white head that fades, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting, with fragrant, spicy and piney hop aromas. The palate is firm, with some good sweet and caramel malt flavors, paired with a nice, spicy/herbal hop flavor. This beer finishes with more of those good malty and hoppy flavors, up front, then ends with some good spicy/piney hop bitterness that lingers. Another well done IPA from Willimantic. I really enjoyed the hop bitterness and hop flavor in this beer, as the pint warmed, you realize you are drinking a very hoppy and bitter beer. This one went great with a cup of their spicy potato soup, and would work well with a number of dishes on their menu.
Willimantic Husky IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Clear gold with almost no head. Floral and citrus hop nose, light pine and mild malt. Sweetly bitter citrus hop flavors, a mild caramel malt. Good.
Willimantic Husky IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Man was I happy to see this on cask. Came with a frothy creamy 1 finger full of head, atop a dirty orangish color. Aroma is strong floral, citrus and piney hops. Flavor starts with some nice mellow malt sweetness, sweet caramel, followed by a firm but pleasing bitterness and a rush of delicious hop flavor. Floral and citrus hops dominate, the finish out with some piney hops. Finishes very smooth, and insanely drinkable, even at 6.9% abv. I must say this year’s batch was better than I recalled the last batch, maybe a slightly different recipe? Who knows, but I just can’t get enough of this batch, and on cask? Insane.
Willimantic Husky IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;"The description at the pub said this was 6.9% and ""an unfiltered IPA with Nugget and Golding Hops with 5 Malts"". Floral citrusy-orange crisp refreshing aroma. Mild pine notes--nice. Mild/moderately transparent copper/amber color with an off-white head. Sweet, orange, citrusy hops to start with nice sticky caramel malty middle. Finishes grapefruity bitter. Nice IPA."
Willimantic Mail Order Raisin Old Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at brewery, sweet and sour, big raisin flavors. Tons of Dark fruity malts, I really like it
Willimantic Mail Order Raisin Old Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Old cleaned up notes: Pours dark copper with a thin white head. Smells fruity and earthy with some spicy hints. Tastes of chocolate, raisins, molasses, some boozy hints.
Willimantic Mail Order Raisin Old Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;This was a real treat, have I mentioned before that Willibrew is awesome? Probably, and it is. This one came a dark brownish red color in a much too small 12 oz. glass. Aroma was sweet chocolate, figs, raisins, caramel, and molasses. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and full, like drinking liquid silk. Flavor starts very sweet, chocolate and caramel highlighting, then becomes very fruity, with molasses soaked figs and raisins highlighting. Slight hints of alcohol in the finish, but it sure isn’t off-putting at all. World class.
Willimantic Mail Order Raisin Old Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Draught. Lots of fruits in the aroma with significant sherry notes...hints of blackberries and licorice as well. Nice, complex nose. Mildly hazy dark garnet mahogany color with a light tan head. Sweet notes to start turning a very malty chocolate with hints of sour cherries. Astringent, cherry/vinous notes blended with the chocolate malts remind me of chocolate covered cherries....mmmm...magnificent! I dig this beer. The alcohol is undetectable.
Willimantic Mail Order Raisin Old Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Dark fruit esters are strong in the nose with some lightly roasted malts and perhaps a hint of smoke. Opaque black body with shy off-white head. Dark fruits are slightly sour with some bread-like yeast notes leading to the finishing roasty flavours. Medium body is effervescent on the tongue. Sampled at the brewpub with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
Willimantic Mail Order Raisin Old Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Dark brown hue, light off-white head. Strong earthy nose, deeply malty, somehow peaty feeling with several dark fruit suggestions among which dates and grapes stand out. Heavy dark dried fruits in fact. Very appealing, especially with that slight leather touch. Feels even more vinous in mouth, the fruitiness is as expressive as can be yet still leaves room for plenty of dark bread aspects. Light acidity level and well contained sweetness contribute to overall balance. Nice rather thick body proposes medium carbonation level.
Willimantic Mail Order Raisin Old Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Raisins and dates surface gently from the kind roastiness...Grapey vinosity appears in the back as warming alcohol is whispered from the classy carbonation...Refreshing ideas soothing the tastebuds and mind...
Willimantic Mail Order Raisin Old Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;"2003: Dark elm body, small lasting hints of foam topping. Woody, parchmenty sweet nose. Sweet, musty, wet flavor and mouthfeel, caramel, no alcohol; shifts from old and bookish to grassy and fresh over the course of the tasting; long sweet finish, hints of lemon at the end. No hops to speak of. Best of the five I sampled. 2005: just a hair less interesting than the Jack Daniels version, perhaps a bit less flavor than I remembered. Downgraded by .1. Still a must-try."

Svatý Norbert Polotmavé 18°;Prague, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Klášterní Pivovar Strahov;Bevuta alla spina al Klasterny di Praga, sulla collina vicino al castello. E’ la tipica birra praghese: maltosa, torbata, dal gusto complesso ma terribilmente beverina, con un piacevolissimo amaro finale. Davvero una bella scoperta questo minipivovar
Svatý Norbert Polotmavé 18°;Prague, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Klášterní Pivovar Strahov;A rich Belgian dark ale that has toffee and sweet chocolatey sugar notes, but I found it a bit cloying and a bit too sweet, however, it certainly was a relief from ubiquitous pale Czech lagers. Opps my mistake, this was a lager, but it tasted, as noted below, like a Belgian ale.
Svatý Norbert Polotmavé 18°;Prague, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Klášterní Pivovar Strahov;Imagine my surprise when I tasted this semi-dark beer - it was like being transplanted into Belgium! It is brewed, intentionally or not, in the style of Gouden Carolus with a rich malty flavour, leaning towards toffee with some spiciness and a nutty finish. Unusual and pretty good. (Draught at Klasterni, Praha)
Svatý Norbert Polotmavé 18°;Prague, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Klášterní Pivovar Strahov;went to the monastery expecting it to be a tourist trap with boring beer but this is very original stuff. on tap amazingly full of life and no worse bottled. had an absolutely massive head which my nose made a big dent in as i tried to take a first sip. slightly cloudy deep amber. some bockish black bean and toffee apple with a slight raspiness balanced by some belgian tasting yeast. apple peel bitterness, smooth and tasty and with a weird treacle aroma. good to know that while standard czech beers are declining in quality, there are some new breweries like this, avar, vrchlabi and berounsky medved who are coming up with adventurous but distinctly czech beers
Svatý Norbert Polotmavé 18°;Prague, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Klášterní Pivovar Strahov;i'll always be grateful to motelpogo for lugging this one back from the czech republic in his smelly backpack. this is an amazing beer. i thought the czechs couldn't do anything good over 5% but no. this one combines the fullness and richness of a doppelbock with the mysteriously vanishing soft drinkability of a czech pilsener. colour-wise it's bizarre: a deep sort of strawberry-amber (but then i always get pink and orange wrong). the mouthfeel is amazingly buttery, sticking to the roof of your mouth lonnggg after you finish. as well as the amazing, rich fudgey malt flavour you get heaps of fresh spicy saazy tingle, and enough bitterness to balance it perfectly without sticking out. beautiful stuff.
Luisen-Bräu Hell;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Luisen-Bräu (see Lemke);Drink this at a sportbar near the brewpub, it was closed, so i can some german football matches. But the beer is a hazy golden coloured beer with a light sweet taste, i nice thick head

Luisen-Bräu Hell;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Luisen-Bräu (see Lemke);Dark yellow (honey) and cloudy. Aroma is fresh and light fruity. Taste is malty fresh with pronounced hop notes and light fruitiness in the aftertaste. O.K. Helles without special character.
Luisen-Bräu Hell;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Luisen-Bräu (see Lemke);I had this beer many years ago at one time when I was only giving ratings to the beers but was too lazy and stupid to write down my thoughts. I will update this as soon as I get my hands on this beer again.
Luisen-Bräu Hell;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Luisen-Bräu (see Lemke);6/20/03, draft, Berlin. Here we go with the context again. I tried this one on tap at the Luisen Brau brewpub across from the Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin. While I was there sitting at the bar, a group of about 30 male, German tourists (from Bavaria I'd guess) serenaded the entire pub with several verses of a traditional drinking song while the bartender artfully filled glass after glass with the house brews. That alone must have added a few points to my rating! This is an unfiltered, amber beer with a healthy white head and great lacing. Aroma is apricots, floral hops with a hint of red wine vinegar acidity. Very hoppy tasting brew, lemon and spicy with a fruity finish. Medium body, round mouthfeel with light carbonation. Good flavorful beer in a great atmosphere.
Luisen-Bräu Hell;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Luisen-Bräu (see Lemke);Cloudy, blond beer with a medium head. Slightly sweet, yeasty taste. Lightly carbonated. Neutral finish.

Luisen-Bräu Dunkel;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Luisen-Bräu (see Lemke);6/20/03, draft, Berlin. Tasted this one at the Luisen Brau brewpub in Charlottenburg district of Berlin. Beautiful dark brown color and a creamy beige head which left nice lacing as I drained the glass. Mild aroma, primarily nutty malts with a hint of hops present. Flavor is hoppy first, then roasted grain, sourdough bread and a bitter hop finish. Rolls smoothly onto the tongue, lies there for a moment, then bursts into a carbonated creaminess. Nice beer in a great location.

Meininger Black Jack;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Meininger Privatbrauerei;"Mommsen-Eck (Haus der 100 Biere) has been a watering hole of mine since before the Berlin Wall came down back in 1989: every trip back to the city sees me re-visit the place for food and beers. On returning now I’m always looking for something on the menu I’ve not had before instead of having something I know; hence the 500ml bottle of Black Jack was ordered during one of my evenings in here during Jan 2012. Black Jack is in fact a dark brown colour with ruby red tinge to it, the body being clear without haze or mistiness to the eye. The collapsing beige head gave it a great initial look; it also produced some impressive lacing as the beer level sank. Sweet malty molasses hit the nose, too strong for anything else to have a showing. The taste was also sweet molasses, caramel and toffee being the flavours I found, with a dark chocolate bitterness arriving towards the end of each sip. The texture was oily more than rich or creamy, the alcohol content didn’t appear to have any influence on the body depth or taste, would have liked to feel at least a hint of it when drinking such a good looking and smelling brew."
Meininger Black Jack;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Meininger Privatbrauerei;It’s black with a red hue and a creamy, lasting head. The aroma is like the moderately sweet flavour. It has notes of roasted malt, caramel, light licorice and some dusty and damp cellar. The finish is dry.

Berliner Kindl Weisse Mit Schuß Waldmeister;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);"The addition of syrup spoiled that beer. It is too sweet. Sourness is only in the background. I prefer ""original"" version. But appearance is surprising - completely green. Resembles dish detergent, also in aroma a little bit. Tastes like cheap apple hard candies. In the summer I would be able to drink it only for refreshing, not for sensory pleasure."
Berliner Kindl Weisse Mit Schuß Waldmeister;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);500ml bottle. It is the better flavored weisse from Berliner. It is sweet but not too much, there is also light acidic taste and chestnut, hazelnut. Very refreshing!
Berliner Kindl Weisse Mit Schuß Waldmeister;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Valójában egy ízesített nyáron jól Iható sör , azonban kicsit túl tolták benne az aromát és talán a savakat. Lehűtve viszont üdítőnek kiváló.
Berliner Kindl Weisse Mit Schuß Waldmeister;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Pours a bright ecto-cooler green on tap with bubbly green-white foam that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of somewhere between green apple, floral notes, and sweet kool-aid. Taste is sweet too, like a green apple jolly rancher that has some spicy floral notes underneath, almost like black licorice. Weird and way too sweet, not for me.
Berliner Kindl Weisse Mit Schuß Waldmeister;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);A funny beer served in Berlin at right conditions and warm weather.

Berliner Kindl Weisse Mit Schuß Waldmeister;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Weird aroma of pudding creme with a note of almond and bit yoghurt signs. Cloudy green in the glass with medium rocky head. Taste is semi sweetish with bit tarty hints, but all is taken by artifical notes of that green syrup. God, why?
Berliner Kindl Weisse Mit Schuß Waldmeister;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);"Dieses Getränk ist etwas ganz eingenes, manche mögen ""besonderes"" sagen. Es ist nicht sauer wie die klassische Berliner Weisse, bitter wie einfaches Bier und auch nicht zu süß wie die meisten Radler. Es hat einen Geschmack nach Ahoi-Brause aufgelöst in saurem Bier. Das ist so abartig, dass es schon wieder gut ist. Ich werde sicher nicht der große Fan von dem Zeug, aber probieren sollte man es doch mal -und sei es, dass man es kennenlernt."

Arbor Blackheath Sweet Stout;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Tap: Yeah, no real head, a little thin compared to the two other new stouts ABC is offering up. A little bit of coffee, slightly vinous mouthfeel. Had a little tang to it that hit me in the salivary glands.
Arbor Blackheath Sweet Stout;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Tap: Lack with decent head. Coffe up front. Coffee with chocolate undertones. Bitter finish. Was decent but I am not a true stout fan only because I can’t stand coffee.

Arbor Blackheath Sweet Stout;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;This is just plain luxurious. It's a milk stout without any lactose (! for vegans!) - it has all the usual suspects, coffee in medium measure, roast somewhat less than that, some chocolate, some (apparently non-)lactic sourness. I was not expecting much, yet this is more full bodied than some - perfect body. Great experience.
Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Poured a dark straw color with a thin whispy head. Classic Belgian aroma. Nice refreshing fruity-hefe flavor. Light-mdium body. I expected an alcohol and dry finish - none. Very nice way to start the night.
Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"A nice beer from the Dane, sampled over at the Hilldale location. Pours a cloudy yellow colour with a big fluffy white head. Aroma is really nice, orange peel, citrus fruits and wheat.

Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"On tap as ""Ride the Dragon"" Tripel. Pours a hazy gold, a compact white head still leaves a lot of streaky lace. Only a faint yeastiness on the nose. Flavor nicely combines yeasty flavors with the sweetness of honey and apricot nectar, a bit of pineapple on the aftertaste. Somewhat more than medium bodied, a bit peppery and prickly on the palate."
Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Brew pub tripel turned out pretty good. Fruity, syrupy, faitn alcohol. A very drinkable tripel.
Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;One of the better domestic triples I have had in some time. LOts of light fruit with just a hint of floral hops and pale malt. Touches of apple, apricot honeysuckle and candi in the flavors. Backdrop of cloves and wheat. Fairly dry in the finish with just a hint of sweet pale malt. Quite nice.
Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;A feal fruit salad. Pours a hazy peach colored beer with a nice nose of candied apricots. Lots of plum, peaches, apricots and pear - lots of pear. Nice long-lasting head, give style points. Long lasting fruit finish, but lacks some body and complexity. Would age well in oak - but this is a brewpub, so I’ll give it a 16.
Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Poured an almost clear golden yellow, with decent-staying creamy head. Aroma was fruity (namely apples and dates), with some alcohol present. Mouthfeel was carbonated almost to the point of being tingly, and the taste was light, fruity, and hoppy. Malt flavor was not distinct, but added bulk to the beer’s body. This was almost champagne-like, and left a nice fruity aftertaste.
Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Hazy yellow color with no head. Floral aroma with a substantial alcohol content. Very spicy grass taste with some apple present too. Bitter and pucker inducing. Alcohol plays a major part here. It seemed out of balance to me.
Great Dane Belgian Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Apple/pear/alcohol aroma, tastes very alcoholic, perhaps more than the ABV (if thats possible). A beautiful light cider color, a touch harsh tasting but aroma represents the flavor fairly well.
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Copper to umber in color. Modest dark ecru head. Aromas of caramel, toasted to light roasted malt, mild spice and dark fruit. Full and a bit oily in feel. Sweet flavors with dark fruit and well developed malts. A touch more hops in this one. Finish was some wood, spice and butterscotch. A good sustaining Doppel. 5/10
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Pours a clear dark reddish coppery color with tan colored head. Caramel malt, sticky sweetness, and some light cereal on the nose; follows onto the palate. Full bodied and thick. Finishes with caramel and nuts."
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at Great Dane-Doty for the beginning of Madison Craft Beer Week, and dispensed to a pint glass with a clear, mahogany color, modest, off white head foam that persisted as a ring and layer of film, and wavy cling to the lacing. The aroma was toasty, with caramel, sweetness, and plenty of smooth malt. The flavor added some moderate hop bitterness and a touch of toffee to the medium+ body, with a little dryness at the finish. A smooth, hefty Doppel, with a bit of warmth.
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;I had this one last week after a few other brews and it pretty much finished me off. Really great tasting and super filling. Pours a dark but translucent copper colour with a small white head. Malt profile is noticeably upfront but integrated well with fresh hop notes. Big full bodied taste with a soft fruity undertone, it’s got some rich caramel notes running straight through it. Fantastic beer
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Medium caramel-amber, cream-colored head is small but dense, leaves a respectable lacing. Sweet honeyed malt aroma with some fresh bread elements. Flavor begins nice, sweet, malt syrup, honey, then takes an off dive at the finish towards bread crusts, with some stale, metallic notes. Full bodied, pronouncedly syrupy but escapes being cloying.
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On draught at the downtown Madison Great Dane brewpub. Pours a semi-clear reddish amber color brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Aroma of caramel malt, brown sugar, toffee and some mild alcohol. Taste is medium bodied, flavors of toffee, dark pitted fruits, caramel malt and some floral hops. Finish is semi-sweet with a brown sugar and caramel malt aftertaste with some mild bitterness.
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;good, not great. low carbonation, nice sweet brown sugar flavors, a slight alcohol burn.
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"On tap at the downtown location, pours dark red with a thin white head. Nothing much in the nose, and flavors were lacking imagination. It kinda had that cheap-Genny Light-hangs-around-too-long taste, finishes just a little malty. Gonna have to give this a ""meh"" rating."
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear copper color. Head was off white and left a bit of lace behind. Smelled of dark fruits and subdued alcohol. Medium bodied with alcohol, toffee, and plum flavors. Decent, but I didn’t like it as much as some of the previous raters.
Great Dane Dominator Doppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Moderately malty flavor with a surprisingly clean finish. One of my favorite local dark beers.
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"Super hazy ruby glowing brown coloured body with almost white/yellow highlights because of the haze. In addition, tons of chunky large particles at the bottom make for a crazy look. Aroma of bananas, clove, anise, liquorice, canned corn and yes - wheat and yeast. Full-bodied; Strong yeastie flavour with wheat, bananas and cloves most noticeable. Aftertaste is mellow and wheatie, showing some alcohol and a plentiful amount of sugars. Overall, a pretty good weizenbock, not complex near the end, but the flavour shows well. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Chevy Chase Wine & Liquors in Washington, D.C. on 03-May-2008 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia on 05-July-2008."
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;This Weizenbock is one of the best in the Baltimore area since DeGroen’s versionin the 90’s. I would put this up against Aventinus from Germany and prefer it over Clipper City’s Hang Ten and Victory’s Moonglow Weizenbock.
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Bottle. Lately i’ve been wanting to try as many wheat beers as I can find in my area, so I picked this up too. I read the reviews and to be honest i wanted to like it as much as everyone else did, but i cant. I do like it, but not as much everyone else. I need to try this in the fall. I’ve been drinking too many hefes lately. I need to revisit this in the fall next to Schnieder Aventinus and other weisnbocks.
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;I sampled this at a beer tasting at Total Discount Liqours in Eldersburg, MD. I liked it and got a 6pk. It poured a cloudy copper/amber color with a tall thick foamy head. There was a distinct wheat aroma and a bit of a mild citrus scent. The flavor was a nice smooth sweet taste that had a crisp clean tangy spice to counter balance it. A very good weizenbock, worth a try
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Pours cloudy copper with a good head, but the head doesn’t last. Looks delicious. Kinda smells like seafood. Full flavored,, full bodied, medium dark wheat that is a little sweet. Cold clean mouthfeel. Spicy, yeasty, sweet finish. This is a really good weizenbock.
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Draft. Poured a cloudy brown color with a thin off white head.

Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Deep red-brown color, very cloudy and thick in appearance. Mystery ABV...I’d guess 6.8% or so. Certainly an enjoyable beer, but not really a world class weizenbock. Malty sweet and rich, worth a try for the enthusiast.
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Great Weizenbock. The catchy name and package originally drew me in. I’ve also had this on draught at the Rams Head Tavern in Annapolis. Both are good. Pours thick murky cloudy brown. Not the prettiest beer....but the taste is great. Clove & banana flavors abound with a slight bitterness. The package art is great and very Annapolitan. Only negatives are it’s appearance and drinkability.
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Basically a spot on weizenbock... huge doughy banana and clove in the nose, sugary, starchy, bready, with a well developed nose. Chewy, moderately thick texture, frothy as well, with the banana and clove done perfectly, not that it’s a hard style to nail. Nice and spicy, not overy done, and sweet but also not too much so.
Fordham & Dominion Fleet Wheat Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Nicely done, especially the strong banana tones and flavor. Other fruits present with a slight hops zing. Very drinkable, though not much to look at.

Decent session ale.
Teignworthy Beachcomber;Newton Abbot, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Teignworthy Brewery;Darker yellow in colour with a very active head out of the bottle. The aroma is intensely lager in type but it has a more hoppy ale texture. Medium to full bodied.
Teignworthy Beachcomber;Newton Abbot, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Teignworthy Brewery;(Bottle). Unpleasant tart aroma and taste with hints of hops, citrus, raspberry and caramel malt. The flavor also has a somewhat strange and uggly flavor that I can not quite place, but according to the label, there are flavor of black currant in the beer. However, I can not find it, and I really like black currants.

City Steam Vienna Waltz;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;City Steam Brewery;On tap at the source. Comes to the table a light golden almost amber color with a small quickly disappearing head. Buttery caramel and light bready malt with barely enough hop aroma to balance the sweetness. Light bready pilsener malt flavor with a small shot of spicy hop bite. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel. Decent light pilsner brew but needs a bit more breadiness.
City Steam Vienna Waltz;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;City Steam Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Clear light orange pour with bubbles. Cereal and caramel sweetness - not bad. Slightly sweet.

City Steam Vienna Waltz;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;City Steam Brewery;"So I dunno, after walking 3 blocks in downtown Hartford on a sunny early Saturday afternoon and feeling like I was going to get killed (I walked past a group of teens who looked at me and mouthed obscenities, then threw an iceball at me for absolutely no reason), after feeling all nervous about my car parked right on Main Street, I thought, well maybe this brewpub will live up to the hype more than the last one. Maybe this will be nirvana in the midst of a shambles, a vortex of light in the middle of one of the worst urban darknesses in America. Sadly, I was mistaken. My first beer, this ""vienna"" is solid, medium-sweet caramel-apple flavored, but has no hops at all, little nose, and a very light wispy conclusion. Oh well darker is better right? On to the IPA..."
City Steam Innocence Ale (-2015);Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Pours clear copper with a medium head. Aroma is nothing to write home about. A bit of grass and caramel. Medium in body with good carbonation. Flavor is surprisingly not all that happy. Sweet malt flavors are up front with a bitter end. Despite the lack of complexity, I actually quite enjoyed this.
City Steam Innocence Ale (-2015);Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Bottle from Table and Vine, I think. Wicked fresh. Hazy copper with lasting dense head and lace. Mild spicy piney aroma. Medium crackery nutty malts with mild fruity sweetness. Assertive spicy lingering bitterness. Fairly dry. Nice draft-like texture. Very good.
City Steam Innocence Ale (-2015);Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Bottle. This one had a bit more hop aroma compared to the blonde on blonde and was a lot more bitter as well. OK, but I prefer the blonde on blonde.
City Steam Innocence Ale (-2015);Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;A good beer but not great. Pour is dark amber with a thin white head. Aroma is mostly a caramel malty thing with light hop notes. Malty and sweet in the front with a dry hop middle and a bitter finsh.

City Steam Innocence Ale (-2015);Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Amber with a thin head. The aroma is sweet malts with not much hops. The flavor is fruity sweet for a moment then is extremely bitter. Decent but a bit harsh. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
City Steam Innocence Ale (-2015);Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Bottle at the cabin in NH. Pours perfectly clear, penny copper with a large, lasting, slightly off-white head. The nose holds bread, caramel, grains, some unfermented wort, barley juice, light pine and leaves. Light to medium sweet with some dry bread, pine, off smokey notes, dry caramel, berries. Medium bodied with fine, creamy carbonation. A bit of dirty, earthy bitterness on the finish with more pine and leaves, dry bread, further off smoke notes, alcohol and more dry caramel. Mediocre, really.
City Steam Innocence Ale (-2015);Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Sampled at Julio’s Spring Beer Fest. Pours amber/orange with a small white head. Grapefruit, citrus aroma.

City Steam Green Eyes & Red Hair;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scottish Ale;City Steam Brewery;Tap at the source - Clear orange, thin creamy off white head. Nice nose that held soft notes of smoke, caramel, and faint dark fruit tones. Smoked malt flavor up front fades into more toasty dark fruit notes. Rounds out with just a kiss of sweetness. Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, smoked finish. Nicely done and perfect to drink with a b-b-que meal...
City Steam Green Eyes & Red Hair;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scottish Ale;City Steam Brewery;Draught @ Brewpub: This one pours a clear amber color, with very little head on it. It does leave some lacing down the glass. The aroma is decent enough, with mainly caramel malt to the nose. Hints of some peaty smokiness also. Mainly a medium-bodied caramel malt flavor, but finished with peaty taste on top. A hint of dryness in the finish also. Nice.
City Steam Green Eyes & Red Hair;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scottish Ale;City Steam Brewery;I've been really digging Scottish ales lately, so though the previous couple of samples I had here were mediocre, I had some hopes for this one. WRONG! It sucked, bigtime. Pale and thin looking for a SA (light amber? looks like a goddamn amber ale), light malt body, hints of smoke in the nose, basically no hops, no carbonation, no flavor. Very very weak.
Maple Leaf Mad Walters Winter Ale;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;"Little nose, like most of the beers here, but otherwise far and away the best thing I tried. Why didn't they turn this old-timey low-ceilinged place into a German-type brewpub, or just a place that served German food and decent German beers? Woulda been a lot better than what we have now. Oh, but the ski bums want a ""brewpub"" so they can be all cool. That's it. Anyway this is light brown in color, sweet and lightly spicy (nutmeg & anise) on the nose, full-bodied for a change, warming, fruity, earthy. Purty good, but I wouldn't drive for it."
Thunder Canyon Warhead Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Black beer with tan head and good lacing, light carbonation. Strong, winter warmer, strong alcohol, resinous. Strong beer, not a ton of complexity, but enough to satisfy, good for the style--rough and tumble beer, a true RIS!
Thunder Canyon Warhead Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunder Canyon Brewery;On draft at the brewpub in Tucson. Pours black with a tan head. Mild malt nose. Flavors of dark fruits and a hints of coffee and chocolate. Smooth mouthfeel with moderate to light carbonation. Crisp finish.
Thunder Canyon Warhead Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Pours Black with almost no head. Not getting much on the head. Lots of licorice and molasses notes on the tongue. Slightl hoppiness on the finish. Lingers a bit. No discernible alcohol burn. Solid for style.
Thunder Canyon Warhead Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunder Canyon Brewery;on tap(2012 vintage) pours thick black with a medium brown head. Aroma is equal parts malt and hops, roast, big pine and resinous hops. Flavor is big roast and semi-sweet cocoa with a big dry finish of ash and pine. Really nice stuff.
Thunder Canyon Warhead Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunder Canyon Brewery;[Cask] Sampled on cask at the brewery in mid January. Pours an inky black color with a average looking brown head. Very viscous looking. Boozy aroma complements espresso and general roasted malts. The taste is vanilla, coffee, smoke and heavy roast. Thick palate. Lingering alcoholic heat. A really solid beer.
Thunder Canyon Warhead Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Growler gift from Southern Johnny. This was a weird but enjoyable Stout. Pour was near perfect (Black, thin tan head). But the aroma was like tar, licorice and chocolate. Medium mouth feel with a bitter caramel, coffee flavor. Damn Good.
Thunder Canyon Warhead Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Growler at RBWG in March 2010. Pours a dark mahogany color with a lightly translucent, chestnut tinted edge. A thin, swirly, light brown film sits at the head, leaving behind minimal, spotted lacing. A quick shakeup indicates lacking viscosity, as the body seems a bit thin for the style. Aromas are very well balanced, giving notes of mild chocolate, burnt caramel roast, singed molasses, and some nougat. A subtle dash of earthen hops supports the roast in evening out the choco-caramel malt. Flavors follow suit, very smooth and chocolaty, pulled together nicely with toasted caramel, nougat, and mildly bitter, earthy hops. There might be a bit of coffee in there for good measure. As foreshadowed, the palate is a little on the thin side, lacking that weightiness that most good imperials show. Still, carbonation is spot on, and it comes across smooth, without much alcohol burn or cloying, sugary finish. Overall, it’s a pretty solid stout. Not stellar, but not terribly flawed either.
Thunder Canyon Warhead Stout;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Ratebeer Winter Gathering. A: Pours a nice deep black with a nice darker shade of brown head. Lite retention with some spots of lace. S: Aromas of deep roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, toasted malt, and earth. T: Very roasted borderline bitter. Lots of bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Earthy but not smokey. M: Medium in body, a bit thin for the style. Good carbonation.

Thunder Canyon Apricot Breeze;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a cloudy yellow to orange color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white head that dissipated immediately. No lacing was left. The smell had a decent sweet apricot with a light grassy and somewhat wheat edge in the background. The taste started off with the sweet apricot and let in a decent tart apricot edge to balance. Grassiness was somewhat there but maintains a decent background. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but still carried a delicate smooth behavior to it. Overall, I say this was a pretty good sessionable fruit beer I could have again.
Thunder Canyon Apricot Breeze;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;On tap at TCB - Pours a hazy straw color with a light head. Has a very light fruit (apricot obviously) aroma. Flavor is sweet and fruity, but not overbearing like alot of fruit beers. Has a smooth light finish. Not bad. The wife really likes it.
Thunder Canyon Apricot Breeze;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;"Light gold color. Small head. Aroma is apricot and malts. A medium bodied fruit beer. The apricot flavor is fairly pronounced and somewhat sweet. There is supposedly over 700 pounds of apricots in each batch. It very pleasant. Light and refreshing. Malts and hops are fairly mild; the fruit is in the forefront. Balanced is OK> Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet."
Thunder Canyon Apricot Breeze;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Light golden color, nice aroma of apricot, sweet apricot flavor, but very cooling and refreshing with a nice drying finish that begged for another sip. Quite good for a fruit beer.
Archers Special;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);"Cask at the Back of Beyond (JDW), Reading. A rather ordinary bitter.

Dark amber, with speckled lacing and a nice bitter aroma. Choc notes which linger on the finish. Beforehand there’s sugary candy choc sweetness, blended unevenly with sour hoppy bitterness.

Archers Special;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask conditioned - handpump - NBC Club Northampton. A mid brown coloured bitter which has loads of bitter hoppiness.

Archers Special;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Amber with a fine white head, possessing a dark reddish hue.

Dogfish Head Chocolate Mild;Milton, Delaware, United States;Mild Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;"Pours an amber color with a quickly dissipating off-white head. No lace from this brew. I don't detect any cocoa in the nose. I can't quite describe what I am smelling here, but it isn't strong. Just mild malt aroma. Soft, light to medium mouthfeel. Smooth, with cocoa on the finish. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Sam doesn't usually sell this one outside of his restaurant, but I guess it is one of his only ""light"" offerings."
Dogfish Head Chocolate Mild;Milton, Delaware, United States;Mild Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;"Dark chestnut brown. Light cocoa nose - I wish I could find more but the brewpub served it ice cold and since they should know better I wasn't going to give them patience. A light nutty note. In addition to being near-frozen, it was way overcarbonated for the style. Reminds me of when the BJCP ""expert"" judges criticized my homebrew mild for being undercarbonated when it had the perfect cask level of about half what you'll find in a lager. Book learning isn't good for much if you haven't logged the miles. Back to the beer...vague milk chocolate and a hint of malt."
Dogfish Head Chocolate Mild;Milton, Delaware, United States;Mild Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;Dark brown color with a tinge of red poking through. Light chocolate and raisins in the nose.

Dogfish Head Chocolate Mild;Milton, Delaware, United States;Mild Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;I love this beer. A session ale from Dogfish...bite your tongue. I quaffed this ale in the brewpub on my last trip down. Dark and rich in flavor. The Chocolate stood out till the last tilt of my mug. It inspired me to brew my own Chocolate mild when I got home.
Dogfish Head Chocolate Mild;Milton, Delaware, United States;Mild Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;This ale has a deep copper hue and a small, creamy off-white head. Fully diminishing. Leaves interesting lacework on the glass. The aroma is lightly malty with notes of milk chocolate and toasted cashews. The flavor is lightly malty and pungent with small hints of the baking cocoa up front. Well-balanced with moderately pungent and lightly bitter hops on the backside. Light-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish. Excellent session beer. Recommended if you can get your hands on it.

Rather attractive clear ruby pour, average diminishing head. Sour and thin aroma, weak persimmon malt and dry lemon juice, somewhat funked up - but I suspect it’s not SUPPOSED to be sour.

Brewzzi Irish Stout;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Stout;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft… Pours a murky dark brown with a mid-sized, delicate, fat-bubbled, beige head. The aroma presents smoke, chocolate, apple, and boiling mash – both intriguing and disturbing at the same time. Medium-bodied, but thin with lifeless carbonation. The flavor is roasty, chocolaty and moderately bitter – fairly one dimensional. Finishes appley and mildly bitter with a dash of instant coffee.
Brewzzi Irish Stout;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Stout;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Black pour with tan head and lace. Chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. Roasted malt, and a good malt bitter finish. Just a tad thin and watery but good.
Brewzzi Irish Stout;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Stout;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Part of the Brewzzi Sampler tray - all pours were in small flute tasting glasses, approx 6 oz (healthy pours). This was the seasonal selection - pour is clear dark brown with a smallish off white head. Aroma is mild roast, along with a milk sweetness. As with all the other Brewzzi beers, very subdued nose. Taste is a nice pine hop and roast malt combination. Simple, but clean and well balanced. Palate is light to medium bodied with a nice soft carbonation. The hops give this a nice dry fresh finish. The last beer I tried on the sampler tray, and my favorite.
Brewzzi Irish Stout;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Stout;Brewzzi Microbrewery;On draft - Stogies and Stouts at Dunedin Brewery 02/08/07. Poured the standard stout look. The aroma is very light and I can just make out some roastiness. The flavor started out with a watery mouthfeel that created a neutral taste. Then some of the flavors showed up in the form of roasted malts, a bit of burnt malts that combine with a vague hoppiness to create a slightly dry, bitter and nearly astringent quality. Since the flavors were so subtle nothing really jumps out and seems out of place yet there really isn’t enough there either.
Brewzzi Irish Stout;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Stout;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft at the brewpub. Fairly roasty aroma with coffee-tinged components and a fairly robust dose of hops. The body is a dull matte blacka nd holds a thin mocha head that is both bubbly and diminishing. Fairly hoppy fore melds with the roasted/bitter notes of the grains and some mild chocolate and dark chocolate notes to pull out some decent flavor, but the watery finish shows a lack of follow through and left me fairly underwhelmed on the whole.
Brewzzi Irish Stout;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Stout;Brewzzi Microbrewery;My trepidation in trying brewzzi's was unfounded. This was a seasonal batch according to the waiter and to his own admission better than the black dog stout. This was a tad hoppy for a stout and almost reminded me more of a porter. Think Rogue shakespeare stout. Lots of burnt characters in this: nose, palate, finish. Very smoothe and clean. Finishes with hops. I just wish they wouldn't serve it in iced up glasses.
Vinga Export;Smedjebacken, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Munkbo Ångbryggeri;Bottled. Dark golden with average head. Spicy, flowery hop aroma. Dry with hard, sharp and thin mouthfeel. Good hop presence and salty, bitter finish.
Ring O Bells Tipsy Trotter;Launceston, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Ring O Bells;First tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 2002. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear dark garnet in colour with a thin white head. Fruity citrus note in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a digestive biscuit base with thick cut marmalade and golden syrup. Strong floral notes apparent in the long bitter aftertaste. Finish is malty with a fruity citrus bite of orange and pommegranate. A decent ESB but surely not in the Strong Ale category?

Bischofshof Export Hell;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Bischofshof;Nice pale gold colour. Rather sluggish and low on fizz out of the bottle, leading to a rather flat mouthfeel for a lager. Restrained aroma with hints of tropical fruit, but nothing very pronounced and certainly not much in the way of malt. Clean and fresh, with some lemon, throughout the palate, ending up quite acidic, but the finish is short. OK, but it gets dragged down by the dull mouthfeel. Not really my thing either. 500ml bottle (not bottle conditioned) from beersofeurope.co.uk

Sweet cookie spread with a slightly rancid salted butter flavour. Peanuts. In fact, slightly stale candied peanuts. Interesting - but not really my thing.

Delafield Hopfenteufel Altbier;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at Delafield Brewhaus. Poured hazy medium amber with a sticky cap of whitish head.. nice lacing followed it down. The aroma picked up sweet, toasted caramel and bready notes first and foremost.. floral character emerged with warmth.. very sweet overall. The flavor was sweet as well, with dark fruits and toasty caramel leading.. a touch smoky on the back-end, also picking up some earthy and fruity bitterness.. OK balance. Grainy sugars throughout the palate, along with sharpness from the bitters and carbonation.. spicy and warmer feel than it should’ve had.. this seemed under-attenuated.
Delafield Hopfenteufel Altbier;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Delafield Brewhaus;Draught at the pub. Pours a hazy amber with a clumpy film of off-white head. Leaves wide swathes of lacing down the glass at first which settles in to a spidery array of white lines. Aroma is a surprising citrusy hops. Flavor is a little odd, sweet and piney but lacking backbone. Thin feel, mild lingering bitterness.
Delafield Hopfenteufel Altbier;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Delafield Brewhaus;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Delafield, Wisconsin. Hazy, reddish brown pour, a filmy, tan head, potent piney hoppiness and a dry finish, very well done!

As I got deeper into the beer, the bitterness faded a little, letting a bit of caramel come forward. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Interesting beer.

Rich fruity nose of orange, pear and melon, yeasty, hints of honey, ginger, sweet white wine, peppermint, straw and a faint sulphuric note reminiscent of fried egg. Fresh apply onset with citrussy freshness, full enough mouthfeel with strong carbonation, smooth caramelly malt background, drying from the middle onwards, finishing mildly hoppy. I usually do not like the Bouillon beers that much, but this certainly is one of their better brews, well-balanced and tasteful.

Audomaroise Blonde à la Rhubarbe / Bière des Hayettes;Saint-Omer, France;Flavored - Other;Audomaroise;Big 750ml swing top bottle. BBE Sep 04. Opens with an explosive pop, but beer stays steady in the bottle. Hazy pale yellow with mouse head. Aroma is initially co2 and rhubarb. Moussey, sharp, prickly mouthfeel. Metallic taste, especially in the finish, is dominant. When the co2 has burned off what’s left is a soft, laid back, gently fruity beer of little character.
Audomaroise Blonde à la Rhubarbe / Bière des Hayettes;Saint-Omer, France;Flavored - Other;Audomaroise;Bottled. Hazy golden, rich lively head. Fruity and sweet with dense, clean mouthfeel. The rhubarb flavour is there, but it’s well hidden. Balanced, but too restrained to be really interesting.
Audomaroise Blonde à la Rhubarbe / Bière des Hayettes;Saint-Omer, France;Flavored - Other;Audomaroise;yellow-gold colour, slight white head, not very stable. Flowery, slightly sourish nose. The suggestion is rhubarb, but that might be the label hinting. Taste is at first very neutral, then a real vegetable flavour emerges. However, this does not remind me of rhubarb at all. Slightly gingerish, or galanga root, rather - or an aroma of water-paint. Good carbonation, not too much, neither too little. A slight acidity rounds off quite nicely. Very restrained beer. I would have preferred the rhubarb more outspoken, but i can live with it.

Bluegrass Russian Imperial Stout;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bluegrass Brewing Company;"Had I known this beer wasn't rated, I would've made more notes. This is a solid RIS with a decent caramel colored head. The flavor and finish are roasty and bitter, not as sweet and malty as some. The only detractor was a noticeable amount of diacetyl (buttery flavor). Without that, it would've been close to ""excellent."""

Fujizakura Heights Rauch;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Smoked - Rauchbier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;300ml keg at Raku Beer, Hiroshima, Japan (¥800): This one was definitely a beer that surprised me & went down far easier than I'd expected, particularly considering how little I've enjoyed pretty much ever other rauchbier that I've tried. The nose & taste thankfully weren't as pronounced or overpowering as I'd anticipated, there was a lot coming through but it seemed more balanced with this one & the bread malts helped things in that department too. Further on & some earthy malts made a surprising appearance which helped this one to become the only rauchbier I've managed to finish & it's by far the best of the style that I've ever tried too.
Fujizakura Heights Rauch;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Smoked - Rauchbier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Aroma is lots of ham. Which i hate. Some bready malts as well. Taste is some sourness but the bitter salty ham has it all. Also kind of watery. Not for me.

Big nose of apple, cinnamon and spice. A great christmas smelling beer, even though I had it in October. Rich full bodied, but perhaps a bit too clovey and estery for my liking.

Asahi Fujisan;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;I really liked this. Used to drink it on the way up Fuji - by car that is. It is/was a good example of the style and good solid yeasty nose, dry and crisp. Sparkling on the tongue, quick clean finish.
Asahi Fujisan;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;0,35 l can, thanks larsga. Grassy hops, rather light, but there is some malty body. OK, but not very exciting.

Asahi Fujisan;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;I bought a can of the premium fuji-san on a recent trip to Japan and cracked in open without really knowing what to expect. A strong hoppy flavour and the alcohol really seems to hit you quickly. A darkish colour and a full body make this one of the better Japanese beers. Still you couldn’t have more than a few of these.
Asahi Fujisan;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;A golden/Orange color with an off-white head. A slight malty scent. A mildly sweet malt flavor with just a bit of a bitter follow. Better than the vast majority of other Japanese Macro Lagers.
Asahi Minori Zanmai;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;Typical clear yellow color and sweet rice krispy aroma of most Japanese macro brews. Plain, bland and watery with a bit of sweetness. Nothing noteable but not disgusting like some others I've had.

Hideji Inoshishi Weizen (Darken Boar Wheat Special);Nobeoka, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Hideji Beer Brewery;Bottle from Tanakaya shop in Tokyo. Copper-colored dunkelweizen that’s light on spice and tastes a lot like their White Weizen but for the gobs of sweet malt - very much like caramel malt. No hops to be found, really. A sweet, very wheaty malt bomb. Nicely done, guys!!!! One of my favorite dunkelweizens, as they’re usually higher in alcohol than I like, but this is only 4.5%.
Hideji Inoshishi Weizen (Darken Boar Wheat Special);Nobeoka, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Hideji Beer Brewery;"Also called ""Darken Boar Wheat Special"" on the label in English. Deep cloudy orange, but not very active. Some ripe fruit wheat style aroma and something almost medicine like, not quite clove, closer to menthol mixed with clove honey. That ""whatever it is"" comes out as a tartnes that leans toward lambic. Loads of sediment eventually smooth out a bit of the tartnes. I have encountered a similar tartness in Hitachino wheat over here, thought it was too young, but maybe thery are going bad on the shelves. Otherwise, calling it a German wheat is not quite right, perhaps its an emerging style from these Nippon brewers. In either case, I will have to say it doesN't work for me."

Syrupy body, more sweetness with some bitterness that kicks in mid-palate to finish. Well-balanced. Maybe a tad young, but I’m not a big barley wine fan anyway. Decent I guess.
Nasu Kogen Nine-Tailed Fox Barleywine;Nasu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Nasu Kohgen Beer Company;Draught at Keyaki. 2015 version. Still quite green, bozy and unbalanced, average really. Tried a 2010 version last year which was quite dusty and probably past its prime. Still don’t get the hype about that one, price doesn’t make much sense either.

Pours nice amberish golden, small head. Looking beautiful and fresh. Aroma is sweetish, some honey, malt character and also some herbal bitterness. First sip reveals some sweetness, herbal bitter flavour intensifies a bit but is still balanced with the strong and sticky body. Nice, but definitely too young - this beer would taste terrific after a few years of ageing. I even feel a bit guilty to drink it in this not-prime condition as the flavours are still edgy, somewhat green and still need more time to come together.

Surprisingly elegant aroma with floral and honey notes. Taste is slightly syrupy but rather drinkable. Also very light and delicate on the tongue.

Baird Rising Sun Pale Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle from COSTCO variety 6-pack. Pours darker orange, well, you can even say its lightly hazy amber. Malty nose, bit of caramel, some light aromatic hop character but mainly wet malts and some light sour character. Tastes has malt backbone, somewhat rough or unpolished feel, light sweetness and quite a lot of bitterness. Again, not the best condition - but it was released in COSTCO just recently, so the beer should not be that old. Maybe a bit heat-damaged? That means I should drink other beers from my 6-pack quickly as well. Overall decent but the same beer has tasted much better in the past.

Pouring a deep amber color I can see how this evolved into their Red Rose Amber Ale. A biscuity sweet caramel nose. The taste is a nice chewy maltiness with nuts, light fudge and caramel. The aftertaste gives you a roasty chocolate kind of vibe. Tasty, I think I like this more than the Amber - cheers guys. Paired with a honeydew melon it really made the flavors of both pop bringing out some citrus notes, yum. 3.5-3.6
Baird Teikoku IPA;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA;Baird Brewing Co.;A bit too sweet and tired hop aroma. After trying five really good beers from the brewery today I expected more. Not a good beer, but not a bad one neither.

Baird Angry Boy Brown Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Brown Ale;Baird Brewing Co.;250ml Keg at Baird's Harajuku Taproom, Tokyo (¥600): Quite a pleasant offering from Baird, albeit one that came through slightly lighter than expected but at least it was fresh & had some bitterness showing too. The beer was easy to drink & balanced with some subtle hops showing without being overly pronounced & overall the beer was quite a clean, sessionable offering that was well worth trying too.
Baird Angry Boy Brown Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Brown Ale;Baird Brewing Co.;"English-style brown ale from this English-owned Japanese brewery, bottle bought at Heilig Hart’s webshop. Tightly lacing, irregular, moussy, pale greyish white, stable head over a lightly hazy, translucent ruddy mahogany brown beer with coppery red hue. Aroma of pink peppercorns, red bell pepper, caramel candy, freshly cut red apple, raw rhubarb, cooked turnip, red beetroot, horseradish even, unripe peach, redcurrant, grape peel, sourdough, damp soil, dried old orange peel, unripe blue plum, light grapefruit juice, cloves, vague liquorice. Fruity onset, lots of red apple crispness, hints of peach, pear and some light pineapple, sweetish core with mildly souring edges, medium carbo, slick and supple mouthfeel. Light but well-dosed malt body, with a nutty, fuller, caramelly sweetish side to it on the one hand and a sharper, cereally graininess on the other side but adding a bitterish toasty quality later on, bit resiny, with ongoing fruity aspects; ends dryish, with sourish impressions lingering alongside a herbal, softly spicy and lightly citrus peel-like hop bitterishness which remains elegant and subtle, penetrating the bittersweetish, nutty and toasty malts with a soft bitterness without becoming overpowering as would be the case in an American-style interpretation of this beer genre. Remains crisp, fruity and juicy, nothing really complex or otherwise ambitious going on here, but to the point, very quaffable and elegant. Has the lightness and quenching features of any proper English brown ale - a style remarkably diminishing in its country of origin. Fits its style denominator quite well."
Baird Angry Boy Brown Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Brown Ale;Baird Brewing Co.;330 mL bottle shared by ebone1988 for the stupid book. The pour is a mahogany brown color with a light egg shell colored ring of head and maybe a spot or two of lace. The aroma is seeet and candy forward. There is a little bit of bitter malt and a light toffee on the back end. Very light. The flavor is a little sharper. The alcohol up front is a bit of a turn off for me. There is a light fruitiness and the candy is there. The alcohol is overwhelming the other items. The mouth feel is a little light but decently carbonated with a lingering malty alcohol coming through heavily. Not too bad. 6 4 6 4 14
Baird Kurofune Porter;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Porter;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle. A- Mild tart cherry, roasty. A- Dark brown color, dark liquid, beige head. T- Roasty, leather, cocoa, watery. P- Medium body, slightly thin texture, slightly flat carbonation, weak finish. O- Should start by saying this was 4 years old (3 past the best by date) so it was bound to be a tad less than desirable. Rather weak and a bit dry. Tasted like stale weak coffee water.
Baird Kurofune Porter;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Porter;Baird Brewing Co.;A lighter porter, with flavors of coffee and chocolate. Has a thinner feel. Appearance is medium brown at best. I thought this was a European porter because of the flatter feel and density, but noticing from Japan...which kind of explains it. Good beer...I just prefer something heavier and more robust.

Victory Milltown Mild;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);This beer is a very interesting beer, in the fact that is actually a small beer, and not really a traditional mild per say. So what exactly is a small beer? It isn’t really a style, but a very old brewing practice, where brewers would actually get two beers out of one mash. When a brewery would do a strong beer, such as an old ale/barleywine with a high gravity wort, they would actually sparge again, and use the second runnings of the mash, to make what was called a small beer. Small beers of course, would be lighter in color, alcohol, and flavor, making them perfect session or drinking beers. They were sold for much cheaper than the old ale, and were the drink of the common man who didn’t have all that much money for beer at the time. Victory’s Milltown Mild is a small beer in that sense, as it is brewed from the second runnings of their world class barleywine Old Horizontal. Milltown Mild comes in at a very modest 3.3% abv, and is served cask conditioned, pulled from a beer engine at the brewery. Milltown Mild pours to a beautiful, bright, deep golden color with a thick and creamy white head, from the sparkler used on the swan of the beer engine, and a very soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is very nice, with aromas of light sweet malty aromas, and hints of grassy hop aroma. The palate is very soft and lean, with some good biscuity/toasty malt flavors, and just a slight touch of ripe fruit. Milltown Mild finishes slightly malty/fruity, and refreshing as well. I could drink a lot of this beer!
Brewbakers Surf City Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;12oz bottle-A light amber body with a small off white head and an aroma of malts and hops. Taste of the same but much better than the blond. Could of been worse.

Brewbakers Surf City Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;During my stay in Aniheim to take the family to Disneyland, this was one of only two local beers I could find. All stores had imported beers or the Macros. This beer safely made it with me across the country traveling in my dirty laundry bag. Still it had a sizable head and nice red color. Alittle yeast at 1st. JB and I enjoyed this 24 oz bottle while barbecuing.
Brewbakers Surf City Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;Hazy red orange with big head. Nice flowery aroma.

Brewbakers Surf City Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) Ladies and gentlemen, step right up. Welcome to a review chronicling a momentus occasion, for what you are about to read will fill you with awe. What I have here is a bottle of Brewbakers beer that is NOT infected! Yes folks, as astonishing as it might sound, believe it! And not only is it not infected, it’s not even a horrible tasting beer! Okay, it’s not the greatest flavor, but I’m just happy it isn’t sour. It’s fairly malty and very sweet, but the sweetness is sugary rather than malty. Mild hops is barely detectable, so this is just a sweet beer, but for some reason, though one-dimensional and pedestrian, I think it’s reasonably enjoyable. Nose echoes the sweet, malty flavor. Dark amber color with a ruddy tint. Small off-white head maintains a thin layer for awhile, and some small patches of lace are left on the glass. Thanks for attending my review, now exit carefully and have a great evening. Come back soon!
Brewbakers Surf City Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;Light amber color with a smallish tan head. Sweet malt alcohol aroma. Taste was pure garbage malt with an almost as bad caramel. Thin bodied. I wanted to brush my teeth after this one.

Brewbakers Surf City Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;Pale clouded amber, decent head formation. Subdued aroma, clean malts and a hint of fruit. Relatively clean palate, a touch of caramel, a touch of sugar, sour hoppiness in the finish. Not much emphasis or anything going on.
Audomaroise Ambrée à la Chicorée / Bière des Cossettes;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;Bottle 75cl, a cloudy amber beer with nice head very creamy.

This was a real gusher out of the bottle, unsure why this was so, it had been left still for some time & lightly chilled. Some sweet malts and yeast, light fruitiness although this is a very slight astringent bitter note (chicoree) otherwise it is fine. A6 A3 T6 P3 Ov13 3.1
Audomaroise Ambrée à la Chicorée / Bière des Cossettes;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;Couple of pints at The Penguin. Pours a not especially attractive murky copper with a tall, lurid yellow-cream head that trembles like blancmange. Slightly sharp, yeasty aroma with suggestions of rhubarb, liquorice Allsorts (especially the purple ones) and...the pig pen. Bright and yeasty with plenty of rhubarb/apple fruit, a suggestion of spice, ladles of oak...and those Allsorts again. There’s quite a yeasty, autumnal English feel to this one, and it’s drinkable but a bit tedious by the 750ml bottle.
Audomaroise Ambrée à la Chicorée / Bière des Cossettes;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;Bottle@Home.Very spicy aroma with a fruity sourness. Hazy/cloudy amber, yellow head, good lace. Sweet, fruity sourness, quite spicy, light bitterness. Soft mouthfeel.
Audomaroise Ambrée à la Chicorée / Bière des Cossettes;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;Brasserie Audomaroise, Saint Omer. Tap. This is the amber with some chicory flavour - slight coffee, nettles, endive, braised celery heart, celariac, brown sugar and raisins. Sounds good, but it’s all a bit blurry - and having a lot of flavours is not in itself a great thing, it’s how the flavours work together that matters. So, points for originality and being intriguing, but minus points for pulling away from being aesthetically pleasing.
Audomaroise Ambrée à la Chicorée / Bière des Cossettes;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;"75 cl swingtop bottle ""Ambrée à la Chicorée"". Hazy amber, nice creamy offwhite head.

Audomaroise Ambrée à la Chicorée / Bière des Cossettes;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;Bottle. Brownish/red beer with a steady bubble based head.

Audomaroise Ambrée à la Chicorée / Bière des Cossettes;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;Bottled. Hazy amber colour. Restrained, but very peculiar aroma, for which I struggle to find descriptive words. Fairly sweet, notes of caramel, salty finish. Ann odd experiment.
Audomaroise Ambrée à la Chicorée / Bière des Cossettes;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;Amber, slightly hazy. Very thick, foxy head, fast collapsing. Nose is like caramelised, slightly burnt, bitterish. Faint aroma's anyway. taste is quite bitter, obviously. Chicory, not coffee. There's quite some malt too. Retronasal the bitter gets stronger. Mouthfeel isn't very full, despite the malt. A bit oily, specially on the palate. Aftertaste consists of burnt caramel-like flavour. As clearly all beers of this brewer, very restrained profile. With chicory, perhaps for the best.

Green Flash Ruby Red Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Green Flash Brewing Company;a very session-able brew that pours a thin red with white head. Low IBU crisp dry and refreshing. Fairly priced widely available.
Green Flash Ruby Red Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Green Flash Brewing Company;"Enjoyed via 12 oz bottle. Pours a nice deep red color. Initially, I thought it might be similar to Hop Head Red or another one of their hop-forward examples. However, I was surprised to get heavy notes of malt in both the aroma, as well as on the palate. Definitely a ""Dusseldorf"" Alt, the drinker gets notes of Munich malt flavors, balanced to a pretty fair extent by the use of what I sensed to be German noble hops. It is a shame that this one is retired (I must have just lucked out and got an old bottle), as it was quite enjoyable."

Buckeye Arthur Ale Altbier;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Buckeye Brewing Company;On tap at the Beer Engine. Poured a orangey amber with very very light carbonation and a fast-fading off-white head. I can’t place the flavor - it reminds me of another style. I guess it’s the resinous hops but it’s more muted here than in the style I’m trying to name which I guess might be an IPA or a DIPA. A nice brew but not for another pint.

Carolina Beer Co. Light;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carolina Beer Company;"Draught. Think Sam Adams light with a bit less flavor. This is a decent take on the ""light beer"" idea. No off flavors or anything else gross on this one, but no pleasing flavors or body. This is really watery, but does manage to produce a nod at European hop flavor and maybe a drop of malt sweetness. Yeah, in summary this has no real bad taste and it kind of tastes like beer."
Carolina Beer Co. Light;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carolina Beer Company;Pretty decent light beer. The only Carolina Blonde for me is NEEZY (with her hair died blonde). She is my Carolina Brunette. But this is a pretty tasty light beer, IMO.

Unionsbräu Altmünchner Dunkel;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Unionsbräu Haidhausen;My Bottom Line : Earthy hops and toasted, caramelized malts roam within this Dunkel’s foamy, sugary mouthfeel. Further Personal Perceptions : -A clinging sheet of foam decorates the coppery mahogany. -Fruity edges add diversity. -Malts seem to provide more sugar than actual malt flavors. -The flavor profile is not really cohesive, but it remains flavorful throughout. On tap at the brewery gasthof.
Unionsbräu Altmünchner Dunkel;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Unionsbräu Haidhausen;Smooth, tasty dunkel that packs a lot of malty flavor, more so than some of its counterparts making it a great easter-time beer.

Unionsbräu Altmünchner Dunkel;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Unionsbräu Haidhausen;From tap at the brewpub. Pours clear and golden dark brown with a small tan head. Roasted malt, breadish and mild caramelish aroma. Flavour has the same with a nice sweetness and good bitterness to match this.
Unionsbräu Altmünchner Dunkel;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Unionsbräu Haidhausen;At Unionsbräu in Munich. Does not have as pronounced a unique aroma as Unionsbräu’s Helles(actually a Kellerbier) or Maibock. A decent dunkel but not super exciting. A little thin in body and a little lighter in flavor than I would want. Still decent. Serving: Tap
Unionsbräu Altmünchner Dunkel;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Unionsbräu Haidhausen;Dark brown with nice thin head. Hints of diacetyl, toffee on the nose. Butter palate with some toast and light toffee. Still drinkable, but not by much.
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewpub, amber-orangeish color, with a white head, floral hops accent, with a note of orange fruitiness, toasted malt in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a herbal fruitiness from the sterling and saaz hops, earthy spiciness, zesty citrusy note, leading towards a fruity hop bitterness finish.
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;Draught pint at CBC 5/5/06. Pours a light coppery color with a small off white head. Nose is light apples, some toasted malt notes. Palate is clean and smooth. Flavor is lightly hoppy, some toasty and spicy notes. FInish is lightly bitter.
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;Draft at Bukowski, Boston: poured slightly cloudy yellow in a pint glass with a thin wisp of ahead. Light banana aroma. Mild apple. Decent body. The flavor is thin: light lemon, somewhat grainy malt flavor. Decent but kind of lacking. 6-3-5-3-13 Draft at Brewery: Pours orange with a small white head. Earthy aroma with hints of chocolate. Light citrus flavor. Lightly carbonated. Good.
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;Moderately sweet and malty Vienna character with some toasted malts and no hops notable in the nose. Hazy glowing copper-tan coloured body is topped by a dense, fine-bubbled, white head that recedes slowly to a persistent cover with excellent lacing. Toasted, nutty, malty and sweet flavour with light, spicy, herbal hops and fair balancing bitterness in the dry finish. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a creamy texture. On tap at the brewpub with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;New England Road Trip Easter ’05 with MartinT, tiggmtl and Rastacouere, beer #64. Sample at the brewpub. Ridiculously generous, lasting head with thick gorgeous lacing tops the pure gold body...herbal, grainy sourdough nose feeds my desire...luscious body with complex dissimilar leafy greens jousting at caramel, bitter smokiness, and vanilla cream, but alway fresh grass underlies and an odd pungent farmy texture coats the superb mouthfeel as tongue leads to throat and ecstasy. Easily one of the best Viennas around...
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;Funky, cheesy wort and citrusy flowers waltz languorously atop the luxurious green Saaz hops...Really reminiscent of L’Amère à Boire’s succulent Cerna Hora...An undying head and nutritious malt body reach perfection and send the soul high above...
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;Hazy gold, superbly laced white head, fully lasting after 30 minutes. Strong Saaz nose, floral and lemony. As clean as it gets. The melting between the Vienna malts and hops is remarkable to say the least. Grassy rosewater. Very appealing. Grainy malty palate, VERY malty, but unfortunately not my favourite variety. The bitterness is very solid, balancing. Now I know my friends all liked it more than me, but I’m with them on the brewing efforts part. It’s just unfortunate that this wasn’t a dortmunder with the almost exact same recipe using all pils malt instead, because I would have given out the big marks on that. I just don’t enjoy the grainy Vienna as much as the biscuity and charming chewy pils types. Marvellous April beer, a little hidden treasure some will say.
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;On draught at CBC, March 16, 2005. Served in a tumbler, well-chilled but not overly so, this beer appeared a copper-yellow with light orange tints. Moderate amount of off-white head is well-retained. Slight chill haze. Aroma is not overwhelming, due in part to it being served in a shaker. Husky graininess, light pils malt and toasted malt, with a dry, yet spicy, hops bitterness (saaz). Flavor is much more explosive than the aroma would suggest. Big dose of sweet toffee and honey up front, great malting, with a smooth, lightly dry, saaz bitterness. Crisp and clean on the finish, some light citrus hops notes are perceived as well (sterling). Body is medium to medium-full but yet wonderfully drinkable, as are so many of CBC’s low gravity creations. You can almost taste the cracked grains in this, as you can in the Regatta Golden. Malt is varied, as well, with some light caramel, toffee, toastiness and honey. A touch of fruitiness is also apparent up front, from the yeast and provides more depth. A bit of astringency on the end, from the graininess and drying hops effect, but it’s minor, and I’d rather this beer tend more dry than sweet. Carbonation is soft and bubbly, no alcohol apparency. Keep em comin, CBC!
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;Deep golden to light orange in color with a small white head. Huge malt aroma, with a touch of bread and a trace of floral hops. Clean crisp malt flavor with subtle floral hops and a slighlty sweet finish.Full malty palate for the style, which I feel is much better than people are giving it credit for, a good session lager.
Cambridge Vienna Gold;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cambridge Brewing Company;Growler: Clear orange with a thin white head. Fresh malty aroma, full bodied and ends slightly sweet. Too light for my tastes.
L Alezane;Bailleul, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Ferme Beck;Leicht karamelliger Antrunk, leicht säuerlich, hefig-herb. Im Mittelteil deutlich aber dennoch verhalten fruchtig, dies geht langsam in einen seichten Malzton über. Dieser Malzton steigert sich im Abgang und wird würziger, auch die Herbe wird etwas kräftiger. ZUdem ist das Bier hier relativ süß. Nettes Exemplar. Vielen Dank an den Doppelbock für das Bier!

L Alezane;Bailleul, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Ferme Beck;Wow, a nicely balanced biére de garde, very drinkable and yet with plenty of unique character. I’m thinking that down below are some ratings of old or off bottles. Big thanks to Sebastian for bringing this 75 cL bottle to me. Tall, off-white and bubbly head recedes, over a thickly cloudy, coppery reddish-orange beer. Smells like caramel malts but also sweet oranges and a bit creamy, and I’m thinking of orange creamsicles. Interesting. Flavor is an immediately tasty and balanced combo of lightly sweet oranges and caramel riding along on lively carbonation into a dry, moderate bitterness. Incredible balance, so easy to drink. Really, really lovely. I hope to get some more and drink it fresh one of these days.
L Alezane;Bailleul, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Ferme Beck;Sampled at the RBESP 2004 Lactic sour, green wood and hayish. Cloudy orange, low head. Lightish body. Couldn’t really get used to it...
L Alezane;Bailleul, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Ferme Beck;A hazy orange beer with a small collapsing orange head. The aroma is sweet with notes of coriander and yeast. The flavor is sour and malty - I’m wondering if it was over the best before date?
L Alezane;Bailleul, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Ferme Beck;Hazy dark blond. Straw-like, dusty aroma. Pale malt notes in the flavour, with a slight lacticity in the finish. OK beer, but a little too yeasty.
L Alezane;Bailleul, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Ferme Beck;Bottled. Cloudy orange colour, pale orange/off-white head. Floral nose with a big yeast presence. Quite malty for being a ’Garde’. A bit sour and lactic. Dry bitter finish.

L Alezane;Bailleul, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Ferme Beck;Also this one is 1 year old. Copper color. Nice aroma, almost like the Hommelpap (fruity, with oranges…). Quite simple, not as much sweet, with some sourness and a late bitterness. Thanks Joris for sharing this bottle.

Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at the brewpub. Deep gold in color (unless you are looking just at the brown paper poke) with a small white head. This has the aroma of enantiomeric alpha-D-glucose and likely has plenty of it instead of malt. It produces the desired effect of corn grain ethanol in beer form. Not great, but good kitsch.
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap @ the brewpub. Dark golden coloured with a medium sized head. Malty with notes of metal, fruit, bread, pines, alcohol and grains.
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Chicago Trip. Monday 12:30+. On tap. The funnest beer I don’t like. Tried for a malt liquor and succeeded. Supposedly the clientèle gets the joke and pints are served in a paper bag. Don’t quite smell the gasoline but the taste is bang on. As it warms the gasoline comes through. Orange-copper.
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at Piece.. served in a fitting Piece-stamped brown paper bag. Poured a clear, deep coppery-amber with lots of rising carbonation and a well-retained cap of off-white head. The aroma was of sweet corn and caramel with some floral accents and something akin to Candi sugar.. peppery spices in there too. The flavor was a sweet blend of grainy corn and alcohol with what felt like some sort of Belgian-inspired spicy yeast.. warm and peppery spices and booze at the back-end.. oddly arousing. There were waves of sweetness and spiciness on the palate.. medium-bodied and almost syrupy.. grainy throughout. Warm finish. It’s Dolemite, BABY!
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Pours an amber color with a white head. Aroma is malty with some corn. Flavor is malty, with some corn and a clean finish. Goes pretty well with their pizza.
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Draught, passed around the table by TheBeerCellar2 to myself, NachlamSie, and shp555. First of all, the damned thing comes in a pint glass in a paper bag with the Piece logo on it. I’m giving bonus appearance points for presentation there. Past that, it’s definitely a malt likka. Lots of corn, but actually in a sort of fresh way. A weird sugariness fills up the mouth and gives it very round edges. Definitely nothing to be excited about, but it blows most other malt liquor out of the water.
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Draught courtesy of TheBeerCellar2 during my Dark Lord excursion. Well, I wasn’t too excited about this one, but really curious. The pour is darker gold than most other malt liquors I’ve seen. Pretty much what I would expect from the style, but surprisingly clean given the constraints of the style that usually spell disaster. To keep this beverage this crisp and relatively balanced while using corn, no hops, and a alcohol content at 8% is pretty impressive. There are flavors of corn, a little sucrose, slightly bitter malty flavors on the back of the palate. Probably not something I would drink again because it does have all the characteristics of a style that doesn’t do it for me, but I was much happier with this than the one other premium malt liquor I’ve tried.
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;"Draught, served in a pint glass surrounded by a small brown paper bag: dark golden appearance, with a thin white cream…smells absolutely like a malt liquor: sweet corn, honey, bready, malt filled alcohol and hay. Sweet, alcohol malt flavour with a bit of tang. The initial flavour is much better than the other malt liquors I have experienced and makes me wonder at the amount of few adjuncts used in the creation of this one: for the flavour is an even balance of sweet sticky malt and crisp hops; I didn’t think it was allowed to use noticeable hops in a malt liquor…anyway, the finish does remain true to the style with a sour malt twinge and a slightly foul hop aftertaste…but this is one of the better tasting and easier drink malt liquors I have come across."
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Pours a nice straw color with good head and some lacing. Nice and clean with a good alcohol burn. Served in a pint glass with a paper bag with a Piece logo on it. It is a good brew that will creep up on you if you don’t watch out. It’s nice when a brewer brews something like this just for fun.
Piece Dolemite;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Malt Liquor;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;From what the bartender said, this brew had 9.5% alcohol and it tasted every bit of it. Malt taste was pretty good, fairly light with good carbonation. The alcohol gave it a real kick from start to finish. Each beer was served in a pint glass with a little paper bag around it. I’ve seen it done before, but still pretty fun.
Piece Dysfunctionale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Tasted on tap at Piece Pizzeria Brewery.

Piece Dysfunctionale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Tap at Piece. Pretty decent APA/IPA. Clean golden malt bill. Kind of a new school hop bill, but not as pronounced as its Chicago peers. Fruity, delicate hops. OK.
Piece Dysfunctionale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Pours orange honey amber with a creamy white head. Aroma brings sweet malty and hoppy oranges, a subtle blend of the two. Flavor of oranges and zesty malts, lightly sweet on the tongue on a smooth medium body.

Some splotches of lace are left behind. S: Nice balance between light fruit, grass and sweet malts. Definitely on the lighter end though and I really got to dig my nose in there to get anything. T: Taste is a little richer with some grassy hops, mild bitterness, a little citrus rind and the sweet, malty finish to give it a little balance. M: Medium to light bodied. Pretty drinkable with nice carbonation level as well. O: Solid overall. Nicely balanced, but I prefer several other offerings from Piece in the hops category.

Piece 4 Reverends Imperial Stout;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Draft: Deep black. Creamy, charred caramel head. Intense aroma of coffee bean, tar, peachy hops, and coconut shells. Black currant, rubber, mud, butter toffee, almond, and black cherry whispers. Asserts more vinous aspects as it warms. Softly firm, dense, creamy body. Beautiful creamed coffee notes and quite caramelly at first. Vague cherry, vanilla, powdery chocolate, and tingly vinous hints. Ink notes prevail throughout its entirety. Closes with hints of toastiness and pie crust alongside a ravishing blend of espresso, dark chocolate, and smoke. Muted tingly vinous notes. Overall a voluptuous Imperial marriage of caramel, coffee, vanilla, and chocolate.
Piece 4 Reverends Imperial Stout;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;"Draught [snifter]: (this rating is for the imperial stout they ""The Truth"" - I believe it is the same. . .) Deep ruby black w/ a lasting (it remained when the liquid was gone) dark brown creamy head. . .vinous and coating. Old fashioned instant coffee aroma mixed with large fresh whole coffee beans, hints of pine, basil and hops. Tremendous mocha coffee flavours that coat the mouth and offer a slight sweetness before hammering the palate with bitter dark chocolate and a strong bitter black coffee. Full body, but in the end it is over-powered by the coffee and is missing the complex fruits and other flavourful dimensions of a great imperial stout - though even Jule said ""Oh, my, that's good!"""
Piece J. Diddys Special Pale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Light golden amber with definate cascade hops aroma.

Piece Oktoberfest;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Draft on tap at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Surprised to find a new entry here. Pours a nice deeper copper hazy pour, nice glowing orange, amber glow. Frothy offwhite head atop is sizable, good stick around and lacing. Aromas are a bit carmelized, gentle earthiness, spice, faint florals and toast. Initial is medium bodied, touches of toast, biscuit and carmelized malt, faint dark fruit meets earthy hop, subtle spice. A gentle giryth but not as toasty or rich as other examples. Some toast, carmelized elements preach harder into that backend. Earthy hop, faint spice, but that malty life gives the character here. Finish is a bit toasty, carmelized and earthy, gentle spice and earthy hops. A bit spicy as we finish and it really lingers on. Different than your typical Okt. Solid. A sweeter nose leads to a more complex beer.
Piece Oktoberfest;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Draft at piece. Orange and cloudy with white head. Biscuits and malty earth tastes - slightly fruity. Very enjoyable Oktoberfest.

Nose is toasty malt and an herbal hop note. Very clean with faint sweetness. On tasting, rich and round malt. Clean and bready. Balanced bitterness overall. Great malt character, drying finish. Really solid Oktoberfest.
Piece Oktoberfest;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Flavor is a bit sweeter than many Octoberfest beers and I really appreciate that. Definite caramel note. Much more restrained on the maltiness than many Oktoberfests as well. I usually don’t like this style but this is one I did enjoy.
Piece Oktoberfest;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear earthy orange with a tan head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma is full of malts with notes of bread, hay and grain backed by just a hint of caramel sweetness. Flavor is similarly malty with mainly bread and hay notes backed by some sweet grains and a hint of caramel.
Piece Oktoberfest;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;"On tap at piece under the name ’octoberfist’.

Piece Oktoberfest;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Murky red brown with a small head. Light malt aroma with dry tannic toastiness and a touch of earthy hops. Dry and toasty flavor with a tannic bite and just a little sweetness. Coarse body. Not somethingij could get into. Needs some more malt and overall balance.
Piece Oktoberfest;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Pours a murky copper with no head, looks like a soda. Lightly toasted malt aroma. The flavor is almost correct, if not for being too light and the alcohol ruins it. Slightly nutty toasted malt, nice lagered flavor. I could see this recipe being reworked into something delicious.
Piece Rainbows and Unicorns;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Pretty mediocre for a Piece offering. I had it a bit too long ago to have many specific comments, but I remember it as weak, watery, and uninteresting.
Piece West Side Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Tap at brewery 7/6/0-cloudy yellow appearance with rocky thin head-aroma of citrus and grains-palate is full bodied for a wheat and definately something i could drink all day.
Piece West Side Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;"This barely cloudy Summer wheat is a nice ""little brother"" to their mighty ""Top Heavy Hefe""! Light and slightly fruity (not as much so as, say, Gumballhead) with a wheaty taste that doesn't fall towards the banana side, but more of a clean, hoppy, light citrus side. Refreshing and perfect with their spinich dip, but they also had FFF Gumballhead on tap, so my wife opted for that instead."

It poured golden body with floating particles and medium sized head above. Biscuit malt and fruity yeasty aroma. Slightly sweet flavor, slightly sour, touch of wood, coriander and other herbal spices. Medium to thinner body with slightly sweet finish. As we all agreed on tasting, a fine beer, no obvious flaws, but so ordinary that it can easily become boring.

Saint Amand La Raoul;Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, France;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasserie des Sources (formerly: de St. Amand);"Yellow-gold with greenish shine throughout. Very thick white head, big bubbles, stable. Grain, pale malt, maybe some candi sugar in the nose. Whilst pouring I had a drain-odour, but that was immediately gone. Taste is quite dry, bitterish with an outspoken pale malt underbuild. There is candi sugar. Retronasal, the bitterness definitely gets hopcharacter, together with a cheese-rind flavour. Quite clean palate, medium-bodied. Some alcohol, sugar and dry; no new aftertaste. Overall a rather strong blonde, not yet triple. Clean tasting. Named after a local folk-poet."

Three Floyds Gumballhead;Munster, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale - India / Hopfenweisse;Three Floyds Brewing Company;A tasty summer wheat beer but I guess I'm not getting the hype. Easy drinking wheat with some lemon notes but a bit of chalkiness on the back end.
Three Floyds Gumballhead;Munster, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale - India / Hopfenweisse;Three Floyds Brewing Company;At Trolls Pub Louisville. Blond colored beer with small white head and no carbonation. Hoppy floral aroma. Full palate. Finish is bitter sweet fruited.

Big Buck Honey Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Buck Brewery;Good head and lace, but not extreme. Filtered it shows a very clean yellow color. The touch of honey is done right, sweetness without being cloying.
Big Buck Polar Bear Brown Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Big Buck Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark red close to brown color with just a cap of a little white head that slides out into oblivion. No lace. The aroma had some semi-sweet nutty to caramel malts. Earthy bitter hops, some citrus. The flavor leaned into the malts fairly sweet. Hops make a good play to add a bigger than normal bitterness in this style. Aftertaste was full of the hops and so was the finish. The feel was between light and medium bodied. Carbonation felt just a touch over. ABV felt decent. Overall, as a brown ale fan, it’s hard to recommend this one. And Big Buck brews better beers than this, to be honest.
Big Buck Polar Bear Brown Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Big Buck Brewery;Weak head, some lacing. Slightly cloudy. Carbination was 'sharp' on the tongue. Overly hoppy aftertaste. My least favorite of five I tried on this particular evening.
Big Buck English Bitter;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Big Buck Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a decent looking hazed over brown color with light orange tints to it. There was a light lacing that came down from a one finger white foamy head once it died down. The smell had a mild burnt caramel maltiness to it to lead to that typical soapiness from a Bitter, but actually, its quite subdued than most Bitters I’ve had. The taste was mildly creamy sweet. Instead of the hops showing any kind of flavoring, it seemed like the malts were roasted enough to provide a slight bready to toasty effect. On the palate, this one sat at a light on the body with a pretty decent sessionability about it, if I wanted to have this again. The carbonation was there but subdued for the most part. Overall, it was not a bad Bitter. It wasn’t a bad beer to me, but not really a real Bitter.
Big Buck English Bitter;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Big Buck Brewery;Good head and strong lace. Golden brown color that was appealing. A bitter, but very mild, with almost none of the standard 'vinegary' taste associated with such brews.
Big Buck Doppelbock;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Buck Brewery;We tasted all of the beers at big buck today, and this was the best of current availability (the belgian strong being second). Nice and dark, great color, but an unimpressive head. Aroma and taste were malty and complex and nice, a little hops as part of the complexity. On the heavy side of medium body. Quite nice, that’ll be my drink of choice if I go there again.
Big Buck Doppelbock;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Buck Brewery;On tap, going on about 2-hr memory. Dark amber color, very nice head and retention. Especially sweet, particularly in the finish. Perhaps a nutty sweetness. Quite unique among the doppelbocks I’ve tried.
Big Buck Doppelbock;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Buck Brewery;Head and lace are good. My favorite of the five I tried this particular evening. Nice color and the right level of bitterness.
Big Buck Imperial Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Big Buck Brewery;"On tap at Big Buck, Gaylord. Part of the ""Brewer’s Private Gourmet Collection,"" listed at 12.7% ABV. Presumably this is close enough to this listing to rate here. Deep opaque brown/black body, thin ring of medium brown carbonation. Sweet nose with molasses and licorice. Chewy body with a ton of sweet chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and berries; smooth, silky, sweet, and rich. Little apparent alcohol despite the likely-inflated ABV."
Big Buck Imperial Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Big Buck Brewery;GABF 2006: Deep black color with a brown head. The aroma was of sweet roasted malt with some mild chocolate notes. The flavor was very sweet with a good bit of chocolate and roasted malt. The finish was warming to the point of just a light burning.

Big Buck Imperial Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Big Buck Brewery;Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival Saturday July 24, 2004. The draft brew poured a small head of finely sized brown colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a great lacing. The body was opaque and black in color with no visible carbonation. The aroma was strong with big roasted malts and a lingering roasted malty note. It had a mouth feel with strong roasted malt start and finish. The flavor also contained the same strong roasted malts. It was very good, but the roasted notes tended to overpower the rest of the beers highlights.
Big Buck Imperial Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Big Buck Brewery;Terribly unbalanced mesh of soy sauce, chocolate, and alcohol in the samples from the Michigan Summer Beer Fest. I saw more than one sample dumped to the ground after a small sip. Very strange aftertaste, chocolate-licorice and alcohol linger.
Big Buck Imperial Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Big Buck Brewery;Chocolate foam with reasonable lace. Pretty 'thin' taste going down and leaves a trace of burn with the slight medicine after taste.
Boundary Bay Dry Irish Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Boundary Bay Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a dark brown almost black color with an off white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Sly stringy lace. The aroma had some sweet to roasty graininess up front. Then some dark chocolate and a touch of coffee bean. The flavor took all of the prior mentioned aromas to blend and then add in a touch of earth and peat. Sly woody to peat to roasty aftertaste. Quick dry crisp earthy/peat/roasty sort of finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great smooth feel rolling all about over my tongue. Good carbonation. For the ABV, though low, it feels like right the brewer says it’s at. Overall, nicely done Irish dry stout, somewhat crushable.
Boundary Bay Dry Irish Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Boundary Bay Brewery;Dark. Dry cocoa, roasted, burnt malt. Chalky medium body with a dry finish. Very nice.

Boundary Bay Dry Irish Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Boundary Bay Brewery;On tap at Boundary Bay, pours an amber-tinged deep dark brown with a medium beige head.

Not too inspiring.
Boundary Bay Dry Irish Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Boundary Bay Brewery;"Draught at the brewpub Black color, with beige creamy head. Light aroma of cardboard, paper and roasted malt. Dry mouthfeel, smooth, but maybe because of some diacetyl there is also a light milky feeling, so it lands between Dry Stout and Milk Stout; ordinary bitterness. Easy."

Boundary Bay Dry Irish Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Boundary Bay Brewery;Draft at the Old Town in Ballard. On nitro, alas...but this beer is big enough to fight through that. Pours jet black and a wee bit chalky looking under a dense and creamy tan brick of nitromousse. Nice roasty nose with mild chocolate notes coming through. Creamy medium body, I mean really creamy silky smooth, with virtually no carb showing. Roasty chocolately mid palate, very rich and approachable and pleasant. Mild roasty finish. Very agreeable. Love to try this on CO2 some time.

Nice aromas of citrus and a touch of pine, a touch grainy as well . Low nitrogen level, lots of grapefruit in there, light to medium body, light caramel, lingering bitter finish.

Capitol City Imperial Stout;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Capitol City Brewing Company;Draft. Served in a goblet??? Very dark and opaque. Sweet and heavy, with chocolate flavor and aroma that is, perhaps, the strongest I’ve encountered. Some obvious alcohol in the aroma.

Capitol City Imperial Stout;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Capitol City Brewing Company;Cask at Shirlington. Thick, dark, and not too far from the Fuel (as I was informed that this was what Fuel is before the coffee is added). Rich aroma, and rich flavor. Fantastic chocolate flavors, and virtually no alcohol flavor. Don’t remember the head too well, but it certainly was thick.
Capitol City Imperial Stout;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Capitol City Brewing Company;This beer rocks! Pours as thick and dark as used motor oil. Burnt orange highlights when held up to bright light. No real head or lace to speak of. The aroma is of espresso, dark, Belgian chocolate, soy sauce and coffee grounds. The flavor has lots of alcohol, everything burnt, espresso and bitter-sweet chocolate. Very well-hopped. The alcohol and hops do a good job of balancing out the flavor. Full-bodied with a heavy, oily mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Lengthy, burnt, dry finish. Great, world class stuff! So much better than expected!

Goldhand Felsgold Premium Bier Urtyp;Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Metro Group (Metro, Real, Makro);"500ml can. Best before: 19/03/2012. It pours an industrial-looking gold with the typical ""too perfect"" looking bright white head. It leaves the typical spotty lacing. The smell is malty and grainy with some bready scents, some spiciness form the hops and some fruitiness. The flavor is industrial-tasting. But for industrial it isn’t horrible. Maybe due to the freshness. It has a slight wateriness, metallicness, and tartness, but also some pleasant nutty flavors, doughy malt, and a nice hop presence. It isn’t horrible but not something I would recommend."
Goldhand Felsgold Premium Bier Urtyp;Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Metro Group (Metro, Real, Makro);A can of fermented liquid malt extract. Nothing enjoyable about it. Apparently this brewery cannot turn it into a decent beer.
Summit Station Belgian Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Summit Station Restaurant & Brewery;Sparkling clear amber hue. What the heck is the commercial description all about. I entered it straight from the menu, but it’s not even close to being something I would consider golden or pale. The off-white head is medium-sized. Mostly, but not fully diminishing with minimal lacing. The aroma is very yeasty with heavy notes of coriander, clove, alcohol, light lemon and very light grapefruit. I detected Banana in the nose as well. Very Hefe-like. The flavor is very well balanced for a strong Belgian ale. Lightly sweet, spicey and fruity up front. Lightly bitter, spicey (allspice, cinnomon and clove) on the backside. Full-bodied with a fizzy and watery mouthfeel. Short, dry and crisp finish.

Pours clear yellow with a fine, creamy white head. Moderate raspberry aroma, touches of white grape. Light sweet flavor with cereal, straw, slight butter, drying raspberry. Light bodied with fine carbonation. Mild sweetness to finish, further mellow raspberry character, corn flakes, hay. So so.
Barrington Raspberry;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear golden yellow with a thin white head. Raspberry and wheat right from the beginning, crisp, sweet. Medium bodied, a little empty though moving quickly from raspberry to wheat and then finishing up with some crisp wheat bitterness and not much else.
Barrington Raspberry;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Sample at the brewpub. Pours gold with a white head. Smells of raspberries, some dry malt, dough. Tastes of hay, touches of tartness, some hints of raspberries. Some earthiness on the finish. Decent.
Barrington Raspberry;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Cloudy blonde body with a small white head. Only a little raspberries on the nose. Taste is not of the raspberry-juice kind. More like a dried raspberries and raspberries flavoured cotton-candy. Taste was dry straws with the residual sugar and sourness flavour or the raspberries but without the juice. Aggressive carbonation (a bit too much so). Highly drinkable fruity beer that I found surprisingly enjoyable. What’s happening to me? I actually like a girly beer. Ok, enough about this rating, I’ve got to go freshen-up.
Barrington Raspberry;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Has a very light golden color with some carbonation and a light raspberry smell. Taste is lightly of raspberry and finishes rather bland with little flavor. Overall this has got to be the worst beer from this brewery, I did not like it at all.
Zannekin Brune;Cassel, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Zannekin;Quite sour aroma - grapes. Brown with a low head. Sour lactic flavors, not pleasant really
Zannekin Brune;Cassel, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Zannekin;An unclear a brown beer with a small light brown head. The aroma is sour with notes of prunes. The flavor is also sour with notes of malt and prunes. Yuk.
Zannekin Brune;Cassel, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Zannekin;Bottled. Dark brown, light brown/yellow head, which is thin. Sour-ish up front, followed up by some toffe and notes of hops. Earthy, little vineous flavour with a sour-ish, lactic overall feel.
Zannekin Brune;Cassel, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Zannekin;Thanks Per, I liked this one! Dark brown pour with a medium brown head that won't go away! Aroma is a mix of hops that I usually associate with Jamtlands. It is earthy, like old twigs. It also as vinuous quality with some sourness. Interesting and tasty brew. Moderately dry finish. Excellent beer!
Zannekin Brune;Cassel, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Zannekin;Bottled. Ruby in colour. Vinuos aroma. Dry, yeasty, lively , funky and light bodied. Lightly soapy and orangey. Very pleasant.
Zannekin Brune;Cassel, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Zannekin;Very dark brown, nearly black. Yellowish-brown head, rather thin. Nose with chocolate cake and chocolate toffee. After a while, there is sourness in the nose as from wheat, or certain untreated grains. Like the cooking soup for mussels. Taste: eeehh! - very outspoken acidity. Special malts/grains used no doubt - including roasted barley. Wheat haze is not visible - but with such a deep-dark beer? There is definetely a retronasal arome of a fine, heavy cigar. Mouthfeel is very surprising: light and spritzy and ,at the same time well-bodied. Temperature and yeast culminate to give a more vineous character at the end. If I had to formulate a criticism, 't would be that the taste is so at odds with the looks of this beer. In fact, this beer is a combination of bière de garde, a dark Weizen and a Schwarzbier.

John Harvards California Common;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;Poured a cloudy orange brown color. Had a mild, light citrus hop aroma. Had a strong hop flavor with an aftertaste of old beer. It left some lacing on the glass. I thought for sure this was an American Pale Ale, I asked the bartender if he had the taps switched,
L Epi Noir;Paris, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;La Compagnie des Trois Epis;A little farty in the nose, sparkling amber color, almost no head. Very buttery in the middle - I hate diacytel-laden beers. Slighty dry toast-like finish. Oily mouth feel. Just a bad mix of flavors.
L Epi Noir;Paris, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;La Compagnie des Trois Epis;Housebrew, La Terverne de Nesle, yuck. Besides the terrible atmosphere the beer was'nt great either. Malty, grainy and a bit farty nose. Amber color, no head, soft carbonation. Sweet and grainy with a light bitterness, pricks and taste goes fast.
L Epi Blanc;Paris, France;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;La Compagnie des Trois Epis;Sulfury nose like a clogged drain, hazy pale orange color and no head - not a good start. Light citrusy maltiness with some vanilla. Was that cherries? short tight spice end. Very thin and watery. Overall pretty friggin' cheap stuff.
L Epi Blanc;Paris, France;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;La Compagnie des Trois Epis;La Taverne de Nesle, sulphury, acidic noste. Cloudy lemonjuice like color, brussels laces, flat carbonation. Pure lemon - maybe some peach. Watery finish.
Geelong Our Original Pale Ale;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Geelong Brewing;"Whilst working in Adelaide, myself and workmates ventured for a Friday bevvie and ordered a Pale. Grudges all round, we complained that the taps were infected as it was initially clear ""this isn’t Cooper’s"". Wasn’t that bad though! Poured a slightly hazy pale straw with a thin soapy white head. Little aroma. Mouth feel was decent with low carbonation and good body. Sweet castor sugar and bready yeast, quite gluggy and arguably lacking in definition with only a light hint of sour leafy hops. Finish is a little short and forgettable. Know nothing of the brewery and haven’t seen this beer advertised anywhere else in Adelaide. Still, it actually wasn’t that disagreeable a drop."
Geelong Our Original Pale Ale;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Geelong Brewing;Actually I didn’t think this was was too bad. Looks the goods with pale yellow gold colour, slightly cloudy. Sweetish nose with a waft of malt. Thick palate, again driven by sweetness although not necessarily malty. Tails a little at the finish and doesn’t really offer any hoppiness. Probably not for the purists but I can see some ’crowd pleaser’ appeal.
Geelong Our Original Pale Ale;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Geelong Brewing;Ewww.... I had this once before and thought it was pretty decent (and a dead ringer for Coopers Pale) but this time it was terrible. Really, REALLY yeasty aroma with some metallic notes. Tastes sweet and fruity like fruit cup cordial (or Fruity Lexia cask wine). To be avoided.
Geelong Our Original Pale Ale;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Geelong Brewing;Dim, pale peachy browm colour. The aroma is like sweet cordial, really short industrial finish. Traditional crap Aussie chemical additive finish, really bad, and unbelievably thin. Hard to believe its an ale.
Geelong Our Original Pale Ale;Moolap, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Geelong Brewing;Light honey colourand Light fruity aroma, bitter hoppy flavour with some sourness. Quite refreshing and IMHO the best of this mediocre brewery's offerings to date. But I stand to be corrected.
Gaymers K6 Cider;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Bottle. Golden. Aromas are apple juice iwth some acidicy. Flavours are sweet apple with lemon and some woodiness. Fairly refreshing.
Gaymers K6 Cider;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);"A ""low"" alcohol version of K9 in all its different appearences. Sweeter and blander than the original."
Gaymers K6 Cider;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);"This is bar none the best ""low alcohol"" cider I have ever tried. Where as the regular K Cider (both the american 6.4% ABV version and the English 8.4% ABV version) border on an excessively dry taste bordering bitter, the folks at Matthew Clark got it right this time. Its much sweeter than the regular and it lacks the abusive aftertaste. The truist English cider drinkers might fight it a bit disappointing, but it more appealed to my tastebuds. The nose was a little more subdued than the original, but I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the aroma of the original. This one will likely be difficult to find in the American market as it is 6.0% as a low alcohol variety."
Troy Lighthouse;Troy, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brown's Brewing Company;"A commercial description of this beer reads"" A Refreshing light bodied beer for those new to craft brews. Brewed to taste similar to American Lagers. "", I say why bother.Not my style.Next to nothing in the aroma and flavor department.Water with a bit of back wash has only slightly more bosy than this beer.But I must admit, if it keeps the patrons happy and they don't have to carry macro swill..god love them."
Troy Lighthouse;Troy, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brown's Brewing Company;Pours with a very pale yellow body topped by a thin white head with some lace left behind on the glass. Grainy malt aroma similar to freshly mashed malt. Sweet grainy malt flavor with a subtle bitter hoppiness and a mutty finish. Very flavorful for such a light beer. Light bodied, slightly dry and smooth.
Topvar 10% Vianočné;Topoľčany, Slovakia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovary Topvar (SABMiller);Compact and little long-lasting foam. Pale colour and enough bubbly. Ordinary and light scent, discreetly pungent. Taste without particularitity, lightly sour finish.

Van Den Bossche Buffalo Belgian Stout;St. Lievens-Esse/Herzele, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Van Den Bossche;330ml bottle from De Garre, Bruges (€4.50): Quite a strong beer at points but still not as overpowering as some imperial stout thanks to the good balance & the nice sweetness coming through from the chocolate, dark fruits & even a little caramel malt. It was drinkable with a smooth feel & good complexity as well. An interesting beer that I'm glad I managed to try, although there are definitely better imperial stouts out there to be had.

Moulins d'Ascq Ambrée;Villeneuve d’Ascq, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Moulins d'Ascq;750ml corked and caged bottle (courtesy of Headbanger) poured into a Stem Glass at 41°. Color is a deep gold with a slight haze. Carbonation is very active giving it a small tight white head. Aroma is rich and sweet with a caramel scent that makes me think of a caramel apple. It has a lighter medium body with a light crisp mouthfeel. Flavor comes in light with toffee and a faint apple note that is backed by a mild hop spice. The aftertaste has a rich feel and the toffee turns to honey with a note of black cherry, then finishes clean with a light bitterness on the end. Overall this brew kicks ass, it has rich bold flavors yet comes across light and easy.

Neustadt Springs Bruce County Premium;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Neustadt Springs Brewery;This lager poured a light golden colour with a quickly dissipating head. To the nose there are scents of hopps, juniper, citrus and dough. First sip was smooth and flavourful with flavours of caramel, butter, hopps and a little spice. Finish is slightly hoppy with a little bitter value there along with a little...smoke? Palate is also slightly hoppy with bitterness lingering. Seriously underated.
Neustadt Springs Bruce County Premium;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Neustadt Springs Brewery;50 cl can, Mulmur, ON, Canada. Slightly hazy pale golden, head is only whisps of lace on the side of the glass. Really nice pepper aroma, sharp but mellow first sip, with a nice long sweet finish.
Neustadt Springs Bruce County Premium;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Neustadt Springs Brewery;500ml Can: I’m a Neustadt fan, albeit rarely a pale lager fan, but that said this is a vastly underrated beer. Pours very light gold, a surprisingly nice foam head that never left straight to the bottom. Lots of citrusy grapefruit and sugar coming out of the aroma, it’s quite pleasing. Very lightly carbonated and quite smooth and light I snagged sweet biscuit and wheat notes off the top and found those grapefruit hops shortly after. This might be a new go-to for me during summer cottage season this year.

Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);I am sad they discontinued this beer. Everyone I introduced it to began to buy it as a regular beer. It needed more advertising. It is deceiving as it is a darker looking lager but tastes much lighter. There is some complexity to the flavors with small hints of nut and currants but is by far not over powering. You can certainly drink a few of these puppies. In Ontario, Canada there has been a rash of cheap buck a beer options. Most of these beers are not great but this one was one of the best for the price. BRING IT BACK! Please!
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Bouteille de 341 ml achetée dans une LCBO de Cornwall. Dégustée le 21 août 2005 (pint). Bière brune foncée limpide. Mousse peu, col mince et éphémère. Peu effervescente, bulles moyennes. Odeur de petits fruits (berries). Douce, assez sucrée, amère en finale.
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Originally rated June 2004. Dark red with brownish bubbly head (that lasted about 2 minutes... not bad). Nice mild aromas of chocolat and coffee, but this is nowhere near a stout. You can drink many of these without being full. In fact, you could only buy this beer in 24 packs, but it did not sell. Now, you can finally buy it in a 6 pack. Watery with hints of coffee and nuts, with a sweet smooth aftertaste. Very well priced and Lakeport’s best beer along with their Honey Lager.
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);341ml bottle sample. There was a time that I drank this quite regularly. Pours rather dark and cloudy, small head. Smells of malt, hops and nut. Tastes much the same as smell sweet roasted malt, nut and slight hops. Has a slight watery consistency, good though.
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);No surprise this one’s retired, I suppose. Had a bottle that had been sitting in a beer fridge for who-knows-how-long, but I doubt the date had any effect on the taste. Pours dark with very little head...I wasn’t getting much out of the flavour, possibly due to the cold temperature, but at the same time, something about this beer made me scared to try it when it got much warmer. For a dark lager it’s okay, but I don’t know anyone who enjoys dark beer but is willing to skimp on it.
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);The after taste is sort of of malty and the colour is dark and sexy... But it still has that swishy foamy taste of a lager ... which is not my thing... Scottish ales are strong heavy meals in a glass... this a little watery . I guess I’m being judgmental because I really like Scotch ales. But, as lagers go this quite good.
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);well there is some malt in there......surprisingly. Aroma is still quite grainy, lots of corn mixed with slight caramel flavours.......this is odd. But drinkable, but not repeatable.
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);341 ml bottle, 5% a/v Pour is very unusual for a macro, it has both colour and head go figure. Medium brown colour with a decent tan head. Nose is nutty, and chocolatey, taste is hops and malt, nothing extravagant, very thin mouthfeel, most dissapointing aspect of the beer.
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);not bad at all......a bit thin and watery but has enough bitterness in the finish to make it worth buying......probably the best lakeport product
Lakeport Wee Willy;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);amber color some head only thing scottish ale like is the slightly darker color drinkable but nothing to be that interested in

Lvivske Premium;Lviv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lvivska Pivovarnya (Carlsberg);Bottle, didn’t catch the date, if there was one, drunk 10/10/16. Clear, filtered honey-golden with a moderate amount of white head. Looks good for a macro. Smells malty in the nose with some faintly discernible hops. Hint of flowers and grass. Otherwise, honey, a good dose of cereal character and light pepper on the end. Didn’t find too much flaw, perhaps some wax and very light corn, but nothing obnoxious. No oxidation so it might be, somehow, fairly fresh. Maltier and sweeter than expected, with a touch of saccharine-like character, some wax and corn on the end, but by and large actual malt flavors, with ample carbonation and a hint of grassy, floral hops. Fine, drinkable stuff.

New Albanian Bourbondaddy Stout (2003-2004);New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout;New Albanian Brewing Company;The Bourbondaddy is a stout aged in a used bourbon barrel. I had this last year at about this time, and I remember liking it, but I don’t remember much else about it. This time around I actually paid attention to what I was drinking. It’s a little bitter at first, but after that it’s very good. Nothing extremely special, it tastes the way it should - a medium stout with a little bourbon flavor added.
New Albanian Bourbondaddy Stout (2003-2004);New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft at Fest: Opaque with a small tan head which diminished leaving an oily layer, good lace. The aroma has notes of vanilla, oak, whisky, roasted and burnt malts, pineapple, floral hops, and dusty yeast esters. The taste starts with a coffee and mocha nature. A nice balanced bourbon and vanilla kick, not over the top. Fruity and smoky finish. The feel is rich and smooth. Another winner from New Albanian, worth a trip to seek out their beers. Sweet (almost like an Imperial) !
New Albanian Bourbondaddy Stout (2003-2004);New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout;New Albanian Brewing Company;"I tried this after it was aged for 18 weeks; the assistant brewmaster said he liked it best at 12. Nevertheless, I thought the mouthfeel was fairly thin. I don't understand why they use nitro, although the creaminess factor might play a role. Aroma was that of a stout with a dash of Crown Royal or Jim Beam. I don't anticipate trying this again but appreciate the novelty involved."

Weird aroma. There are some malts but also some sour-ish fruity notes, like old cherries. Sour taste, and not the good one. Slightly infected I reckon. Fruity notes of cherries and grapes, not much of the spices mentioned on the description, metal notes on the finish. Medium thin body, average carbonation. Not good.

Flavours of grapes, yeast, light tart, malty, olives, dough, bread, some berries, some herbs and bitters. Not sure what happened here... Infection? It’s unbalanced for sure and strange in aroma and flavours. Aftertaste is grapes, tart, malts, olives, dough and yeast. Low carbo, creamy mouthfeel, medium unbalanced body and a creamy tarty texture.

Amherst Patch Porter;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Amherst Brewing Company;Growler from beerbud...Poured a deep umber with a ring of mocha foam the dies quickly... aromas are roasted malts and a subtle touch of chocolate. On the palate it was lacking a bit of umph but was quite drinkable and lacked any major flaws. Lack of carbonation and a bit more focus on punching up the flavors and they may have better luck. Not to familiar with the brewery but based on the listings seems like a decent brewpub that enjoys brewing a wide variety of beers for the masses. Cheers to that !
Amherst Patch Porter;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Amherst Brewing Company;Appearance: clean and clear with blacks bordered by garnet and cherry woods. Tan collar but no real head to speak of. Nose: roasted and toasty all around. Dark Ghirardelli cocoa powder. Roasted marshmallows with a nice char, just the way I like them. Vanilla bean. Rich black earth. Palate: wet woods old and deep, ash, and scorched earth. Bark and twigs in the middle, burnt of course. Unsweetened pure black cacao Ghirardelli chocolate tingles and grabs sides of cheeks. Acrid burnt black root. Raisins and prunes for a touch of meaty goodness. Final Thoughts: a solid quaffer of a porter perfect for slaking a hard working man or woman’s thirst. The last of my Amherst flight of four, I declined on any growlers to go but did get my lucky hands on a t-shirt.
Amherst Patch Porter;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Amherst Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. A good example of the inconsistency of the lineup, this porter is rather bland and the carbonation and taste is off. Certainly not a batch that should have been served. Dark, a bit of aroma, some hops that gave it some citrus. It could have used: less carboantion, more malting, particular chocolate malt.
Amherst Patch Porter;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Amherst Brewing Company;Deep dark black. Tan head. Roasted malt, raison, port, coffe'ish nose.

Golden Pacific Half Dome Pale Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Golden Pacific Brewing;When I think of a Pale Ale, Sierra Nevada is what comes to mind. This is OK compared to that. Nice amber color with a little white head. The aroma had me expecting a lot, but the taste is a bit lacking but not too much.

Franklins Double Vision;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;This is the 7.0% version that the brewpub lists at Dubbel Vision, so I’m not sure if its a new beer or not.

Franklins Double Vision;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Draft. Pours a muddy brown with no head. Flavor is spice, licorice, mint, sugar and a tiny bit of hops and alcohol. Moutfeel was crisp and refreshing with little aftertaste. Easy to drink but the flavor caught me off guard.
Franklins Double Vision;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;On tap at Franklin’s. Poured a nice looking brown mahogany color with a thin white head. Aroma was straight up banana and malt. having this after the batch #400 was like drinking the skinny little brother of the 400. Not bad, but a lot of banana and (probably unfairly) thinner than the previous beer. Very drinkable though.

Franklins Double Vision;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;"Stopped by the brewpub to pick up a growler and saw that they were offering this on cask. I asked for a sample and the bartender told me, ""Tell me if you like it, I think it’s weird."" The sample of the cask Double Vision pours a clear purple brown with no head. The aroma is heavy alcohol and vinegar. The flavor was similar, very astringent, citrus bitterness, fusel alcohol and a little metallic tinge. Finish was very pungent. Needless to say, I passed on the cask version. The version on tap that I ultimately got for my growler was much better. Pours a purpley, brown with a thin white head. Aroma was spicy, bread, nuts, clove and slight citrus all marry well. Flavor has much more of the grain, biscuit, dark/sweet fruit and a bit of yeast. Definite alcohol on the end and slightly thick on the tongue. I don’t love Belgian, but this was very drinkable and a nice change of pace from Franklins."
Franklins Double Vision;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;"Pint at the brewery. Cloudy bread crust brown body. Proper clove, toast, mild fruit and nuts in the nose, more of a pulpy fruit character tasted, makes me think of pulp (as in orange) from plums (which I guess doesn’t really exist). Nutty, bready, soggy, chewy, toasty; overall it’s a pretty solid dubbel, with just a hint of alcohol at the end."

Roast, pepper and spice up front, chewy yeast background. Flavor has some faint banana, pepper and more spice, hard to pinpoint. As it warms even more, get a certain vegetal character I can’t pinpoint. Mouthfeel rather thin at times.
Franklins Double Vision;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Courtesy of artusory Growler: The aroma is fruity and yeasty with some notes of burnt wood, alcohol, and vegetables.

Pale, yellow with a filmy, white head and little carbonation. Aroma is sweet, spicy, with plenty of alcohol esters, bananas and some clove. Flavor is pale and fruity, and a little bit of spice.

Franklins Mr. Whipples Triple;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Tripel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Hazy gold, fluffy off-white head. Nose is full of sweet orange peel, pear, corriander, banana, and fresh bread. Flavor shows just a bit too much alcohol, (this batch was 12%...yikes)but still pretty tasty regardless.

Franklins Mr. Whipples Triple;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Tripel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Lovely beer. A hazy copper gold color with lacy head. Spicy, sweet, orange aroma. The flavor is sweet, mildly orangy, well-rounded, full bodied, and slightly spicy (corriander-ish). High alcohol, but not a strong alcohol flavor. It's a great Belgian-style that does its heritage proud. I very much enjoyed this beer.
Franklins Mr. Whipples Triple;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Tripel;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Great Beer! Hazy, golden hue. Small, creamy white head. The aroma is of dark bread, fuzzy fruits, candy sugar, bananna and alcohol. Way sweet up front, but almost balanced out on the backside by the tart, acrid and lightly bitter hop addition. So, a fairly well-balanced tripel, although the high ABV is definitely evident. Not necessarily a negative in my book. Medium-length, dry, pungent and astringent finish. My 500th rating. Yeehaw!

Gordon Five;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;33 cl. – clear green – bottle @ home. Procured from Carrefour. Pours a clear amber orange with a tiny synthetic white head. Smells like an industrial lager but rawer, touch solvents and superglue mixed with this odd sweetness like watered down cheap candy sugar, I am not feeling it. Taste is bitter, surprisingly some hops here mixed with a watery mess of watered down brown honey and chemicals, sweet grains and caramel. The whole thing is really watery. Despite all of this you still get a light alcohol burn, garbage ingredients I suppose. A total mess, not much of a surprise there. Label at least doesn’t look to bad.
Gordon Five;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;Bottle. Pale piss yellow. Flavour is sweet caramel and some itchy hops. Thin and unacceptably poor.

Berliner Kindl Weisse Tropical;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);This is the best beer! It tastes like Pez candy but not as sweet. It reminds me of being in Germany. If only I could find it in the U.S...
Berliner Kindl Weisse Tropical;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);A pale yellow cloudy beer with an OK head.

It has faint hints of malt but no bitterness. Very boring for a beer.

Kyseessä kirkas, kullankeltainen olut paksulla valkoisella vaahdolla, joka jättää hieman pitsiä. Tuoksu maltainen ja voinen, mutta aavistuksen liian köykäinen. Maku sen sijaan on mainio. Voinen makeus on vahvasti esillä ja yllättäen toimii kokonaisuudessa loistavasti humalan tuoman katkeruuden vastatessa jälkimausta. Todella toimiva pils!

Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Backlog rating LCRBM/Bruxellensis 2006: Nice layering nitroporter bubbles, creamy head. No aroma. Very light nutty. Very lightbodied, watery.
Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Taste is like watery Guinness with a strong metallic aftertaste. The name is really the best thing about this beer.
Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"""THAT explains it! a stout made by our good friends at Bud. I was excited to see a new stout, complete with a 3d boxer taphandle, while on vacation. more excited as it came out, cascading on nitro. the flavor, however, was entirely underwhelming. if you’re a Guiness fan it’s almost comprable, but i’m a fan of bigger stouts than this."""
Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);(Revised from 2007 rating.) Pours a deep brown with a cascading khaki head. Well, A-B has its Guiness clone and competitor (or had). Smooth, creamy, and dry. Very light, too. A little too light, in terms of aroma and flavor. Faint roast and chocolate and coffee and cream. This really isn’t (or wasn’t) bad. I wish they still made it, to be honest. It was my go-to when we took visiting friends in college on the A-B brewery tour.
Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);(old notes) Used to get this on-tap from the Busch Gardens beer room every once in a while. Black pour, tan head. Not much aroma, just roasted malts and a little chocolate. Taste is a fair Guinness knock-off, a little more alcohol and a little too thin. Perfectly average.
Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Overall, it’s not a bad stout. Nothing really special here but I would take it over pretty much anything else AB makes. I have a feeling if it wasn’t associated with AB it would probably have a much higher rating.
Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Draft from awhile ago. Pours black. Nose/taste of roasted barley, baker’s chocolate and dark malt. Dry finish. Plain.
Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I can't even find this anymore. If you did. A blind taste test this would score much higher. But because it's brewed by AB people have a predisposed hatred of it. It's a bit chocolatier Guiness. Still a nice stout. Regardless of the brewer ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bare Knuckle Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Tasted on tap in standard pint glass. Poured a clear, dark brown color with fluffy off-white foam which dissipated fairly quickly leaving very little lace. Aromas of bread, roasted barley, no hops, no yeast esters. Some malt-sweetness, slight hops bitterness, more roasted barley. Completely missing any malty, fruity complexity. Light body and thin, bland mouthfeel, Characteristic Anheuser-Busch watery and metallic tastes with sharp, overly fizzy carbonation. Stouts are great, but this is a sadly lacking version.
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a black color with beige highlights and a huge creamy off white head that left incredible lacing. The aroma was dryish and roasty with a hint of vanilla. The flavor was dry and bitter with roasty malts and almost vanilla cream. Medium length finish. Medium body. Not bad for a style I dont care for.
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;Dark black almost brown, with no head remaining. Smoky with a very distant rear cocoa finish
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;Really nice example of the style with a little more smoke and peat, dark with nice head but little lacing, not thin and finishes reletively clean
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;This poured a black color with a big fluffy tan head. Aroma was almost not existent due to the large head but was a bit dark rasoted malts and smoke. Flavor was really smokey and a little chocolatey. Loved the smoke here but the rest was way too thin must like most of there other beers.
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;On tap at the brewery. This was a very run of the mill dry stout. Aroma was pretty weak but could pick up roasted malt. Pour was a nice near black with a two finger tan head. Taste was flat and roasty like the style usually is. This isn’t bad, but all nitrogenated beers taste the same to me. Like a beer that has been sitting out for a day. For what it is, though, on par with a Tetleys or Beamish.
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;Creamy head, almost like chocolate mousse. Very dark, almost black for the most part. Not much aroma, it just comes across clean nosed. On the palate, it’s pretty much flat, like most Irish jig stouts. Very nice lacing on the glass, makes me want to peak behind. Mildly roasty and ropey on the tongue. Above average dry stout. Surprisingly not as bitter as other DS I’ve had. Has a finish like stale bark beer, but in a good way. Can’t get used to beer without carbonation.
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;At the Church Brew Works. They called this batch O’Casey’s, (March 17, 2007) although the description was referred to as the same as O’Bryan’s. Black brown, off white head. Aroma is molasses, coffee, chocolate. Flavor is molasses, coffee, chocolate, pine. Thin body, but nice bitterness.
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;Pours like a typical Irish dry stout. (ie. no description necessary) Aroma of dark coffee and roasted barley. A nice mouthfeel with a quick bitterness at the end. The extra abv was a welcomed addition to a rather tame style. The best beer I had there.
Church Brew O'Casey's Irish Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Church Brew Works;Very black, persistent brown head. Roasty smokey nose and taste with a touch of bitterness. Medium bodied.

Church Brew Rauchbier;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church Brew Works;I am really touchy about smoke in beers but this one was very well done - prominent smoke but not one dimensional. +++ Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a very dark brown color with a medium sized foamy tan head that left a touch of lacing. The aroma was bacon bits, a hint of nut, wood, more bacon, pepper and a touch of raisin. The flavor was woody and smoky with some bacon, some toasty malts, nut and a hint of bread. Sweeter than I would have expected but it really worked. The finish was long with wood and bacon lingering. Medium body. Well done.
Church Brew Rauchbier;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church Brew Works;This poured a lightly cloudy medium brown color with a small beige head. Aroma was of caramel, grass, light toffee and medium strength smoked malt. Flavor was a nice blend of caramel sweetness with smoke bitterness, not too sweet, but not offensively smokey. Definitely a smoked beer I wouldn’t mind have more than one glass of.
Church Brew Rauchbier;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church Brew Works;Had this at the 2011 Pittsburgh Ratebeer Christmas Eve Eve Tasting. OK, this beer has been brought back into production by Lithy and he did a good job. IMHO the first version of this, 2003, was not too good. I normally do not like smoke beers but this was a special treat. Appearance is not black like other smoked beers that I find acceptable, more of brownish thing here. Dull and smokey on the aroma, no doubt this is a smoke beer. Oh my, what a smokey impact on the buds. However, it seems to have nice balance, no ill bacon or anything like that. Most smokeys are way over the top but this is behaved and a gentleman. Friendly, and easy! Does have a decent amount of CO2 and this helps me enjoy it. BIG THANKS LITHY! Finally a smoked beer I can appreciate. I’m gonna say its up there with east end heritage porter and Ofallons smoked porter, my two most liked smoke beers.
Church Brew Rauchbier;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church Brew Works;This was one of the more palatable smoked beers I've had. Malts are sweet caramel and medium thick and the finish was mostly dry. The smoked flavors start with the aroma and follow the tastes from beginning to end, adding a consistent character to this. I was pleasantly surprised. Dark orange/brown color.
Church Brew Rauchbier;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church Brew Works;nice lighlty smoked beer. the smokiness comes through asa flavor component and does not overwhelm the malt character of this beer. finishes on a dry note with a lingering smoky sweetness.

Humpty Dumpty Claud Hamilton;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Very dark brown with a thick beige head. Sweet malty aroma. Taste is, - well it doesn’t say anywhere on my bottle that this is a stout, and it clearly isn’t - fruity, malty, hoppy and a touch sour. Light bodied, foamy mouthfeel. Pretty good easy drinking porter-ish beer.
Humpty Dumpty Claud Hamilton;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Smooth, malty style Porter (I thought?). Some biscuit and bread wrapped in the smooth, watery choc. A bit light and untroublesome.

Humpty Dumpty Claud Hamilton;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. A very odd stout. Reddish brown colour - not very dark for a stout. Not a lot of aroma, but what’s there is dull and vaguely malty. Bits of caramel and fruity malt on the palate, but no great depth of flavour. Thin and seemed very tired to me (it being the last day of the festival). More like a mild than a stout. I have a bottle of this so I’ll re-rate soon to see if the festival conditions were to blame.

Humpty Dumpty Claud Hamilton;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Cask conditioned - Gravity - Derby BF. A black coloured sweet stout. The aroma is of sweet (perhaps milky) alcohol. The taste is excellent with caramel and toffee full flavours. Very nice indeed.

A surprise to find such an authentic cask mouthfeel in Helsinki! -The finish is balanced, with a few cereals peering through for good measure. -Drinkability is quite high. -The citrus character is obviously not just from hops here (added zest, I presume). On cask at St. Urho’s, Helsinki.

Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;Pours a very dark coffee-red with a light khaki head that isn't too large. The aroma is typical big malty lager aroma. The flavor is interesting however. The dominant flavor is brown sugar and the flavor is sugary indeed. It's definitely on the sweet side, especially for a lager. A little wood and such mixed in there as well. If they'd dry it up a bit, it probably wouldn't be too bad, but right now it's too sweet.
Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;Dark and reddishly semi-transparent, I managed to pour it with a decent head, which surprised me. I'd have guessed this was a sweet stout before opening it up, but the arome is very much like a certain bad macro bock. Slightest hint of dark fruits with a heavyish tinge of sweetness. Not all that bad but nothing exciting. By the time I had smelled it, the head had nearly vanished. This reminds a lot of their low ABV sweet stout in the flavour, but surprisingly this is almost, but not quite, adjunct free. I'd have guessed otherwise, but again I guess wrong. Taste is sweetish, some dark chocolate, sweet dark malts, not much complexity. Not watery by any means and really, I wouldn't want that flavour to be bigger, thus ruling out me wanting it to have a bigger body, which it would otherwise need. Not quite bad to be an automatic drain pour, but bad enough that I'll say no thanks to another.
Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;Dark Brown, little head, quite sweet nose. Very thin lack of body. Not a very good beer, even by icelandic standards
Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;Dark brown w/ creamy beige head. Sweet nose of malt, molasses, brown sugar & milk chocolate.

Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;Dark brown , creamy small head . Sweet malt ,milky chocolatey . Very interesting taste . Unusall brew ...
Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;Reddish brown colour. Caramel and brown sugar on the nose. Sweet but bland palate. The combination of sweetness, lack of body and lack of melanoidins (those compounds that manifest themselves as luscious, rich maltiness) tells me this beer has too many adjuncts. Some sort of unfermentable caramel perhaps? Not unlike a Peruvian schwarzbier in that respect.
Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;"Dark brown. Light fruitiness in the nose; caramelly sweet. Body is very sweet and smooth with hints of caramel. Finishes lightly bitter which is the only thing saving this much too sweet beer."
Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;"I was very dissapointed by this one, it wasnt bad but it was far from great. Good malte taste was totally ruined by to mach water.. this would be great beer if it wasnt made in Iceland : re-rate 2004 batch ; this one looks like it more carbonated then they JólaMaltbjór, and has a destinct dark caramel nose. Color is black, but not darkness. Palate is very watery and a bit to smooth, this is way more drinkable then other disasters from Egils, and quite frankly their best beer, but it doesnt make it that good, and far from being something great...."
Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;Dark black, but with clear reddish shine. very little, yellowish head. Rich malt nose, with sweet chocolate tones. Very sweet, malt-sugars, sweet worts at first, but going over in liquorice. Hint of bitterness at the end. Very slight carbonation. Pretty empty. Aftertaste turns to sweet-liquorice again. Too sweet. It does resemble a German Maltztrunk. Wonder where those 5.6 ABV are hiding.
Egils Malt Paskabjor (Easterbeer);Reykjavik, Iceland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson;Sweet malty aroma, hint of caramel and brown sugar. Ruby in colour, a tiny toffee head. Roasted malt, and rich caramel flavours, as it warms it tastes of maple butter. Creamy, with a fine sweetness, really pleasant mouth feel. Great example of the style, my first Easterbeer. Thanks Eirikur.

Asda Whitechapel Porter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Porter;Asda (Wal Mart);Clear 500ml bottle at home in Blaendulais listening to Krishna Das. As ’Asda Extra Special Whitechapel Porter’, 5.2%, undated, brewed at Shepherd Neame. Pours like cola to form an opaque black beer with a dense creamy brown head that endures permanently and leaves thick lacing. Aroma is bourbon biscuits and chocolate truffles, ashy notes. Smells pretty inviting. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is a little thin and metallic up front, then some soft toffee and liquorice notes, ashy earthy finish. Not far away from being pretty accomplished. Looks and smells like the real deal and then falls away. Really grows on you though. (6-4-6-4-14=3.4)
Buckhead Donegal Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Bottle shared by omhper thanks. No head. Clear dark red brown color. Big roasted malty aroma. Sweet caramell malt taste with a distinct acidity. Mild bitterness.
Buckhead Donegal Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Good-looking black beer. Mild ale-y smelling, with just a twinge of hop aroma. Choco-lactose on top of dark roast flavor. Dry, a little watery tasting (though not watery feeling.) Mildly hopped. Fairly quick coffee finish. An off note in the backend disturbed an otherwise very good palate. Easy drinking.
Buckhead Donegal Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Overall a good Brewpub stout. No real aroma - excellent thick dark black pour with a heavy, creamy head with a lot of lacing. Detect a little bit of hoppiness in there. Smoky, roasted flavor starts off strong but fades and sours near the end - bit of an aftertaste - thus the low marks on palate. Overall a good choice for #400 for me.

Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12oz bottle. This beer sucks. It is bland all around. Tastes like they took any of your american macro brews and put a new label on it.
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;This beer has a light golden color, which held to the sun is this beers only redeeming quality. The taste is acrid and it is virtually undrinkable.
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;this i can honestly say, was fuckin terrible, i dont know if i should be thanking heemer or kicking his ass for a pour of this crap. Extremely light color that is skunked beyond belief and tastes like wet luandry. AWFUL. what a piece of crap to have for number 1300.
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;This stuff gets worse as you drink more. A very light gold. Aroma of old moldy sweat socks and some vomit. The taste was light carrots and peanuts with rotten lemons.
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;this tasted like fleghm and snot. ew. i dont want to drink my cold. got worse as it got warmer. sick dood. i cant wait to read heemer’s rating...
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I bought this sixer on a novelty idea since I was heading out to Knoxville to play a whole lot of Texas Hold Em Poker. I passed around the bottles and figured, eh, what the hell, I’d try one. So I poured this out a rather clear and light yellow color with little carbonation after a small frothy soapy head. The aroma was relatively non existant...some cold glass, a hint of corniness, but nothingness really. The flavor wasn’t as bad as I expected. There’s really nothing to it...they managed to make it not suck, but they also managed to get little to no flavor in there. A hint of corn and sweet malt, but once again...nothing! Overall mouthfeel was weak and watery. It was a nice novelty idea...and oh yeah, I got the Ace of Spades under my cap...top that!
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I bought this beer for 50 cents at Kreston’s in Wilmington, Delaware. I’m happy to say that my cap was the Queen of Hearts, which may get me laid tonight. The beer was middle of the road, but not as bad as most BMC shit. I could actually see buying a case of this and playing a drinking game involving which person gets the better cap card. Decent aroma, taste, and finish.
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I have to give this beer points for originality (in marketing that is). You would think that with as much creativity and effort that they put into marketing this beer they could have put a better beer in the bottle. Not offensive but still bland and pointless.
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Alright, heres the deal: i am allowing the price of this beer to influence my rating. I bought this stuff for 1.99/six pack (6.00/24). For the price, it's damn good. If, however, I were to pay an average amount for this beer, it would not be rated as well. It has minimal head, a bland aroma but a decent flavor. Sort of sweet and a tad skunky. To me, its more refreshing than most American standards. Again, for the price, it's great.
Poker Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Wow. This was the cheapest bottled beer I've ever bought! It was less than $3.00 for a 6 pack of bottles. That's cheaper than the cheap shit. It's not as bad as other cheap beers. It's brewed by Matt for Wet Planet Beverages, and they also own Jolt Cola.
Springfield Mueller Saison;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Springfield Brewing Company;Some faint caramel and yeast in the aroma, lending some banana and clove, along with a certain vague spiciness and sugary sweetness. Massive, lasting head. Honeyish amber color. Malty and sweet flavor profile, some floral notes, spices and a bit of hop tingle. Lots of effervescence and lacing. Finishes with yeast esters, sweetness and spice. The lasting impression is of banana bread with a bit of caramel drizzled over the top. Very low bitterness and hop flavors. Interesting.

Sweet grainy flavour with some herbal hops and light finishing bitterness. Light body with crisp carbonation that dimples the tongue. Bottle. Entered from notes.
Steiger Hell (The Beer From Hell Brewery);Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovar Steiger;Light golden color, little to no head. Nose is of sweet malt with slight leafy notes. The body is smooth but honestly reminded me of bile/some kind of stomach acid. Light bitterness, very very gross.
Steiger Hell (The Beer From Hell Brewery);Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovar Steiger;Pale yellow w/ Small white head. Some sweetness in the nose w/ a hint of hops. Light feel (but not too light). Somewhat sweet, some bready character, & a mild-moderately bitter finish.

Steiger Hell (The Beer From Hell Brewery);Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovar Steiger;Pale gold lager, white frothy head. Sweet malty aroma with some spice .Quiet similar to radegast, pale rye bread. It does get a bit better while you are drinking.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;From tap at the brewpub. Pours clear and golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is fruity and light toasted malty. Smooth fruity, crisp hoppy, light peachy and mild citrusy. Smooth fruity into a light bitter finish.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Draft. Clear deep golden color. Aroma of light citrus and straw. Taste is slightly sour with nice balance.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Draft at brewery. Very good american pale. Aggressive hop aroma and taste make this interesting but it is not overly strong to be like an IPA. One of my favorites at Franklin’s.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;On tap at Franklins, Hyattsville on 14 July 2006 (noted at 6.0%). Unusual to find two different APAs on tap at a brewpub at the same time. Hazy amber colour. Good strong hop presence. Big on grapefruity Cascade. Another good APA. The hops are a bit more aggressive than in the Twisted Turtle but there is less of a malt backbone. Honours even.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Served on draft at the brewpub. Pours a hazy copper color with a large creamy offwhite head. Good head retention and lacing. Faint aroma of citrus hops. The taste is wretched. Big herbal and citrus hops. Way over-hopped. A chemical note. No balance whatsoever. Medium bodied. Looks decent, but other than that I could barely manage a few sips.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;on tap-pours an offwhite head with copper color.

Pours clear light copper with off-white head. Aromas of citrusy american hops, caramel, and english malts. Flavors of hops, some citrus, caramel, and english malts. Nice mouthfeel and carbonation. Decent pale and one of the better beers on tap.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Tap at Franklins. Pours a hazy light copper with a thin head. Aroma is citrus grassy leafy cascade, lean toffee and light caramel malts. Flavor is nicely hopped resinous, pine, citrus and orange notes, cascade is big, almost piney sappy spicy centennial as well. Clean and crisp good APA.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Cloudy dark orange copper color. Aroma of juicy hops and sweet caramel malts. Nice body. Taste is upfront bitterness with some pine hops. Pretty good.
Franklins Sierra Madre Pale Ale;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Gravity pour from the friday firkin. Cloudy orange with a pillowy white head. Huge aroma of hops and grapefruit. Flavor is mostly grapefruit and citrus hops. Much like drinking grapefruit juice, only not as bitter. Very smooth with a nice pale malt backbone. Quite drinkable.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;500 ml schooner glass at the Karl Strauss in LAX. Pour is slight haze golden orange copper with a smallish off white head that falls with some light lacing. Aroma is citrus fruit hop, big, mildly sweet clean. Some toastiness from the malt behind that. Taste is the hops, citrus fruit up front, nice mineral earthiness through the finish. All throughout, the toasted malt balances the hop out. Palate is light bodied, decent carbonation, finish is mellowed out by a bit of wateriness. Decent enough for an airport bar.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Served cold from tap at Universal Studios brewery. It wasn’t nearly as hoppy as it should have been for an IPA, it had a very nice finish though. Poured clear amber with a thin white head, leaving trace amonunts of lacing. Aroma was somewhat weak and hoppy. Taste was middle of the road.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Draft. Seemed a little closer to a regular PA than IPA, but it’s not bad. I expected very little since the only other Karl Strauss beer I’ve ever had was their Oktober fest. A decent amount of floral hops, could be more assertive.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;The head of this beer sticks around forever. All the way down the glass. Pretty impressive. Serious hoppy citrus nose. Hoppy flavors dominate the beer, and hang around in your mouth long after you’re done.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;"Clear light amber/copper coloured body with a thin white head. Assertive west-coast hops in the nose-some floral-some citrusey. Medium-bodied; Strong hops up front with little else following behind. Bitter floral hops resent with an adequate malt backbone. Aftertaste plain & bitter-not too great. Overall, a decent IPA-good for a layover before Australia! I sampled this beer on draught at the Karl Strauss Brewpub in Terminal 7 at LAX after a flight from Washington and before our flight to Sydney. This was sampled on 31-May-2004."
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Sampled draught at LAX airport. Clear amber, small creamy head. Grapefruity hop aroma. Clean malt profile, loads of cascade hops. Soapy, grapefruity finish with good bitterness.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;This beer has a huge hoppy nose. I could smell it when he was pouring out of the tap across the bar from me. It smells like hops and nothing else, it tastes like hops and nothing else. Strangely there is no bitterness. This beer is also lacking any kind of malt to balance the taste and lacking body as well. It tastes like they just dry hopped a keg of carbonated water. Good to try if you like hops because thats all you can really taste.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Draft. Orangeish gold, hard to comment on the head as it seemed to be gone when it was served. Aroma is fruity malt and hoppy. Seems like an APA with a bit more cascade hops. Overall not bad too and quite drinkable, especially when it’s the best choice at one of your favorite restaurants.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;On tap at Disneyland’s California Adventure, pours a medium-yellow with small head. Aroma is more of malt than hops. Medium-bodied, I could hardly taste any hops at all. The low alcohol content does not help. Pretty weak and tame for an IPA. Dissapointing.
Karl Strauss Star of India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;"(Draft: Yard House in San Diego, CA) Moderately malty, but it’s fairly sweet and sugar until the finish when a slightly tart, bitter grapefruit rind flavor takes over; It’s moderately bitter, but never actually hoppy; Medium bodied; Almost no nose, very light hoppy aroma, and for an IPA, that’s criminal; Ligth amber color; Off-white head settles to a thin layer, but the dense, thin blacket of lacing is excellent"
Cannery Skaha Bluffs Light Blonde Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cannery Brewing Company;"This poured a well-carbonated light gold colour, with no resemblance at all to urine. The head was foamy white, and of only modest size but it did deliver some nice lacing. Aroma was floral and hopped, pleasantly so.

Cannery Skaha Bluffs Light Blonde Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cannery Brewing Company;This actually isn’t bad for a light beer. It pours very pale and sa\tarts off very bland, but has nice hop aftertaste. This is a step up from macro light beers.

A decent beer after a day on the crags.
John Harvards Gold Apricot Ale;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;Good head, with a great apricot and hops aroma and a solid malt base. The apricot seemed a little artificial, but I enjoyed this nonetheless.
John Harvards Gold Apricot Ale;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;Golden in color with a fluffy white head, light-bodied but very smooth, not much by way of any kind of apricot aroma or flavor at all, tasted almost like faintly flavored water

Second Street Trappist Pale Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Second Street Brewery;Murky amber with small white head. Taste is of smooth sweet hops, very frothy. No distinguishable smell, but the taste is fantastic. Perfectly balances bitter with sweet hops. Hints of coriander, a little like a hopped-up wit. Fits perfectly with the fish and chips.
Eskes Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;The other pale ale. This one with a little less body than the Mesa. Not particularly sweet, mostly watery. Tried at the brewery in 2007.
Eskes Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;On tap April 9, 2007. Contaminated. One sip and I was outa there. Too bad. Eskes is the only brew pub in town. If in Taos, skip this place and head for the Adobe Bar.
Eskes Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Smells wonderful, nice full hoppy aroma, with hints of fruit, and a big whiff of rich caramel. However, that's where the fun ends. I wish this beer tasted like how it smells, but it was not the case. Tastes almost identical to the irish ale and rio refresco, bland bland bland. Like chewing plastic, there was really no flavors through the entire glass.
Eskes Rio Refresco;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draught. Pours clear light yellow with an average, creamy, white head, mostly lasting with good lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (cereal, grain, meal), average hops (grass, herbs), average yeast (sweat) with notes of chalk. Light bodied, thin texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Long duration, light sweetness and acidity, moderate bitterness.
Eskes Rio Refresco;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;This beer wouldn’t get a such a generous rating if I wasn’t comparing it to the other bubbly glasses of garbage I drank at Eske’s. The Rio Refresco was only slightly more refreshing than a glass of water from the Rio Grande, and nearly as opaque. It would have been a bit better if it was cold or decently carbonated. Also, when served with a lemon, it tasted like Pledge. Why do I know what Pledge tastes like? Why would I give a beer that tastes like furniture polish a flavor rating of two? It’s probably because I’m drunk.
Eskes Rio Refresco;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;"Still, lightly hzay golden with a firm creamy head. Velvet texture. Little flavor; only a hint of orange essence over the starch."
Eskes Rio Refresco;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Light yellow, slightly murky. Aromas were mild, mainly of wheat and light hops. Flavors were hard to find in this one, pretty bland and a little sour. Not like a wheat at all, but maybe I should have put a lemon in it to liven things up a little.

I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Ins Glas ergießt sich ein blassgelbes Bier mit grob seifiger und kurzlebiger Krone. Der Geruch ist süßmalzig mit hopfigem Hintergrund. Der Antrunk fällt sehr hopfig bitter aus, insgesamt sehr herb. Im Abgang ist das Export ebenfalls sehr hopfenbitter.

Hoppers Old Porch Dog;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;On tap in Palm Harbor....poured a reddish-brown, hazy, with a small beige head. Aroma is malty, light choco-caramelish, vaguely mocha-ish. Hops balance the flavor pretty well, with the strong malty flavor being held politely in check---thank God for that. A bit too thin in the mouth though. Finishes lightly bitter and dry, but not terribly disappointing.
Hoppers Old Porch Dog;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft - Crimson and browns, velvety light tan head. Aroma held notes of chocolate, grapefruit, spice, and light coffee. Flavor was almost a match to aroma. A good hop bitterness and sweet malt combo provide a nice balancing act. Full bodied yet somewhat thin, soft carbonation, bitter drying finish.
Hoppers Old Porch Dog;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft at the Linebaugh location... Very murky, ruby ale with a small, creamy, beige head. Great retention. Nose of milk chocolate, cinnamon and leather. Well-balanced flavor is a little alcoholic with notes of caramel, mocha and grapefruit. Nicely bittered. Full-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Finishes bitter and then dry.
Hoppers Old Porch Dog;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Very enjoyable mirco brew. Although Hoppers doesn't necessarily consider it so, I would classify this beer as a brown ale. The aroma offers pleasant notes of cocoa and butter (but not butter in a bad way). This beer starts off light with hints of cocoa and a nutty flavor, and moves gradully into a deep, yet soft, liquor flavor. It settles very nicely on the tongue and produces a pleasnat display of brussells lace as well.
Metcalfes Hard Cider;Jacksonville, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;North River Winery;A apple juice look on pour. Smells of apples as well. It is a very sweet cider but pleasing after you’ve had a glass or too. Not to potent but enough to get you feeling it.

Metcalfes Hard Cider;Jacksonville, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;North River Winery;750ml bottle: Pale yellow body without carbonation. Very fine particles can be seen suspended in the body, but to be honest it takes concentration to really see them because it’s mostly clear and filtered. The aroma shows some crisp & sweet apple and just a bit of lightly tart apple. Smells very fresh. Taste is fresh apples as well as a bit of tart apple, with just a hint of alcohol showing through, creating light flavors of clove, then some hints of wood. Light bodied, still, finishes with some light residually sweet apple.
Metcalfes Hard Cider;Jacksonville, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;North River Winery;First off, this is the first cider I’ve had since my college days and Woodchuck. Pours clear yellow and very still. Nice sweet and tart aroma, very crisp. Flavor is a bit too sweet, I’d rather have it be a bit more tart and crisp. It is dry, however. Very crisp. Nice.
Metcalfes Hard Cider;Jacksonville, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;North River Winery;Pours yellow and fizzy. Smells of tarte ripe apples with a hint of spices. Flavor is light and clean with hints of tarte apples.
Metcalfes Hard Cider;Jacksonville, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;North River Winery;Lightly spicy aroma is bursting with fresh apples. Clear golden body is quite viscous on the sides of the glass. Quite dry, woody flavour has plenty of sweet apple character that lingers into a leafy finish. Medium-dry body - feels dry across the tongue but has plenty of residual sweetness. Wine glass. Just above fridge temperature. Bottle (Winooski Beverage Warehouse, Dec-05).
Metcalfes Hard Cider;Jacksonville, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;North River Winery;Poured a pale golden color with no head. A very still cider. Sweet and funky, apple, and vanilla aroma. Aroma was very sweet and spicy. The first sip knocked my socks off. Taste was that of a nice apple pie. Very sweet, though tartness was also included, as well as cinnamon, and crisp apples. The mouthfeel did not hold up to the taste. But this was still a very nice cider.
Metcalfes Hard Cider;Jacksonville, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;North River Winery;"750 ml bottle. Pale golden, no carbonation; is that what ""English-style"" means? Pleasing soft sweet apple/vanilla/cinnamon aroma. Flavor is fairly sweet also, with a bit of tartness at the end and also some metallic hints, but not enough to really ruin it. Above average cider with a good dry/sweet balance that just isn't distinguished enough for me to be likely to try it again."
Southampton East End India Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;IPA;Southampton Publick House;Draught, at the Blind Tiger, NY. When Spiesy & AustinPowers drank. Amber with a lovely lacy head. Good malt and decent, fullish hop aroma. Hoppy flavour with a good, long bitter finish. I’d love to go and sample a few more of these beers on location in South Hampton. Maybe this summer?!
Southampton East End India Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;IPA;Southampton Publick House;Nicely hopped IPA, even though in appearance, the body is a little light in color. Easy drinking, not too bitter or stringent. I will order this again, if not buy a growler.
Southampton East End India Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;IPA;Southampton Publick House;This is a mighty fine IPA from a mighty fine brewpub. Excellent lacing coats the glass and sticks to the sides like cement. Perfectly hopped, leaving a lingering, near perfect hop bitterness in the finish. My only complaint is that I think it should have had a bit more of a malt presence.
Bouffay Bière de Mars;Carquefou, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie du Bouffay;Orange colour, slightly hazy. Slight gushing, thick white head, not very stable. Nose with a bit of (cooked) vegetable, malt, carbondioxide. Quite dry taste, citrussy notes, but very restrained. Grainy-malt comes on, but retronasal (hoppy) bitterness. Mouthfeel is dry, but spritzy because of high carbonation. No new aftertaste. Pleasing, but not really characterfull. Would probably make a good session beer.

Smells good, yeasty and of course reminiscent of wheat beer. Could this be the first really good non-alcoholic beer? It masks its low ABV well, but there is the typical wheat taste that I’m not too fond of, and a weird, burnt aftertaste. But, at the end of the day, slightly more interesting than all the other non-alcoholic beers I’ve tried so far.
Clausthaler Hefeweizen;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);0,5 bojs fra Coop Mega: uklar gylden med tett skum som varer helt ned. Hveteølpreget er til stede i aromaen, og aller mest i smaken. Cremet munnfylde takket være det imponerende skummet. Trolig den beste alkoholfrie øl jeg har smakt, og uten den metalliske ettersmaken som vanligvis skjemmer slike.

Tømmermann Pils;Drammen, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aass Bryggeri;Bottle. Yellow colour with a white head. A very standard cheap lager beer. Light malty and hoppy aroma and flavour.

Springfield Mueller Anniversary Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Springfield Brewing Company;Shared bottle from a cellar cleaning.

Springfield Mueller Anniversary Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Springfield Brewing Company;GABF 2004: Light copper color with a lacey white head. Aroma hints at strawberry candy and fresh hops. Starts with a nice candy malty sweetness and some light fruit complexity. Full bodied and well balanced, but has some different flavors from what I’m used to in a barleywine. Still hides its alcohol well and is a unique and good beer.
Springfield Mueller Anniversary Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Springfield Brewing Company;This is not a normal barleywine - slightly sweet, but very earthy and piney and metallic - also thinner and very very easier drinking than most BWs. Warms up to a super smooth and not AT ALL 10% brew - not thin from the alcohol and not cloying from the sweetness of the malt. Wonderful and thanks to Indra for this rare treat.
Springfield Mueller Anniversary Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Springfield Brewing Company;Deep rich wood color - like that ancient but well cared for chiffarobe in a classy antique shop. This is the highlight of a really mediocre microbrewery and it is very, very good. Excellent balance between plumlike fruitier tones and spice and nut action. It's six dollars a bottle and well worth it, if only becuase it's an excellent brew among lackluster entries
Springfield Mueller Anniversary Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Springfield Brewing Company;This beer rocks!... Clear mahogany ale with a small, white, fizzy head. Lasting, stratus wisps of head float atop the brew throughout the tasting. The nose is of orange blossom honey, fig, caramel and evergreen. Caramel, toffee and pineapple in the flavor. Well-balanced by the hops and alcohol. Full-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Great brew!
Springfield Mueller Anniversary Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Springfield Brewing Company;Intriguing aroma, with caramel-drenched cinnamon rolls, lightly perfumed flowers, nutmeg, faint berry and apple fruitiness, butterscotch, prickly pine needles, a slight earthiness as it warms and wafts of alcoholic vapor. The reddish-orange of a California sunset, lightly hazy with a quick-settling head. Flavor profile is buttery, toffeeish, sugary sweet, and lightly nutty with a generous dosage of spicy hop flavors and bitterness. Finishes strongly with fruit and more evident alcohol. Sends a pleasant warmth coursing through one's veins. Excellently done.
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);The foam stability is medium. The aroma malty, light, a bit bitter. the taste is malty, a bit bitter and watery. Drinkable.
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);"Beer with yellow color, light body, light bitterness, some foam on top, average carbonized, (shared a 50cl can beer with PG, bought at ""Pyaterochka"", Saint Petersburg, RU #991)(#12 RU)."
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Pours clear golden with a white and rather stable head. Aroma has malty notes of fruits and grain combined with moderate sourness. Taste follows the aroma, sweetish fruity flavour, hint of yeast and dryish finish. Well-balanced overall. A nice one for a bulk lager. (Poured from a 0,5l can, bb 04.04.20)
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Bottle, 500 ml. I got this as a present from a friend. Deep, darker shade of golden, shows there are stuffs inside. Decent off-white foam, can be recalled by swirling the glass any time. Aromas of sweet malt and some faint fruits like ripe apricot. I miss the hops big time, which makes the palate sweet. Fruity tones in the background, but the hoppy bitternes is missing unfortunately. Medium- aftertaste with sweet end. Usually i never get disappointed with Carlsberg beers, and this is a fair lager too from Baltika (Carlsberg Brewery) with a good carbonization inside, but it could be way more exciting with some more hops (or other kind of hops) inside to balance the sweetness of the malt. Not bad, extra point for the label design... Sooooo Russian.
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Can at 4.7%. Clear golden colour. Basic white head. Aroma: malts. Light body. Clean grainy taste. Restrained fruitiness.
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Light aroma and taste of malt and grassy hops. The aftertaste is slightly dry. Not very good, not disgusting just boring!
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);"Held onto this .5 L bottle way too long. Brought from Russia in 2004 along with other beers, vodkas, and our wonderful boy Vanya. Wanted to share this with a Russian-speaking acquaintance who could never make it out and whose diabetes got worse. Okay, I’m opening it to celebrate our move, having let it ""lager"" for 4 years. At least it’s been in the fridge almost the entire time. Pours straw yellow, lots of bubbles, and a nice big head. Smell is light bready malt, a whiff of adjunct. Taste is actually above the usual cheap lager. A bit of fusel at first, but it clears away quickly. Does in fact seem to be an all-grain taste, just a basic balance of hops. Light citrus note. Goes down very well in the summer. I’m sure if I’d found this in a store around here, it’d have sat in an uncooled warehouse under florescent lights for months and tasted awful. Probably cost 75 cents American over in St. Petersburg."
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);500mL bottle. Another sample of urine. This one has an amazing white foamy head. Nice skunky hop aroma (for a lager). Not much flavor. Very light beer. Body and texture. An OK Lawn-mowin beer.
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Pour is a bright gold with a big fluffly white head. Aroma is sweet malt with a bit of vegatable. Flavor is again some sweet malts and some grassyness. Nothing great but it is refreshing after cutting the grass on a humid day. Bonus it that it only cost $1.99 for an 18 oz bottle.
Leningradskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Very pale straw color with a moderate, white, fluffy head. Nice small bubbles continually stream to the top. Aromas of pale grains, grass and wild flowers. Very sweet, with malt and corn syrup. Small amount of herbal flowers come in mid quaff. Somewhat thin and fizzy in feel. A light euro lager, that still has some of the strong qualities and flavors. Certainly beats many micros.
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Not a bad Cerveza, smells ok no skunky aroma, the color and clarity of the beer is good, the taste is a little bitter for a cerveza. overall it is good.
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Not a bad tasting beer , a cross between a rolling rock and a Corona Light. Light Aroma , not as pungent , typical skunky mexican beer , but for 3.99 a six pack bottles , aint too bad of a beer , you get what you pay for..... Not as discriptive as the preppy douchebag fratboys below, but you get the point......
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Canned. Pours a thick, and I mean THICK head. Tastes at first like a cheap Dos XX knock off, then finishes much worse. The disturbing part is the head that begins to resemble styrofoam in a finished glass after a few hours. Will not try again.
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Pours a mellow golden yellow color. Aromas of grains, light hops, and a funky musty smell. Flavor is bland with a weird funk, add a lime to it to kill the funky taste and it is almost drinkable.
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);This was a straight up shitty beer. Smells like strong rotting vegetables, corny and very lightly malty. Kind of an oily mouthfeel, with almost no flavor to speak of. Bland and boring and watery.
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);A pretty bad beer. The aroma is corn like and skunky. Its got that rubber taste that so many south of the border beers have along with the weakest hops and malt imaginable. The palate is very weak. I won’t drink another.
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Pale yellow, light fizzy head, no retention. Nose of skunky chewy tic-tacs and grains steeped in antifreeze. The flavor is chewy, large body and lots of things I can’t be my hands around. Thick proteins, light hops, watery finish, skunky film left behind.
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);If you like Coors, you will like this beer. It has much the same lack of flavor, lack of character. Since it is in a can, I can’t see it. Just as well. I bought it ($7.99 for an 18 pack) so I will drink it...maybe I’ll try making ice cubes with it...
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Eh...certainly not anything special about this lager that I could detect. Like a slighty watered down Corona. Not offensive by any means, but not noteworthy.
San Lucas Special Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Tastes a little skunky. Reminds me of some of the cheaper European brews like Holsten, or something like that. Not too bad for a cheap Mexican Esque beer.

Turonis Vinnys Light Lager;Evansville, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;"tap at the main brewpub - Note that all the beers were billed as ""Main Street Brewing"", no mention of Turonis, though at least that keeps them separate from Main Street Brewing in Ohio.

Turonis Vinnys Light Lager;Evansville, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Tap: Golden hue with a lasting fizzy head. The aroma is that of wet pale grains, light noble hop herbal and grassy vapours and a hint of DMS. The taste is almost akin to Bud Light but with a bit more faint noble hop and pils malt character, light veggie tones. The mouth feel is crisp and refreshing enough. My bowling teammates actually liked the ales over this and I guess that says a lot. Boring...

Turonis Ol 23 Stout;Evansville, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;One would expect a stout to have a very nice thick head, but this one had no head at all.

Nice roasted malt and soft vanilla nose. Lightly chalky black malt edge paired with caramel, esters, chocolate fudge, and molasses. Mellow carbonation. Slippery body. Understated hop snap paves the way for soft notes of vanilla and roasted malts. Finishes lightly seared with a touch of apple acidity, which is the only distracting element. I credit Eric, (the sort-of new head brewer), for the turnaround of this once-undrinkable, so-called stout.
Turonis Ol 23 Stout;Evansville, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;"Mostly coffee and chocolate, some vinous notes but not enough to compete.

Turonis Monks Dubbel Ale;Evansville, Indiana, United States;Dubbel;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;my advice is to avoid this beer. I have never had a dubbel before but I’m pretty sure it is not supposed to be like this. The glass came with very low carbonation, and no head. half way through the glass the carbonation was completely gone. The taste wasn’t to terrible, and as I said I can’t compare it to other beers of this style. The beer tasted of sweet toffee with a hint of chocolate.

Kelley Brothers Dutch Point Porter;Manteca, California, United States;Porter;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;Suprisingly, I had never had their porter during the many trips I made to this place, so getting to try this was kinda cool. And the beer turns out to be a very nice beer at the same time. Aroma was chocolate defined. Tons, and tons of chocolate with a underscoring of roasted malts. Can’t recall the last porter I had that had this much chocolate. Appearance was dark, dark brown to black, no head. A bit thin and watery in the mouth. Flavors are chocolate, roasted malts but suprisingly not really sweet and finishes a bit on the dry side. Nice suprise!
Kelley Brothers Dutch Point Porter;Manteca, California, United States;Porter;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;Tap at the Toronado. Very dark brown color with a foamy light brown head.

Snowshoe ESB;Arnold, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Snowshoe Brewing Company;Draft. Rich amber color with a thin off-white head. Roasty/nutty aroma. Slight roast flavor with citrus hops. Roastiness takes away from the enjoyment and leads to a muddled beer.

Smoky Mountain Winter Warmer;Gatlinburg, Tennessee, United States;Old Ale;Smoky Mountain Brewery & Restaurant;"Draft at turkey creek pub. Pours amber and moderately clear. Nose is rich bready malts, toast, and a touch of coffee. Flavor is similar, rich bread, caramels, toffee, toast, and just a faint roast malt flavor like on the side of coffee or chocolates. Not overly amazing but I actually liked it considering the ""mass-market"" approach of the establishment."
Smoky Mountain Winter Warmer;Gatlinburg, Tennessee, United States;Old Ale;Smoky Mountain Brewery & Restaurant;Aroma is a very sweet caramel type aroma. Smells like a bunch of sticky raisins.

Smoky Mountain Winter Warmer;Gatlinburg, Tennessee, United States;Old Ale;Smoky Mountain Brewery & Restaurant;Appearance: Pours out a clear, humble-looking, brown body with a woefully thin, short-lived head. A rather dull look, I must say. Smell: Let’s have a sniff! Smells of simple toast, fire-licked nuts, cocoa, and an open box of Sun-Maid raisins. Taste: Essentially, what you smell is what you get in the taste, with a follow-through of toasted bread given a light dusting of sweetish cocoa powder. Slight nuttiness throughout. Background dark fruitiness. Very mild bitterness. Drying finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Light carbonation. Drinkability: Never exceeds being merely ’okay’. The relatively light body and carbonation leaves this one feeling a bit lean in the mouth. Can we get some melanoidin malt up in this?
Rocky River Brewery Twin Peaks Pilsener;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);A pretty medicore attempt at a pilsner. With all the Bohemian and Classic German Pilsners I've been sampling lately this is a joke. A slight sour flavor with nothing but water to back it up. As much of a pils as Miller Lite and honestly not a whole lot better.
Rocky River Brewery Twin Peaks Pilsener;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);Could have used a little something. lacks the crispness that I like in in a American Pils, and didn't have the depth of flavor I expect in a European. Not bad, and very drinkable, but nothing to set it apart from the pack
Rocky River Brewery Twin Peaks Pilsener;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);Bright yellow with a small head that stayed until the bottom of the mug. Strange soft banana pudding taste, although the beer was very light and watery. Not the best brewpub pils I'v had!

Rocky River Brewery Panther Creek Porter;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);Bottle-Mellow Mushroom-Chattanooga, TN. A small sized light brown head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The nose was that of chocolate and mild coffee. It had a mild coffee taste to it with some malt notes. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth and medium bodied. This beer had an excellent lace to it. This was a mild Porter in my opinion.
Rocky River Brewery Panther Creek Porter;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 5. This bottled brew was enjoyed at the Mellow Mushroom in Chattanooga Tennessee which had 40 taps and about 72 different bottles of beer. It poured a small head of fine to large sized light brown colored bubbles that left behind an opaque dark brown colored body with no visible carbonation and a fair lace. The aroma was mild with notes of dark malt. The mouthfeel was intially thin and unbodied, but finished very stong smooth and full bodied. A strange but nice finish. The flavor was that of dark malt, mollasses, hops and mild coffee. It was a well rounded and very enjoyable brew.
Rocky River Brewery Panther Creek Porter;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);Deep black pour with a thin tan head. Good aroma full of coffee, vanilla, and roasted malt. Great smooth taste with some chocolate and caramel dominating the flavor. A damn good porter. Sample bottle given to me from the owner of the Beer Sellar in Knoxville, TN!
Rocky River Brewery Panther Creek Porter;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);This was a very nice porter. Pitch black apperance. Flavor was quite bitter like this morning's coffee minus cream and sugar. Some dark chocolate and smoke was detectable. The aftertaste was slightly sour. The body was a little thin but the excellent flavor of the beer made that a non issue.
Rocky River Brewery Panther Creek Porter;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);Black with a tan head. very faint burnt toast aroma. Coffe and malt, with some sweetihs, milt chocolatey aroma. Dry, light finish. decent flavors, but a thin body.
Rocky River Brewery Panther Creek Porter;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);Very dark brown, almost black. Caramelly, chocolatey, and smokey. Woody, oaky and dry at the end. Just like a Slopoke candy sucker that had been licked and stuck to an oak barrel that once aged some fine bitter porter.

Pours slightly hazy golden yellow with white head. Settles as flimsy patches of foam. Malty aroma. Quite sweet with notes of caramel and bisquits. Some fruity sourness. Medium carbonation and watery palate. Taste is sweetish followed by medium bitterness. Rather short aftertaste. Works okay with food but not something I would go out of my way to get.
Svaneke Påskebryg;Svaneke, Denmark;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Svaneke Bryghus;Tap@Taphouse, Copenhagen - golden amber coloured pour with white head. Medium sweet malty aroma and taste, bready malts, doughy yeast, caramel sweetness coming in, some floral hoppy backing. Fair for style.

Flavor is like a rather ordinary lager with a light malt profile and moderate bitterness. Medium body and a bit light in aftertaste. Drainable, quite straight forward lager with focus on the malty side.

Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA;Milton, Delaware, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Dogfish Head Brewery;I had this at Global Brew. Pours copper with a white head. Taste citrus, hoppy, boozy. I thought this was good. It thought this was ok strong. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA;Milton, Delaware, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Dogfish Head Brewery;I was definitely excited to find this. It was definitely worth the price. To label this an IPA is almost unfair. There's so much more to it. It definitely has a Belgian strong feel to it. I poured it from the bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a reddish mahogany with a small, off-white head. The aroma is so complex and appealing. I get dark fruits, molasses, cinnamon, bourbon, and hops. The taste is at first cherries, apricot, grapefruit, raisin, and booze. Later in the glass, you get more molasses, cinnamon, date, and bourbon. There's a tingly burn at times. It lingers quite a bit. This is something you definitely have to savor. Needless to say, it packs a helluva punch. This lives up to the hype.
Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA;Milton, Delaware, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours deep hazy brown amber with a minimalist tan head. Aroma is bonkers. Creamy dark fruit and wet bready malt. Toasted candy raisin. Taste follows with incredible depth. Finish is strong and brings those sugar hops with notes of pine and some mild bitterness. Toffee and bourbon. Unlike any other IPA I’ve tried. More like a Belgian. Still, awesome and unique.
Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA;Milton, Delaware, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottle Matt bought back from Dana Point, CA. Pours an inviting amber, cloudy at first but settles into a deep bright limpidness. Small fizzy white head. This is a HUGE BEER. Smells of apricot, goji berry, light fig, candied apple, jam, malt, cream, tonnes of booze and hop. Like a hoppier, less malty, more alcoholic wee heavy — some rye spice in there. Very smooth and despite the massive booze (almost 18%!) it is still surprisingly and dangerously drinkable. Taste has even more booze and jammy fruity malt. The big oily hops and booze keep it from being overly jammy/musty. Finish has some floral/vanilla sweetness and bubblegum esters. Body is oily and big. This is an unbelievably big beer, executed well and with perfect balance. Almost feels like an experiment in how much you can crank up the ABV and accompanying hop/malt in a beer without making it taste like gimmicky or like a spirit/liquor. Huge, apple sweetness and crispness, wood-y whiskey complexity, most enjoyable when it can be nursed.
Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA;Milton, Delaware, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottle from BevMo in Dana Point at home in HK. Rich ruby-copper pour with fine white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is complex - candied apple, deep pine resin hop, chewy bready malt like a wee heavy. In fact sort of like a massively hopped - with pine resin - big scotch ale. Taste is sweet but not quite treacly and hugely bitter. Jammy fruit, tingly bitterness. Rich palate but not too heavy somehow. Very good enormous pine-forward IPA, balances by giant sweet plum-bread malt.

Victory V12;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"From Jan 2006 Poured from bottle(bottled on Aug 27th 2004) a ruby semi *clear* gold with a very nice head of foam that diminishes slowly but never leaves the scene. The smell was immediately apparent right after I removed the stubborn cork....a whoosh of mixed fruits including bananas and plums. Oh, and there's a bit of a sour smell there as well. Could be good. ;^) The taste is very fruity as well. Tons of plum with some banana and some citrus and also, a sweetness that smacks of caramel. In the far background, I sense a bit of clove. Wow. This son of a gun is so complex and wonderfully harmonious with its flavours. And dang, the 12% abv is there but is pretty well hidden. Why was this beer retired??? Thank goodness I have 3 more bottles. *Clear as in I'm drinking from the first 3rd of the bottle. What is left in the bottle is looking a bit more cloudy. Btw, I've had this one a couple of times in the past(+2 years ago) and the bottling dates weren't a year and a half from when I tried them like this one(much less) so the aging done by Liquid Solutions or whomever has definitely paid off big time, imho! Bottom line: If you see some around your neck of the woods....grab 'em!"
Victory V12;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Color: the lightest Quad I have ever seen. Looked and tasted more like a triple to me. Reminded me of their golden monkey beer. I would've taste tested them side-by-side to see if this wasn't a bomber. Notes of plum and rum soaked raisins. A bit peppery. Prominent alcohol taste. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Victory V12;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Pours murky amber from the bottle. The frothy white head soon fades. Aroma is apple cider, plum, vinegar. Taste is sweet with caramel and fruity notes, soggy sponge, tart apple vinegar. Big bodied with mild carbonation. The imperfectly hidden alcohol makes itself felt in the finish. Okay.
Victory V12;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle. Pours a hazy dark amber with a small bubbly white head that fades to a ring. Sweet aroma, with booze and oak, caramel malt, and dark fruits. Taste is quite sweet to start then picks up an oak and hops bite before going back to sweet with dark fruits and brown sugar again. Alcohol burn on the end. Lingering sparkly sweetness. Excellent.

Glastonbury Lady of the Lake;Somerton, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glastonbury Ales.;Bottle, pours copper with a very slight head. A little toffee, acidity and caramel malt on the nose. Palate is malty, but lightly tart and acetic, sweetish and slightly cloying finish. Faulty, I assume.
Glastonbury Lady of the Lake;Somerton, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glastonbury Ales.;Cask gravity at my friends wedding down Sumerset way. It pours clear amber with minimal head. The nose is earthy, wood, leather, nut and caramel. The taste is bitter - sweet, wood, caramel, toasted nut and brown bread with a short, toasted finish. Medium body and a touch flat. Condition could have been a bit better, but this is all in all a fairly standard bitter. OK.

Glastonbury Lady of the Lake;Somerton, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glastonbury Ales.;From bottle. Malty, herbal hopped aroma. Big bubbles carbonation. Frothy lacey head over cloudy amber beer (both Glastonbury beers I’ve tried so far have had some cloudy residue towards the end of the pour). Good balance of fresh sweet maltiness with light herbal bitterness. Vanilla notes in the dry sweet finish.
Glastonbury Lady of the Lake;Somerton, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glastonbury Ales.;Bottle from ASDA Poole. Cloudy orange. I like this one, good nose and great balance of hops against quite a malty caramel backbone. But, hideously overcarbed again, took two careful pours to get it in the pint glass.

San Francisco Billy Goat Double Bock;San Francisco, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;San Francisco Brewing Company;The bocks brewed at this establishment - especially the St. Stephen’s Bock - are the best I have ever tasted from an American microbrewery. If you visit San Francisco during the late fall and winter, be sure to stop by the pub and see what bock is on tap.
San Francisco Billy Goat Double Bock;San Francisco, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;San Francisco Brewing Company;Not even a good try. This was downright piss-poor. Very little head. Not much abv. Light Amber color and a lighter body than any bock I've ever had.
San Francisco Billy Goat Double Bock;San Francisco, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;San Francisco Brewing Company;Black/brown, medum head, not long lasting.

Celestus 6 Blond;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;Bottled. Old rating from my second rating notebook, apparently missed to add this. Amber colour, small head. Flavour is malts, some fruits, alcohol and yeast. Flavour is fruit, alcohol, and mild yeast.

Celestus 6 Blond;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;Bottled (BB 07/2005) Clear amber color, tight white head, some lace. Nose has toffee, smoked ham (!) and grassy hops.

Celestus 6 Blond;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;(Bottled) Clear amber color with a small, vanishing, lacy head. Sweetish-caramely, fruity and slightly yeasty aroma with acidic and sour hints. Sweet-malty, somewhat fruity and hoppy, slightly acidic, bitter and sour flavor with rye and toffee hints. Medium-bodied, bitter and acidic palate with moderate carbonation. I’m pretty sure this is Tongerlo 6 Blonde, since it felt familiar from the first sniff. A slightly below-average blond, but drinkable.
Celestus 6 Blond;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;"(Bottle 33 cl) Actually more amber than blond, what I usually refer to as fully golden. Filtered with a HUGE head that never flattens - quite impressive. Typical Belgian yeasty notes, otherwise fruity with some nutty notes. Fresh with some bitterness in the palate. ""Celestus"" is a brand for a Belgian supermarket-chain (have forgotten which) and I wonder if this is just a Tongerlo 6 Blond in disguise? 050305"
Celestus 6 Blond;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;"The disembogues from the 330ml brown bottle a lightly clouded amber color with a dinosauric semi-creamy light tan head and as it slowly fades to nothingness the lace forms a satin sheet to lie upon the glass. The aroma of ripe peaches, sweet and appetizing; crisp with the start sweet and the malt profile perfect, top is light to moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops ever so mild but pleasant, very dry and lingering aftertaste, ah what is better than a well made beer, “Hell Yeah”, another well-made beer."
Celestus 6 Blond;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;YMER in the aroma. Unpleasant flavour. Very yeasty and rather watery. Thin body with a weak mouthfeel.
Celestus 6 Blond;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;A bit darker blond beer with a small white head. The aroma is candy sugar and light malty. The taste is initially very sweet and fruity with a more bitter finish. Quite an ok beer but lacks that little extra.
Celestus 6 Blond;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;hazy golden-orange with a fine head and a nice lace, candy sugar and undefined fruits in a discreet aroma, medium-bodied with a moderate dry bitterness - incredibly lacking of character
Baltika 10 Jubileynoe (Jubilee);St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Quite unusual and interesting spice lager. Perhaps, it's not my kind of beer, but I will never forget it. Clear golden appearance, poor head, lovely spicy aroma, grassy (to say the least) palate. Funny.
Baltika 10 Jubileynoe (Jubilee);St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);A very interesting beer. Aroma from pepper, and some other spices. Flavour from marzipan and bitter almond.
Baltika 10 Jubileynoe (Jubilee);St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Golden. Fine creamy head. Spicy peppery aroma. Interesting flavor of marzipan. Slight bitter in the end. This high rating cod of the attempt to brew something different.
Baltika 10 Jubileynoe (Jubilee);St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Bottled. Straw colour, moderate head and condition. Well at least it looks like beer. Rollercoaster ride of aromas starting with marzipan followed by a peppery herbal note that turns to curry powder and finally settles on chicken skin. In the mouth there is still some marzipan noticable but anything else is drowned out by chicken stock. Did not linger long enough in my mouth for any judgement on aftertaste that sretches beyond one sylable.
Baltika 10 Jubileynoe (Jubilee);St. Petersburg, Russia;Flavored - Other;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Almond extract is evident in both the aroma and flavor. Unlike Baltika's other numbered beers, which are in ascending order with beer strength, #10 is only 5.2% ABV. The almond, and apparently basil, provide a uniqueness in a beer that I have not tried. A pretty decent effort and recommended if you can get your hands on this limited release.
Cambridge Straight-Up Stout (Straight Edge);Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cambridge Brewing Company;Average stout. There is really nothing special about it but its still a good beer none the less.
Kraftbrau Scotch Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kraftbrau Brewery;RBSG2003 (extended) (On tap at the brewery) This beer rocks! Deep, hazy copper brew with a small, quickly diminishing head. The aroma? Wow! Me likes! Fruity, leathery, smokey and very astringent. Mysterious. Musty and old smelling like weathered paper and a good, single malt scotch whiskey. The flavor is malty with blasts of light molasses, but also pungent and lemony. Warm alcohol as well. Heavy and full-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel and pillow-soft carbonation. Short, sweet finish. Excellent, world class scotch ale!
Kraftbrau Scotch Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kraftbrau Brewery;OK, my first brew to rate without a rating. I sampled this brew in the brewers Pub in Kalamazoo, MI. This brew pours a small white head of fine bubbles and a light reddish transparent body color. It has a mild fruity aroma and a flat taste of cherries. Overall, I found it to be very nice and drinkable, but had to place the tastes. Of course that was after sampling seven beers across the street at bells and several of Kraftbrau’s 5 oz samples of some of there other brews.

Relakspol Excellent Mocne;Kraków, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Relakspol;Bottled. Golden color. That hensfood aroma again, yet slight of it. Not such alcohol feel as one would think. Sweetish flavor with a slight bitter ending.

Michigan Brewing Bavarian Dark;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Michigan Brewing Company;This one has a pretty low ABV.

Boundary Bay Dunkles Bock;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boundary Bay Brewery;GABF 2010. Pours a deep red amber with thin head. Aroma is big sweet caramelized malts, big caramunich, vienna breadiness, toffee, earth leather, slight fruitiness and light hops.

Boundary Bay Dunkles Bock;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boundary Bay Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Rating #9 of the beer. Pours garnet in color with a trim beige head. Smells and tastes of raisins, rye, black licorice, earth, and malt. Bolder in aroma than flavor, but this is still pretty awesome for a Dukles -- easily the best I’ve had since I was in Germany.
Boundary Bay Dunkles Bock;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boundary Bay Brewery;Deep mahogany body with a nice top. Not much nose is able to be coaxed from this one. The body proves quite sweet for the style, plenty of unfermented sugars. Perhaps this batch is a bit under-attenuated? A fine medley of caramunich and vienna malts and the like. Enjoyable.

The alcohol definitely brought a smile to my face, similar to what scrizzz reported (funny!)...I found myself grinning ear-to-ear by the time I finished the pint.
Boundary Bay Dunkles Bock;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boundary Bay Brewery;draught at brewery. rich toasty even breakfast oatmeal aroma, rich heavy clear brown, nice lacing. heavily malted complex goodness. long roasted finish. makes me smile
Boundary Bay Dunkles Bock;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boundary Bay Brewery;At the brewpub. Served way too cold, around 4-5 degrees C. Nice burgundy colour. No aroma at all until about 10 minutes of trying to massage some heat into it, but once it had warmed, it gave off a lovely rich malty aroma, toffee, caramel, rye bread, licorice and light spice. Full-bodied. Flavour shows a big maltiness, molasses, licorice, dark cherry. Yeast gives off an interesting minty and herbal character. Once warmed, is a solid brew.
Boundary Bay Dunkles Bock;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boundary Bay Brewery;Dark brown with auburn highlights. Aroma of earthy, chocolatey malt. Full body. Smooth, dark malt palate. Slight raspberry note. Chewy, toffeeish finish. Served way too cold, this beer was useless at first glance, but opened up as it warmed and is actually quite a good bock.
Boundary Bay Dunkles Bock;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boundary Bay Brewery;Didn't care much for this one.Brown in color, beige head. Slightly metallic malt nose.Flavor is all malt but with a yeasty, fatty ending. Decent body
Boundary Bay Dunkles Bock;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boundary Bay Brewery;Gold Medalist at the 2001 GABF. The new batch was just recently released with much anticipation (at least on my behalf). Very dark color, very modest flavor. Very mellow and perfectly round. The malt is teeming with nuttiness and baked bread and the alchohol gives way to licorice and vinous notes. Although not really a big beer, this is definitely a very well crafted brew.
Lindens Rude Boy Scotch Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Lindens Brewing Company;Deep copper in color. Nice thick, creamy head. N'Western hops present and quite sweet. Bold hop accent but lower on the bitterness than I was expecting (needs more). Overall a nice beer to drink.
Tracks Old Mill Ale;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tracks Brew Pub (Canada);Draft - Light toast and caramel. Muddy brown with a small white head. Raisin, some prune and sweet toasty malts. Kinda like a dubbel. Not bad
Tracks Old Mill Ale;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tracks Brew Pub (Canada);A typical inoffensive red beer with a surprisingly nice aroma. Just a hint of hops in it, balanced by sweetness. Flavour isn’t much... A bit of bitterness over smooth malt. Not very intense, but not bad. I’d compare this favorably to Rickard’s Red or Upper Canada Dark, at least. Hoped for more from a brewpub, but that’s what the Granite is for.

Tracks Old Mill Ale;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tracks Brew Pub (Canada);Dark red-amber. Small purple-grey head. Light malt, fruit (cherry?), & hop aroma. Medium body. Fruity (cherry, grape), at first, giving way to light malt & a moderately bitter finish. Slight carbonated, mineral water character.
Tracks Old Mill Ale;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tracks Brew Pub (Canada);This suburban sports bar has had a brewery on premises for quite some time. They produce a lager and an ale, though from what I've heard only one at a time. Old Mill Ale is a dark amber ale with pleasing fruity-hoppy aroma, reminiscent of leaves, pears and maybe melon. The body matches these flavours with a slight bitterness in the beginning, followed by a sticky maltiness, a product of the extract nature of the brewery, but not offputting. Carbonation is nice and low, making for a pleasantly drinkable pint.
Church-Key Cranberry Maple Wheat;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Church-Key Brewing;"On tap. Cloudy straw pour with quickly diminishing white head. Nose is all tarty cranberry and strawberry. Up front is the same. Not getting much of the syrup, but I can’t imagine what this would taste like without the added ingredient. Finishes with a salty earthiness. Not getting a yeasty ""wheat beer"" character. Just not very good."

Church-Key Cranberry Maple Wheat;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Church-Key Brewing;341 bottle from 6-pack purchased at brewery. Pours light gold with thin white head. Strong berry smell. Fairly strong berry taste with a dry finish. All in all a decent summer beer.
Church-Key Cranberry Maple Wheat;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Church-Key Brewing;A fine looking hazy wheat ale with an aroma of jolly ranchers and it tastes okay but is reminiscent of a bagful of artificially flavoured halloween suckers floating around in an okay american wheat. Sorry CK I love you and this beer is well made but I don’t get it. It’s like a girl drink.
Church-Key Cranberry Maple Wheat;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Church-Key Brewing;341 ml bottle - pours a clear medium gold colour with very little head. Aroma is mainly fruitiness with cherry upfront, some cranberry, and a hint of green apple. Flavour a bit strange - a bit too saccharine and not much maple at all. I guess cranberry is in there, but the whole thing kind of reminded me a bit of cherry fluoride. A decent grainy presence in the body saves this one from being completely ridiculous. Didn’t get much wheat. First Church-Key brew I’ve had that I’ve been slightly disappointed by. Oh well, I guess there had to be one.....interesting experiment though.
Church-Key Cranberry Maple Wheat;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Church-Key Brewing;Bottled sample via gregclow. Light gold in colour with fairly strong carbonation. Aromas of cherry, some cranberry, a bit of lemon, herbs, and some light sweet malts. Some tart cranberry flavors, along with some very mild maple notes. There’s an odd artificial sweetner flavor there too that just doesn’t work for me. The body is very thin, and there just doesn’t seem like a whole much else going on.
Church-Key Cranberry Maple Wheat;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Church-Key Brewing;This wheat beer poured a light cloudy yellow colour with a frothy white head. To the nose was a full blow of fruit. Almost medicine like, cough syrup to be exact. Very hard to get around the sweet cranberry smell. Swedish berries come to mind. First sip is sweet and all I can taste is the cranberries. Still reminds me of cough syrup with a beer base. At least its not as sweet as some other fruit beer I’ve had before. This beer is a one bottle per day beer, I don’t think I could handle any more.

This draft beer has a small off-white head that is long lasting, opaque straw body and spotty amounts of lacing. The aroma is malt, wheat, sweet, bananas, spicy, and clove. The taste is lightly sweet, malt, wheat, bananas, clove, and light spice. The mouthfeel is light tingly carbonation and this beer is medium bodied. This is an easy drinking and session beer. The various flavors come together nicely and I would drink this beer again.
Rock Bottom El Jefe Hefeweizen;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Dark hazy orange pour, served with a slice of orange floating on top so you know what your palate is about to get. Smells like citrus, banana, wheat, and clove. Tastes pretty much like that, but with some hops that I couldnt get from the smell, and more of a wheat finish. Medium bodied and quite refreshing. It’s like a beer-snob’s version of Blue Moon.
Rock Bottom El Jefe Hefeweizen;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Draft at Rock Bottom La Jolla.

Bagel Beer Everything IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;"Well, ther’s nothing especially wrong with it, and there are no specifically bad flavors.

Bagel Beer Everything IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Brewtopia’04. Hazy, heady beer. Again, a very bready, doughy smelling brew, some raisin aromas. Flavor was grainy, some pine, salt at the end, Could stand to be a bit more bitter.
Bagel Beer Everything IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;This produced a huge, long lasting, creamy, off white head over a muddy, orange-amber colored beer. The aroma was too bready for my liking coming from an IPA. Hints of Apricot in the aroma too. The flavor got back on track a little better, but overall this just misses the mark somewhat.

Very weak aroma, but some undefined sweetness (malt), which goes in direction of caramel. High carbonized and unfortunate not a beer with much taste. Some hops are present, but it is not in balance. Short finish.
Chapelle Northmæn Rousse;La Chapelle-Saint-Ouen, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;la Chapelle;Kind of a strange beer. It is pretty bland for being 7% but it’s not bad I suppose. It does have aromas and flavors of apricot, grapes and honey so it is kind of sweet but none of the mentioned attributes give it enough zing to make it memorable. It also has a rather light body given the alcohol.

Poured almost flat with rising bubbles, aroma of cherries and apricot, reddish amber. Taste is sour and thin with an oily malt texture, bland for a 7% beer. Belgian candy sugar sweetness.

Big Buck GTs Java Porter;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Porter;Big Buck Brewery;Black brown color with a nice medium to large sized brown creamy head. Pretty good lacing. Nose is chocolate roasted malt, coffee, and some cardboard, and maybe even a strange garbage smell. I wonder how clean all the tap lines were at this brewery.......Taste is of chocolate, stale coffee, and brown sugar. Pretty smooth. Just ok in my book.
Big Buck GTs Java Porter;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Porter;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at the brewery, probably there best offering. Pours with a thick, light brown head covering a black body.

Big Buck GTs Java Porter;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Porter;Big Buck Brewery;Cola-fizz in the glass, caramel head, 98% opaque with only the faintest tint of red against a bright light. Dry coffee aroma, with a hint of candy-like flavor. Chocolately notes in the flavor, making it a bit like a Kahlua candy. Except, this is aggressively dry. Unfortunately, what stood out for me was an aroma and flavor like Prego-brand Extra Chunky Garden Vegetable Spaghetti Sauce. The body reminded me that this was a porter, not a stout. Decent beer, if I hadn't been so frequently reminded of spaghetti sauce.... (on tap, Grapevine, TX location)
Big Buck GTs Java Porter;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Porter;Big Buck Brewery;Sampled draught at Big Buck, Grapevine, Texas. Very black. Big coffee aroma. medium bodiued and really roasty. Dry, but not very firm. Bitter salty finish.

Like all of their beers this had a very watery body, kinda lifeless after the first sip. Soft caramel malt flavor up front, a touch roasty, but bland and watery.

Waitrose Organic Ale;Bracknell, Berkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Waitrose;Really, really unpleasant ale that is blatantly made by someone who cares about ’organic’ products, but has no knowledge about, or interest in, beer. It tastes disgusting and lingers unpleasantly (after a deceptively ok cereal malt nose).
Waitrose Organic Ale;Bracknell, Berkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Waitrose;Bottle picked up from Waitrose, Witney, 29-07-06. Copper coloured beer that had a large white head. Aroma was a little strange it’s bizarre that this is organic coz’ I felt that if anything the aroma was a bit chemically. Fairly uninspiring in the taste dept’ some maltyiness and low levels of bitterness, just a bit to safe really.

Pepperwood Monkey Brown Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Murky brown. Big over abundant foam. Almost a gusher. Nose is musty dark malt . Flavour is nothing.

Three Floyds Evil Elf (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Dubbel;Three Floyds Brewing Company;THIS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT BEER FOR ME .IT WAS SWEET AND TANGY WITH FRUIT OVERTONE REMINDED ME OF RABBID RABBIT WITH A LOT OF ALCOHOL.HAD IT IN 2004 AND WISH THEY WOULD BRING IT BACK CHEERS TO THE GUYS
Three Floyds Evil Elf (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Dubbel;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This is very complex. Sweetness and tanginess right up front gives way to subdued fruitiness. Pretty red-orange color with a rapidly diminishing head and carbonation level. Notable alcoholic presence. Great on a cold evening, but appropriate anytime. Quite good.
Three Floyds Evil Elf (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Dubbel;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Really an unusual brew. Not a Dubbel per se, but excellent none the less. While the residual sweetness breaks through to leave the taste of plums and raisins. Then come the hops. Full flavored here in the typical Floyd's fashion yet nicely blended to compliment the overall experience.
Three Floyds Evil Elf (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Dubbel;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Surprisingly complex...I bet this was the millionth batch that finally turned out good! Candy Sugar and dark fruits added to a huge alcoholic first sip. I compared it to an Orval that accidently got dry hopped for 90 minutes. I hope this becomes a regular and makes me fear the upcoming Alpha Kong Quadruppel!
Three Floyds Evil Elf (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Dubbel;Three Floyds Brewing Company;WOW! what a cool brew-Nick FLoyd himself brought this keg out to the tap at the brewery in Munster. I am not familiar with the style of brew, but he said it tastes like Duval. Candy aroma, apperance was cloudy beige-palate was sweet sweet sweet-nice subtle hop bite to round it all out-maybe they will try to make this a regular?

Wagner Valley Sled Dog Trippelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;750ml bottle. Reddish brown pour, small head. Aroma is rich malts, toffee and raisan. Malty sweat taste with some toffee. Smooth yet complex. Velvety feel. Mild carbonation. Very good start to finish.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Trippelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;A family favorite. Aroma is red apple peel, some toffee, and a corn syrup malt extract (in a good way). Pours deep red brown with no head but noticeable carbonation. Taste is sweet with instant iced tea, apple peel, and malt. Very easy on the palette despite the ABV and dangerously easy to chug. Still a dependably great brew.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Trippelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;750ml bottle from Jesterdeal. Older bottling. Thanks. Pours a dark brown color with a minimal off-white head that quickly dissipates to fine ring. The aroma is quite pungent with rich malts, caramel, toffee and some molasses. The flavor mirrors the aroma, lots of complex toffee, caramel, molasses, raisins and dark roasted grains. The palate is full and viscous with soft carbonation. Finishes long and dry with lingering toffee. Overall: one of the best dopplebocks I have ever sampled. Good stuff, highly recommended for lovers of this style.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Trippelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Dark orange with small off white head. Aroma brown sugar, bread, candied fruits. Medium full body, strong warm alcohol presence. Flavors of molasses, caramel, citrus, dark dried fruits. Pretty sweet. Some good flavors here but I thought with this one the alcohol was not well hidden and interfered too much.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Trippelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle shared by jayhawk73. Thanks Jeff! 2008 Vintage A: This beer appears a burnt orange hue, perhaps slightly dark brown. The head stands in at an eighth inch and leaves some good lacing in its wake. S: The aroma is pleasant and consists of lager malt, caramels, brown sugar, and toffee. T: A delicious bock beer. Well balanced and full of flavor, this one is not too sweet or hot. Delectable toffees and sweet breads, along with caramels in soaked in alcohol. M: Surprisingly smooth and creamy, it seems as though a few years of aging has worked some magic on this beer, though I have no point of reference. D: Very tasty. I easily consumed my half of the 750 mL bottle. Would definitely drink again. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 02-01-2011
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Trippelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;750mL bottle, quite old. Poured crystal-clear, deep coppery-amber with a dusting of smoked tan head.. nice color to it. The aroma picked up warm, aged molasses, caramel, chewy dark bread, and a hint of chocolate.. alcohol amplified, and did nothing but help enhance the goodness. The flavor found similar stuff.. aged molasses, maple, and rye bread at the core, with peppery alcohol and warm, slightly jammy dark fruits around.. a little acidity helped guide the deliciousness through the finish. Heavier-bodied with low-moderate carbonation on the palate.. felt great.. loved it!
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Trippelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;This one has been sitting in my cellar for a few years. Dark amber pour, thin lasting brown head. Very nice big aroma of molasses and brown sugar. Smooth drinking, no hint of alcohol or boozy taste. Sweet. Make a nice after dinner sipper. Very malty, taste of dark fruit and molases. I’m going to get a fresh one to compare but really enjoyed this one with a little age.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Trippelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;I don’t remember much about this one, other than thinking it was a bit weird that we had to pay an extra 50 cents to taste it during a tasting of beers on tap at the brewery/vineyard. My guess is that it was higher in alcohol? Seems like commonplace these days... Most of their beer was pretty forgettable.
Ritter First Premium-Pils;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Sampled from 0.5 l bottle from ’Rudat’, best before April 2018. Clear, golden yellow with a thin, foamy, stable, white head. Sweetish, slightly grassy aroma of grains and hints of straw. Sweetish, slightly bitter, moderately grassy-spicy taste of grains and some straw, followed by a short, slightly bitter, moderately grassy-spicy, a bit dry finish.

Ritter First Premium-Pils;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Thanks Ogi! Poured a golden tinged yellow with a thick white head that went away slowly. Hm, nice. The aroma isn’t bad, mild herbal hoppy pleasant note, with mild sweet maltiness... slightly too light though. Dry grainty taste, however, ending strangely salty. Weak salty/bitter finish. Not too lean, OK body, but this is just on the slightly worse side of generic. Which seems to be the norm for the brewery.

Locher Balik Beer;Appenzell, Switzerland;Porter - Baltic;Locher Appenzeller Bier;330ml bottle from Stansted airport. Pours clear reddish caramelly colour, off-white head. Aroma of sweet caramelly malts, yellow plums, wood, turpentine. Taste is freaky. Strawberry jam, marmalade, alcohol, wood, tar, sherry in taste. Sweet liqueur taste is aftertaste. Medium bodied, average carbonation. That's some really weird stuff. I've no idea why it's under baltic porter, but label says same. There are no hints of any porter style in this beer. But in weird way I can drink it.
Locher Balik Beer;Appenzell, Switzerland;Porter - Baltic;Locher Appenzeller Bier;Not a Baltic porter! Golden coloured and clear. Has a white head, medium duration. Heavy sweet malty aorma, alcohol too. Heavy sweet flavor, warming alcohol.

Aroma of caramel, malt, sour wood with hints of smoke, fruits and some basement notes. Alcohol is quite well integrated for a 11% beer. Quite sweet with some wooden sourness and a bit harsh bitterness in the finish. Quite strange, but interesting enough. (2013-06-05)

Locher Balik Beer;Appenzell, Switzerland;Porter - Baltic;Locher Appenzeller Bier;Bottle from a deli shop at Heathrow. Pours clear dark golden with a big creamy snow white head. Aroma is spicy and perfumed grainy. Taste is spiced grains, lots of alcohol, reminds me more of a strong lager, this is not a porter. Burning alcoholic aftertaste, my lips feel numb.

Locher Balik Beer;Appenzell, Switzerland;Porter - Baltic;Locher Appenzeller Bier;Bottle. Pours with a thin white head that disappears quickly, clear coppery orange color. Sweet maltiness, candy, and fruits in the aroma. Candy sugar drives the flavor, vanilla, and just an overall sweetness with booze that I really don’t like. Thicker body, and just doesn’t suit. Bleh really.
Laško Bandidos Tequila;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Sweetish-arificial beginning. Fresh, hints of malt, not too sweet, but quite artificial. No real Tequila there, only undefined sweetish beer. Easy to drink with a slight bitterness in the end.

Laško Bandidos Tequila;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;I’ve tried all the Bandidos varieties, and I have to admit this was is my least favourite. Pours a clear golden color, with a small white head and basically no retention. Malty aroma is overpowered by citrusy smell, as well as something that should be tequila supposedly. The taste is slightly fruity, slighty bitter with a weird, again supposedly tequila-like finish. Meh.
Laško Bandidos Tequila;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Bottle. Pours a yellow body, with a small white head that diminishes quickly, leaving almost no lace. Weird tequila aroma as soon as I open the beer, some faint malts too. But taste is nice. Sure, not a beer per se, but that lemon really softens the result, had a tequila beer before, and this is really better. Average carbo, thin body, watery texture. Not that bad really, better than expected.
Laško Bandidos Tequila;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Bottle 330 ml. Unusual citrus and tequila aroma, seems artificial. Sweetish taste with some tequila. Didn’t like it.
Laško Bandidos Tequila;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Bottle from Beers of Europe. Poured a crystal clear light amber with a thin broken white head. The flavour is moderate bitter, weak citrus sour, weak sweet with a lime lemon sweet palate. Truly awful, but a country nonetheless!

Kantel Bräu;Roma, Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);My girlfriend brought it back for me from Italy. In any case, it pours a golden straw like color with a quickly dissipating white head. Has the pale lager smell, but only in a faint way. Kin of metallic taste with some sweet notes. There is actually a little bit of bitterness in there, but not in any good way. It tastes mostly like an uninteresting pale lager and that is what it is. Drinkable for the most part.

Triumph Roggenbock;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;GABF 2007. This smelled and tasted of straight up caraway seed, like it was concentrated and liquified. It’s not bad, but I’d like some more balance of flavors (like some more characteristic maltiness, although there is some chocolate lurking underneath). Don’t really know what to make of this.
Triumph Roggenbock;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;A very nice tasting beer. It has a aroma and flavor of a rustic black rye bread. Sampled it at the Philadelphia location on 2/21/2008

Hancock Black Lager;Skive, Denmark;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hancock Bryggerierne;"15-11-2018; bottle; at home (bought at an unknown location). The looks of the beer are nice, I give you that. Dark, but not black. The color of the beer is a lovely reddish chestnut, with a lovely glow. The beer is crystal clear. On top of the beer there is a rather thick nice frothy layer of slightly off-white foam. Foam retention is very good. The aroma's of the beer are rather average. Malts are simple and give some beady and slightly toffee aromas. A bit simple and not very strong. Hops give some herbal bitterness. In the mouth the aromas are a bit to thin and watery. Could be stronger. Because it is a bit mild now, it becomes a bit dull. The taste is the same. The malts are sweet, but not very. A bit shallow. Hops are bitter, but not vary. A bit rough and not to balanced. There is also a malty savoury note; a bit grainy. Could be better. The palate of the beer is low average. Medium-light body, a bit thin and sticky texture and medium carbonation. The finish is mainly dry and not to interesting. The dry sensation lingers on for quite some time. Not the most interesting beer. Expected a bit more."

Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;Nice Belgian tripel. Yeasty, fruity and with some mild hopping. Solid brewing.
Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;33cl Brown Bottle, best before 24 Feb 2008, drank a little after then, but cellered correctly. Poured into a Straffe Hendrik Chalice. It looked a lovely golden, clear brew, with a good white head on top. Good carbonisation, almost lively, as the bubbles cascaded upwards. very little aroma, some yeast and hops, but not much of anything. Plenty of flavours to savour, hops, yeast and malts, a proper tripple in all aspects (apart from smell). Impressive, good alcohol presence without it knocking you about, well balanced and pleasant to drink.
Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;23rd February 2008. Slightly fruity malt. Smooth tripel - no rough edges here. Lingering dry malt finish. A lot of sediment in the bottle.
Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;Bottle conditioned, 330ml, aged 4.5yrs. Hazed orange gold with white head, big lumps of yeast carefully negotiated. Fairly basic Belgian type beer, sweet, but with plenty of alcohol, pear, some spice notes. Ending fairly blandly.
Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;Tasted this beer, more times. Bottle, 33 cl. Hazy darkgolden to orange color with off-white head. Aroma bit yeast, malts, some spice, and a hint caramel. Medium body. Taste bit yeast, fruits, spices, some light bitterness. Good but not complex tripel.
Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;1 yr old, 33cl bottle. Slightly cloudy, yellow, straw color with small white head. Aroma is citrus, alc esters that give off an almost syrupy sweet quality. Sweet, grainy, big spice, defintely coriander, lemon, red apple, grapefruit, slight sour, cloying. Medium to light, fizzy body. Overall I think that its really sweet and heavily spiced, moreso then the style typically calls for. Alc. is more subdued for the style as well, which in opinion, is a good thing.
Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;33 cL bottle, 5 year old vintage. Pours hazy orange with a diminished white head. Aroma is mild dry wooden and mild spiced yeasty. Mild caramelish nite and light yeasty. Light malty finish with a mild bitterness coming through.

Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;Bottle at Kulminator. Dated 09/06/04. Dark golden color, a bit hazy, with a white head that left quickly. Aroma is musty or yeasty with light stone fruit. Medium body and very smooth carbonation. Seems to have acquired a touch of oak. Another old b.c. beer that’s aging well. It is dry. Finishes near astringent. A very good experience. Malt? Must have been in there somewhere.
Père Abbé Triple;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie Du Bocq;Bottle. Hazy yellow colour with a huge white creamy head and some lacing. Heavy aroma and taste of fruits and spicy. Semi hoppy finihs. Well balanced.

Kieler Bier;Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Kieler Brauerei am Alten Markt;Copenhagen 9/5 2018. 1 l swing cap bottle from the Brewpub in Kiel. Yellow serious looking label with a hoppy logo and a very short durability period (less than a month). Pours hazy amber with big, bubbly white head. Settles as 2 cm thick creamy layer of foam. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is surprisingly sour with a more subdued sweetness. Milk gone bad, light butter and more light caramel sweetness. Light carbonation. Thin, watery texture. Flavor is rather sweet followed by more subdued bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetish. Quite strange tasting with the dairy products after expiry quality that it has. Will not become a favorite except if I run out of butter.
Kieler Bier;Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Kieler Brauerei am Alten Markt;On tap in the Kieler brewpub.

Kieler Bier;Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Kieler Brauerei am Alten Markt;Wenig Aromen, wenig Geschmack, aber dafür ne ganz ansehnliche Optik und eine vorzügliche Süffigkeit, die in Kiel Legendenstatus genießt. Fass. Oft und in allen möglichen Gebinden...bis hin zum großen Holzgefäß ☺ . Oh ja, da werden Erinnerungen wach...
Kieler Bier;Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Kieler Brauerei am Alten Markt;Had the beer in a bottle filled at the brewery. The beer looks nice. The color of the beer is a nice amber. A lovely orange glow comes from the beer. The beer has a nice cloudiness. However, for an unfiltered beer it is quote clear. Nice little gas bubbles are floating towards the top. On top, a nice layer of slightly tinted soft foam is formed. The foam is very unstable and collapses quickly, leaving only a thin drape of foam. The smell is lovely. It has this nice aromas that are typical to this type of beer and that takes me back to by trip to the baltic states. It has a nice fruitiness in it. I smell some strawberries. There are also some lovely malty aromas. The fruit tones give the beer a lovely sweetness. This is balanced by the malts. Those give the beer a nice bitter and slightly savory smokey aroma. It is in good balance and really invites you to drink. The taste is also very nice. It has a nice hoppy bitterness, that is almost immediately present. After this the smokey, somewhat roasty malt aroma fills the mouth. This gives a nice savory and bitter contrast to the hops. The sweet fruitiness, reminding of strawberry, completes the beer. Its very nice and well balanced. The palate of the beer is nice. The gas bubbles are small and give the beer a nice tingly kick. A very nice beer. The finish is also nice. The tingling sensation remains on the tongue for quite some time. The taste dies away slowly, making you remember the lovely taste for a long time.

Ricklinger Maibock;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;Mich erwartet das typische schlicht gehaltene Streifenetikett auf 0,5er Bügelverschlussflasche. Das Bier gießt sich in einem leuchtenden gelb ins Glas, hat durch die weggelassene Filtrierung eine deutliche Trübung, perlt stark ab und stellt eine langlebige grobporige Blume auf. Nun die Geruchsprobe. Der Hallertauer Hopfen birgt hier eine äußerst kräutrig grasige Note und bereits beim riechen eine deutliche Bitterkeit. Der Antrunk passiert mit einer feinperlig prickelnden Spundung den Mundraum. Sofort tun sich kräutrige und florale Geschmacksnuancen auf. Ich könnte wetten, dass hier auch Tettnanger Doldenhopfen drin ist. Der Körper präsentiert sich mittelwürzig, eher leichtfüßig und dafür auch leichtgängig. Im weiteren Verlauf zeigen sich die 35 Bittereinheiten mit deutlicher Herbe, die ich beim Pils natürlich sehr begrüße. Durch die Unfiltriertheit erreicht das Bier eine sehr weiche und etwas sämige Textur.

Ricklinger Stout;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Stout;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;Gerade einmal 5% schlagen hier zu Buche. Das Bier ist tiefschwarz. Die Schaumkrone ist langlebig und zerklüftet sowie cremefarben eingefärbt. Die Flaschen ist im Bügelverschlussformat mit Tangastreifen als Etikett. Zunächst riecht man erstmal und erwartet Kaffee, verbranntes Toastbrot und Lackritz. Aber man riecht hier widererwartens Pinie und Grapefruit. Hier wurde wohl wieder schön mit Aromahopfen gearbeitet. Im Trunk kommen dann die gewohnten Kaffee und Bitterschokoladearomen. Sehr rauchig, trocken, röstig bis verkohlt, unsüß,ätherisch. Wichtig ist: Keine Asche. Asche schmeckt nicht gut im Stout. Dann hats der Braumeister definitiv übertrieben. Dieses hier ist genau richtig und für 5% herrlich gewürzt. Die Brauerei merke ich mir mal.
Ricklinger Stout;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Stout;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;Ikke så meget at sige. En stout som (jeg synes) en stout skal smage. Den har smag og er rigtig mørk, lakrids, brændthed og stor fylde.

Body is light and dominated by carbonation, yet not lacking the malt backbone. Quite round, but lacking any flavours, just some sweetness and hints of butter. Not bad for a macro lager though.

Feldschlösschen Frühlingsbier;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);Review: Green bottle at 33cl of Feldschlösschen Frühlingsbier: ABV: 4.8% vol A seasonal spring beer. On the nose I get a light aroma, very faint, a bit malty and metallic, not great. For the appearance it is a yellowish looking beer, with no head to speak of, looks pretty shite to be honest. Yellow goes a bit cloudy after a while too. Doesn’t look great. Found the taste to be slightly strange, a bit pointless to be honest. Bit cardboardy and overloaded with sweet malts. Fruits at the back trying to get out, detectable. Shit, bland taste, nothing nice, very boring and unexciting. Taste!!! Bland, cardboard, slight fruit at end. Pointless!!! Malty, very malty But not beery. Disappointing, flat in the taste, faint hops barely noticeable, the beer should be given away for free (it’s a bit pricey) Gave me a head the next morning, shitty beer!

Feldschlösschen Frühlingsbier;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);I have bought this bottle, at the coop, supermarket, in front of the train station. We have tried this bottle yesterday, at home, relax, during the apero. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer, not a great one but it is acceptable, best before 01/19. The body is clear, yellow and slightly troubled, normal carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste is fresh not so rough than an original, a kind of witbier, malty, creamy, a sensation of wheat, fruity, a touch of coriander, orange peel, a sensation of peppermint at the final and discreet, really refreshing, not bad.

Poured a golden colour with a small lasting white head. Fizzy. Extremely so at times. Oh man. Nose... alcohol, dust, cardboard. Proooomising. Not. The taste was almost exactly as I expected. Bad, sweet, riddled with alcohol, some maltiness and dusty hop shows up but not nearly enough to hide the nastiness. Almost offensive. The 1.5 feels a little too high.

Unfortunatly there is no picture of this brew, but the bottle is covered with a huge rhino, and Brutalis is the name of a notorious danish rhino who caused havoc in every zoo he was transfered to. So when you pass the Rhino field in copenhagen zoo, you ofcourse drink a ""Brutalis"" - its extremly nasty though. Spirit with actificial sweet malty notes trying to cover it up."

Avery White Rascal;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Honestly may be partial on the rating as White Rascal was recommended, rather than my usual stumbling upon. The beer offers a wheat body you would expect from a Belgian, however only minimal front pallet spice and citrus, leaving you wanting more/unsatisfied. The best way I could describe it would be an average alcohol content with a generic taste reminiscent of Blue Moon without the orange after your third Blue Moon in a row. In absence of other Belgian options it is sufficient, but not one I would seek out on purpose.
Avery White Rascal;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Can @ Friends/Grumpy brewer. Appearance: pours hazy golden with good white soapy head and lacing. aroma/taste: barley, wheat, bread, coriander, orange peel and fruity notes. palette: medium yeasty and spicy aroma, average carbonation, medium body, medium sweetness, somewhat balanced by a light to medium bitterness, average duration and a watery texture. Overall: refreshing wit
Avery White Rascal;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);You're getting a lot more fruit than just oranges with this beer. It has a very fruity flavor, with hints of banana on the tongue. Very low hops, some malt, and all flavor. This brew is not your typical wheat beer flavor, so if you drink this expecting Blue Moon or Shocktop, you'll be disappointed.
Avery White Rascal;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Pours cloudy pale gold with white lace diminishing. The aroma has spicy coriander notes. Taste has the banana notes of a classic wheat beer. Sweet predominantly with a light bitter finish.

Golden and slightly hazy. Fruity, apple-like nose. Fermented apple juice in the flavor, also. Rather carbonated. Milky and watery at times. Some earthy malt flavors with hints of yeast. Some alcohol notes, though, not that strong. Apple flavors were much too dominant.

Mountain Town Ultra Lite;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Perfect beer if you like making love in a canoo. It’s f’ing near water but it’s true to it’s style. An extremely light ale for massive drinking in a college town.
Mountain Town Ultra Lite;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Extremely fluffy and creamy to compensate for the absolute lack of substance.

Mountain Town Hobo's Brown Ale;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Mountain Town Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from Jimmie's in Alpena. Pours dark like a coke with crazy foam. Took me 5 minutes to pour it and I probably slurped a third of the beer in foam. Foamy head remained until the beer was gone and is probably still floating somewhere down the drain. Nose is malty. Taste follows suit but has a pleasant hop bite. Nice brew. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Mountain Town Hobo's Brown Ale;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Rated on 01-12-2012 (Bottle) This beer has a medium sized smooth tan head with a lengthy retention, hazy brown amber body, fast rising carbonation observed, and spotty amounts of lacing. The aroma is caramel malt, nutty, sweet, and dark fruits. The flavor is sweet, dark fruits, malty, nutty, and a hint of roastiness in the end. The mouthfeel is soft carbonation and this beer is light-medium bodied. This is a session beer and there is not a lot of character with this beer.
Mountain Town Hobo's Brown Ale;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Mountain Town Brewing Company;12oz bottle poured into a mini 12oz looking pint glass thing. Appearance: Awesome. Two finger tan head, nice and clear brown color, with outstanding lacing. Looks great. Smell: Not much there. Some caramel malts with some traces of roastiness with some nuttiness and maybe some coffee. Smells like your typical brown, really. Taste/feel: I am surprised. I’d almost give this a four, but I can’t quite do it -- this is JUST the brown ale you want to have on a hot day like today. Nice and cold, fairly thin but creamy feel, not too much carbonation, and tastes way better than I expected. It’s not bursting with flavor, but it has a nice creaminess. The flavor is primarily nutty caramel with a touch of roastiness. It’s not too bold, but it’s very enjoyable. I’d buy it again.
Mountain Town Hobo's Brown Ale;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Mountain Town Brewing Company;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of foamy fine to medium sized tan colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a typically carbonated transparent light brown colored body.

Not too shabby.
Mountain Town Hobo's Brown Ale;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Thanks to my Michigan pusher, Steve! Nice chestnut brown pour.

Mountain Town Iron Horse IPA;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;IPA;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Rated on 01-08-2012. This bottled IPA pours a very small creamy, smooth head that is fully lasting, gold transparent body, very fizzy, fast rising carbonation, and spotty amounts of lacing. The aroma is caramel malt, citrus, and orange pine hops. The flavor is grapefruit and orange pine hops and has a short dry finish. The mouthfeel is light carbonation and this beer is light-medium bodied. The hops are upfront as they should be for this beer style, but they are not in your face hops. This beer is easy drinking even for us non-hop heads.
Mountain Town Iron Horse IPA;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;IPA;Mountain Town Brewing Company;12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The pour is a clear copper color, maybe a touch lighter. With a two-finger slightly off white head and pretty nice lacing. The aroma is incredibly full of piney resin. There is a nice hoppiness and strong citrusy presence. Nothing too fantastic. The flavor is similar. There is a solid hoppiness coupled to a light bitterness before the resin flavor takes over. The mouth feel is decent, there is a medium creamy carbonation, and the aftertaste is bitter and dry, with a touch of resin. Not the best IPA out there. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Mountain Town Railyard Raspberry Wheat;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mountain Town Brewing Company;It’s okay. Not as light and refreshing as I expect from these. Raspberry flavor is kind of week and only in the finish.
Mountain Town Railyard Raspberry Wheat;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Best beer at mountain town. A little weak on the raspberry but a great taste for anyone who likes wheat.

Mountain Town Railyard Raspberry Wheat;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mountain Town Brewing Company;050 13 526 ... I want to assume that means this was bottled the 50th day of 2013. Poured about three months later into a shaker pint on May 17th. Appearance: The label is much like Mt. Pleasant’s other brews -- a train, with a colored background. This one is purple/pink, making it somewhat eye catching. The beer pours with a two finger head that doesn’t last two long. The color is a super hazy purple and brownish hue. Not much lacing. Smell: Heavy raspberry with a dribble of beer ... definitely heavy on the raspberry, and not much else. The wheat and some malt is also traceable. Taste: Well, I expect anybody that dislikes fruit beers to hate this one, as it’s definitely raspberry forward. It’s super easy drinking and has a significant raspberry profile, but I don’t find that it’s too much. I was a bit iffy on the first sip, but I got into it. There’s a tart character on the taste buds as well, which makes this super thirst quenching on a hot day. The after taste has a bit of wheat flavor to let you know that this is a beer. The feel is like a mildly carbonated pop, and is easy to slam if you’re super thirsty. Look, it is what it is ... it’s a fruit beer, and it doesn’t try to be anything else. A LOT of raspberry, minimal bitterness, a solid sweetness and tartness... this beer would be absolutely fantastic for somebody that isn’t a fan of beer and/or craft beer. This isn’t a great beer, but it’s solid enough for the style. By the end of a bottle it becomes a bit much with the amount of sourness and sweetness, but that’s just enough for me... I couldn’t have much more. Another good beer from Mt. Pleasant.
Mountain Town Railyard Raspberry Wheat;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Golden color brew with a white head. Not a very good aroma, makes me think of a smell you would find in a hospital. A mild raspberry flavor that somehow makes the beer taste awful. Leaves a bad aftertaste.

Mountain Town Railyard Raspberry Wheat;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mountain Town Brewing Company;12oz bottle, pours a murky amber with an insane amount of bright white head. Took several minutes for this to settle to a point I could even think about beginning to drink it. Once settled though, not a bad looking beer. Not much in the way of aroma, want to say I pick up some berry, but it is faint. Wheaty taste with raspberry flavoring, reminds me of a friends home-brew. As far as raspberry beers go, it doesn’t stack up to Rubaeus, but certainly you could do worse on a hot day.
Mountain Town Gambler's Golden Ale;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Got this bottle from a cheese place in frankenmuth. Smells like good ol' lager beer, good ol' fresh lager beer, quite nice. Taste tho, you immediately know this is an ale, has a couple negative ale attributes from the first taste. Mellows out in the middle, starts to settle down to a decent golden, but perhaps not, blonde ale. Simple and easy, it hides its alky content well. Not bad for what it is, but it lacks the civility of a basic blondie.

Pours a murky pale orange with a pretty large fizzy head. Aromas are pleasant enough: dough, yeast, a little citrus and a little bit of cloves. Flavor is very weak.

Mountain Town Steam Engine Stout;Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Mountain Town Brewing Company;Draft at Mountain Town Station. Pours black. Small off white head. Mild chocolate aroma. Flavors of roast, chocolate. This is good, but I have to laugh when I read the description. I would consider this a mild light bodied thin stout. Flavor is good and its very drinkable. Definitely not rich and hardy as described. Not something you’d seek out specially, but solid and easy drinkable.

Loose ropes of lace. Moderate bitter taste, light sweet. A lot less sweet than expected for a ""sweet stout"". Good bigger coffee in the finish. Medium body. Kind of slick texture.

River City IPA;Wichita, Kansas, United States;IPA;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);"2004 Recipe: A bit of a letdown. The hops have changed to a blend of Cascade and Centennial, with EKG for dry-hopping. The aroma is a nice blast of grapefruity resin, and the bitter finish is solid, but that's only because the malt is essentially absent. Pale gold, very dry, as close to a ""no malt, hop-juice"" beer as there is. Lightly hazy red-amber color. Med strength aroma with notes of citrus (grapefruit) and resin. Notable citric/piney hop flavor, with medium caramel malt backbone. Nice balance, and pretty close to the way I like my IPAs. Fairly smooth, tingly mouthfeel. Bitter, almost puckering finish."

Banana cream, vanilla, clove and peppery nose. The light body is fizzy with carbonation. The wheat malts help add some creaminess, but just aren’t substantial enough.

New Albanian Haggisdaddy Stout;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout;New Albanian Brewing Company;On tap at the original Rick O’s location. The beer was right on style, and fine, but pretty base line and forgettable on the whole. That being said, I would probably order it again if I am in the mood for a simple, middle of the road stout, but I feel like they (NABC) offer many more preferable beers, both their own and those offered on the incredible Rich O’s bottle list.
New Albanian Haggisdaddy Stout;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout;New Albanian Brewing Company;(draft) First time drinking the non-bourbonized version of this stout. I got an almost overpowering sense of chocolate - both in the aroma and the flavor. Pretty good, but would probably be too much for me to wrap an evening around. I was pleased to detect no coffee or licorice at all.
New Albanian Haggisdaddy Stout;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft: Per Michael, the brewer, intended to be used in their Bourbondaddy Stout (aged in Woodford Reserve barrels), but sometimes released on its own.

Big Aloha Hefe-Weizen;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Aloha Beer Company;I generally like German Hefe-Weizen style beers. This is a German Hefe-Weizen beer, and I like it. I had it at Sam Choy's Seafood Restaurant in Hawai'i of course. It was served me cutely with a lemon in it, which I left there. This added to its pleasant tartness, its citrussy taste. It has a nice lightly cloudy golden tinge to it and is a quite pleasant brew. It was probably my favourite from the Big Aloha Brewery, but of course this could be due somewhat to it being a Hefe-Weizen, currently my favourite style of beer.

Aloha Kiawe Honey Porter;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Porter;Aloha Beer Company;All Sam Choy’s beer tastes the same. It is just beer. Nothing exciting nor flavorful at all. Then none of the local Hawaiian brew has been. It is true: Homebrewing good brew does, in fact, turn one into a beer snob.
Aloha Kiawe Honey Porter;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Porter;Aloha Beer Company;This beer was the highlight of my sampling at Big Aloha. A perfectly crafted, and somewhat unique, island brew. Deep brown with sasparilla underpinning and a respectable head. The nose easily fills with a sweet roastiness, true to its honey porter name. As the bartender tells me, island honey (acacia?) is used for this brew. It certainly adds a distinct and pleasurable complexity the well put togther porter base. The sweetness complements the heavier roast notes that are richly nuanced with chocolate, coffee, and maltiness. MIlk chocolate finish. A medium-bodied, flavorful and quaffable brew.

The looks are truly that of a Pale Lager. Golden yellow, crystal clear, frothy white head. Nothing really special. The beer just looks rather simple. The aromas of the beer are very simple. Some grainy malts, hardly any hop and a soapy aroma. The aroma is thing, light, nothing really is there. Just water with a little touch. The taste is almost not existing. Hint of malt sweetness and hop bitterness. But, to thin, watery and cheap. The palate is also not great. Thin body, watery texture, very high carbonation. The finish is dry but has no real flavour.

Great Northern Freds Black Lager;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Northern Brewing Company;Bottle… Pitch black lager with a small, creamy, off-white head. Decent retention. The nose is a touch nutty and, unfortunately, gives off a warm perspiration-like note. Full-bodied and lightly creamy with medium carbonation. The roasty, carbonous, medium bitter flavor also hints at a vinous, tawny port-like component. Nutty, roasty, moderately bitter finish. Kudos to Skyview for sending this beer my way!

Pizza Port Swami's India Pale Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;IPA;Pizza Port (Bressi Ranch);A Pizza Port IPA at Trader Joe's!!!. That being said, this isn't their best one. Thin while wildy over bitter. Bitterness would be fine at a 10% abv, but it's all that's there with this malt. Would like more hop flavor too. It's a truck of bitter. You can only go so many IBUs on this malt and dry hop/hop flavor. Pizza Port is still easily one of my favorite brewers so I'm conflicted and confused on not loving this. More hop flavor PLEASE!!!

Big Horn Belgian Strong Gold;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Mostly clear, green-gold, very thin head. Light Belgian aroma, dubbel-esque, contrary to the appearance, and a little smoked/tawny smelling. Tart, clear gel Belgian flavor, astringent bittering (what little of it there is.) Unripe sloes, stonefruit flavors. Medium body, flabby, sour finish.
Big Horn Belgian Strong Gold;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Had this at the Wheeling restaurant. I suppose Ernest is right in saying that this is an oversimplified version of a Belgian Strong, but it’s still decent nonetheless. Basically, it’s a generic version, but it’s drinkable.
Big Horn Belgian Strong Gold;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Draught. Body is light yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), with notes of banana and clove. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Alcohol seems to be well-hidden, but this is an over-simplified representation of Belgian golden ales. I'm glad more and more microbrewers and brewpubs in America are attempting to replicate Belgian beer in general, though.
