Morgan Street St. Louis Dark Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;Sampled at the St. Louis Heritage Festival. Of the three Dark Lagers I jotted notes for, this got the Gold. Filtered amber hue. Soapy white head. Touch smokey and grassy nose. Mild bready nose. Moderate and easy. Caramel bready with a touch of dried fruit. Slightly more complex than the previous two.
Morgan Street St. Louis Dark Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;(tap at the brewfest) Medium brown. Mild malt aroma. Caramel malt flavor, but a bit of mustiness in the finish. Not one of the better efforts at the brewfest.
O'Fallon St. Louis Dark Lager;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;O'Fallon Brewery;Sampled at St. Louis Microfest. Well, this sucked. From the previous reviews it didnâ€™t look like it was much better fresh at the brewfest last month. Poured amber with a dense beige head. The aroma had roasted malt and its fair share of diacetyl. Think body with semi-soft carbonation. The taste is the same as the aroma. Best they just dump the rest and forget they ever made it.
O'Fallon St. Louis Dark Lager;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;O'Fallon Brewery;Tasted at St. Louis BrewFest, May 12, 2007. I did not enjoy any of the St. Louis Lagers at this brewfest, and this one was no different. Un-interesting aroma, appearance, and flavor makes this lager below average.

Schlafly St. Louis Dark Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at the Heritage Brewers Festival. The best of all the fest special brews. Each brewer was supposed to make a dark lager just for the fest. Rich creamy dark malt sweetness without too much hops or the burnt malt flavor one frrequently gets when approaching this style. Smooth, clean and even perhaps a little too thin, but delicious none-the-less.
Schlafly St. Louis Dark Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Poured dark gold with an off-white head. The aroma was mainly toasted malt ~ faint aroma. The body was on the lighter side with a TON of carbonation. The taste started with toasted malt that was quite grainy and finished spicy and sour. An okay beer.

Hazy amber with off white head. A little citrus hops in the taste. Too damn cold....A little rye and grain comes through once it warms. Mild and drinkable, but not worth trying.

Bright yellow in appearance. Not as fruity as most Belgian goldens Iâ€™ve had. Finished dry and refreshing. Definitely too easy to drink given itâ€™s alcohol percentage! Iâ€™m fairly new to the Belgian Strong ale community, but I really liked this one.
Flyers Flyer Tuck Strong Pale;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Brouwerâ€™s Belgian Fest. Weird beer. Very effervescent, but in a light, almost cereal-grain sort of way. Not real good. Not exactly sure what to call this thing.

Avery Anniversary Fourteen;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);This is a backlog rating from 2008 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are fruity, yeast, caramel, resin, chocolate, all over the place.
Avery Anniversary Fourteen;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bomber, from Ratman197's cellar. Pours an unclear, brown color, with a medium, bubbly, tan head. The aroma is brown sugar, pine, figs, orange peel, earth, and a touch of soy sauce. Sweet and malty, with a surprisingly pleasant, dank bitterness. Heavy body, with an aggressive, syrupy palate. Probably past it's prime age, at only 12 years young! Quite tasty.
Avery Anniversary Fourteen;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"From Aug 2007 Purchased at Wilbur's in FT Collins for US$5.99 Pours from 22oz bottle(bottled in 2007) a nearly pitch black with reddish hues and a large head of foam that lingers for a while shrinking to an almost solid layer by the end of the session and it has plenty of lacing. The smell has roasted malt, fruit, and a touch of alcohol in it. The taste is very fruity to start. Lots of dark fruit like fig and plum hit my palate first then I get some caramel and roasted malt. After a few more sips, the hop bitterness moves in and though it doesn't dominate, it has enough of a presence to make me ask...why? When I get a Belgian Style Ale or indeed, a Belgian Ale, I'm not looking for nor expecting a strong Hop presence unless, say, I get a bottle of De Ranke XXX, or one of similar ilk, which I do love. Anywho, I'm just saying... After emptying more of my glass, I'm starting to notice the abv a bit but it's not obtrusive. All in all, it's a pretty tasty brew; it's just not what I expected for an example of the style and because of that, I'm a bit disappointed. For a more representative example of the style, I'd need to go elswhere and that's the bottom line for me."
Avery Anniversary Fourteen;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle from my cellar. The pour is dark, almost opaque deep brown with garnet highlights. Medium sized tan head. The aroma has molasses and raisins and a touch of alcohol.

Santa Cruz Mountain Wilder Wheat;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Cruz Mountain Brewing;Slightly cloudy yellow gold on tap. Aroma is light bubble gum clove and citrus. Flavor is light to a fault as is the body. Not getting off flavors previously mentioned, though. That was the IPA :)
Santa Cruz Mountain Wilder Wheat;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Cruz Mountain Brewing;July 25th, 2014 - I sat down with a friend here at Santa Cruz Mountain’s Brewery to try a long line of tasters, starting with the lightest of the team, the Wilder Wheat. It’s very thick and soupy, and on the darker side, perfectly aligned in color with what I would expect from milled wheat. But the nose is absolutely redolent with buttery popcorn and pears. I know that’s a no-no, but I typically like that flavor. Even so, this is a lot of butter, and it just drowns out anything else I can smell. The flavor is also disappointing, starting with a promising tang, but the flavor and mouthfeel collapse shortly afterwards, leaving me with a winding, long and unpleasant aftertaste.

Santa Cruz Mountain Wilder Wheat;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Cruz Mountain Brewing;Bottle: &nbsp Pale straw, very cloudy, moderate to large sudsy white head, spotty lacing. &nbsp Wheat malt nose, slight sourness. &nbsp Very minor earthen funk. &nbsp Spritzy pale wheat malt flavor, slight soil and lemongrass. &nbsp Better than I expected, but its rather fizzy versus wheaty/thick. &nbsp Finishes with a bit more of that organic profile that one would expect. &nbsp Still, remains better than I thought it was going to be. &nbsp Simply, a little fizzy, not really wheaty enough, but had some minor sweetness and lemongrass notes that helped it along.

Feral Hogwash;Baskerville, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Now called Hogwash this is the latest offering from Feral and at 11.9% it is almost three standard drinks in one glass. Deep dense strawberry coloured body with an off pink head and rings of lacing. Not big on aroma. The wine that has been added to this brew helps thin out the full body somewhat making it fairly easy to drink, a little like a strong red cordial, just beware of the alcohol content.

Flavor is sweet with toffee and caramel, some mild bread, yeast, a little date. Finishes sweet. Not a bad Tmavy.
Hurricane Amarillo Wheat;Mobile, Alabama, United States;Wheat Ale;Hurricane Brewing Company;Had this beer at the brewery in Mobile...notihing spectacular here but definitely a pleasant surprise. Would have again.
Hurricane Amarillo Wheat;Mobile, Alabama, United States;Wheat Ale;Hurricane Brewing Company;"Draught. Pours hazy yellow with a spare frothy white head, completely diminishing, spare lacing. Aroma is light malt (hay, straw, meal), light hops (grass, citrus), light yeast (dough, soap) with notes of coriander. Light bodied, thin texture, lively carbonation and a chalky finish. Average duration, light sweetness and bitterness, moderate acidity; heavy soap flavor."
Caulier Bon Secours Blanche;Péruwelz, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Caulier;"Very pale gold, nowhere murky, unless the bottle is shaken; gushing-exploding to a huge, very equal white head. Bit oily, with virtually no wheatbeer characteristics. No coriander, no orangepeel, even no wheat. Strange. Sweet, again no ""wit"" notes, exept the very perfumey character - but it is like a light top-fermenting barley brew, not a wheat. Medium bodied, quite slick, nearly viscous. Poor witbier, even without coriandersurplus. I’m sure it will be bettered for the next batch (first try)."

Half Moon Cole Porter;Kokomo, Indiana, United States;Porter;Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub The bigger beers were more interesting despite there only being two on tap. A robust porter has plenty of flavor to keep you interested. At the same time it doesn’t abrade the palate and tire you after a pint. Aroma / Appearance - A fluid brownish base is black around the edges. An ebony head idly sits on top like cake icing. Coffee, licorice, and chocolate are a bittersweet foundation for a nose that also harbors black licorice. Flavor / Palate - Velvet creamy malts soothe the palate. Raspberry, vanilla, chocolate, and coffee stir the senses into action. A sweeping fruity taste carries into a pleasant finish. This is one of the best porters that I’ve tried in a while and totally unexpected after previous samples.

Half Moon Old Ben Brown;Kokomo, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery;This draft brew from the brew pub poured a head of foamy finely sized tan colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a transparent uncarbonated red brown colored body. The mild aroma was brown malt. The semi-flat mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The thin flavor contained notes of brown malt. Not one that I would likely buy again.
Half Moon Old Ben Brown;Kokomo, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at the brewery and rated on 5/5/07. Tan small head that was mostly lasting, sparse amount of lacing, transparent, red hue, and no visible carbonation. Nose was slightly roasty, malty and a hint of caramel. Ditto for the flavor and lightly hoppy. Smooth mouthfeel and light boy. Lacks aroma, easy drinking, session brew and would probably drink this one again as it was one of the better brews available.
Half Moon Pre-Prohibition Pilsner;Kokomo, Indiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery;Out of the sampler at the brewpub. Pale yellow color with a thin white head.

Smells of wheat and a hint of lemon. Tastes like it smells, but blander and without the lemon, with a touch of grain. Solid on the palate. An easy drinker, but unmemorable."
Half Moon Wildcat Wheat;Kokomo, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub A fairly run of the mill wheat ale is not bad but not great. Falling somewhere along the middle of the spectrum it is a drinkable session beer worth a four ounce sample at least. Aroma / Appearance - A semitransparent golden base is contrasted by a stark white head. Malt and wheat stir up a mixture of old lemons and fruit sorbet. Flavor / Palate - Lemon butter spread over toasted whole wheat slices is flavorful but simple. A light tang is present in the finish to add honey drizzled over a slice of lemon. It is not the most complex of beers. Despite having had worse I would probably skip it if I ever revisited Kokomo.

Half Moon Stoplight City Red;Kokomo, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub At last I made my way through the seemingly endless flight of wheat beers and moved on to the rest. This is a solid amber ale that is more interesting than most of the other lighter taps. One or two of these over dinner would be a good start before ticking the heavier drafts. Aroma / Appearance - The caramel colored body is mostly opaque except for a few stray bands of light. Candy corn, caramel, and molasses are a fall festival in a sample sized glass. For a 6% ABV beer the malt feels heavy. Flavor / Palate - Creamy from the first sip the texture of the mouthfeel binds together the parts. Caramel, chocolate, and a dash of red licorice are a blend of Twix, Nutella, and Twizzlers in liquid form. The sweet malty finish brightens the palate. Overall this is well rounded and worth a tick.
Half Moon Stoplight City Red;Kokomo, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery;Tap at brewery. Light caramel malt aroma... almost nothing. Coppery amber with a small off-white head, moderate lacing. Light toast, caramel, and light herbal bitter flavor. Medium body, soft carbonation.

Aroma, bitter dark fruits, fresh hops yeasty and caramel malts. Flavors, light palate, some roasted malts and a tad of sweetness. As it warms up, the beer’s ESB bitter aspects are more forward, adding to the mix grassy hops. Overall it’s decent ESB, wish the nose had some extra complexity.

Tampa Bay ESB;Tampa, Florida, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. Pours clear deep gold with a copper core, off white head and decent lacing. The aroma is malty sweet and roasty but leaning toward the sweet side. Overall the nose is too meek. The taste is mild with some pale to highly roasted malts along with a stream of mild hops that border on tasting pine like. To go along with the pine-ish hop note is a spice hoppiness that tries to carry the flavor experience to the finish. Decent ESB
Boulder Beer Cold Hop;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;Aroma is floral hops and English malts. The flavor is fruit, malts, a clean bite in the middle and a lingering mildly hoppy finish.
Boulder Beer Cold Hop;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;"I enjoyed this ""IPA"" slightly more than their Mojo Risin IPA. This seemed more like a hoppy Pale Ale versus IPA, but had a the floral notes in the aroma and taste like many IPAs. Advertised on the bottle as ""English-style Ale"", so I'm not sure exactly what it is. Maybe somthing similar to Lagunitas 2009 Correction Ale. Is it a Pale Ale or IPA....that is the question???? Still another solid brew from Boulder Beer. Nothing by them really blowing me away yet, but they are reasonably priced for the quality they deliver."
Boulder Beer Cold Hop;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;"From Sep 2007 This pours from 22oz bottle(bottled July 1 as per small stamp near base of the bottle) a clear gold with a healthy head of foam that shrinks fairly quickly....some spotting in the middle and some lacing hugging the side of my glass. The smell has some hoppy and sweet notes along with some bread and some fruit. Nice nose. The taste on first sip and I get some good caramel malt and bread followed by some grain and a mild hop character. Tasty. After a few more sips, there's more hoppiness in the flavour but it's balanced nicely by the malt and it really works well for me. I don't have to have a hop bomb in every IPA that I drink!! ;^) The mouthfeel is medium, the carbo is medium, and it finishes slightly sweet. Good stuff and it's going to be no problem at all finishing the bomber. I recommend it!"
Boulder Beer Cold Hop;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;Poured into an English pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt orange to amber color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Sly sticky lace. The aroma had some semi-sweet bready to biscuity malts with a mild soapiness. Grassy and earthy hop bitterness. The flavor stays true to the aroma, semi-sweet with a subtle bitterness. Mild flowing hops to malts aftertaste with the same sort of finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a good sessionable sort of feel. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, this was definitely an English pale ale throughout and I could see myself coming back to if I could get it again.

Liberty Myrtle Beach Lincoln Street Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;Draught in Columbia. Pours a light gold, not really cloudy.

Auburn Alehouse Old Town Brown;Auburn, California, United States;Brown Ale;Auburn Alehouse (CA);On tap at the brewery. Medium brown color and very translucent. Aroma is pretty typical brown ale - some sweet malts and nuttiness. Flavor is a little more complex than the aroma lets on with some nice light roasted malt flavors as well as some coffee notes. Palate is extremely light. Overall a decent brown that would be infinitely better with a little more body - just too watery for my taste.
Auburn Alehouse Old Town Brown;Auburn, California, United States;Brown Ale;Auburn Alehouse (CA);Soft nutty notes on the nose. A hint of roast and chocoalte. Brown/amber pour, soft head. Toasted nut flavor, hints of roast, light sweetness, chocolate. Earthy bitterness rounds out the finish.
Auburn Alehouse Gold Digger IPA;Auburn, California, United States;IPA;Auburn Alehouse (CA);Draft. Version I'm driving king is at 6.3% and 65 IBU. Clear lager yellow. Nice lace. Aroma is of citrus juice. Flavors are if freshly squeezed lemon and lime, and burst forward. Malts are water cracker, and wafer thin. Hint of cocoa too. Wow.
Auburn Alehouse Gold Digger IPA;Auburn, California, United States;IPA;Auburn Alehouse (CA);Sample at GABF 10/08/2016, thanks to my sis for assistance with note-taking. The beer is a clear dark golden color with a medium thick off-white head that diminishes steadily. Partial rings of lace. Citrus, hops and malt aroma. Medium body with flavors of piney hops, citrus and malt. The finish is moderately bitter with a citrusy hop aftertaste. Pretty good overall.
Auburn Alehouse Gold Digger IPA;Auburn, California, United States;IPA;Auburn Alehouse (CA);50cl bottle pours with a crystal clear pure gold body that supports a dirty white head of foam. The aroma offers up clementine, tangerines, some mango, a slice of pineapple and then a bit of spicy sort of earthy hops toward the end of the draw. The taste delivers a nice bite of citrus hop bitterness backed up by a modest degree of mango, tangerine and tangelo juiciness. To midway the citrus hop bitterness ramps up and is then joined by spicy onion dank hop bitterness and some earthy hops. This stays tropical and citrus from front to back with plenty of tasty hop bitterness rimmed thinly by juicier fruity hop notes. Pretty nice IPA.
Auburn Alehouse Gold Digger IPA;Auburn, California, United States;IPA;Auburn Alehouse (CA);Pint at Pi Bar, good aroma, sweet, citrus. Orange and grapefruit. Grassy.

Auburn Alehouse Gold Digger IPA;Auburn, California, United States;IPA;Auburn Alehouse (CA);Bomber from Hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. Clear honey gold with a big almost white head. A citrus aroma with pine (and I can never smell or taste pine!). Citrus beginning and that includes grapefruit. Cat pee. Cinnamon. Fairly big bitterness and it is making the top of my throat become numb. Some tropical fruit comes in mid glass. Simcoe is not a favored hop for me and this one definitely features it.

Nose is tropical fruit, citrus, pine, and peach. Medium plus body. Smooth in the mouth. Flavor is very rich with the fruit dominating, some grapefruit, pine, and some cinnamon spice.

Auburn Alehouse Gold Digger IPA;Auburn, California, United States;IPA;Auburn Alehouse (CA);A very nice West Coast IPA with a huge - almost gratuitous - hoppy taste to it. Very piney and resiny, with just a hint of sweet caramel in the aftertaste. A good pick for any hops fanatics.

Lodi Harvest Ale;Lodi, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lodi Beer Company;Smells like a diacetyl laden gruitt beer. Cloying spices with very faint cheesy hop notes. Even worse on the palate.
Lodi Harvest Ale;Lodi, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lodi Beer Company;Faded garnet color with an ivory head. Siide-by-side this beer looks identical to the amber. Caramel malt aroma with some hop notes. Very thin mouth feel. Dry with some bready notes.

Third Street Aleworks Kalamity Kolsch;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Third Street Aleworks;I had this beer on tap at Third Street Aleworks. This light bodied golden pour had a slightly sweet taste. It would be a good thirst quencher.
Third Street Aleworks Kalamity Kolsch;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Third Street Aleworks;Sample at brewpub. Light yellow with white head. Grain and corn, bit of cereal and bread. Mild sweetness with a nice carbonation, odd sweet/tang at the end though.

Third Street Aleworks Kalamity Kolsch;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Third Street Aleworks;"Draft. ""Yellow Card Kölschbier"" was so renamed for World Cup fever. Gold with head that disappears entirely. Vomit and tarragon aroma. Flavor at least adds some malty goodness. This example is an unfortunate contrast with the same beer a week or two ago - it was so good, I got a growler! I miss that delicate, nobley beer. I was even thinking about ordering a keg, it was that good. Re-rate, 9-2-2010: A totally different beer! This one is clear pale amber with a scraggly white head. The nose is of dark berries, warm malts, and uncut awesomeness. Flavor is gentle, fruity, grainy, and reflects the berry notes from the nose. Finish is a tiny bit chalky but otherwise crisp and pleasant."
Third Street Aleworks Kalamity Kolsch;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Third Street Aleworks;"The one I tasted was called ""Yellow Card Kolschbier"" so this may not be exactly the same thing.

Rafters India Pale Ale;San Rafael, California, United States;IPA;Rafters Grille & Brewery;Tasted on tap at the 10th Annual Bistro IPA Festival. This IPA pours a light orange gold color.

Watch City Pocket Full of Rye Hefeweizen;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Watch City Brewing Co.;Draught pint at the brewpub on 8/13/07 A an orange-copper-tinted hefe-weisse with the rye obviously adding the deeper color. Head immediately fizzles to a ring, clarity is medium-high, no lacing. Strong spiciness in the nose has a fresh floral hop scent as well that creates a very crisply aromatic one-two punch. Definite toasted notes give a bit of an earthy feel to it, while the wheat and rye round out the finish, dulling things somewhat but also deepening the complexity. Light brown sugar and honey sweetness, with a vanilla flare and a bit of caramel. Medium strength of aroma, flawless, no alcohol noted. Great balance of sweetness, with just enough honey, sweet nuttiness and caramel to give it ample body but yet retain its drinkability. Clove and spicy rye are light, but notable on the finish, while an interesting malt complexity is formed from the chewy wheat, crackery malt huskiness and softer vanilla-caramel sugars. Low carbonation, could probably stand to be a bit tighter, but it is draught, so that’s understandable. Light citrus hints dot the finish and the yeast has not pumped out an overwhelming amount of phenols.
Watch City Pocket Full of Rye Hefeweizen;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Watch City Brewing Co.;Aroma is resplendent with rye spiciness. The flavor is a tiny bit flat by comparison. Kudos to the brewer for trying this, rather innovative, combo. It’s well accomplished.
Watch City Pocket Full of Rye Hefeweizen;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Watch City Brewing Co.;~8oz glass @ brewpub. Color is muted gold and clear. Aroma is strong on the estery/banana/bubblegum. Some breadiness as it warms up. Taste leans toward a more lemon-y hefe with a light grainy flavor (which I attribute to the rye). A bit watered down and a bit too light-lager like. A nice thirst quencher and returnable just for that. Leaves a corny/banana aftertaste. A great idea but maybe batch two will come out with a bit more substance.
Mordue Tappy Lappy;North Shields, Tyne & Wear, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mordue Brewery;Out of a barrel in a rain-lashed marquee, Whitefriars, Coventry. Orange amber with white suds. Gently citrussy hop crispness with lingeringly biscuity malt. Octo fountained most of it over the floor, but that was in no way intended as a reflection of the beer’s quality.
Mordue Tappy Lappy;North Shields, Tyne & Wear, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mordue Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Three Tuns, Alcester, Warks. Gold with white head.

Marston's Evening Glow;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Cask at Charlie’s Bar, Copenhagen. A deep red beer with a thin off-white head. The aroma is sweet with quite a lot of diacethyl combined with light notes of berries. The flavor is swet with notes of berries - especially cowberries and raspberries combined with a diacethyl fruityness - especially with notes of peaches, but also with notes of toffee, and hops that kick in late with a light bitterness.

Marston's Evening Glow;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Cask conditioned at The Hollybush, Alcester Warks. Red amber with white head. Dark and flavourful bitter, quite old fashioned these days but certainly easily drinkable. Deeper roasted crystal malts but also a sweeter light roasted note in there too. A fairly standard Marstons hop finish, didn’t get the Marstons ’snatch’ in this one. I liked it.
Föroya Bjór Atlantic Summer Breeze;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Föroya Bjór;Very pale yellow coloured ale covered by a minimal white cover. Extremely light, vegetal, green tasting lager with tart bready notes that might come from wheat, but nevertheless don’t really fit there rest. Almost textureless, this could be water with a bit of bubbles. I was quite astonished to see this beer winning the KBV fest’s best summer beer contest.
Föroya Bjór Atlantic Summer Breeze;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Föroya Bjór;Bottled (thanks faroeviking!). Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is quite salty, malty and hoppy. Flavour is quite much the same, with focus on the saltwateryness.

Fyne Ales Noble 100;Cairndow, Argyll, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fyne Ales;Aroma has a touch of sulphury salts, spicey malts, grassy and floural hops. Taste is similar but without the sulphur, though still a bit chalky, peppery hops leave a dry mouth, very sessionable. This was cask #13 in my work.

Turbo King (DRC);Kinshasa, Dem Rep of Congo;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Bralima (Heineken);One of the better tasting Congolese beers. Sweet, dark, heavy. Better if brewed in Kinshasa - the beers coming from the Mbandaka brewery in the north have a heavy chemical taste. Large beers (720 ml). Don’t drink 2 or you will regret it in the morning!

Piedboeuf butterscotch aromatics diluted into an actually quite drinkable Lion bar of a beer. No abv nor real hops apparent, yet mellifluous like caramelised banana syrup without the stickiness. - Who would have suspected that this gruesome ex-colonial would be enjoying a Congolese beer in post-ritzy Slavic Baden-Baden instead of colourful Matonge...
Alexandra Arms Quaffers Ale;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Alexandra Arms Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - Alexandra Arms Rugby. A copper coloured beer with a big white creamy head. The aroma is spoiled a little by the tight sparkler but there is a little hop. The taste has some lemony citrus notes. It is a light beer but easy to drink and I guess the name is representative of its drinkability.

Amazing with so much maltiness and so perfectly mellowed by the aging process and raisininess and chocolate explodatizing the palate. If you missed it, you may actually be better off than those of us who know what it’s like to have loved and lost. (through metabolization/urination)

Atomic Reactor;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Beer Of The Evening (so far), and the most balanced of the Atomic beers I’ve tried. Fibrous, spiky, American-like hopping again (actually Styrian Goldings), but cushioned with biscuit. Earthily citrussy, but leaves you thirsting for another sip.

Capitol City Maibock;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Capitol City Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Bar pour yields a burnt orange/amber color with a slim cap of a level white head. Light lacing did show it’s face. The smell had a light toasted to burnt caramel note. Light orange fruit made a slight stimulant but in a slight off sort of way. The taste was semi-sweet but through a malty sort of weird conglomeration of burnt bitter hops scaling themselves into this weird flavoring. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a light sessionability about it. The carbonation was fine for the style and to me. Overall, for a maibock, I dunno man, honestly, I just didn’t really care for the smell and taste.
Capitol City Maibock;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Capitol City Brewing Company;Aroma was barely detectable. Color is a burnt yellow close to an orange and clear. Very little head. Did not like the flavor. To me it was as if someone threw up candy and banana. Palate was like the after taste that banana leaves behind. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Capitol City Maibock;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Capitol City Brewing Company;Draft. Pours a clear light copper with the slightest of white heads. Minimal lacing. Sweet, grainy aroma. Medium body with a bit of carbonation. Flavor is also sweet with notes of honey and a touch of caramel. Overall out of balance. Too sweet.
Capitol City Maibock;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Capitol City Brewing Company;In the bottle at an SOB tasting thanks to Phil’s Dad. Pours a light amber with a white head. This is surprisingly good for a Capitol product. Not German in the grainy intensity, but a bit sweeter with a smooth palate. Easy to drink.
Capitol City Maibock;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Capitol City Brewing Company;a rite of spring, don’t care for the new labelling, buts its the same great beer.
Capitol City Maibock;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Capitol City Brewing Company;Dark Amber color with White Ring. Light Sweet Malted Aroma. Light to Medium Mouthfeel. Sweet Musty Malt, Bitter Twang...Burnt Caramel Flavors...with a Dry Burnt Caramel Finish. Something Seems Off With This Brew but At Least Has Some Promise to it.
Capitol City Maibock;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Capitol City Brewing Company;Clear light copper color, white head, almost no head at all though. Very sweet straight malt and sugar nose, cheap grains and sugary maple syrup and apple smell. Taste is also sweet, more apple and honey flavor, more grains, I can sort of see some bock qualities but it really tastes no different than their altbier. Too sweet.
Capitol City Maibock;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Capitol City Brewing Company;on tap at uno in madison. Nice white head,light amber body, caramel taste with a decent palate but the finish was unbalanced,some alcohol bitterness. I doubt if I will be having this one again.

Mash Energy Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);(Bottle 33 cl) Pours a clear golden with a white head. Sweet raspberry aroma - this has the aroma of Red Bull! Medium body with extremely sweet fruit notes - raspberries. And again absolutely no bitterness. Obviously an attempt aimed at the RTD segment. 120208
Mash Energy Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle 33c. Golden clear body with normal size head. Berries in the nose. Fizzy beer with lots berries in the flavour. Reminds me a lot of red bull. Beer? Hmmm
Mash Energy Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Tasted 23/11/2007. One of many jubilant beers after cycling ’round the lake. This one was the only ""energy"" beer - the rest were quite nicely restorative. Straw gold, no head, capsicum aroma reminds me of a chilli beer. Sweet, firmly carbonated, a touch of spice and shorter than the proverbial short straw. Cheapest looking bottle and label I’ve ever seen. This must have huge margins. As a beer it is ghastly, if it were a non-alcoholic carbonated beverage it would be ok. Like Bozo, I had a quiet laugh at the nutritional information on the label."
Mash Energy Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle, a slight haze to the gold colour, no head. An aroma of ginger and ground spice. A sweet palate, like a red bull. Not beer as you know it. Oh dear.
Mash Energy Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Oh dear......berocca meets a weak lager shandy. Insipid...!!! Funnily enough, the first beer I’ve seen labelled with nutritional information...
Mash Energy Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Yeah, last one to endure!!! Piss yellow in colour with white head. MMM gurana and food acid330. Looks like beer but is sickly sweet syrip. When will this marketing event stop!!!
Govnors Public House Absolute Rat Bastard;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Old Ale;Govnors Public House;On tap at the Govnors Brew Pub. Poured a dark and deep amberish almost brown color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of orange peels, roasty, and toasty. Tastes of citrus, floral hops, caramel, a little fruity, and biscuity.
Govnors Public House Absolute Rat Bastard;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Old Ale;Govnors Public House;On tap at the brewpub. The body was brown with some orange and the edges. The aroma was fairly sweet with some pears and cinnamon. The taste was lightly bitter with some black tea. There was also a muted sweetness like plums. Decent.
Govnors Public House Absolute Rat Bastard;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Old Ale;Govnors Public House;Pour is dark brownish amber with a thin tan head...smell is faintly sweet with caramel and hop that I can’t put my finger on...taste is lightly sweet at first with some bright caramel flavors...then a medium metallic type bitterness...
Govnors Public House Absolute Rat Bastard;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Old Ale;Govnors Public House;"GTMW 2007. Brewer’s description in the festival program reads ""Hybrid brown ale"". Poured a clear reddish-orange color. Trim, off-white head. Aroma was of toasted bread and grassy hops. Nutty with a bit of biscuity malt and citrusy hops. Clean finish. To be honest, this one probably didn’t really get a fair shake as far as it’s rating goes. It’s tough to stand out when preceded by the likes of Surly barrel aged darkness and Minneapolis Town Hall Czar Jack."
Govnors Public House Absolute Rat Bastard;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Old Ale;Govnors Public House;This poured a deep mahogany body lightly highlighted in red and had a minimalist’s beige head. The aroma was rich and malty but held an odd sourness that when blended together reminded me of the candy corn that I ate as a kid but can no longer stomach. Exhaling through my nostrils as I drank, I found it somewhat tasty, some roasted malts, dark dried fruits, caramel, a hint of smoke. Not a bad drink if you can divorce the aroma from the experience. Govnor’s Public House, Lake In The Hills, IL
Govnors Public House Absolute Rat Bastard;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Old Ale;Govnors Public House;"When I called the brewer to determine this beer’s style, ""Muffy"" or ""Cissy"" (or someone) gave me the runaround of ""Well... it’s a dark beer, a little bitter, but not TOO bitter..."" When I stopped them and said, ""No... I know it’s an ALE, but what TYPE of ale?"", they paused and proceeded to start reading the commercial description above. I thanked them and am listing this as an ""Old Ale""... as is the case with the other Govnor’s brews with ""Absolute"" in their name. If anyone cares to try to get a better answer, feel free. (And suggest better education for the brewpub staff while you’re at it.) Poured a dark, coppered-mahogany with very little head save for a few soapy bubbles of halo. Vinegared aroma dissipates to find an odd underbelly of prune pastry filling and tart cherries. Flavor finds dark fruits and biscuity malts with a light smokiness and a covering of vinegar before an earthen linger. A bit on the thin side with an oiliness to the palate. It reminded me alot of Taylor Brewing’s Dark Satin... a ""Dunkel"" with strong vinegar notes that took a while for me to warm up to.

Church Brew Coconut Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Flavored;Church Brew Works;Didn't like this one as much as other coconut stouts. Maybe the coconut was just not pronounced enough for me and only had a vague milky taste and not in a good milk stout way.
Church Brew Coconut Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Flavored;Church Brew Works;Sampler at Giant Eagle in Pittsburgh, PA A bit on the weak side and could have been heavier bodied, a common problem with Church Brew Works.

Pale malt and floral and wild flower blooms in the aroma. Hints of bananas and dry spice as well. Quite heavy in feel, with a tight zip to keep it from getting too cloying.

Actually drank the whole bottle, which is more than I can say about many of my last few. 1/11
Great Divide Belgica;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;Bottle from Cracked Kettle. Golden body with rocky head. Hoppy and buttery nose. Very easy to drink, with hoppy flavour. Prickly and piney in the finish. Quite enjoyable.
Great Divide Belgica;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;From old notes. Distinctive appearance of clear faded yellow but vibrant with some loose beading and a thick creamy head. Firm and robust with a degree of lean chewy but not at all citric (despite when the label says) but long and lingering. Restrained and persistent with just a trace of sweetness at the end to add to that hybrid style. Leaves layers of lacing rings as drunk. As shame this was discontinued. It got none of the respect it deserved.

Great Divide Belgica;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;"easily the weakest GD offering i’ve had to date. i was thinking/hoping for a titan type ipa with a belgian yeast strain, but it appears the hops are different (and lighter), the belgian yeast isn’t very assertive, and the belgian pilsner malt may be a slight miss. as a beer, it’s still above average, balanced, and refreshing, but given my expectations of GD (and my expectations of this cool style) this ones a miss. Won’t visit again unless i see it on tap, or go to CO."""

Aroma is lightly malty (grain), with a strong note of DMS. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter, slightly unclean.

Greenland Arctic Ale;Narsaq, Greenland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Greenland Brewhouse;A delightful aroma of malt and hops are mixed with a touch of the strong alcohol. The beer is very fruity, slightly hopped and have a good warming taste of alcohol. By type barley wine makes itself not particularly noticed among the otherwise large selection available of similar types. It will certainly find its true nature after being stored for some years. I would certainly like to acquire me a couple of bottles for to long-term storage. The finish is hoppy, warming and prolonged.

Kurokawa Craft Beer Dark Lager;Kumamoto, Japan;Stout;Kumamoto Craft Beer;Bottle from Furusato Nozei. This is the Yu-agari Bijin label. Cocoa powder nose, lightly roasty, slightly creamy. Shiny dark brown to black with a fine, frothy head. Dry, roasty flavor, dark chocolate and coffee, a bit of burnt wood. I agree this is probably an ale and not a lager, although could be a schwarzbier. Body is rather light, crisp. Finish is mostly roasty and dry. Not bad at all, though somewhat forgettable.
Kurokawa Craft Beer Dark Lager;Kumamoto, Japan;Stout;Kumamoto Craft Beer;Pours brownish black with thin greyish head. Aromas are smoky and hard to smell because I have a cold. Very bubbly carbonation, mouthfeel of a somewhat flat soda. Flavors are very smoky, roasty again, but without any trace of bitterness that can sometimes accompany dominant smokiness in a beer. Decent, not too filling, goes down easy.

Piece Brutal IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Chicago Trip. Monday 12:30. Spoke with the brewer. This is brewed with Apollo hops. Not sure if it was also with Centennial and Fuggles or if Apollo is descended from those two. On tap. Golden beer. Wet grain aroma. Light foam. Attractive flowery hop nose with citrus notes as well. Very malty beer. Big bodied. Holds up a lot of hops. I believe this should be listed as an IIPA.
Piece Brutal IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at Piece. This was a dark one.. and could have been a DIPA, but I couldn’t get info. Poured a surprisingly deep brown with a short cap of off-white head. Aroma was of sweet, toasted grapefruit with caramel and perhaps a hint of chocolate.. pine resin accents.. deep, dark, and seductive! The flavor was even more enjoyable with a dark, sweet base of grapefruit, pine resin, and caramel.. hefty doses of pineapple and pine resin bitterness surrounding.. nice use of darker malts in there.. long, bitter pineapple finish.. very tasty! Medium-bodied with the sweet, toasty core supporting the higher bitterness well. Great stuff!
Kurokawa Craft Beer Pale Ale;Kumamoto, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kumamoto Craft Beer;Bottle from Furusato Nozei. Yu-agari Bijin label. Slightly strange nose, stinky durian / very ripe tropical fruit, bit of toffee, ripe stone fruit, metal. Golden orange with a low, lacy head. Sweet, creamy flavor, toffee, creamy, tropical and stone fruit. Very light bitterness, slightly peppery. Touch of diacetyl maybe. Not a lot going on. Nose is a bit out there. Not bad.
Kurokawa Craft Beer Pale Ale;Kumamoto, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kumamoto Craft Beer;Hooray! A halfway decent tasting beer made in Japan! Pours a pale slightly green golden color with a nice natural looking head. Flavor is mainly hops, some nice American IPA style hop. Has a slightly oily taste to it, but nothing too bad. Something of an ok beer, hooray!
Red Rose Junipers Ale;Great Harwood, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Red Rose Brewery;Coming in a 500ml brown bottle, bottlle-conditioned. BBE Aug. 2007, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. Appearance: pouring a very static pint of murky, russet-brown tea, with no beer head what-so-ever and very little carbonation detectable. Aroma: aromas of flowers, sour pears, and a touch of ripe blue berries rest on top of a Mild-like brown-sugary and sweet tea-ish malty backbone. Quite simplistic, and a tad stale as well as damp overall... Flavour: pretty mixed in flavour, featuring light chocolates, licorice, ground herbs, balanced by (yeah...) a touch of berry-ish sourness and longan-fruit tea. A belated flow of mild hop bitterness and a little bitter nuttiness creep up in the end, while the overall dry-ish mouthfeel resembles a Dark Mild. Palate: the structure of this ale is messed up, while the texture remains watery, showing no signs of fizziness at all. I wonder if the bottle-conditioning process, or the bottling process, has gone wrong. Also there’s no telling whether Juniper berries are indeed used in the brew, as this beer’s fruitiness is also like that of some other not-so-fresh ordinary bitter... All in all, an interesting beer this is, but desparately in need of more freshness and body in order to be an enjoyable one...

Quite a lot of hop and pinewood in the nose, but also some nice soft malty tones. It tastes really nice. Well balanced. Bitter finnish as expected from an IPA, but not too much hop. Nice beer
Kvajj Fruentimmer;Vejle, Denmark;IPA;Bryggeriet Kvajj;Dieses IPA steht unfreiwillig schon länger im Keller - ich habe es erst jetzt wiederentdeckt, das MHD liegt 8 Monate zurück. Kann ein IPA da noch hopfig sein? Kann es. Kurz malziger Antrunk, danach bleibt die Malznote kräftig, wirkt aber eher im Hintergrund. Der Hopfen ist süßlich und wirkt kontrastreich zum Malz im Vordergrund. Der Hopfen kann sich nicht mehr steigern, wird aber etwas grasig und zum Ende bitter. Durch die malzige Hintergrund Note wirkt das Ganze nicht mehr allzu frisch, dafür aber eher würzig. Im Abgang wird das Bier noch einmal hopfig und würzig. Angenehm! Test vom 24.9.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 9,10,11,12,12,11 - 10,85

Baird Ganko Oyaji (Stubborn Old Man) Barley Wine;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle, bb 2/23 - guess that means it's a 2018 bottle. 11% ABV. Amber with a fat coat of cream head.3+ Aroma of bread, very ripe grapes, old lemons, light spices. Not all that heavy for its strength. Low carbonation. Bittersweet with bread, spices and quite vibrant marmalade-like citrus. Slips down - a slow drinker rather than a sipper. Subtle notes under its directness.

Baird Ganko Oyaji (Stubborn Old Man) Barley Wine;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Baird Brewing Co.;February 22nd, 2017 - Ganko Oyaji is one of the burlier, if not the burliest, brews available at their Takadanobaba tasting room. With a deep dark color, it looks the part, and the smell is stuffed with dark fruits, brown sugar and a boozy finish. Both the 2016 and 2017 smelled largely the same, save that the 2016 version’s alcohol note is more pronounced and a little more raw. The same is true of the flavors, each featuring the depth of sweetness of apple sauce, some ripe esters (bananas right before it’s banana bread time) and some figs. But there’s plenty of body to go around, holding up the fermented tasting sugars. February 20th, 2015 - One of the best named beers in Japan, the Ganjo Oyaji Barley Wine is a burly boy, swirling in its tulip glass with a deep, redwood haze. The head is a stack of tan pearls, keeping pressure not he nose of this brew, which itself is dense with red grape juice and graham crackers, and edged with alcohol. The taste is also quite sweet, but more forward with marshmallow, and featuring a slight tang to liven up the sticky sweets. As the beer warms those marshmallows take on a darker, roasted marshmallow note, which fits nicely with the progression of the evening.

Alvinne Blond Cuvée Speciale;Moen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Alvinne;"(33cl bottle, 6.5% abv) Hazy, orange golden colour with a huge foamy white head. Dusty and yeasty, sweet malty aroma with notes of ripe lemon. Sourish and slightly bitter-tart flavour, medium bodied with a lively carbonation. Slightly wheaty and almost astringent citrus- and lemon-fruity, yeasty taste which covers everything else; dry and sourish tart finish.

Alvinne Blond Cuvée Speciale;Moen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Alvinne;"As TBone says ""I suppose that this the right one even it doesn’t mention ""Cuvée Speciale"": it is 6.5% and contains: ""water, pilsmout, tarwemout, hop (challenger en ek goldings), korrelgist lesaffre T58""."" Pours out beautifully with a humongous head, especially with the Alvinne glass. A thick golden color with some slightly visible carbonation. Aroma is as usual for Alvinne, yeast gone wild, this is in the form of milky-pineapple with an airy Belgian feel and sweet candy. Taste is nicely different with the pilsner malt coming through and the esters are died down just a tad. Sweet finish but the strong carbonation chases away any negativity from that. My only complaint is that house yeastiness is so prevalent in all there beers that it is becoming a bit boring. Also, since when is a mistake beer become a ""Speciale"" beer, its like trading cards.33cL bottle @ Bierbrasserie Cambrinus, BB 03/2009, in a large Alvinne tulip on 5/19/08."

Zonnegemse Zot;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Tasted this years ago, can’t even remember when, but during cleaning up, I stumbled on old notes hastily scribbled on beer mats and pieces of paper and this was among them.

Pizzeria Uno Blonde Bock;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Hand bottled, thanks to my friend Dickinsonbeer. I typically shrug off lighter lagers like this and this one was resting in the back of the fridge, forgotten about. I cracked it tonight and i’m blown away by both its mouth feel and malt character. Extremely flavorful, fresh, succulent lightly toasty and bready malts. This is an eye opening beer and one heck of a lager. Thanks Paul.

Butte Creek Spring Run Organic Pale Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle: &nbsp Reddish caramel, very hazy, large fluffy off-white head, enjoyable lacing. &nbsp Malt oriented nose, very slight graininess. &nbsp Very little hop presense, if any. &nbsp Hmmm... on first sip I noticed that for an Organic its not as earthy/grainy as I have come to expect. &nbsp Its actually a bit malty, with a soft hop background. &nbsp This one is pretty easy to drink, and certainly a bit better than I expected. &nbsp Well rounded, feels fairly hefty for a Pale Ale. &nbsp Paler than most, er ligher perhaps, not as hop oriented, but I am a stickler about North West Pale Ales. &nbsp Its actually more appealing that its not all that grainy. &nbsp Decent little offering.
Butte Creek Spring Run Organic Pale Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Picked up at the new Hop City in Atlanta, Georgia. 22 oz. Nice caramel/orange in color. Thin head sitting on top. Little hazy, but still nice. Good looking beer. Slight hop aroma, but mianly biscuit and malts. Pungent aroma ,but not my favorite type of aroma. Very sweet beer at first, with a subtle hop aroma that develops into a decent bittering hop flavor. Leaves some decent lacing. The hops don’t play as big of a role as I would like them to. The caramel sweet malt flavor is what stands out the most. Not a huge Butte Creek fan.
Butte Creek Spring Run Organic Pale Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Pours nice copper color with a small off white head. Caramel and biscuit malts are quite prominent in the aroma with a nice balance from the piney hops. The flavor is similar, but the hops stand out nicely from the sweat and toasty malt background. Also picked this one up at Jungle Jim’s for $1.99, what a steal.
Butte Creek Spring Run Organic Pale Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;3/16/2009: Spring Run is an all-around good, solid pale ale. I like it. Its toffee maltiness is paired nicely with a honey sweetness. It is slightly dry and grainy in the middle. The front is balanced by a moderate level of pine and grassy bitterness. I could really just sit around and drink this well-bopped pale ale all day. I definitely need to go back and pick up a bunch more of this for the price (only $1.99+tax/bomber!). 1pt., 6fl. oz. bottle (5.7% alc. by vol) from Jungle Jim’s International Market in Fairfield, Ohio. Rating #14 for this beer.

Butte Creek Spring Run Organic Pale Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bomber. Poured translucent brighter orange with a short cap of white head. The aroma picked up soft bready and caramel notes with vibrant citrusy and grassy accents.. smelled at the back like it may have a boozy bite. The flavor had an almost syrupy caramel base with moderate-to-high grapefruit and piney bitterness surrounding.. not bad, but nothing really popped. Medium-bodied with lower carbonation on the palate.. I didn’t much care for the long bitter finish that didn’t have any real flavor behind it.. aiight overall.

PC Blanche;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;Light gold with plenty of carbonation from bottle. Citrus, grassy and fruit notes in the aroma. Taste is smooth and easy drinking but not complex - like a beginner’s witbier.
PC Blanche;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;Originally rated July 2007. This beer comes in a 12 pack, for one dollar more than their other swill lagers. It pours a cloudy golden-beige colour with a decent creamy-foam head that has pretty good retention, and very nice lacing. The nose is malty with some of that Belgian white yeast. Smooth watery mouthfeel, with very mild stickiness as it goes down. The taste is pretty light, with mostly malt and maybe wheat in the background. Some little citrus in the aftertaste. Above average for a PC brew, but too light tasting to be a good witbier. Good on the wallet though, and just right for the summer.
PC Blanche;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;Poured cloudy straw coloured with a thin white head. Citrus aroma. A nice version of a belgian wheat beer considering they aren’t my favorite. Very drinkable, light citrus and malty flavour. Better than I expected.
Stieckemus Weizendoppelbock;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Bock - Weizenbock;De Proefbrouwerij;On tap at in de Wildeman, Amsterdam. Pours a quite hazy brownish-red with islands of stark white, sticky foam floating and lasting. Aroma is predominantly caramel sweetness, but there also a very high ester profile in clove and banana notes, and a bit of that characteristic wheat funk/sourness. Taste is fairly complex, and quite fragrant at first sip. Great chewy malt presence: caramel, toffee sweetness upfront mingles with a fruity component reminiscent of dark berries and cherries as well. A slight sour note in the finish as well as a very faint alcohol presence. The aftertaste is striking and lasts considerably, a slight sour component sticking to the palate, and a bitter presence at the sides of the tongue. Despite high carbonation this retains a thick, complex mouthfeel. Quite nice, approaches Aventinus but doesn’t quite make it to those heights.
Ommegang Cuvee BXL;Cooperstown, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat);I had a glass at the same-named bar in the Times Square area of NYC. The draft was an opaque orange with a very full head of finely bubbled, light tan foam. It smelled slightly of peaches and coriander. The taste, grain, spice, toast, malt and a bit of yellow fruit. Not grabby but not bad either.

Ommegang Cuvee BXL;Cooperstown, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat);Tap pour at bxl cafe. Mostly opaque amber-orange with solid white head in glass. Lacing all the way down. Orange zest, coriander and pizza dough on nose. Inviting. Taste is sweet fruits, some zip, coriander and a healthy amount of doughy yeast. Errs on the side of sweet, detracting slightly from an otherwise very well executed ale. True to description, highly sessionable. And at the gravity, a bit of a liability. Worth an order, or two.

The pour is a hazed copper golden, with a well formed 1 inch white head. Nice lace coats the glass. The aroma is straw, hay, clove and a light fruit yeast. The taste is the straw, hay, and a bit of fruity lemon lime. The beer is lightly sweet, then moves to yeast notes of the nose, though the clove is softer in the taste than the nose. Touch of banana as the beer warms. The palate is light bodied, thinner, almost approaches being watery. Soft carbonation, and a clean, thin finish. Easy drinking beer.
Ommegang Cuvee BXL;Cooperstown, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat);On tap at BXL East on many occasions. Pours lovely cloudy orange with a medium white fluffy head. Lovely aroma of citrus fruits with notes of spice. Orange/coriander flavors really come through in the aroma. Taste is well balanced with a nice amount of coriander, orange peel and yeast. Really enjoyable beer.
Ommegang Cuvee BXL;Cooperstown, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat);Tap at BXL, served in a saison dupont tumber, $6.Cool little joint at 1am I might add. Simple light amber pour with a small head. Yeast, spice, malt, grassy hops, more spices (not in a bad way, no soap), some dough.. Yep. This beer is pretty straight forward, but the spices aren’t overdone and I could have a couple more pints no problem. A clean, easy drinking beer that holds my attention. I couldn’t ask for much more.
Ommegang Cuvee BXL;Cooperstown, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat);On tap at bxl nyc, obvs. Have drank this beer deep into many evenings at my post-bway theater district hang. Rich, fruity, juicy aroma: wonderful, which unfortunately sets up an expectation that isn't exactly lived up to in the flavor. The nose is so interesting but the taste, especially in the finish, falls flat without enough bitterness. Makes it really drinkable as a session beer but not more. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Smallish dark cream head. Light fruit and lightly toasted malt aromas. Some hints of depth, but a fairly simple smell. Darker fruits, light spice and plenty of malt flavors make this known that there is a backbone to this one.

De Danann Meade;Tampa, Florida, United States;Mead;Aspirations Winery;Courtesy Degarth. Yellow/gold, lightly hazy. Apple pie, old wood, cinnamon, earth, small dose of honey, light colored fruits. Weird at first, but growing on me as it warms. Medium body, still. Very good, surprising.
De Danann Meade;Tampa, Florida, United States;Mead;Aspirations Winery;The aroma is fantastic. It’s sweet like syrup with honey, fruit, and cinnamon. The appearance is golden and still. The flavor is where this one goes wrong. There is a sour taste that ruins the fruit and cinnamon elements. The sweetness from the aroma is hardly present, replaced by a more dry vinous character. The palate is thin. I am not really that impressed with this mead. It smells a lot better than it tastes. I think they used the wrong yeast and it might need more time to mature.
De Danann Meade;Tampa, Florida, United States;Mead;Aspirations Winery;A true paradox in mead, the aroma is heavily, its got a sherry like aroma with some spice. taste however it is like a tart apple cider, that doesn’t work well. it like the mead makers used the wrong yeast when they could’ve made something really special, instead its sub par.
De Danann Meade;Tampa, Florida, United States;Mead;Aspirations Winery;Fuck all ya’ll! Dave, John, Jason...I’m talking to you! Damn it I really liked this. Maybe I’m a mead moron, but I thought this tased really good. Granted it tasted a bit like cider, but I loved it. Anyway, the aroma is woody, vegetal and quite spicy with cinammon standing out. The body is golden, clear, still and headless just as every mead I have ever had looks. The flavor is simple....wood, apple, honey and cinammon. It does in fact taste like some liquid version of mom’s apple pie baked on a wooden pie tin. But I farking loved it. I thought the flavor was very good, if simple. I’d happily drink it again.
De Danann Meade;Tampa, Florida, United States;Mead;Aspirations Winery;Mead courtesy of Degarth, thanks Joe. Pours clear yet tanted with Coors Light yellow-ish hue. Big aroma with odd yeast and alcohol notes that border on freezer burned rotting vegetation. The taste starts sweet then some of the interesting yeast notes and alcohol enter the picture. Taste is pretty nice. The finish creeps up with cinnamon apple pie. Very interesting.
De Danann Meade;Tampa, Florida, United States;Mead;Aspirations Winery;"Big thanks to Degarth for sharing this one. Pours a golden body with of course no head. Nose of spices, honey, wood, apples, cinammon, nutmeg. You would think that would be good, but for some reason it smells ""off"". On the tongue it tastes very cider like, with apples, honey, and the spices coming through. Tastes better than it smells. Very silky on the palate. A good amount of alcohol burn greets you in the finish, which is also slightly sweet and of medium length."
De Danann Meade;Tampa, Florida, United States;Mead;Aspirations Winery;Light, very hazy golden body. In lieu of legs, a solid sheet of sticky honey teeters from the inside of the glass. An interesting conglomeration of bubbles gathers at the bottom of the glass. A slight apple-green tint encapsulates the golden remainder. Honey precedes heavy spices in the nose. Floral tones exude lavender and orange blossom water scents. Apples and doughy crust meld nicely with very moderately concealed alcohol. Perfumed as heavily as it is, musty notes seep through with focused intensity. Interesting, for sure. I wouldn’t delude someone’s explanation of this by calling it complex, but it’s got enough intricacies to be deemed worthy of sampling and sharing. Flavor is unorganized and really has lost much of its vibrancy. Spicing is muddled, cinnamon and orange pith noticeable first. Honey is dulled. Alcohol is far too noticeable for a sweetened mead. Finishes warm and dull, reasonably respectable length. Average at its very best.
Legend Eisbock;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Legend Brewing Company;on tap-pours a thick rich light brown head and deep red/mahogany color.

Interesting but not amazing.

Opaque dark brown body with reddish highlights at the edges, thin buff head. Bourbon dominates the aroma. Sharp bourbon body with alcohol, coffee, dark chocolate, and a bitter, lasting finish.

Morgan Street Mammogram Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;On tap at the Parkville Microbrew Festival. I thin this is one of those beers linked to a fundraiser. Testicular torsion syndrome, I believe (Go Team Venture). Pours black with an off-white head. Has an interestingly smokey roasted aroma. You could swear that there is salmon in there. A solid stout.
Morgan Street Mammogram Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours very dark brown with a clinging tan head. The aroma has brown sugar, molasseses and roasted chocolate malt. Medium / full body that is slick and has lightly sharp carbonation. The taste has much of what was on the aroma along with some honey traits. The finish has lots of charred malt. There is also a bit of a hop kick at the end. As the beer warms a coffee presence becomes apparent. A respectable stout.
Morgan Street Mammogram Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;This beer was created by a patron of the Morgan Street Brewery who is a survivor of breast cancer. The beer tap handle was a pink ribbon. The beer is brewed with molasses, brown sugar and something called acai berries which is supposed to be high in anti-oxidants. The beer poured ultra-dark brown with a one-finger tall tan head that left good lacing. The aroma was heavy on molasses and brown sugar. The flavor was molasses, smoke and some fruit (I’ll go out on a limb and assume this was the acai). Damned watery mouthfeel that plagues every beer they produce was unfortunately hanging around for this one too.

Rock Bottom Warrenville Vanilla Red;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Rock Bottom Warrenville;"I suppose I could take the silly way out and enter this cask conditioned ale as a Cream Ale because it tastes like cream soda. That’s how so many ""Cream Ales"" got into our database, after all. But what this is is an Amber Ale heavily spiced with vanilla beans, hence its Spice/Herb/Vegetable listing. It pours a bright amber body with a bubbly ecru head. The aroma is vanilla over fruity malt with a light earthy bitterness. The flavor begins with sweet malts but is soon flooded over by vanilla. It finishes on that vanilla note with a mild herbal bitterness left on the tongue. Rock Bottom Warrenville, Warrenville, IL"

Rock Bottom Orland Park Cinquo de Mayo;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Taster glass, guest tap at Rock Bottom Yorktown. No foam in my glass, but it is just a 4 oz. pour. Still, this small sample shows a deeper brown color than for other Mexican Viennas I have met. Simple, light grainy beer smell. Taste is also kind of grainy, like a dark roast bock. I’m reminded, fairly or not, of Schell’s Bock. This roast barley taste can require some palate adjustment after I’ve enjoyed a big IPA. A bit estery, too, but that just adds to its charm.
Rock Bottom Orland Park Cinquo de Mayo;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Rock Bottom Orland Park;1 of 45 beers I tasetd at Rock Bottom Brewery’s Rockfest. Pours a reddish brown with a thin khaki head. Aroma is hoppy, bread, hay. Finishes easy with little bitterness
Rock Bottom Orland Park Cinquo de Mayo;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Rock Bottom Orland Park;On tap at Rock Bottom Orland Park. Pours ruby with a foamy tan head. Aroma is of malt, dark fruit, grain, faint hops, and caramel. Taste up front is slightly hoppy, but not enough hoppiness to really make an impact. The backbone consists of caramel malt with notes of dark fruit and grain. Had some strange ubderlying medicinal notes, which caught me by surprised and I disliked. Mouthfeel was very creamy and carbonated. A very drinkable beer, buct lacking in the hop flavor.
Rock Bottom Orland Park Cinquo de Mayo;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Served on tap at the brewpuib (Orland Park, IL). Pours a deep dark copper, clear, but pushing solid chestnut and dark deep reds, fairly big dull tan head that cakes and laces very well. Aromas are a bit muted, caramel and toffee malts push through, with a good biscuity sweetness, light nut, with underlying bitterness from some florals. A touch metallic. Initial is lighter, with decent caramel and breadiness, a light spice towards the backend, light bitterness to balance from florals. Cereal into the body. This is a-ok and sessionable at 4.5. Gets a little deeper partway in, more flavor, light toast, good all around for the style. Slight metallic in the finish, similar to their last seasonal. Cheers.

A little flat in the mouth, but a spritz of carbo adds a tingle to the finish. Alcohol creeps. Drinkable, but it could stand to be a little fuller-bodied. And sweeter.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Cinquo de Mayo;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Rock Bottom Orland Park;On tap. Another one of RB’s crafted brews. Poured a nice sleek golden color with good head. Good retention as well, slightly carbonated, decent lacing. To me was a mix between a pilsener style and vienna style. Not your typical Marzen but slightly lighter with hints of sweet malts, caramel and a slight nuttiness. Was meduim bodied, thin, and well balanced for this style. Just a little too weak for me
Rock Bottom Orland Park Cinquo de Mayo;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Rock Bottom Orland Park;I saw the name and thought we had another Corona clone on our hands. But it’s actually a Vienna, somewhat thin, but not bad. It’s got a deep amber body with a healthy head that does some lasting lacing. The aroma is bready and sweet with caramel.

Founders Braggot (2007);Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Well I hate to disagree... I loved this beer. I also had it at the aniversary party and I drank it until the last keg ran dry. I loved it so much I tracked the brewer down afer a few years and Im having him brew me a keg for my wedding. sorry to disagree and Ill post back with the follow-up keg.
Founders Braggot (2007);Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Being a mead-maker and one very interested in different meads I was anxious to try this one. I had it the first week it was available, but it just wasn’t much. Very little flavor--but for what was present it was okay. Light honey, ...light oak. Nothing much else. Caramel? Yes. Cloudy (should bee less so) Smooth, creamy, murky dark rusty orange / red. Should have been better.
Founders Braggot (2007);Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);draft at founder’s anniversary party....appearance: mediuim brown with no existence of any head.....aroma: sweet honey and very sugary....taste: more of the same. sweet honey with more carbonation than i would expect, especially for the mead style. i concur with masonjer of this beer being very one-dimensional. given the choice, i would probably not order this again but nice to try anyway.
Founders Braggot (2007);Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);haven´t tried many braggots before, so I don´t have much to go from. Tried this at the brewery. Smelled sweet, tasted of honey, sugar, slightly floral. A bit one dimensional and overly sweet. Not bad though.
Founders Braggot (2007);Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);dark amber pour with no head..aroma of light honey, strawberry, and sugar...flavor of a tame mead (basic honey sugars)..a touch of berry fruit..the aftertaste of this beer is equal to the smell of a first aid kit
Founders Braggot (2007);Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Draft at brewpub. Poured clear reddish copper color with minimal off-white fizzy head that mostly diminished with fair lacing. Heavy dark honey and spicy aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Heavy spicy sweet flavor with a rich sweet finish of moderate duration with a small alcohol burn as it warmed. Pleasing Devil Dancer and honey combo to give a barleywine flavor.
Founders Braggot (2007);Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);This is the first time I’ve tried a mead. It was dark orange in color. Very light aroma, some fruit and honey. The flavor was fairly sweet... the alcohol was definitely in the forefront. It was just OK... I probably wouldn’t order it again.
Founders Braggot (2007);Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. Their first stab at a braggot in a couple years, this version is significantly stronger than the previous version, pouring a murky orange-brown compared to the light yellow-orange creation of years past. Fruity aroma with honey and alcohol heat, a touch estery. Rather dry body, the honey sweet but subtle. Instead, dry, dusty notes and alcohol coax the palate. Drinkable but pricey and on the mediocre side.
Alchemist Heathen;Stowe, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Alchemist;In short: A tasty, crisp, super refreshing, fruity and floral blonde IPA. Nice! How: Tap at brewpub The look: Cloudy yellow blonde body topped by a small white head In long: The bright nose shows lemongrass, grapefruits and floral notes. Taste is crisp with a hay-like maltiness, a ton of fruity hops (grapefruits, mangos, oranges) as well as a strong countryside flowers sensation. Meidum-strong bitterness that is never aggressive. Good attenuation. Uber-refreshing. I really love those refreshing blonde IPAs. This is one pint I didn’t want to share. I hate it when a friend asks me to take a sip from my pint and I tell him to stick it up his ass and he’s all insulted even before I can tell him what “it” is.

John Harvards The Warriors Code ESB;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On cask at John Harvards in Lake Grove. The beer is initially a very cloudy amber with a thin linen white head that quickly dissipated. After about five or six minutes, the beer settled and became mostly clear golden brown. Light, pleasant aroma of malt, caramel and brown sugar. The flavor is sweet up front with malt, caramel and brown sugar followed by some moderate hops bitterness. Lightly dry at the finish. Medium-full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel.
John Harvards The Warriors Code ESB;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at the Lake Grove location: Copper pour with a thin off white head, has some clarity. The aroma is malty, with caramel, raisiny notes and a light hop zest when it warms. Flavor is somewhat sweet, nice a nice malt character. Creamy body with a nice roasty and buttery aspect with nutty characteristics and a caramel note. Finish has a late balancing dry background. A solid, some what sweet/malty ESB.
John Harvards The Warriors Code ESB;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Cask - cloudy amber with a frothy, creamy head - strongly malty aroma, with notes of caramel, oats, nuts, bread and cookie dough - oddly heavy and malty sweet for an ESB - caramel, brown sugar, bready/yeasty qualities - a slightly herbal, warrior hop tang on the back of the tongue - lingering breadiness - tastes a lot like a lighter version of their hoppopatamus, which really isn’t a bad thing at all.
John Harvards Penguin Pils;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Pale gold/straw color. Somewhat malty with a bit of a grains in flavor. However, I found the aroma to be a little off putting and chemical. The chemical aroma is out of place for Harvards, so I’m willing to overlook it to an extent.
John Harvards Penguin Pils;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at JH. Aroma very lemony with a perfumy, floral quality there as well. Flavor again quite lemony, a sort of bittersweet lemon, at the same time lemon pastry and a lemon-grapefruit hybrid. Hops are at once on the gentle side, but also work nicely with that predominant lemon character. Tasty.
John Harvards Penguin Pils;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at JH. Pours a clear deep yellow with a thick white head.

John Harvards Penguin Pils;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at the brewpub. Pale golden coloured beer with a light haziness under a thin white head. Light herbal/floral hoppiness on the nose as well.

John Harvards Penguin Pils;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Looks like I had the new batch of this, tap @ the brewpub. Pint pour, clear yellow, macro-ish looking with not much head retention. The looks are the worst part of this beer. Aroma is a mix of so many different elements: starts with a hint of German herbal hops, which are the tip of a great cereal sweetness. Beneath that one picks up light citrus orange from American hops and light lagered fruitiness. Taste is similarly cereal/grainy sweet and faint fruity hops present. Seemed like a good maibock to me. Just a hint of bitterness to road it off. Very light and quaffable, but with the sweetness making you come back for more.
John Harvards Penguin Pils;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;"Tap at the Lake Grove location: Light yellow color with hardly any head. Subtle, restrained lemony hop aroma, somewhat crisp. Light bodied, with slightly creamy carbonation. Has a hint of tartness and a sour dough malt touch. Finish shows only a hint of saaz dryness. Light and simple; good for a session."
John Harvards Penguin Pils;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;"A decent attempt at a rather hard to produce style - cloudy straw color, with not much of a head, but rather sticky lace - grassy hop aroma, with hints of lemon and grainy malt - honey sweet flavor, with some light floral and fruity qualities - the saaz hop bite isn’t as prominent as I’d like; the sweetness keeps it from becoming very evident - a little overly sweet and not as clean as a good pils should be, but still fairly tasty."

Pours a slightly cloudy copper with a small amount of white head that reduces to thin cap that lasts. Nice lacing. Fruity sweet up front, fading into a moderate hop bitterness that lingers. Moderate carbonation and slightly astringent finish. Could be hoppier, but overall a pretty good IPA. Definitely worth trying if you make it to Wild Mountain.
Wild Mountain Hop Diggity IPA;Nederland, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wild Mountain Smokehouse & Brewery;Tap at brewpub. Deep amber with orange highlights and a white head.

Wild Mountain Hop Diggity IPA;Nederland, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wild Mountain Smokehouse & Brewery;Draft. Deep amber with orange highlights. Frothy white head, mostly diminishing. The aroma displays notes of toasted grain resin, pine and a bit of orange. The flavor is lightly to moderately bitter and lightly sweet. The finish is lightly sweet and moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture and lively carbonation. The way the malts are used in this IPA reminded me in some way of Alpha King which can be husky and chewy like this IPA. But Hop Diggity is not near as complex or as well balanced as Alpha King. The husky malts get muddled up with the earthy, green hops. Not very clean, but at least it is not overly thin.
Wild Mountain Hop Diggity IPA;Nederland, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wild Mountain Smokehouse & Brewery;Pours hazy orange with a decent off-white head.

Unfiltered cloudy dark copper colored body with a white head and medium-to-thick lacing. Dry-hopping very evident, catty, resinous hops, actually resembles American ESB, musty pine and orange hops in the nose and tasted throughout as well. A malty nose of bread crust/toast stands up solidly on the palate, medium to full body, with some weird filmy carbonation issues noticed, but nothing too distracting or annoying. Fresh, delicious, well integrated toast/bran/bread crust with the mildly dry/catty orange flavored hops, with IPA/ESB-level bitterness. Quite good.

Wild Mountain Bodhi Amber Ale;Nederland, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Mountain Smokehouse & Brewery;Draft pint. Dark cola brown, looks like a brown ale, very dark overall with some dark red hues visible at the bottom of the glass. They went a little overboard with the chocolate malt in this batch, I was told... easily evident in the flavor, no surprise. Nose has some roast, some chocolate, some burnt crackers, but certainly has strong hop definition... cedar wood, pine, some green vegetal notes as well. Flavor is fresh and pungent, weird mixture of chocolate malt, a little roast, some pine-green hops, and some caramel malt. Strange beer.

Wild Mountain Bodhi Amber Ale;Nederland, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Mountain Smokehouse & Brewery;"Deep, dark amber hue. Rather lively carbonation. Very roast and toasty, with only a mildly sweet base to boot. Kind of chewy and dark natured. Had a curious, black ale or schwarzbier quality, with hints of tar, dark toast and anise. A little sticky at times. ""Amber"" is an ambiguous style, as many know, but this beer definitely leans toward the ""brown ale"" or ""black ale"" categories among the ""amber ale"" spectrum."
Dillon Dam Raspberry Porter;Dillon, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dillon Dam Brewery & Restaurant;"Draft. The menu listed this as seasonal, and it was available on May 15, so I assume it is a spring beer. There was a light raspberry aroma along with some other sweet malt. The flavor was pretty much the same; a medium flavored porter with notable raspberry tart flavors. I would have preferred slightly less raspberry and a fuller body."

Draught pint at Acadia Café in Minneapolis, August 2008. Dark clear caramel with just a bit of lasting foamy head...woody, caramel-malty, lightly herbal-accented aroma, pleasant enough...alas the body is more than a bit sour and off, with detergent soapiness at first; warming up it gets a bit more palatable but it’s still a struggle to get through it...somewhat fizzy and light-bodied but not damagingly so; the flavor was enough damage I’m afraid."

Silver City Kellerbier;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Silver City Brewery;22. Pours crystal clear burnished medium golden with a towering, sudsy platinum blonde head. Weird sour metallic nose, not very pleasant at all. Light watery body, fizzy carb, bit of hay and some herbal hop notes on the mid-palate. Not unpleasant, except for the nose, but ultra, ultra light. Light is fine, but leaving that aromatics problem exposed is telling.

Light roasted malts, a good chunk of hops that seem to exist mostly in the bitterness realm, earth, a bit of burnt malt, chocolate. Finish is long, dry and nicely bitter. Medium bodied.

Poured dark brown color with a large frothy brown head that was mostly lasted with heavy lacing. Moderate complex roasted malt and earthy hop aroma.

Silver City Sasquatch Stout;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Stout;Silver City Brewery;Thanks to Brandon for hooking me up with this bomber! Poured clear, deep brown with a medium cap of creamy, well-retained tan head. The aroma picked up an array of nicely-roasted black malts with dark chocolate, licorice, and black patent represented.. maybe a splash of earthy and herbal hoppage, but it was malty overall. The flavor lost a little specific character from the malts (mostly black patent with lesser coffee and dark chocolate), but the hops played a greater role (earth, pine, and citrus were well-blended in here).. finished with great balance between the roasty malts and hop bouquet. Medium-bodied and well-carbonated on the palate.. balance was great, and this was easy as could be to drink. I’d love to have a keg of this handy at the house.
Silver City Sasquatch Stout;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Stout;Silver City Brewery;"Bottle. Pours nearly black with a tan head. Hop-and-blackberry drive the aroma along with some of the expected roasty tones; we see the same thing in the flavor only more so. Lots of blackberry and dark cherry, deep-roasted coffee, a decisive hop close with the Amarillo coming in even through the midrange to meld spicy citrus with the berries and keep both dancing lightly beneath the chocolate and coffee. Thisis a big high-octane stout, and it’s a very nice one in my book. Well worth a revisit."
Silver City Sasquatch Stout;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Stout;Silver City Brewery;Pours dark with light beige head. Roasted aroma immediately comes out as I pour. Flavor is roasted malts I wish I could taste the cents and the amarillo more. This is a few months old and the hops might’ve faded by now. Still a solid beer that deserves to be one of the better stouts out there.

Medium bitter, sweet toasted malt/grainy flavor. Saazy, or just Goldings - unlike any ESB I’ve had in terms of the hop profile. Comes across as an altbier. Light nutty finish.

The aroma is in your face smoked peat that has me thinking scotch not beer. There is also roasted malt present. The flavor is a complex mix of the smoked peat and wood from the barrel along with the roasted malt and dark chocolate from the stout. Mouthfeel is smooth as this was a bit undercarbonated.

Grays Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Grays Brewing Company;Tap at Grays. Deep opaque brown-black, thick respectable beige head. Viscous, a pretty decent beer, way better than most of Grays crap. Big rich bourbon caramel chocolate tones, but not much alcohol brutality, relatively mellow for the style. Still certainly full bodied with some rich bourbon chocolate sweetness. A nice balance, this is right on. A true accomplishment for Grays. Burnt caramel toffee notes. Mellow vanilla oak in the aroma. Nice, I can dig it.
Grays Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Grays Brewing Company;On tap at the Old Fashioned. Black with ruby lowlights and a creamy tan head. Aroma of mild bourbon, dark malts, chocolate, vanilla and maple. Taste of chocolate, maple, dark roasted malts and light peat. The bourbon/oak did not really come into the flavors much and while it was okay, I was expecting a bit more.
Grays Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Grays Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub, pours black with a thick lasting tan head. Cappuchino aromas, very smooth with flavors of coffee, toffee, and caramel, with a bitter finish. Thus far my favorite offering at Gray’s.
Grays Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Grays Brewing Company;This is cool, rating a beer for the first time here. The beer pours black with almost no head, white if there is one. The aroma had hints of coffee and caramel .... this is winter here, so my nose is not the best. Definite flavors of roasted malt, coffee, no hop flavors, a bit sweet. Medium body, moderately bitter from the roast/coffee, definite alcohol in the finish, I’d say this is a stronger version of their oatmeal stout - imperial oatmeal? Nice.
Grays Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Grays Brewing Company;Served on draught at the Wisconsin Micro-brewers Beerfest in Chilton, Wisconsin. Pours a thick dark milk chocolate colored brew with a thick and creamy tan head that has some good retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted dark malts, a touch of bourbon whiskey, coffee and some dark pitted fruits. Taste is thick and creamy, full bodied with little carbonation and with flavors of toasted dark malt, some coffee and some soft chocolate and molasses flavors. Not much bourbon flavors in the taste of finish as detected in the aroma but a decent thick and creamy imperial stout that is worth trying again.
Grays Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Grays Brewing Company;Dark brown with a thin lid of tan bubbles. Aromas of berries, roasted malt and coffee. Not overly complex but solid. Light toasted malt start that leads to roasted malt and lightly burnt coffee. No catching much bourbon in this. Perhaps they have toned it down since the earlier reviews. A solid imperial stout.
Grays Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Grays Brewing Company;Dark, dark brown in color, but not black by any means...with an inch tall, light tan head. Aroma is soft, with notes of butter, bourbon and chocolate...not very many roasted malts. Flavor is very buttery, this is a smooth stout with more emphasis on the chocolate and sweetness than bitterness and coffee. The bourbon was very present, but not much oak. It was pretty good. Palate was medium-full with soft carbonation.
Grays Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Grays Brewing Company;On tap @ Gray’s Tied House, 5/15/07. Got the last of the last--a pint of foam became four ounces of black beer--brown at the edges--and still managed a two finger tan head after 10 minutes of sitting. Aroma up front is fresh brown sugar (not that I’ve ever had it). vanilla, butter, strong alcohol, coffee and roasted malts. Flavor had strong alcohol up front with some whiskey--tongue numbingly so, unsweetened chocolate, some caramel and toffee. Too much whiskey, too much butter, too much alcohol. Almost flat with a thin body--though I can’t knock it because of the carbonation. I know this beer isn’t that crazy strong, but that alcohol kinda sucked. I guess I’m not a true dark beer lover.
Roskilde Festival Surprise 2007;Bringstrup, Ringsted, Denmark;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Det Lille Bryggeri;24th June 2009 Cloudy dark chocolate coloured beer. Semi soft and semi dry palate. Rich sweet malt that has traces of ginger and sweet fruit. The alcohol is noticeable but not unpleasantly so, the aniseed provides counterbalance to the sweet malt. Warming afterglow. Tasty beer.

Wild Onion Bohemian Dark;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wild Onion Brewery;This draft brew from the brew pub poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized light brown colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a semi-opaque no visible carbonation dark ruby red brown colored body. . The mouth feel was very tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of mild hops sweet and dark malt. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Wild Onion Bohemian Dark;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wild Onion Brewery;On tap at Onion. Poured a clear, ruby-tinted dark brown with just a little beige head action. Sweet, darker chocolate notes steal the show in the aroma, and were quite enjoyable… some molasses and light herbal notes peek through at times. Flavor found sweet darker caramel and semi-sweet chocolate malts.. tasty.. back-end brings out some diacetyl notes and a mild chocolate bitterness.. drinkable, but much better on the front half. A little shy of medium body and sweet on the palate.. felt very nice until the tail-end.
Gekkeikan Gold Sake;KYOTO Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Gekkeikan Sake Company (Japan);Slightly yellow tinge in the tiny ceramic cup. Smell is a bit alcoholic, but more warming than solventy. There’s a delicate flavor with a bit of plum brandy, but it’s mostly washed down by the alcohol.
Gekkeikan Gold Sake;KYOTO Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Gekkeikan Sake Company (Japan);Clear pour. Subtle, dry aroma of rice and alcohol, mostly alcohol. A bit sweet with a minor kick at the end
Gekkeikan Gold Sake;KYOTO Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Gekkeikan Sake Company (Japan);Not really a sake fan. This is pretty sweet, vodka-like honeyness. Not better than a good beer, but nothing bad. Sake seems to lack depth.
Gekkeikan Gold Sake;KYOTO Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Gekkeikan Sake Company (Japan);From a760 ml bottle. The sake poured a pale yellow-golden color. The aroma was grass, rice, lemongrass and pronounced alcohol. Dryish with strong notes of rice, lemongrass and vodka. There was a faint undertone of vanilla that popped up for a minute and was then drowned in lemongrass and rice. Long tangy lemongrass finish. Fairly full bodied and oily texture. Ok.
Gekkeikan Gold Sake;KYOTO Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Gekkeikan Sake Company (Japan);"My first sake, from a 720ml bottle. Rice aroma, clear, colorless pour, tastes of rice and alcohol. Fairly sweet, but good. (Not sure how to rate it; going middle-of-the-road for the time being.)"

A little sweet and the body is a little oiley. Good cold or warm. Reminds me of rubbing alcohol and vodka. Easy to drink and not half bad, but I was expecting a little more. Seems like a sake that could be used when doing shots.

Prairie Rock Barley Wine;Elgin, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;On tap at Prairie Rock. Poured a clear reddish-amber with no head.. flat and translucent. Enjoyed the aroma of deeply-toasted, rum-laced caramel and dark fruits.. some alcohol apparent.. big & mean, but well-presented. The flavor found an odd blend of boozy caramel and plums upfront.. worked OK.. some unidentifiable bitterness and alcohol scald the back-end a bit.. ugly bitter, boozy finish. Warm on the palate with a smooth fore.. medium-heavy bodied.. gets ugly toward the finish.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Bottle. Reddish Amber in colour. Unfortunately the rhubarb obliterates the taste of the base beer. Very, very dry, rather bitter beer with a vanilla taste. Not for me. Truly a Strange Brew. (2008)
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Feb 2008: This one of the ’Serious Country Ales’ themed beers from Greene King (owners of Ruddles name). I once had a Gurkin flavoured beer which had a green hue to it and actually tasted of girkins, it was horrible. I am reviewing this as I drink it and I don’t really want to taste nothing but rhubarb, so here goes. Clear 500ml bottle, no best before date visible on the bottle. Poured into my Bateman’s straight pint glass. Deep amber colour with a thin white head, looks OK but is no world beater in the appearance stakes. The aroma is more towards custurd than rhubarb, there is however some rhubarb crumble smells too. The taste is all rhubarb and sour rhubarb at that. The label doesn’t lie, apart from the bit about rhubarb having a sweetness. If it does have a sweetness i think they have boiled it out. No way of telling Bramling Cross Hops have been used unless you read the neck label. Different to anything I’ve ever had before and not all bad. I am not a huge rhubarb fan at the best of times but I’ve almost enjoyed this beer. Will I have another? Most likely not. I have had to start eating chesses to help me finish the bottle and hide the taste.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Bottle. No best before date but I’ve been putting this off for a while. Amber coloured. Disgustingly sweet aroma with obvious rhubarb but more like rhubarb and custard sweets. Tastes as it smells but actually even worse and without the nice sugaryness that actual rhubarb and custard sweets would have. Beyond awful.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;8th January 2008 Amber gold beer. Crisp palate. Pronounced Rhubarb that leads to a bone dry hoppy and rhubarb finish that lingers and lingers. Unusual but the palate makes it hard work.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Light brown with a thin but lasting head, strong sweet fruity rhubarb aroma, flavour of rhubarb, vanilla and hops, dry and bitter, this is not a good idea for a beer, not nice at all. Nearly pored it down the drain and I could still taste this beer hours after drinking it.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Bottle @ Beer Exposed, September 2008. Pours clear, golden amber with a small, creamy, film head. Aroma is sweet, clear rhubarb character and caramel. High carbonation and a little thin. Flavour is weird, some rhubarb, a touch of tartness, caramel and doughy malts. Very weird, but actually drinkable.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Sweet actually smells of rhubarb, good enough to eat. No head amber with a hint of pink. Looks pretty flat. Mmmm tastes like rhubarb too but with malt mixed in. Has a bitter taste to it but then again it is rhubarb Considering it looks flat it is quite fizzy in the mouth. Enjoyed this beer would buy it again would be good to drink with custard mmmmmmmmm.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Bottle. At one time many years ago Ruddles was a highly respected name in the real ale world. At one point it seemed to be the only real ale stocked for miles. How times have changed! This was a truly awful novelty type drink not to be taken seriously. All i could taste was heaven forbid Rhubarb. As I love both beer and rhubarb it was a shock to taste both together. An experiment that hopefully will never be repeated again.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Bottle from Tesco. Truly awful. I should’ve read some of the reviews on here before wasting my money. Never, ever again. Nasty, musty odour, revolting chemical taste. Christ, this may well be the worst beer I’ve ever drunk. I poured it away after a couple of gulps. Possibly used in trench warfare during World War 1.
Ruddles Rhubarb;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;500ml Bottle - Amber in colkour. Vanilla and rhubabe in the aroma. Sweet rhubarb taste with some vanilla notes and light malt. Has the potential to be good but this is rather sickly.

Hair of the Dog Belgian Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Draught @ Brouwer’s Café: Deep burnt orange, moderate foamy off-white head, a few streams of carbonation, fairly nice lacing. &nbsp Campfire nose, loads of ash, rich biscuitiness as well. &nbsp Reminds me somewhat of the Adam, just not as complex with the malts. &nbsp Quite ashy on the tongue. &nbsp Somewhat of an odd concoction. &nbsp A little farmhouse like, some mustiness. &nbsp Moderate body and mouthfeel. &nbsp Finishes with a bit of smokiness, slightly biscuity. &nbsp Yeah, comes across as a lighter version of the Adam.
Hair of the Dog Belgian Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;On tap at Brouwer’s Belgian Fest. Reddish brown with good head. Little bit of dark fruit sweetness, but not all that sweet for the style. Lots of spicy belgian yeast in the flavor.
Hair of the Dog Belgian Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;A dark brown, strong Belgian ale. I called it an Abbey Dubbel, but I’m not sure about that distinction. Had on tap at the Brouwer’s Belgian Fest. Plenty of hops in this one, which makes it unusual. I really enjoyed it, but I think it will get better with time.

Silver Peak Steamboat Common;Reno, Nevada, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;Nothing in the aroma. And not much going on in this beer either. A little hop flavor, it barely qualifies as a hot summer day brew.

Town Hall Hillarys Step Strong Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Malts: all Golden Promise. Hops: 100% Summit dwarf. Named to honor a figure famous for mounting a daunting summit. Clear amber/bronze appearance, with a big, lasting creamy head. Lovely aromatics, big, fresh hops, citrus zest and spice...grassy and green. Wonderful. Taste: delcicious. Ample juicy malt, contained bitterness, mixed with fresh hop flavor, with fruity associations, then a bold, brash malty feel kicks in, riding with the higher alcohol. A meaty brew. Beefsteak and applesauce! Great drinking, too, despite the higher booze buzz. A beautiful blend of malt and hops, so smooth, so tasty. I’ll be helping kill these kegs at every opportunity.
Town Hall Hillarys Step Strong Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;I don’t get the American strong category, because it just isn’t that strong. But good anyway. Fairly well hopped nose with some citrus and pine. Flavor has a biscuit-bread quality from the malt and considerable hop bitterness. One of their better recent beers. Gold color, moderate head.
Town Hall Hillarys Step Strong Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On cask at the Brewpub: ...and fabulous! Wow, nice gem look to a pale yellow gold. Smeared and glowing haze to its body. Creamy small top of smooth foam. Immense lacing or should I say straight up sheet of foam lays across the glass like a blanket of pillowy foam. Wow! Gorgeous! Aroma is of soft citrus and pine that carryies a well displayed sifting of orangey/pineapple juices mixed with tangerine soaked pine. Taste is quite nice, very firm and peppy with an overall smoothness that is killer. Tenderly soft in citrus juicyness that induces the ideas and tastes of the tropics. Pineapple, red oranges, tangerines, and some nice touches of skin dryness and pith. Earthy yet favors a subtle tone of sweetness over the top with its juicyness. Grassy touches the end with a nicely rounded bitterness thats easy to handle yet has a decent pep and zip to it to keep it interesting. Feel is super smooth and full on cask pulled delight. Oh so tender and smooth with an amazingly creamy feel with a small texture of buzzing hops and citrusy stuff that floats about. This stuff is gold to the throat. So smooth and tender and creamy its a breeze to drink. A damn fine drinker by TH. No surprise there. Good stuff!
Town Hall Hillarys Step Strong Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Copper color with a thin head. Big aroma of oranges and hops. The taste falls into a sweet and sour malty soup. Very boozy for 7%.

Town Hall Hillarys Step Strong Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Didn’t take notes, but this was another nice solid beer from Town Hall. There was a flavor that became stronger as it warmed that I didn’t care for. Solid, just not my flavor.
Town Hall Hillarys Step Strong Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Aroma is peaches, malt, and maybe a bit of marijuana? Slightly cloudy pale ale with small white head. Flavor is somewhat sweet up front, then bitter peaches, and quite bitter at the end. Lively carbonation throughout. Good beer.
Town Hall Hillarys Step Strong Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Orange magma hued pour, completely clear. Light, crisp notes of citrus on the nose. Ginger bitten sesame seeds and honey wheat bread follow. Crushing bitterness. Firey licks of lavender perfumes. A mashed pulp of flower petals and sunflower seeds with an off-centered citrus hop punch. Not grapefruit, but unusually tangy like nectarine. Palate is slick and harsh, mellowing given some patience and adjustment. Mostly predictable, but not boring. Unique strokes against a proven and dependable canvas.
Rock Bottom Chicago A Roll In The Hay;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Rock Bottom Chicago;Actually named A Roll In The Hay, this is a spiced up American wheat. It pours a very cloudy straw color with a substantial frothy head. The aroma is strong on the spices, especially ginger, but has a soft underlying wheat malt to it. The flavor is sweet and wheaty, the spices building beginning midway until it’s almost like talcum powder. Oddly refreshing. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;I would say this is more of a pilsner versus blonde ale. If expecting a blonde, then yes, I think it's a bit weak and thin. But, like I said...if this is classified as a pilsner, which I was actually expecting...it's quite decent. Bought it for the season as summer beer, and it serves the purpose. Grassy flavors with some bitter hop at the end. Appearance is a clear medium pale yellow. I wouldn't go out of my way or anything in the future, but can see me getting this again.
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Pours a nice medium amber color. Aromas of sweet malts, and the faintest hint of hops. Flavors of caramel sweetness, a touch of fruit, and almost no hop. Nice dry finish.
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;"Hazy golden coloured body with a rich, thick, three centimetre tall white head. Aroma of pale malt, grass, light hops and a touch of citrus. Light-bodied; Sharp metallic flavour up front with a grassy note, some subdued earthiness and a pale, yet distinct malt flavour. Aftertaste is a touch bland with a little grassiness and a light metallic note and a faint sweetness near the end. Overall, a light yet pungent grassy character with noticeable finish - not a bad beer for the style and showing much less bitterness than others in this style. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Whole Foods in Washington (Foggy Bottom, Eye Street NW), DC on 28-May-2015 for US$2,49 sampled at home in Washington on 12-November-2015."
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Bottle. The deScription has a lot of flowery language for an IPA. Dark gold color with a large head. Citrus and spruce taste and aroma.
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Thanks to iNBE. A little ale like and a little lager like. Both kind of sweet and hoppy. OK. Serving: Bottle
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;"12 Fl. Oz. Bottle. Poured bright yellow, clear, white fizzy head and lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma of wheat, yeast and some hope; actually not bad. Taste is tart, hoppy, some grain but a bit too watery for my taste. Is not a bad beer by any means, but it’s certainly not a rockstar either."
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Enjoy by 7/1/15 Slightly hazy gold color with a rocky white head. The aroma is big on spicy, citrusy, and floral Sterling hops. There is an underlying bready, crackery aroma of pils malt as well. Light malt body gets out of the way quick as a huge hop presence takes over. Finishes well on the bitter side, but clean and refreshing. Pretty good stuff.
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Fairly straightforward pale malts - biscuity - with a dryish, almost continental hop character.
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Semi-bitter grainy taste. Fruit in the aroma but mostly grain. Pretty light bodied and somewhat dry.
Sweetwater Road Trip;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Bottle into a pilsner glass. Best by 05/24/2015 so over a week past freshness date and it was priced accordingly. A: Medium gold with a slight haze and an inch of head retaining nicely. Lots of carbonation and good lacing too. S: Light bread scent with a faint spicy hop note in the background. T: A bitter herbal taste up front fairly dominates anything coming in behind. Not altogether good. A bit of a round maltiness finally detected but too little too late. I guess the hop bombs were diffused with age. M: Medium body and slightly above average carbonation. Pretty average. O: This beer is past it’s freshness date which may explain it’s herbal/vegetal character. I’m sure it deserves another rating and maybe it will receive one but it will be a while before I purchase this again. Not very good.
Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;On draft at Big Bear.

Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;"On tap at the Jupiter beerfest. A big thanks to Tara the Tiger for hooking us up with the ""private stash"". Big oak, vanilla, and citrus flavors compliment this hoppy east coast DIPA. Florida ain’t San Diego, but this beer represents the state well......"
Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;Draft… Lightly hazy orange ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Good retention. Earthy, citrusy nose – pine, leather, grapefruit and only a rumor of oak. Maybe some Munich, caramel and/or crystal malts. Surprisingly, no bourbon. Full-bodied with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and prickly carbonation. Bitter! Hearty malt backbone, but mainly just kick ass, earthy, grapefruit and pine hop bitterness. Lengthy, very bitter, almost-caustic finish. If I were a hophead, I would be ecstatic about this one, but I’m more of a bourbon barrel, imperial, big time malty, double IPA guy. This beer leaves me wanting more malt and a more refined flavor. I would have enjoyed this bourbon barrel aged beer a lot more if it had actually been aged in a bourbon barrel. The bitterness is way too intense and sharp for my palate. Also, maybe would be better on cask or nitro.
Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;Hazy amber. Big hoppy nose is very woody with papaya notes. Bitter, refreshing, herbal, woody, citrusy...fun stuff. Very complex yet seamlessly integrated. Outstanding.
Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;Cloudy amber dark orange rusty color. Smells like a pine forest with lots of evergreen, cedar, and a slight sweetness. Super quaffable, dangerous. Bursting with flavor, with an astringent tobacco finish and hints of smoke. Great hopping, excellent brew.
Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;tap at Jupiter brewfest.

Matt really knows his beer!
Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the JCBF, pours a orangish gold, cloudy. Big time nose of grape, citrus, and a bit of mollasses (from the barrel aging maybe?). Taste is amazing. Hugely hoppy and very bitter which is not my thing but tempered by an amazing smooth roundness to the malt, definitely some vanilla lingering in the finish along with the orange and grapefruit. Complex and brilliant, many felt this was the best in show, I’d be hard pressed to argue.
Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;on tap-pours a foamy/bubbly off white head and cloudy gold color. Aroma is citrus/pine hops bitter. Taste is grapefruit, citrus/pine hops bitter, good balance with medium malt-some sweet. Nice for 1 or 2. OK carbonation.
Big Bear Double IPA - Bourbon Barrel;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Big Bear Brewing Company;On tap. A little below 9% ABV. Amber pour with a hoppy vanilla nose. Impressive double IPA. Good balance of hops and alcohol with an excellent smoothness delivered by the barrel aging. The floral, hoppy and vanilla components follow throughout the taste and leave a pleasant, slightly bitter finish. Great Florida brew.
John S. Rhodell British Red;Peoria, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John S. Rhodell Brewery;Amber pour with a nice off-white head. Aroma of caramel, little bit of hops. Taste was good- caramel, soft carbonation, smooth. Left a great lacing on the glass.
John S. Rhodell British Red;Peoria, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John S. Rhodell Brewery;Poured a reddish amber, then it falls apart. A big banana fruity estery nose, the banana esters completely overwhelm everything else. With the name, you would think that this is an amber with English hops, but the banana fruitiness dominates any other flavors, even the hops disappears under the bananas. This is the mystery of Rhodell’s, how can Mark produce such great DIPA’s, IPA’s, Imperial Stouts, Barley Wines, German style ales and lagers, but when it comes to Scottish Ales or Amber/Red ales, they all have this same. stupid, banana phenol, making them undrinkable. I don’t get it.
John S. Rhodell Black Widow Imperial Stout;Peoria, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;John S. Rhodell Brewery;This is a good RIS, not Dark Lord great, but still very good, one of the better brewpub RIS available in the Great Lakes/Midwest region. Aromas and taste of dark roast malts, coffee, cocoa and earthy grains, citric and bittering hops, just enough bitterness to counter the malts, the alcohol is in the background and provides a soft warmth in the palate, and a dryish roasted malty finish. This is a tasty and balanced RIS, Peoria is lucky to have the J. S. Rhodell brewpub, where the majority of the brews our of high quality.

Shiner 98 Bavarian Style Amber Lager;Shiner, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);From Sep 2007 This pours from 12oz bottle a clear amber with a very small head of foam that recedes rapidly. The smell is of sweet malt, some roastiness, and some hop. The taste has a good biscuit malt flavour up front with a more than ample hop bitterness that moves in about midway through. When I swish it in my mouth, I taste some earthy and roasted malt notes and overall, this is a pretty good tasting little beer and I find it's quite quaffable. The mouthfeel is medium light, the carbo is medium, and it finishes fairly dry. I'd buy this again, no problem.
Shiner 98 Bavarian Style Amber Lager;Shiner, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 4/14/2016. Pours clear orange/light copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap.

Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

Pretty clean on lager flavors; slight yeasty notes are present. Moderate dryness from bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, creamy/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a nice Vienna lager. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean to drink.

Shiner 98 Bavarian Style Amber Lager;Shiner, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Originally rated on 6/2/08. A mild offering from shiner. It isnt daring by any stretch but a well rounded, balanced beer. A little light on flavor, some malts, unoffensive, ok.
Shiner 98 Bavarian Style Amber Lager;Shiner, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Shiners Bavarian style ale does not do it for me. Common taste for a common beer. You can do better than this one.
Shiner 98 Bavarian Style Amber Lager;Shiner, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Amber pour with a sweet aroma. The flavor is also ver sweet with a wet finish. Some yeast, and light malts. Not too malty.
Shiner 98 Bavarian Style Amber Lager;Shiner, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);A nice amber lager from Shiner, pours an excellent clean amber color with lots of white lacing and foam, very classic look. Aroma is a subdued caramel maltiness, reminds me of a weaker version of a Brooklyn lager or original Shiner Bock. Taste likewise is a couple layers of caramel malt and grain notes, pleasant and not too sophisticated. Finishes clean, light-to-medium bodied. Decent flavor but a bit thin.
Shiner 98 Bavarian Style Amber Lager;Shiner, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);A throwback to my pre-ratebeer days. Can’t say I’ve been missing this one in the intervening years. Deep amber with lightly sweet and bitter notes.

Shiner 98 Bavarian Style Amber Lager;Shiner, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);12 oz refridgerted pour into a Spiegelau IPA glass (for the hell of it). Aggressive pour produced a thin white half-finger head. Fades quickly. Clear as day, mild carbonation. Nose is sweet corn and a little malt. Body a thin, though not as thin as I expected. Crisp. Taste is alright. A little malt, a bit of bitterness, a little corny sweetness. Maybe some hay? Fine for this price point, but not something I’d pay for. Probably wouldn’t turn it down, I think.

Jasper Rocket Ridge Raspberry Ale;Jasper, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Jasper Brewing Company;"***review from June 2008*** Poured out an awesome very burnt orange brew with red hues, crystal clear, usual small white cap but this time it was very creamy and gave out entire glass lacing the whole way through. Perfection in a glass. The aroma was concentrated raspberry syrup that is not overwhelmingly sweet. Almost like a raspberry sorbet. Boring and lacks vision big time. Obvious raspberry taste that seems fake and is probably just syrup. Decent biscuit malts in the middle.... a so-so beer at best.... just got my plate of ""mall quality"" over greasy fries... fuckers. Smooth and very tangy, good sour middle even if just for a second. Finishes empty."
Jasper Rocket Ridge Raspberry Ale;Jasper, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Jasper Brewing Company;"Draft 6 oz at the brewpub; Almost pink, watery looking and still. No real discernable aroma and the berry flavor is restrained too. Very, very light. Made for non beer drinkers I think. Well made, I supposed, but I don’t think I’d seek this out again.

John S. Rhodell Imperial Black Widow Hop Head Stout;Peoria, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;John S. Rhodell Brewery;(draught at the brewpub) Dark black, very little head. Not a lot of aroma. Flavors of roast malt mixed with hops. Interesting blend.
John S. Rhodell Imperial Black Widow Hop Head Stout;Peoria, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;John S. Rhodell Brewery;Remind me of the Hoppin’ Frog’s Bodacious Black & Tan I had at the recent Peoria International Beer Festival. Poured a blackish brown with an off-white head. Aromas of citrus and roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Good moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel. A pretty smooth blend of two styles, just enough sour citric bitterness to balance with the sweet roasted malts, an easy sipper, very tasty.
John S. Rhodell Hop Head Heaven IPA;Peoria, Illinois, United States;IPA;John S. Rhodell Brewery;From the tap, served at cellar temperature in a pint glass. Poured a slightly hazy reddish orange copper with a foamy, bubbly off-white that settled into a thin sudsy lacing, small amount of sticking. Tiny bubbles flow from the bottom to top for whole duration. A hop head’s aroma, pine resins, sweetly floral, citric zest and rind, with just a smack of graininess at the edges. Good active carbonation and crisp, dry, hop slick, velvety smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel, pretty close to perfect for an IPA. If you like hops, then this is close to heaven, piney, oily, citric zesty with a pronounced rind bitterness, a lingering bitterness with a soft, mild numbing of the tongue, a light lemon flavor emerges towards the end, the malts have a sugary graininess that helps sweeten and add to the hop taste, the alcohol is barely noticeable, provides a low temperature warmth in palate that also helps enhance the hops, and a crisp, dry, hop and rind, grainy finish. Another great IPA from Mark at Rhodell, I can’t wait to try the single hop Summit IPA that is coming soon.

Aroma of berries, burnt caramels, and toast. Very sweet flavor profile with abundant berries, fruitskin, and residual sugars, backed by heavy toast and leafy hops. Medium-bodied.

New Holland Uncle Heavy;Holland, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;New Holland Brewing Company;Anniversary Trip 2007 5/19/2007: New Holland Uncle Heavy Scotch Ale is dark amber/brown in color and transparent. The aroma is chocolate, some char, roasted malt, nutty(?), and has some coffee undertones. Deep caramal and some chocolate comprise most of the flavor. There are also hints of bourbon and slightly charred oak. This beer is slightly dry, but mellow and smooth overall. I enjoyed their Scotch Ale quite a bit and it is probably one of my favorite New Holland beers... Draught sample at New Holland Brewing Company’s restaurant and pub in downtown New Holland, Michigan.

John Harvard's Cambridge A Spoonful Weighs a Ton;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;A reddish copper ale with a thin moka head. A pleasant intense mix of treacle, licorice, and floral hops, citrusy notes. In mouth, a let down from the aroma, rather light and watery malt, with light British floral hops, a bit of lichee and tropical fruits. On tap at brewpub, July 1 2010.
John Harvard's Cambridge A Spoonful Weighs a Ton;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Cask half pint at NERAX on 5/5/07 Great condition, bright and all with a plum-mahogany color and an off-white head that shows strong retention and moderate lacing. Lightly fruity nose is otherwise full of graham crackers and a bit of toffee. No hop apparency, maybe just the barest bit of leafiness. Some vanilla and sweet pale malts find their way in and greatly soften the harder toffee and cracker-like notes, resulting in an aromatic and balanced nose. A truly splendid mouthfeel does wonders for this very low gravity beer making it seem neither watery nor thin. Vanilla and honey are joined by a gentle chocolate graham cracker flavor as well as light bread and nuttiness on the finish. Very engaging, tight carbonation with moderate esters and no hop notes. Absolutely flawless and truly remarkable that an American brewer produced this. Draught pint at the brewpub on 5/19/07 The forced carbonation on draught really illustrates why these beers are so great on cask. The looser carbonation left it watery and made the body seem much, much lighter. The tight carbonation in the draught sample concentrates the maltiness and creaminess. Still a good beer and flawless, but just not meant to be served on draught.
Rohrbach Jamie Bock;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rohrbach Brewing Company;The Bock is back at Rohrbach’s. I’m pretty sure this is a different recipe than it was before, but the name is the same. Rohrbach Bock is a crystal clear deep red beer with a thin off-white film that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma has notes of chocolate, bread and roast. It smells grassy, with a a slight, soft sweetness. It is medium, maybe medium-full bodied, chewy, smooth and syrupy. The finish is sticky. It tastes slightly sweet, chocolatey and lightly fruity. The bitterness is light and grassy and the finish is tart. This is an ideal bock!
Rohrbach Jamie Bock;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Acouple days ago I stopped in after helping my brother Ed trim all his bushes and plant roses. I wanted the Pale Ale, but they were out. I didn’t beleive it. I’m glad they still had the bock there. It was more premium($3.75 a glass) then their other permium beer. It was as JB said: Dark reddish brown with a thick creamy looking head. Very malty aroma along with some toffee. Rich creamy palate with a burnt feel to it. A bit of nuttiness adds to the body. I enjoyed it too.

Quite a fresh, citrusy bitterness - orange, tangerine. The finish is dry. When it gets too warm it gets sort of tannic...maybe that’s the rye...I’m pretty bad at picking out rye. Not bad.

Joh. Albrecht (Konstanz) Maibock;Konstanz, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauhaus Joh. Albrecht Konstanz;On tap at brewpub in Konstanz. Deep, hazy copper color. Decent white head doesn’t last. Aroma of grains and oranges. Flavor is initially sweet--light malts, orange zest and some dessert spicing. Fades into a malty bitterness that carries you to the finish. Really outstanding, but I wonder if the recipe varies by year and brewpub franchise.

It’s a dark hazy orangish-brown with a small beige head. The flavor has lots of cranberry with some hints of cherry syrup, There is a light herbal bitterness in the finish. Virtually no sourness. Different and interesting, but not very lambic-like.
Fort Street Cranbic;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Fort Street Brewery;This beer is based on a lambic with cranberry added. The aroma was too strong of cranberry. The flavor was also too much cranberry. A very sweet beer would be a good ladies beer. It was a good quality beer just not what you would expect a beer to taste like. Drinkable but would not order another.
Siraku Amber Ale;Santiago, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Siraku;Has a color coppery amber. A big head, which is kept enough time. The aroma is to sweet and something of fruits. The flavor is well malty, with something of excess of caramel. The hop is identified well. I would say that it is a balanced well beer. The body is average, good. The finish is with too much caramel (it is the serious mistake of the majority of the Chilean beers). Nevertheless, this beer on the average of the Chilean beers.

Fruity like the pear, quince and the skin orange. Liquory like whisky. Flavor begins sweet and finishes with medium and persistent bitterness. Presences of the hop that reminds herbs. Palate: Medium body, semi-oily texture. Medium carbonation. A nice surprise, it is much more than another handcrafted chilean beer. Very advisable.
Springfield Mueller Milk Stout;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Springfield Brewing Company;"WOW. Pours a total pitch, medium tan head. Aroma is milk chocolate, coffee, and a slight cherry note. Flavor is massively chocolate, sweet but not cloying, with an excellent hop balance that never makes itself known, but keeps those malts in line. very dark roasted coffee makes an appearance in the second half, next comes a lemony/grassy sensation, and a long bitter finish. This brewery definitely knows how to make a stout (""black sheep"", as they call them)."

Clear mahogany in colour with a thin creamy white head. Slight note of weak coffee in the short aroma. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts deliver a rich digestive biscuit base laden with hedgerow fruit, bramble in particular. Dusty hop prickle gives a dry note to the short aftertaste. Finish is malty and moreish with maple syrup and dates. A lovely mild and well recommended.

Davenports IPA (Cask);Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Wetherspoon Festival, Nov 2007. JDW, Rochester. Not an exciting selection, but I love the idea of having 3 1/3 pints for the same price as a pint, and having the glasses marked with the special marker to show the number of the beer. This is a nice beer with Fuggles and Mount Hood hops. A soft session bitter, very drinkable. Juicy sweet, then a lovely dose of dusty hops in the finish. Chalky dry in the middle. Nice one.

Lancaster Rare Rooster Summer Rye Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Poured into a pint glass. Bought this for a buck at local place. Had this before, but this time is for reviewing. 3.0 A: Semi-hazy medium orange color. One finger of head that falls quickly and leaves not much lacing. I don’t remember it looking this pathetic. 3.5 S: Only a touch of rye. Doughy and buttery in a brewpubby sort of way, if that makes sense to anyone. 3.0 T: Not too big on the taste. Healthy bitter backbone. The same buttery flavor exists in the taste. Really not that great of a beer. No flavors that I want and plenty that I don’t. 3.0 M: Medium body. Undercarbonated. 2.5 D: Way too many problems. I don’t remember it being this bad. If I ever try it again, I’ll review it if it turns out any better.

Lancaster Rare Rooster Summer Rye Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Bottle to pilsner glass. You can smell the rye pretty easily. Has a different taste, but a nice finish. Spare head, colored white. Good lacing, cloudy body which is a dark y ellow / amber color. Lots of malt flavors like molasses and bread.

Lancaster Rare Rooster Summer Rye Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Bottle. Is that a Blue Hen? Label certainly has enough blue and gold. Sweet spicy nose, a little rye, sure, but tons of spice I’d expect to find in a pumpkin beer (+vanilla). Amber pour still translucent, creamy and, yes, lacing beige head. Taste is much drier and bitterer than expected, a little harsh grain with some strange raspberry and blueberry notes. Touches of orange peel and pepper. Vial of liquid yeast in the finish along with some spruce. Medium-full carbonation ind a medium-full and slightly metallic body. Left sort of a dirty impression, but could be fine substitution for a summertime Wit.
Lancaster Rare Rooster Summer Rye Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Bottle. Cloudy orange copper with small head.

Lancaster Rare Rooster Summer Rye Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lancaster Brewing Co.;12oz bottle thanks to my buddy ben4321. Orangish-amber color with a small, quickly dissipating off-white head. Aroma is rye bread, butter, and corn. Flavor is some rye, caramel malt, and grain, along with an overwhelming buttery diacetyl flavor that sort of kills it. Wouldn’t be too bad without that, not that it would really be that exciting either. Body is fairly watery and thin and it has a weird butteriness to the mouthfeel as well. Overall, not so good.

Red Bocq;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Du Bocq;Bottle. Cherries, candies, elderflower and marshmellows. Cherries dominate and the beer is excessively sweet, which resembles cough syrup. However, if not for the sweetness, it might have been genuinely tasty.
Red Bocq;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Du Bocq;Bottle from Sugaya. Thick cherry nose. Hazy pink-tinged peach color, thin head, some lace. Cherryies, berries, sugar, with a gentle dry finish. Light body, tingly carbonation. Not so bad. Not very beer-like, but fairly tasty.
Red Bocq;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Du Bocq;Sweet cherry beer (well, cherry, strawberry, plum and blackcurrant) based on Blanche de Namur. Aroma and taste of the basic beer, however, are completely overshadowed by a very sweet, artificial, sugary, cloying fruit candy taste not unlike grenadine or water ice, which leaves no room for anything else. Looks nice, with a bright and fierce cherry red under a lilac head, but I’ll never learn to appreciate these sickly sweet witbier-based design fruit beers.

Minerva Colonial;Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Cerveceria Minerva;12 oz pour at Wings Army, Playa Del Carmen. A semi hazy pale yellow pour with a thin fizz head. Minerva has proven to be quite a nice collection of brews, I have learned on this trip. Straw, some corn on the aroma. Suspicious, but flavor seems to really save this. Good flavor. Refreshing. A touch of corn, but thin. Quite a carb bite here. Late cream corn reminder. A little better than what I would expect from a kolsch around here. Still, with this heat, very refreshing.

Grizzly Paw Cales Pale Ale (CPA);Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;Spent the weekend in the mountains with my sister and bother-in-law visiting from Halifax, and this is a must-do for luch. New summer seasonal on tap. Bright golden straw colour, clear, dense white head with generous lace down the entire glass. Light grassy/flowery aroma. Pale malt palate with a nice mild floral hop accent and a mild bitter finish. Not a classic rep of the style (lower-key than most), but really quite nice as a summer sessional. In my mind it comes across more like a bohemian pilsener than anything, I think.

BridgePort Haymaker Extra Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BridgePort Brewing;"From Jul 2007 Purchased as part of a mixed 6 Pack at Wilbur's in Ft Collins. It pours from 12oz bottle a clear light gold with not much foam to speak of and there's no lacing. The smell is as weak as the appearance. Nothing strikes my nose with any intensity. The taste...this is where it starts to shine a bit. I'm getting some good citrus. mainly lemon, hops up front and it has a good malt balance. The malt isn't sweet; it's more of an earthiness but it does well in balancing the hop presence. Mind you, this isn't a beer with the flavour of the ages but it's quite quaffable. The body is on the light side and it's lightly carbonated but it's a good one to turn to for a hot summer day. It's worthy of a try or 2."
BridgePort Haymaker Extra Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BridgePort Brewing;Decent aroma, white head, virtually no lacing. Hazy body with fair carbonation. Slightly bitter flavor and similar finish. Not much happening here. Very disappointing, considering it’s from Bridgeport.
BridgePort Haymaker Extra Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BridgePort Brewing;A decent EPA. The citrusness is a bit more than I would’ve wanted. Otherwise weak body, light golden orange appearance. Tried this in Taos NM riding in the back of a truck through the S. de Cristos. Could’ve influenced my appreciation of the beer...
BridgePort Haymaker Extra Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BridgePort Brewing;355ml bottle sampled while on vacation in Oregon pours a golden orange color with a small white head that leaves very little lacing on the glass. Aroma is hay and some grassy hops. Taste is light malty sweet with some grassy and mild citrus hoppy bitterness. Light to medium body and light carbonation. Nothing memorable about this one, just an average pale ale.
BridgePort Haymaker Extra Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BridgePort Brewing;12 ounce bottle. Pours a light clear pale gold with an average white head. Aroma of yeast, grain and some florals. Tastes is similar with some florals added. Nice light beer, not exceptional, but drinkable.

BridgePort Haymaker Extra Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BridgePort Brewing;Lemon-hay to start. A brilliant straw, yellowish white head.

BridgePort Haymaker Extra Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BridgePort Brewing;12oz bottle. Hazy dulled orange color. Soapy, patchy, off-white head. Respectable orange-citrus hop aroma. Medium bodied and quite mild, this is a pretty nice session beer. Low carbonation. Maybe a hint of lemony wheat. A little too tame.

Creemore Springs Traditional Pilsner;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);"Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #39. 473 ml can purchased somewhere in Ontario (July 2008), and consumed in a hotel room in Wisconsin or Minnesota, near Duluth (August 2009). Clear golden body with a frothy white head that sticks around for a bit...malty-sweet, just lightly grassy-hoppy aroma, fairly weak...pleasant, fairly full body, accent on the pale malts, and just a bit syrupy...not bitter, hoppy or dry enough in the end to save it, though it’s not horrible. I guess I’ll probably never get to try it again; doesn’t seem like it was a patch on their Premium Lager though, which I have had a few times and wouldn’t mind finding again."
Creemore Springs Traditional Pilsner;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Similar to the Lot 9 Pilsner. Very easy to drink with no aftertaste. Like every other Creemore product I have tried, this does not disappoint. MB
Creemore Springs Traditional Pilsner;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);A decent, solid Pilsner from a home brewery.

Creemore Springs Traditional Pilsner;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Like Hippy Hop -- the review below mine -- I’m always on the look out for a decent pilsner & am usually underwhelmed by what I find. This beer offers little hope on improving this sense of lost hope. Has that vitamin C absorbic acid flush that a good pils has but then it just falls flat. Meh.
Creemore Springs Traditional Pilsner;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Was pretty sure this wasn’t going to be the holy grail in my quest for a great pilsner, and it isn’t. Pour is dark gold with a small, quick-fading cap. Nose is virtually non-existent. Pale grain and....pale grain? Taste is clean, light cereal with a slightly bitter/spicy finish. Passable pils.
Creemore Springs Traditional Pilsner;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);"Pilsners have never excited me. Preferable to a Pale Lager but not by much. There just doesn’t seem to be a depth of flavour. some of the better ones from Europe or NA micros are okay, but really only okay. This is a clean yellowish gold, a frothing white head makes for a pretty appearance. The looks soon fade away and give rise to a mediocre beer that tastes and smells of fairly tame cereal graininess, corn and very mild spiciness. The texture seems a but ""meh"" as this just sort of vanishes down the throat without notice."
Creemore Springs Traditional Pilsner;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Can. Clear gold pour with a medium white head.

Goose Island Wrigley Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Wrigleyville. Had this after freezing and leaving early from a late May Cubs-Sox game. Despite rating this a little lower than the La Deuxieme I had before it, I enjoyed this more. Easy drinking but with flavor. An excellent session ale at only 5.0%. Moderate hop profile invites you to keep them coming. Slightly hazy amber body. Excellent lace.
Odell Bowsers Bitter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Odell Brewing Company;Odell Small Batch Festival. Copper, thin head, low carbonation. Candy aroma, floral, soft.

Odell Lager Ale Hybrid;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Odell Brewing Company;Odell Small Batch Fest. Yellow, thin head, clear with lots of carbonation. Light sour aroma, lots of tangy and pungent hops. Smells IPA. Taste is certainly lager- bitter, minerals, german malts. Light sour finish. Palate pretty soft, but needs to have much less carbonation. Late fruitiness. Interesting.
Sherwood Asylum Amber;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sherwood Brewing Company;Growler.. the more the merrier for this beer. Aroma is sweet. Every time I bring it to my nose I get a whiff of honey. Appearance is nothing out of the ordinary for an amber ale. Caramel color that is translucent. Taste is nice.. real nice! Of course this is coming from someone who likes a big hop profile, and this one’s got it. Medium to light body, goes down smooth with big hops following through at the end. This beer goes great with a nice, spicy burger (Burgatory, anyone?).

Grafschafter Schwarzhaferbier;Nordhorn, Lower Saxony, Germany;Specialty Grain - Other;Grafschafter Brauhaus;Probably the best seasonal beer this local brewery has come up with. Brown/amber coloring. Nice taste of roasted grain, only slightly hoppy. Starts sweetish and leaves a soft sour mouthfeel afterwards. Very drinkable, does however only have moderate body. A bit less watery texture would have made this beer quite a blast. Nevertheless a fine Schwarzhafer from tap (only).

Victory Abbey 6;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"(Old BA rate - tap) Poured with a thin pure white bubblier looking head. Coppery color, that it is a bit more like a Belgian pale ale, etc. Sweetish maltiness at first; unripe apple and grape aromas; fresh and a bit herbal. All things were a bit muted, though. Tart and just a bit sour; grape flavors; a bit yeasty; and pretty refreshing. Thinner MF, but still had a more substantial body. Snappy carbonation. Good drinkability for me, refreshing brew and there were enough interesting flavors to keep me interested."
Victory Abbey 6;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Draft. Pours an orange body with a white head. Fruity esters peach, citrus, and some wheat notes. Apple and malt with a medium mouth feel and a light spiced finish. Nice session ale.
Victory Abbey 6;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);TAP: gold pour, no head. Coriander on the nose, same on taste, thin body. Tastes metallic.

(3+) Aroma is surprisingly mild, touches of dry malt. (6+) Flavour is similar, pleasant dry malt, lightly alcoholic finish. Toasty malt touches. Modest malty base. Average plus palate. (3+) Enjoyably quaffable, but relatively mild and fails to wow in a crowd of much bolder beers. Still, I could seeing drinking a few of these in an evening quite happily.

Grumpy Troll Monk Sweat;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;"Draught sample at the brewpub, July 26th. This was billed as just ""Monk"" on my visit, and I suppose it’s possible that it’s a different beer. But my guess is that it just varies a bit from batch to batch - and name to name - not enough to warrant a new listing. At any rate, what I had poured a moderate to dark gold, rather hazy/oily, with virtually no head...nose is fairly alcohol and sweet, a bit of that candy sugar perhaps, little of that yeasty Belgian character I’d expect...and the same is true in the body, which is very sweet, syrupy, and fairly harsh; boozy and cloying, with an off vegetal finish. Pretty terrible, but thankfully the worst sample we had."

Grumpy Troll Curly Scotch Ale;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Tap at the brewpub - Pours hazy amber with a frothy off-white head. Smells fruity, with lemon and honey on top of a sweet, malty base. It’s a bit too much, and comes off as a bit cloying. Taste is lots of bready malt with a bit of nuttiness. Finish is kind of flat and minerally, with a slight smokiness. Really carbonated and biting, which made it hard to pull flavors out initially. It warmed up a bit and the carbonation eased off and became a lot softer. Overall, however, this one was just flat and uninspired.
Grumpy Troll Curly Scotch Ale;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy amber color with thin white head that leaves chunks of lace here and there. Aroma is rich, sugary malt with a tiny touch of molasses. Flavor is malty, sugary, a touch of molasses, a little bit of dry grain following up, and very modest hop bitterness. I didn’t detect much of the smoke they talk about in the commercial description, which is unusual because smokey flavors usually hit me like a freight train. So I don’t consider it a loss that the smoke was basically absent. Palate is thick but a little flat. Nice, drinkable.
Grumpy Troll Curly Scotch Ale;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Unfiltered amber-brown color. Smooth malty aroma.

Grumpy Troll Curly Scotch Ale;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;This was my second selection and i thought it was great. Not as overwhelmingly smoky as some scotch ales i have tried but the flavor was definitely there. The apprerance was nice with a thick head and full mouth feel. A good example of the style, even more enjoyable that some because the brewer does not go overboard on the peat.
Grumpy Troll Curly Scotch Ale;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;On tap at the brewpub 7/31/09: Pours a transparent bright copper amber with a thin, wispy lacing white head. Aroma of sweet toasty caramel malt with some light piny hop character. Starts with good fullness and sweet caramely maltiness before a slightly drier bittersweet and crisp finish. An enjoyable Scotch ale, but could use a little more peaty character.

Grumpy Troll Spetsnaz Export Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;"Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #89. Draught sample at the brewpub, mid-August 2008. Interesting that they had both this and the ""regular"", non-bourbonized version on tap at the same time. Anyway in this case the bourbon does no favors; the stable head on the regular Spetsnaz is replaced by a quick-dying one here, the body seeming just as inky and opaque but thinner...nose is all bourbon, perhaps some raisiny-grapy notes are in there but they’re pretty hard to find...body is also boozy and vinous, very sweet, though it does dry out and some toasty malts come in for a nice finish. Ehh, in the end it’s not bad but definitely simpler and less interesting than the ""regular"" version."

Nice malty brown ale aroma with espresso hints.

Bristol Old No. 23 Port Barrel Aged Barley Wine;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bristol Brewing Company;Tried the 2016 and 2017 side by side, there were some noticeable differences but they were both delicious.

Full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. I haven’t historically been a fan of the Old No. 23, so I didn’t have high hopes, but this was pretty darned good. Looks like it picked up some wild yeast in the barrel too...it’s light but adds an extra dimension. Guess it’s about time to re-rate the regular 23.

Good job.
Great Waters Holy Hand Grenade IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Love the cask conditioned IPA. In my area, it is a hard find. Had one before a concert at Xcel Center. It was nice hop-balanced IPA that was held up with enough malt. Because of the time of year, the temperature (52°) of a cask-conditioned prevented me from having any more.

A bit of a sour grain nose, whiffs of rye, wheat, sourdough… stenchy, sweaty hops as well... quite nice though, almost some sour lactic yeast qualities as well… just a really strange aroma but nice – smells like a harvest, like fresh cut crops. More sour grains and rye tastes, starchy and parched palate, with some old fruit – old oranges – and dough and a nice rough, grainy hop pellet bitterness. Very good after a whole pint, I definitely warmed up to this one, and it’s unique and tasty.

Cheers to that! I was just swinging by to grab a growler. Not anymore. Pours a clean, shiny golden pour, plenty of carb, a decent amount of active fizz head. A cornish grain on the nose, which had me worried, but the flavor on this blows away all expectations from an international pale lager. Barely a corn grain, a slight sweet malt.

Starts with sweet apple, banana and oak flavors as well as having a rich full body and boozy mouthfeel. Finishes smooth with brandy and vanilla flavors as well as a good dose of warming booze. Really nice, but hard to tell if it’s a tripel.
Captain Lawrence Golden Delicious;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;On tap at Man in the Moon. Golden with a white head. Sweet with fruit, yeast, some esters and oak. The body was full and the finish with warming alcohol.
Captain Lawrence Golden Delicious;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Clear deep golden with a thin foamy white head. Nice boozy full golden malt aroma that’s semisweet with tones of apple and brandy. Smooth full warming flavor that’s boozy, apple fruity, spirited like brandy or light whiskey, with a golden malty sweet finish.
Captain Lawrence Golden Delicious;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;On tap at Randolph Williamsburg. Pours gold. Brandy, boozy, orange peel, banana, boozy heat to finish. Medium body. Better than those notes imply.

Captain Lawrence Golden Delicious;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;16 oz single can from Two Angels Liquors. Golden to light orange colored appearance with slight haze and a white head. Aroma of apple pie, tropical fruit, fruity esters, toasted malt and light herbal/floral notes.

Captain Lawrence Golden Delicious;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Pours clear pale golden with a one finger, white head. Aroma is apples, brandy, raisins and light hops. Taste is apple and light caramel, moving strong hop backbone. Finish is hoppy. This is a hops lovers tripel.
Captain Lawrence Golden Delicious;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Some of my favorite stouts are aged in brandy barrels, so I was really looking forward to trying this beer. I don’t think this Belgian ale holds up as well to the barrel as stouts do. Most of what might’ve made the beer distinct is lost in the boozy swell of the brandy character. This beer pours golden yellow in color with very little foam. The aroma is a little bit of cracker malt, but mostly just boozy notes from the brandy barrel. Those brandy notes dominate the flavor. There isn’t much else to say about it. It doesn’t taste bad if you like apple brandy. but I was hoping for a beer that would impart the barrel without completely surrendering to it.
Captain Lawrence Golden Delicious;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;2018 edition, now 11%. $4.75 pint can, Beer Run. Pours slightly hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma is fresh cut flowers, apple cider, barrel, yeast. Flavor is apple brandy - very boozy tasting, along with barrel, yeast, cider, green grapes, earth, licorice.

Kuhnhenn Tenacious Cassis;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2015 vintage. Pours hazy dark ruby red, light copper/brown color with a 1 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big juicy/tart/tangy red currants, fruit skin/seeds, raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, red apple, red grape/wine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted biscuit, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of molasses, vanilla, cocoa, smoke, leather, tobacco, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of currants, fruity yeast, dark/bready/light roasted malts, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with big strength. Taste of huge juicy/tart/tangy red currants, fruit skin/seeds, raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, red apple, red grape/wine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted biscuit, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of molasses, vanilla, cocoa, smoke, leather, tobacco, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness; and fruit tang/tartness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart/tangy currants, fruit skin/seeds, raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, red apple, red grape/wine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted biscuit, brown bread/crust, molasses, vanilla, cocoa, smoke, leather, tobacco, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of currants, fruity yeast, dark/bready/light roasted malts, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness, and tart/tangy fruit balance; with no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and tart/tangy fruit. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, fairly sticky/acidic/tangy/tannic, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol for 16.5%. Overall this is an amazing fruited old ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of currants, fruity yeast, dark/bready/light roasted malts, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the huge ABV, with the mellowly bitter/tart/tangy/drying finish. Amazingly soft feel for the big ABV. Perfectly balanced between jammy currants, fruity yeast, and rich dark/bready malt complexity; with nice earthy hop presence. Light residual sweet with lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing style example as expected. Never had the base beer; but this is perfectly balanced between old ale and fruit character."

Port Townsend RyPA;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;IPA;Port Townsend Brewing Company;Murky brown pour, really nice tan head and some lace. A nice looking beer. Nose is full of problems. Butter, a little buggy, there is rye and some floral hops. But this is a mess. A little tart, buttery, buggy, vegetal.

Bready, lightly sweet-fruity nose. Not much rye sourness happening here. Medium body, carb is tangible, almost firm, but not intrusive. Nice sour bready rye blasts right off the attack and carries through the mid-palate and the finish. Finishes clean with some lightly peppery hop. Tasty stuff. I’ll definitely seek this out again.

Water Street Mayor McPriors Irish Stout;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Water Street Brewing and Alehouse;Pretty close to black. Lots of black notes - mainly dark chocolate with some coffee and wood. Hoppy and quite roasty as well. The body, though, is quite thin.

Heads Up Abbey Tripel;Silverdale, Washington, United States;Tripel;Heads Up Brewing Company;Hazy golden. Big estery aroma with light florals, bready pale malt and firm alcohol all in a nice balance. Pretty enticing nose, all told. Flavour doesn’t really live up...it’s somewhat fuselly, getting into harsh gasoline country the warmer it gets. There’s still plenty of rich bready malt and peppery alcohol notes...this is what you get in the finish so that bit’s nice. But the middle is problematic.
Heads Up Anisenystigmus Imperial IPA;Silverdale, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Heads Up Brewing Company;Flat-looking hazy dull amber...certainly not an attractive beer. Big fennel/anise aroma. They used a bunch of different parts of the anise plant in this one. Flavourwise, it’s a whallop of anisey, fennelly notes. Light alcohol shows through a bit, as do some faint caramel malt notes. This aged bottle actually comes off a bit oxidized, and certainly unbalanced...I’m getting almost nothing but anise, not even hops.
Heads Up Perverted Immoral;Silverdale, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Heads Up Brewing Company;(12oz bottle) Sampled at the Post-post-Great Canadian Beer Festival 2007 in Victoria on September 9th, 2007. Courtesy of Oakes. Thin yellow head with dissipating to the edges and deep mahogany body. Nose of raisins, puree apricots, marshmellow. Fruity and DAMN malty. Lasting tart finish and mellow warm malt. Very good.
Heads Up Perverted Immoral;Silverdale, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Heads Up Brewing Company;Dark brown body. The head dies quickly - it’s a superheavyweight after all. Quite an interesting juxtaposition of light fruit esters (peach, apple) and dark malts (demerera, caramel). Oily, slight, and very sugary. Dark date and plum character towards the finish. Nice, sweet, interesting strong brew.
Heads Up Bourbon Barley Wine;Silverdale, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Heads Up Brewing Company;Maple syrup, marzipan and alcohol blend nicely in the nose. Clear brown body is topped by a shy, tan, fully diminishing head. Sherry, bubblegum, maple syrup, marzipan and bourbon flavours don’t marry all that well. Alcohol is strong in the aftertaste. Overly sweet and bourbon lingers. Medium body with fair to moderate carbonation. If the carbonation lasted longer it would likely taste and look better. Bottle sampled at Oakes’ Xmas tasting 2007.
Heads Up Bourbon Barley Wine;Silverdale, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Heads Up Brewing Company;(Bottle) Sampled at Oakes 2007 Christmas party. Deep ginger brown colour with dissipating white head. Great raisin and fig malt. Flavour of strong honey with undertones of alcoholic gueuze. Tangy finish.
Heads Up Bourbon Barley Wine;Silverdale, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Heads Up Brewing Company;Flat medium brown shade color, extremely fragrant with sweet smells permeating of bourbon and sugars. A bit dissapointing at first sip but rounds out nicely. Low suds which allows for the true flavor to be tasted.
Heads Up Bourbon Barley Wine;Silverdale, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Heads Up Brewing Company;Pours really cloudy, hazy, with smelly yeast and alcohol. Molasses, super sugary too like flan. Thin mouthfeel. Reminds me a lot of maple syrup turned into alcohol. Reminiscent of sweet alcohols like brandy or sherry. Not all that much carbonation.
Heads Up Bourbon Barley Wine;Silverdale, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Heads Up Brewing Company;Re-rate showed a beauty Buffalo Trace-ish nose. Flavour was more balanced...still very sweet but less maple and more vanilla and rich malt character. Slight score upgrade. Dull brown colour. Nice legs. Pear, brown sugar, nuts on the nose. Flavour takes a left turn and goes totally maple...just massively so. Chewy malts back this up. So much maple they could sell this at the souvenir shop at Pearson Int’l.
Heads Up Flagship IPA;Silverdale, Washington, United States;IPA;Heads Up Brewing Company;Hazy orange with a thin white head. Dull citrusy hop aroma. Light to medium bodied smooth a crisp ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Heads Up Flagship IPA;Silverdale, Washington, United States;IPA;Heads Up Brewing Company;Served in a standard pint glass, Carolina's Flagship IPA pours a medium amber with golden highlights. No head forms, but there is a spattering of white bubbles that occasionally coagulate and form a widely-spaced surface covering. Aromas of bright citrus and sweet, lightly roasted malts waft up from the brew with each sniff. The finish is full of malts and hops, and a nice bread-like character makes it quite fulfilling. This breadiness and hops makes up most of the aftertaste. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Heads Up Flagship IPA;Silverdale, Washington, United States;IPA;Heads Up Brewing Company;An English style with a malty character. Pours a nice clear amber with a big head.

Heads Up Sour Brown;Silverdale, Washington, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Heads Up Brewing Company;Hazy brown colour. Sweet (corn oil) aroma and vague lactic taste. A little sweetness kicks back into the finish, but again it’s sort of corn oily.

Bend Maibock;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bend Brewing Company;Tap at Bend Brewing Co, Bend, 23/05/13. Clear golden with a thin off white head. Nose is malt, grain, light spice, touch of fruit. Taste comprises caramel, biscuit, bread, dark fruits, light spice. Medium bodied, fine carbonation. Drinkable but pretty average, lacks depth in the flavour that a decent heller bock should carry.
Bend Maibock;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bend Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Dark orange pour with a medium creamy white head that diminishes steadily. Small patches of lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty with some pungent hops in the background. Medium body with flavors of earthy hops, sweet malt and fruit.

Bend Maibock;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bend Brewing Company;On tap at Bailey’s Taproom in Portland, OR--Poured a deep amber body with a medium to small whitish head. Nose of sweet malt resembling some dark fruits balanced with a sharp hops presence. Pears, prunes, and raisins come to mind.

Bend Maibock;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bend Brewing Company;Draft at the Brewpub: Pours orange with a smaller white head and good lacing.

Big Horn Snake Thumper Red Ale;Boise, Idaho, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Big Horn Brewing Boise (The Ram);Draft: Pours a cloudy reddish orange with a moderate white head and good lacing. Nose is light of malt, citrus, and floral tones. The taste is malty sweetness up front, with citrus and floral hops in the tail. Nice, lingering hops bitters in the trailer. Not bad, but Jordan is right on by only having one pint.
Big Horn Snake Thumper Red Ale;Boise, Idaho, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Big Horn Brewing Boise (The Ram);"Tap @ Meridian Location: Ruby mahogany hue with an average looking head and lacing. Served in a super thick frozen solid mug, like 1/2"" thick, so it took about 30 minutes of watching PAC10 whatevers on the big screen while gripping the mug with an iron grip, to finally get it to warm up to temperature. It doesn’t help that they have 2 sizes available and both are larger than a pint. Digressing, fruity hop nose, light caramel malts and some roast, but very little. The flavor is balanced, a bit more toward an amber ale than a red, but i can’t fault them for that. It’s tasty and drinkable, but by because of an almost ethereal and intangible rule in the beer world for brewers in this category, it still comes across thin for the style. Finishes average. Howdy hum, howdy ho, another pint? Fuckin A no."
Monterey Coast India Pale Ale;Salinas, California, United States;IPA;Monterey Coast Brewing Restaurant & Brewery;Not good either - disgusting. Had this as part of a flight at Monterey Coast Brewing in Salinas, CA.
Monterey Coast India Pale Ale;Salinas, California, United States;IPA;Monterey Coast Brewing Restaurant & Brewery;"""If not for the heavier body, I’d have thought they mixed up the pale and IPA.

Urine, berries, herbs, and grass with a sweet caramel and bread malt base. Blech. The flavor is not much better. Quite grassy with a strange herbal quality and lots of berries. Juniper notes, a little bit of pine bitterness, and lots of caramel sweetness.
Monterey Coast India Pale Ale;Salinas, California, United States;IPA;Monterey Coast Brewing Restaurant & Brewery;"Tap at the brewery earlier this month. Served in a pint glass full to the rim with absolutely no head. No bubbles. Aroma is barely there with some slight pine if anything. Taste, bland malt forward, simcoe hops in the front but nothing that stands out. The lack of carbonation is a big off putting element. Asked if there was a problem with the carbonation was told, ""No, this is the way we intend it to be served."" So if you like flat, malty, IPA, this is for you!"
Monterey Coast India Pale Ale;Salinas, California, United States;IPA;Monterey Coast Brewing Restaurant & Brewery;Tap. Pours clear buttery amber with a small white head and some lacing.

St. Stans Maibock;Modesto, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;St. Stans Brewing Company;While this definitely wasn’t the worst beer on tap at the brewery, this wasn’t really anything to get excited over. An aroma with fruity esters, light spice and a slight funkiness that I assume was from bad tap lines. Appearance was a dark orangish/red, cloudy with absolutely no head at all. I even tried numberous times to stir one up, but no luck. Mouthfeel was watery. Flavor was light fruits, some bubblegum, boiled veggies, with that odd funkyness rearing it’s head again. I struggled to make it through a pint of this. Ugh.

Amicas Green Chile Ale;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;Clear light golden, no head. Nose of an assortment of fresh chiles. The flavor is crisp and semi light with a blonde ale backbone, but then a spicy wave of fresh chiles kicks in, with a wonderful roasted undertone, and a bit of capcasin heat.

Flavor Profile Has A Malty Sweetness With A Muddled Pepper Spice. The Anaheim I More Dominant Than Any Actual Green Chile Flavor. A Promising Beer, But A Let Down Overall.
Amicas Green Chile Ale;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;Had as accompaniment to the pizza. The strong chili taste makes me want more right after finishing. Love this beer. Might be too spicy for some palates.
Amicas Green Chile Ale;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;Sort of a greenish tint to this light yellow beer (could be my imagination). Aroma is fresh chili heat, with less roasted notes than expected. Imposed over a sweetish, uncomplicated malt background. Flavor is sweet with some fresh pepper bite, but again, little detectable roastiness. Fairly spicy/hot, but not distractingly so. This comes across as some peppers thrown into a simple golden ale. Not bad to drink, but also not terribly interesting.
Amicas Green Chile Ale;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;22oz bomber shared by Tim. Awesome and simple beer. Aroma is strong peppers in your nose, just the way I like it. The flavor was much more restrained, not hot in the throat like I would like. Very simple basic lager and the peppers really died down. But the nose is fantastic. I could sniff it for a long time. Thanks Tim.
Amicas Green Chile Ale;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;22 oz bottle purchased at Dillon Ridge Liquor in Dillon, Colorado. Pour is a light haze golden, with a smallish white head. Aroma is bright fresh clean green pepper with a bit of spicy hot pepper. Really smells like Anaheim, fresh and clean. The nose is mostly the peppers, not a whole bunch else. Taste is the peppers on top of a very simple toasted malt base. The peppers give a nice bright heat, then fade smoothly. Nice integration of the heat and vegetable of the pepper. As it warms, get a bit of a buttery finish, though does not detract too much from the pepper. Palate is light to medium bodied, un filtered mouth feel. This beer was all about the peppers, and it did that well.
Amicas Green Chile Ale;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;Bomber from brewpub. Pours hazy yellow with a swiftly disappearing head. Super carbonated. Nose is full of green chiles and grass. Taste is pretty one dimensional, with the chiles hitting the palate softly at first, then giving a bit of a sting on the way down. Very carbonated and light body. Not a bad beer for what it is and will go well with the stir fry that’s on the stove now.
Amicas Green Chile Ale;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;Bomber pours hazy golden/orange with small white head.

Amicas Green Chile Ale;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;I’ve had this one on draft on the pub but most recently from a bottle brought back from CO. either way, it’s a light straw color with an average-sized white head and fine carbonation. aroma is intense, vibrant green chile with a slight grassy note as well as a hint of wheat/graham, the taste tends to chile as a top note but there’s a solid malt backing underneath that. this is one of the best chile beers I’ve had, and pairs great (not surprisingly) with chili and cornbread.

Lost Coast Cherry Lager;Eureka, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;Lost Coast is good with fruit beers and this one is no exception. On draft, it came a nice light cloudy gold color with a light purple tinge with an off-white head. Looked much like a hefe in the glass. Moderate lacing in my pint glass. Nose of cherry. Mouthfeel was very smooth and refreshing. Flavor was of cherries also, with a little vanilla malt taste. Finish was very light. For a fruit beer this is very laid back, and remarkably refreshing for the type probably because unlike a lot of this style it is not too sweet. I took home a growler and will sample again tomorrow.

Saverne Top Budget Beer;Saverne, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbräu (Karlsberg);"If there’s one thing as a beer connoisseur I enjoy, there’s nothing else in this world I find more appealing than a beer with ""budget"" in its name! So I buy this thing and chill it for a day, and it pours just okay - some head, some bubbling, okay yellowish colour. Smells vaguely like wet bread and carbonation, but honestly not a whole lot of aroma going on here. Same with the taste-it’s like carbonated water with a lemon twist. Okay breadiness. Very weak taste, but mayhaps that’s what you want, as at 4.2% alcohol it can work well as a ""getting drunk"" cheap lager. It won’t work as an enjoyable experience, however."

Steinacher Ankerla Bock;Steinach, Thuringia, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ankerbräu Steinach;"Golden color. The aroma is quite ordinary, with the classic light cereals. The flavor is better, with a good balance of malt, sweetness and bitterness (actually higher than the average, in Germany); even if not much alcoholic, there is some quite alcohol warmth; good bitterness level, and the finish is quite long. Sweet Bock, good."

Würzig-pikante Aromen von Brotkruste, Toastbrot, gerösteten Nüssen und Bayrisch Blockmalz. Gut rezent, weiches Mundgefühl. Im Abgang kräftig hopfenwürzige, etwas holzige Herbe; recht trocken. Trockener, holzig bitterer Nachtrunk. - Recht eigenwilliges aber außerordentlich aromatisches Bier, nicht so glatt und harmlos-gefällig wie viele Dunkle. Der Hopfen agiert hier nicht nur im Hintergrund und zur Abrundung, sondern gestaltet den Charakter des Bieres unverkennbar mit. Wer sich an der leicht muffigen Geruchsnote nicht stört, kann hier ein wirklich interessantes Bier kennenlernen. Sehr empfehlenswert!"

Dry nose, some chalk, going over in dried apples & applerind aromas. Sweet, with of course apples, but also a pinch of ginger, lemonpeel and raw potato rind, finishing earthy. Quite empty palate, fizzy MF, too sweet to be refreshing. It’s obviously an ""easy drinker"". The Bio certificate is a plus, but it’s not really a good cider. Bit kiddies’ drink profile."

A slightly clearer pale straw gold than the Blue Nile a milder coriander nose as well with some earthiness. Great filmy long-lasting head with excellent Belgian lace. Smooth med-light body. Much more malt forward than the other beers with some fruitiness & spiciness. Probably the best balanced of the three Nile beers.

Kizakura / Kyoto Bakushu White Nile;Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kizakura Sake Brewing Co. Ltd.;Bottle (rated in Apr 2008). Head is fully diminishing. Body is medium yellow.

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Kizakura / Kyoto Bakushu White Nile;Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kizakura Sake Brewing Co. Ltd.;Pale yellow and thin head. Light smell of lemon. Taste: Butter with some wheat and coriander light sweetness and some fruity feel. Aftertaste is thin with some banana feel. A little thin and plane overall but drinkable without any negative things to say.
Kizakura / Kyoto Bakushu White Nile;Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kizakura Sake Brewing Co. Ltd.;Aroma: At first whiff I immediately noted the aroma of sun-dried hay and the barnyard aroma characteristic of saisons. After spending a little more time with this brew, I also picked up the scent of lemon rind, resinous pine, and slight phenols. A few buttery notes snuck in as well. Appearance: This beer has an incredibly delicate and pale color and yet is topped with a persistent and foamy head. It almost has the appearance of a lager with the head of a hef. Lacing sticks to the glass here and there. Taste: Light buttery malts followed by faint earthy pine hops. A slight hef-funk finish rounds this beer out nicely. Mouthfeel: Slightly more carbonation than normal for a saison, but that’s not necessarily a disservice. It makes it seem more refreshing. Also, the taste really sticks with you. Overall: All around I think this is a pretty solid beer. It’s definitely very light for a saison and could use a little more yeasty funk to more appropriately represent the style, but on the other hand it’s a unique take on a saison that’s well done.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Laurens Lager;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On tap at RB – Yorktown. Poured clear bright golden with a short cap of white head. The aroma picked up dusty sweeter pale malt and bready notes with a touch of lemon and grass.. not very fragrant or interesting. The flavor was a little heavier with mostly pale malt at the core.. also a little honey paired with grass and wheaty bitterness on the edges.. dry finish with lemon, grass, and pale malty sweetness. Light-bodied with some odd sharpness and tartness on the palate.. dry and not very enjoyable finish. This wasn’t good.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Laurens Lager;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Note to my friend Drnk_McDermott - Demand your rights as a beer geek and make them give you an unfrosted mug!

The malts are sweet and bready and there’s a pleasant grassy bitterness that increases with consumption. Good warm weather brew. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL
Rock Bottom Yorktown Laurens Lager;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Mug Club draft. This was a special edition beer to raise funds for a foundation honoring an area resident (see RB’s page for details). This is based, I thought, on the Line Drive Light, but I detect no adjuncts here. Just a very light lager malt, just a touch of chewiness, and a well supported background of bittering hops. Served in their frosted mug, though, but it’s a very decent lawnmower beer. Hey, Cornfield, I do ask for an unfrosted mug... when I remember to.
Shed Carnival Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;"Draught pint at the brewpub, January 21 2007. Completely opaque black with no head whatsoever; well, it’s not on nitro anyway....fruity-chocolaty nose is interesting at first, with coconut seeming to form a principle component....later on caramel, weak coffee and some whisky-bourbon notes emerge.....on the tongue, similarly, a mishmash of flavors, not terribly well integrated, with a sweet/sour lactic quality growing in domination through the pint, burnt-chocolate/espresso notes overwhelming everything else at the finish, orangepeel hazily appearing and disappearing, and, unfortunately, the all-too-typical strong mineralic content of the water contributing to an overall grittiness in texture (as well as killing the head, I expect)....alcohol subtly apparent. Well, this one didn’t work though there’s some effort apparent."

Shed Shedwin Indian Brown Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;IPA;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub, January 21 2007. A small, diminishing off-white head tops the dark hazy brown body....reasonably fresh citric nose, orange and grapefruit burst forth with light caramelized malts in the background.....on the tongue it’s all acidic citrus, fresh and clean until the finish which is, like many Shed beers past and present, disfigured by the harsh mineralic qualities in the water though in this case the effect is muted somewhat....very light and effervescent body, strong prickly carbonation, quite bitter and dry at the finish but fruity acidity stays with you....pretty one-note but it’s a good one.

Zero Gravity Wilsons Plover;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;On tap at Flatbread. Opaque yellow orange with a thin white head. Earthy spicy with lots of clove and some light bready honey maltiness underneath. Decent but a little too much clove for my tastes.
Zero Gravity Wilsons Plover;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub, February 2007. It pours a hazy, bright gold-yellow with a bit of lasting head (damn these pint glasses!)....orangepeel is the first whiff, then white pepper, coriander and very vague hints of ginger show up to color the expressive, lightly earthy and pungent nose....very, very dry on the tongue, highly carbonated, chalky-mineralic towards the finish, very light dried orange husk notes....with a few minutes’ warmth, enough sweetness arrives at the finish to mute the dry earthy attack and keep the hardness in check...very well done, very authentic dry saison, though there’s nothing really exciting about it.

Uncle Billys IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;(Sample at Uncle Billy’s on August 2, 2008) Damn, that’s dark for an IPA! Deep mahogany red. Can’t see anything through it but barely a faint glow and a glisten of light. A light head remaining after all this time. As much hop aroma as the pale ale. I sink my tongue in… a little thick, more alcohol. Warmer, yep, more alcohol. As I exhale I detect something… musky-bitter. Just barely failing (in my opinion) of acceptable amongst the IPA norm. But why is it so dark??? Seems more malty with maybe more caramel than most IPAs. That may have something to do with the color. When IPAs cross-breed with brown ales, what do you call it? Brown chicken brown cow!
Uncle Billys IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;On tap. Poured a hazy golden-amber color with a moderate off-white head that left some nice lacing. Nice leafy hop aroma with pine resin and light citrus. Flavor was moderately bitter with a nice piny, sticky hoppiness and moderate citrus (grapefruit, orange) finish with a lingering hop bitterness. Tasted really fresh, and went very well with the habanero wings and chili fries.

Uncle Billys IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;From sampler (almost got a pint)- solid golden color, non transparent. Heavy aroma of hops, very nice.

Uncle Billys IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;Wonderful IPA. My facorite of the five beers that I tried, had to get a growler to bring more of this home.

Uncle Billys IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;Great beer...good aroma and flavor from the hops...good level of bitterness. Nice malt to back it up.

Uncle Billys IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;Amberish color, with a very hoppy smell and taste. A touch of sweetness, but I found this very similar to their pale ale, but a touch more bitter, perhaps. A nice strongly hopped IPA. I’d like to try this again now that I’m much fonder of IPAs than when I first rated this.
Uncle Billys IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;The only thing I can see going against the beers here so far are the silly names. At least this one was born with none. Deep amber or red color, nice full body and superb hopping. My crappy means of writing do few beers justice.

Uncle Billys Axe Handle Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft... Hazy golden ale with a small, creamy, white head. Decent retention. The bouquet offers pale grains and those signature Simcoe, earthy, cat-pissy aromatics. Medium to full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and modest carbonation.

Uncle Billys Haystack Hefeweizen;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;(Sample at Uncle Billy’s on August 2, 2008) Served with an orange wedge… at first sight this looks like grapefruit/orange juice. Solid, cloudy. I notice that none of these samples seem to have much head. After a good amount of citrus goodness goes straight up my nose (there I go again), I feel the full aroma. Spoiled by the orange, I remove it. I still smell the rind on my fingers. Suddenly every encounter I’ve ever had with an orange flashes through my mind. Its aroma is citric, nothing more really. It’s flavor, though… you can actually taste some hay (unless that’s all psychological), with serious orange and lemon. Not sure why they would add an orange wedge to intensify this. I think I’d be drinking orange juice if I had left it in. I dig the palate, though. Thick, well-constructed. Lively, but not carbonated, tangy. Tastes natural, alcoholically, of course. Really not that bad.
Uncle Billys Haystack Hefeweizen;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;"On tap at the brewpub; nice cloudy yellow color with an average white head.

Bold strong wheat flavor, accentuated by the fizz, but the taste is a little watery on the finish. Taste also has orange citrus flavor.

Batemans Gemini Double Trouble;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;This is one of Bateman’s ’Mystic Brews’, they are producing beers for various signs of the Zodiac during different times of the year. This beer was tasted at the bi-annual beer festival held at the brewery (May 2007). Hand pulled in the windmill, brewery bar. The pint sleeve glass had a dark amber beer with an off-white topped head, it looked good. The smell was most offputting, an almost fowl aroma of sulphur and farmyards almost made me take the beer back. Luckily the taste and mouthfeel made up for the aroma, a solid English bitter flavour, not a fantastic, must have another straight away sort of beer, but fine none-the-less.

Good thing these guys are so creative with their hops....pours totally opaque, unfiltered apricot-gold with just a bit of foam that lasts for a moment or two....the nose is gorgeously spicy-perfumy, with complex interactions of cardamom, lavender, cherry blossoms and pepper, really one of the most sublime aromas in a hoppy beer I’ve experienced....flavor is not quite as delightful but still top-notch, strongly hoppy-spicy-sharp throughout, lots of carroway/rye notes, light citrus (mostly grapefruit but a hint of lime as well), twiggy-barky towards the finish....moderate, very natural carbonation and quite full body. A delight, very easy to drink despite the complexity and sharpness.

Inveralmond Pale Ale;Perth, Perth and Kinross, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Inveralmond (Innis & Gunn);"Cask, Whey Pat Tavern Ale Festival, St Andrews. Note this is the ""internal"" version of the pale ale. Light amber, thin off-white head. Nose is slightly sherberty and bitter, not much to it. Mouth is better with bitterness, but some fruity goodness, reminded me of crab apples, hops and tannin. Palate ends very bitter, but quite smooth at the same time. One of those you don’t know you’re drinking so fast..."

Aroma of lemon, slight apple, a little pale malt and subtle spicy hops. Taste of lemon, some apple, slight pale malts, a hint of liquorice and subtle spicy hops. Light bodied and soft carbonation. A short, dry, spicy hop bitterness in the finish. Soft citrus but weird spicy hop notes. Some apple but not offputting. Ok.
Millstone Tiger Rut;Ashton-Under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Millstone Brewery;Cask @ The Salopian, Shrewsbury. Pours clearish gold, white head. Aroma is fruity, taste is jammy apricot and not what I’d consider typifies the Chinook hop, but it’s nice enough.

Fitgers Highway 61 Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours hazy yellow with nice fluffy white head, looked great in the glass. Aroma has notes of clove, banana, some bubblegum, sweet apricot and some pear.

Not much in hop bitterness but it has a dry aftertaste.
Fitgers Highway 61 Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at the brewpub. Clove and oyster platter aroma. Musky and mildly spiced. Sweet. Incredibly clouded deep gold, tinted in amber, with a perfectly white sharp head. Easily the most murky, clouded beer I’ve ever seen. Damn near milk. Flavor moves with a light gentle wheat oil grace, spritzy and full of banana peel and pulp. Gentle. A nip thin, but bringing stellar drinkability to the table. Finishes on a bite of almond skin, almost no hop presence. Clean, bright, and refreshingly. Quite enjoyable.
John Harvards Natural Mystic Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap at the Lake Grive location: Pours near black with a thin tan head. The aroma is decent, with a coffee-ish character. A bit thin bodied. The flavor has a roasty quality, however, there are some weird chemical-like flavors such as permanent marker. Some salty licorice notes, vinegar qualities with a somewhat vacant finish. Not a stand out Stout.

Well-crafted, moreish Dunkel.

Flossmoor Station Pullman X-IPA;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;A blend of Pullman Brown and X IPA served from a growler given to kp by Matt on DL Day. Pours a clear dark brown body with a thin, off-white head. Although there are hops in the aroma, they aren’t what I expect from either an IPA or an IIPA. Not enough bitterness for it to be any form of IPA, but too far from a Brown Ale to go that direction. Chocolate IPA.
Flossmoor Station Pullman X-IPA;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft at Flossmoor. Okay, so far this is a rate-able beer, so let’s pull out my memories of last month’s tasting: Pullman malts are very much there, in their molasses and leaf tobacco texture. Smell has the ""X’s"" hop nose. Totals up to a deep malt package with a counterpoint in heavy citrusy hops. Can go well for you if just try to get along."
Flossmoor Station Pullman X-IPA;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;This beer very much had the appearance of a brown ale but one whiff and you can tell it was mixed with an IPA. The very citrusy hop notes in the aroma make me very excited for actually sampling this brew. However, I felt the flavour was a let down. The first thing I thought was a chocolatey IPA. I really didn’t think the beers mixed well and probably would have prefered them by themselves. The brown ale undertones were good but the IPA thrown in gave it some strange characters and an odd balance which proved too hoppy and not well enough melded with the brown.
Flossmoor Station Pullman X-IPA;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;A blend of Pullman Brown and X IPA served from a growler given to kp by Matt around DL Day. Brown hued with a small frothy head and okay lacing. The aroma has a pronounced juicy fruit hop vapor along with with piney, clove, nutty, toffee and yeasty esters. WOW, that is hoppier than expected but still has great balance with a spicy finish layered over the base brown ale malts. There is some lingering acidity that added to the refreshment. The mouth feel is sharp and dry with a minor metallic note. I really dig it, what a strange brew but something he should really brew. We have hoppy Belgian Ales, why not hoppy Browns?
Sapporo Bitter & Sharp;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Can: Pours a golden pale color with light head, which goes down quick. A squalid nose with some light toast and a quickly disappointing hop and grassy chemical note. The flavor is sharp, not bitter or hoppy, just chemically and dry, lots of adjuncts and corn. Bah! Happoshu.
Sapporo Bitter & Sharp;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Another new macroswill from Sapporo.

Weyerbacher Twelve;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Bottle shared by RussianDragon. Turn back the clock. The beer is copper orange with a small off-white head. Light haze. Aromas include apples, brown sugar, yeast, oranges, butterscotch. Sweet and syrupy with prominent honey character. Thick on the palate with low carbonation. Alcohol presence is tamed by time but the beer is still a bit of a chore. Best shared many ways.

Weyerbacher Twelve;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Obviously well aged bottle at this point - murky brown, thought not totally opaque pour with the thinnest of off-white heads that leaves a lasting ring at the edges of the glass. Aroma is malt, honey, brown sugar, hint of booze - somewhat faint...very sweet! Flavor is quite good - lots of honey, some sweet malt, lightly hopped, some booze at the end. Very little hint of the rye remaining, which is disappointing, but perusing some earlier reviews, I think this may have benefited nicely from the age. Palate is moderately thick, oily, light carbonation, slight burn on finish. Not a half bad beer...definitely better than the ratings had me expecting before open.
Weyerbacher Twelve;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Aged 5+ years. I enjoyed this quite a bit, the beer was well integrated with a faint cherry sourness offsetting the thick, somewhat spicy brew. Nice warm finish.

Quite lively CO2. Tasty and refreshing. (0,5 l bottle, best before 17.07.2014)
Empire Moonrakers;Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Empire Brewing Co.;Third, gravicask, shared with Finn at Twickenham Beer and Cider Festival. Almost naked surface, black in the glass, spotty lacing. Earthy malts on the nose. Moderate taste of earthy chocolate malts. Roasted, mid-sweet finish. Okay mild. (24.10.2019).
Kilderkin Double;Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Dubbel;Kilderkin;Bottle: sell-by 1.02.08, drunk two weeks past this. Pours near black with a healthy white head. Superb full mouth filling beer, fully malty texture, and the richness of a real secondary fermentation. A fair amount of yeast in bottom cm of bottle, rather than the inert window dressing of most Belgian equivalents. Flavour is full-on chocolatey pleasure, hints of earthy smokyness.I think this is a better beer than any Belgian dubbel, but it is at the same time not a Belgian dubbel style. This is an authentic version of something else. Porter? I’m of the opinion that the Belgian industry in general, especially ’Abbey’ beers is in a crisis of poor quality, and it is a shame to yoke this fine beer to that declining industry. OK, I except Graal Dubbel from this criticism, and I’m sure there are more. 3 Horne Dobbelaer from NL is great too. Damn! My thesis is being spoiled. Nice one though, Kilderkin.
Kilderkin Double;Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Dubbel;Kilderkin;A very good example of a Belgian style abbey ale. Rich, malty and slightly sweet. Nice.
Kilderkin Double;Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Dubbel;Kilderkin;Bottle at ronnies, bottle conditoned. Aroma is spicey, chocolate malt, sweetish, good yeasty character. Taste is similar, however noteably maltier, bready, biscuity and choc malt.
Kilderkin Double;Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Dubbel;Kilderkin;Black with no head. Aromas of tar and roasted hops with winter fruit, sugars and liquorice. In fact, very much like TCP! Quite watery, only slightly bitter. Rich and sweet.
Kilderkin Double;Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Dubbel;Kilderkin;Cask conditioned - handpump - Cambridge BF. Now here’s a thing. A British brewery trying Belgian styles and being pretty true to style too. Long live Kilderkin Brewery and let’s hope a new wave of British breweries might be spawned in their shadow. This is a black coloured beer with hints of a whitish head. The aroma is malty with chocolate and licquorice notes. Necessarily sweet. The taste is rich and has all the attributes of the aroma together with some yeasty notes. Very good and so refreshing for an English brewer.
Seidr Dai Blakeney Red SV (Draught);Cardiff, Wales;Perry;Seidr Dai;From the barrel - Cambridge BF. A cloudy light orangey green coloured perry. The aroma is crisp and inviting with good pears. Pretty sweet on the nose. The taste is nice and fruity. Good sweetish pears. Very easy to drink, and nice tasty flavours.

Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak (Bourbon Barrel);Elmsford, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;From Mar 2008 I got this in a trade with nutbrown. Thanks Alan! Batch 1: It pours a near pitch black with some reddish hues and a 2 finger head of billowy tannish foam. Nice lacing. Very good head retention. The smell has notes of bourbon and a strong sour nose that reminds me of a american wild ale. I also get a little vanilla. Not exactly what I was expecting, or was I? The taste has some bourbon, some vanilla, some good woodiness, a touch of chocolate, and strong sour notes. The sour, imo, is just a tad too strong here and does seem to dominate but it certainly is, for me, an easy drinking Porter. I can't say that I detect much of the smoke....some day, I would love to try the version that isn't barrel aged just to see how it compares. The mouthfeel is medium-light, the carbonation is fairly robust, and it finishes with a nice taste of that bourbon. Like I said before, it's easy drinking so I'd guess the abv would be in the ~6%abv range. All in all, I like this offering from Captain Lawrence, as I did the rum barrel aged version. Very interesting flavours and pretty darned palate pleasing.
Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak (Bourbon Barrel);Elmsford, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Bottle shared with Anker. Nice pitch black body with a nice steady mocca colored head. The aroma is roasted with some deep ripe fruity and acidic notes mixed with oak and smoke. Quite sweet sourish and bitter roasted flavor. Smoked wood and light vanilla from the bourbon. Very nice.
Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak (Bourbon Barrel);Elmsford, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Old noted from 2010 - batch 2. Appears a deep dark cola color with a tan head than goes to a ring with some lacing. The smell is sour, dark fruit and wood. The taste is grapes, sour tartness with dry wood in the middle ending with a dry finish. Very carbonated. Overall pretty impressive beer.
Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak (Bourbon Barrel);Elmsford, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;750ml. Smoke tinged.oily, sour Porter, this is a great beer. Lots of depth. World Class beer all the way, this is just excellent. Vinous sour tones more than balance out the dark malt tones. I love the sour black ale style, and this one nails it. Awesome stuff.

Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak (Bourbon Barrel);Elmsford, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Bottle from Batch 1 courtesy of mcallister, thanks for the opportunity. Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a huge off white head that fills half the glass and takes forever to recede. The aroma holds some roast and chocolate with a solid hit of bourbon and oak and a curious fruity tartness. The flavor follows the aroma with the sour cherries and lemons taking over the lead role and just about obscuring the porter that was once in this bottle. Medium body with a ludicrous amount of carbonation and an tart ashy bubbly mouthfeel. This beer is a shell of its former self. Some wild yeast have gotten into the bottle and turned this beer, or maybe I just sat on the bottle for too many years.
Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak (Bourbon Barrel);Elmsford, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Bottle Batches 01 & 02 courtesy of Max at Kramer’s Campground Brewdown 2012. Both pour a deep brownish body with light fizz. Aroma on Batch 01is musky, oaky, bourbon and chocolate, while Batch 02 has a much more pronounced sour acidity present. Mouthfeel is similar on both - medium to thin with notes of bourbon, oak, chocolate, and molasses. However, the flavor of Batch 02 is completely different - veering much more into a dark sour ale with notes of tart acidity, light oak, bourbon, wine barrel, chocolate and spice. Both very solid beers. Batch 01: 3.9, Batch 02: 4.1.
Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak (Bourbon Barrel);Elmsford, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;All four variants of Smoke From The Oak served side by side at my tasting on May 29, 2010. Thanks to Pete, Chris, and Brad for supplying the bottles. Review is from notes. This beer is a dark brown color. It has a decent sized head that fades quickly leaving very little lacing. Aromas are smoke, oak (go figure), and bourbon. The flavor is pretty nice. This was my second favorite of the four bottles. This particular variant was the most sour of the four bottles. There is some noticeable heat in the finish. Although, I would drink this again, I wasn’t especially impressed by any of the Smoke From The Oak lineup.
Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak (Bourbon Barrel);Elmsford, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;(Bottle) Pours black with brown edges. Small, light brown head. The aroma is sourish with buttery and woodsy bourbon. Light fruity and smoky undertones. Hints of dust and light horse blanket. The roast and the fruitiness play well together.

Dark brown/black color with a huge never ending tan head. Aromas of tart cherry with hints of chocolate and dark sugary rum notes. A hint of oxidation and a touch of earth. The flavor is tart with a lactic twang. Fleeting caramel and roasted notes with a bit of woody vanillin round out the flavor. Light body with a bubbly tart mouthfeel, and a moderate to high level of carbonation. Infected, but not horrible to drink.

Muskie Capital Double Honey Maibock;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Muskie Capital Brewery;"Small pour (approximately 3 oz.), on tap at Gitchee Gumee Brewfest in Superior, WI on 4-5-08. This was the eighth of 12 beers that I rated (out of about 20 total beers that I tried). Called ""Muskie Capital Honey Double Maibock"" at the festival. This should be listed as a doppelbock instead of a heller bock. Pours a hazy to cloudy dark gold to light amber color. Short-lasting beige head. Sweet, classic heller bock smell; tart, honeyish, almost sour aroma. Sweet, honey taste. Alcohol noticeable in the flavor. Too sweet for my taste. Medium body. Smooth in the palate."
Muskie Capital Double Honey Maibock;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Muskie Capital Brewery;"Somehow this brewery’s location in Hayward put the words of ""touristy"" and ""novelty"" in my mind rather than ""brewing credentials"" before I sampled this particular beer. I was brought in by the name...seemed more interesting than their other beers. And I found it a bit novel, but not especially commendable...sadly validating my pre-judged notions a bit. This beer is sweet and boozy, like many maibocks or doppelbocks that do not contain honey, and the perception that the inclusion of honey makes beer ""smooth"" was not particularly valid with this beer. If anything this beer was sweeter than other maibocks, and had a graham cracker character that I didn’t particularly care for. In addition, I was genuinely bothered by high levels of diacetyl I noticed once the beer warmed up in my hand a bit, which I thought inconsistent with the style and difficult to drink. A novel name, and a bit of a unique approach, but I can’t recommend the final outcome."
Muskie Capital Double Honey Maibock;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Muskie Capital Brewery;Watery, not much going on the nose of this hazy amber beer. Sweet malt flavor with sour apple taste common to all the beers here.

Fresh at the brewpub on tap, pours a semi-cloudy burnt coppery amber color brew with an average off-white head that dissolves very slowly to a fine film. Aroma of sweet buttery toast, bananas, a touch of apple juice, and sweet sugar. Taste is smooth, creamy, medium body and more sweetness on the tongue. Finish is sweet and little bitterness. The brewmaster at Muskie Capital is the same brewmaster at South Shore in Ashland. The beers are almost identical in taste except the Hayward location version has a smoother, creamy finish.
Muskie Capital Belgian-Style Tripel;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Muskie Capital Brewery;Pours a cloudy light orange with a frothy white head that quickly dissipates.

In the aroma I get big smashed cherries, brown sugar simmering plums and pomegranates as well as lesser amounts of earthiness and Christmas like spices. The taste is similar with bold cherry, plum and pomegranate fruitiness edged with a bit of roasted malts, earthiness and some yeasty spiciness. This is a bold fruity brew where yeasty spices and pomegranate tang attempt to balance the sweetness.

Rupperts Dark Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Porter;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);A very dark brown/black color with a nice creamy head. Has a roasted caramel taste and aroma. Very great beer to top off the meal with.
Rupperts Dark Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Porter;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Anniversary Trip 2007 5/20/2007: Ruppert’s Dark is very dark brown in color and has a creamy tan cown. The aroma is chocolate mocha with some citrusy hops. At first, the flavor is roasted barley with some coffee. Further in some hints of citrus hops can be found. With each passing drink is gets more and more citrusy and bittery like an IPA, but this would be more like a DARK IPA due to the malt and chocolate/roasty flavors. The finish has a roasty flavor as well and is slightly dry. The body is medium-full and this beer is smooth and has a little creaminess to the texture. Overall this beer is quite good. I really enjoyed it and found that the chocolate and roasted qualities really pair well with the citrusy hops and bitterness. This is a well-crafted brew and I actually liked it more than the Southern Tier Porter! 16 oz draught at Clementine’s (restaurant) in South Haven, Michigan. Note: After arriving home I called Southern Tier Brewing Company to inquire about this beer since it seemed similar to their Porter, but more citrusy. They confirmed that this is a different beer. It is brewed using a similar recipe as their Porter, but has 100 pounds less dark malt per batch...

Overall a very nice brew. Thanks for picking it up JB.
Stegmaier White Ale;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lion Brewery;From a variety 12 pack from State College - respectable enough version of a style that I wish would fade away sooner then later. Very cloudy and pale with some unknown bits floating around in it, but no points off for that, I thought it lent it character. Mild citrus nose + clove + funk, decent aromas wafting. Palate is a little bit sweet and a little bit sour. You know, I don’t have anything but good things to say about this one.

Stegmaier White Ale;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lion Brewery;Pours a hazy bright orange with quickly dissapating bubbly white film. Aroma is typical white ale combo of doughiness, orange peel and coriander. Flavor a bit overcarbonated but surprisingly not overly watery. Good wheat dough base with good sweet orange sugared flavor and tad bit of spice. Overall, respectable enough.

Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;This is a backlog rating from 2011 from a bottle picked upat Kuhnhenn, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are honey, floral, peaches, stonefruit, sweet but there is enough hoing on to not make it cloying, solid.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2006 bottle from the brewery, drunk 1/8/17. Appearance as pictured, clear, leaving plentiful sediment behind. Lovely, fiery, burnished copper. A mix of clean, lightly peppery honey, rich and sumptuous but accented with plentiful acidity to balance. Almost like tart peach or nectarine. Touch of raisin and vanilla creeping in from the age but otherwise no sign of the years. Little/no alcohol in the nose, which is very impressive. In the mouth it’s sticky, rich and full of sweet honey but almost perfectly balanced on the finish by the acidity that is lip-smacking and bright, leaving the stuff shockingly drinkable. Complex golden raisin, caramel, vanilla, grass, herbs and peach all provide an outstanding variation of flavor. Very clean, soft and with almost no sign of the alcohol. Awesome stuff.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Nip sized bottle. Poured golden color with no head. Fruity and honey sweetness. To me, more of a straight forward mead, but one that I liked none the less considering that.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle at Clockwork’s 4K/5K/10K gathering. Pours a hazy yellow body with no head or lacing. Aroma is sweet fruit. Mouthfeel is medium to thick, rich with notes of flowers, honey, light booze and some peach cobbler.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle, big thanks to James (Jredmond) for corking this one and bringing it down the the Ginger Man, 18/05/13. Lightly hazed pale golden with no head. Nose is sugars, piss, light apricot, booze. Taste comprises sugars, syrup, light floral sweetness,boozey fleshy fruit. Full bodied, slightly cloying, sweet.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle. Pours clear gold with no head. Sweet honey, faint flowery notes, some hints of apple juice, and a medium sweet juicy honey finish. Not to sweet. Solid stuff.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;The pour is pale yellow/milky white with alright lacing left on the glass. Aroma is fairly complex with notes of honey, peach, apples, and white wine. The flavor is more subtle at first with some slight fruitness/honey and transitions into a boozy overripe fruit finish. Medium bodied for a mead leaning more towards sweet than dry.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle... This beer rocks!... Hazy straw-colored mead with sparce, but thick and beefy legs. The bouquet is a blend of wildflower honey, funky fallen apple and funky fallen peach accompanied by a mild note of ethanol. Full-bodied and sticky with the dawn of carbonation from over two years of warm storage - and the bottle wasn’t brand-spanking-new when I acquired it. The flavor presents wildflower honey and fuzzy fruits - pretty much as the commercial description reads. Sweet, warming finish with a nice hint of acidity. The 18% ABV is certainly well-disguised. This world class mead was provided by KickInChalice!
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle at the Colorado Mead Tasting ’12. Pour is golden orange with no head and great legs. Smell is floral, honeycomb, light apples, a touch of wood, vanilla, and fruit. Taste is white grapes, almonds, pear, wood, honey, and flowers with a dry lingering finish. Syrupy mouthfeel with no carbonation. Nice mead and not too sweet.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Wildflower Sack Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2012 Colorado Mead Tasting at Armin’s house. Thanks to Matt! Pours a light clear yellow appearance. Tangy, earthy/herbal, floral, apricot aroma. Not quite as sweet as the other Kuhnhenn meads. Somewhat dry finish with a moderate boozy burn. Peach, floral flavor. Kind of interesting.
New Holland Michigan Apple Cider;Holland, Michigan, United States;Apple Cider;New Holland Brewing Company;This is a backlog rating from 2010 on draft at New Holland, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this cider are apples, sweet, light tart, pretty standard.
New Holland Michigan Apple Cider;Holland, Michigan, United States;Apple Cider;New Holland Brewing Company;On tap at New Holland Brewpub. Slight ting of yellow to a rather clear and lifeless decapitated body. Aroma of apples, apple skins and cinnamon. Taste is tart with apples, cinnamon, spices, mild tannins and a dry finish. I preferred the raspberry cider to this one but obviously cant rate it.
New Holland Michigan Apple Cider;Holland, Michigan, United States;Apple Cider;New Holland Brewing Company;Clear yellow body. Crisp and refreshing. Apple and nothing else. s A decent cider, but nothing that makes this noteworthy.

Very gently sparkling. Aroma is like apple wine. Some crisp apple and light white wine in the flavor. Light body. Draught sample at New Holland Brewing Company’s restaurant and pub in downtown New Holland, Michigan.
Ringneck Red Alert Amber;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Brew Kettle;Pours a coppery amber. The malt is pretty big, lots of caramel, but not a lot of hops or character. Seems a bit one dimensional despite having plenty of flavor.
Stonecutters Long Hammer IPA;Barre, Vermont, United States;IPA;Stonecutters Brewhouse (formerly Granite City Brew Pub);A hazy golden IPA with a thin white head. A pleasant floral hops aroma with light caramel notes, very typical. In mouth, a decent IPA with good balance of floral hops and malt. Medium bodied. Sampled at Vermont Brewfest July 19 2008.
Stonecutters Long Hammer IPA;Barre, Vermont, United States;IPA;Stonecutters Brewhouse (formerly Granite City Brew Pub);Objectively speaking: A ridiculously off-target IPA. I like: Worst beer in a while. I dislike: While poured from the draught, this was full of yeast sediments. Problematic dry-hopping covers whatever flaws you can bet there are. Hugely yeasty in a dusty way, almost a pure dust flavour in fact. Empty maltiness provides no suppleness nor mouthfeel.
Leroyer Cidre;Saint Fraimbault, France;Apple Cider;Cidrerie Leroyer;"Tuesday, November 13, 2018. Bottle, 75cL. 4.5%. Purchase (""Cave de Beuvron"", Beuvron-en-Auge (14), FR). Home. A sparkling bubbly clear cider; average white head ; no retention. Wood, apple, light flower. Light sweet, light to medium dry refreshing, bitter note.

Leroyer Cidre;Saint Fraimbault, France;Apple Cider;Cidrerie Leroyer;Bottle, bought at the ciderie. Aroma of fermenting apples. Sweet and sugary flavor, fernmenting apples. Not really a typical apple flavor, only in the aftertaste. Also a touch of horseblanket in the aftertaste. Very rural cider.
Old Capitol Templeton Rye Pale Ale;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;IPA - Rye;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Batch 1 at the brewpub. Hazy orange caramel with a 1/2 finger creamy light beige head, fades to a ring quickly. It did leave a couple strings of lace. Aroma of whiskey, vanilla, and oak up front. Kind of hard to pick up on much else. Flavor is of whiskey, vanilla with some spicy rye, caramel malts, very light buttery notes. Not too boozy, though it isn’t supposed to be over 6.2%, so no surprise there. The Templeton Rye finish is the best part of this beer. Creamy medium body with a slightly prickly carbonation. Pretty decent. 2nd Batch. So anyways, had a tulip from the second batch last night (12/11/07, and am doing this from memory. This batch had quite a bit of peach/apricot fruitiness and a lot of straight bitterness (5-6 out of 10) in the woody finish. If I can scrounge up my notes from the first batch, this review will make a little more sense. Templeton Rye is fairly fruity, and since I have a glass of it next to me, it is clear this is where the fruitiness came from. 2.6 isn’t my actual rating, just what I’m putting in until I find my scrap of paper.
Old Capitol Templeton Rye Pale Ale;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;IPA - Rye;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;New batch on tap in a tulip in December 2007. Hazy dark amber body with an off white head. The aroma was definite Templeton Rye, and I could tell that when all I knew was that it was a barrel aged brew, not which barrels were used. There was a little bit of green apples and caramel. After it warmed the rye was more subtle with some bread crust. The taste was boozy grapefruit with up front rye. This was woody and dry. There were some definite hay notes in the finish. The barrel aging was a little much by the end. Pretty good for an Old Capitol brew.
Old Capitol Templeton Rye Pale Ale;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;IPA - Rye;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draft at the brewpub. Served in an 8 oz tulip glass. Aged in barrels from a distillery in Templeton, Iowa. Poured a slightly hazy orange red color. Head was two fingers thick and off white with decent retention. A bit of lace was left on the glass at the end. Aroma was a mix of whiskey, citrusy hops, and husky grain. Dry on the tongue with a warming alcohol effect. I definitely tasted the whiskey along with some vanilla, subdued grapefruity hops, and husky grain. Plenty of alcohol. I was feeling it by the end of 8 oz.
Kross Stout;Curacaví, Chile;Stout;Kross;330ml Flasche. Klar und schwarz. Minimale Schaumkrone. Malzig. Etwas Karamell und Röstaromen. Ordentlicher Körper. Gut trinkbar.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Mollys Titanic Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Mug club draft on tap at the brewpub (Lombard, IL). Pours a nice dark brown, reddish edges not really opaque but dark enough. A decent tannish head that laces ok, stays a thicker film. Aromas are a nice firm roasty cocoa base, brown malts throw earthy tobbacco, brown sugar, coffee grounds, a touch of sweetness and faint vanilla. Initial is firm, a lighter side of medium bodied with a good roasty base, coffee and roasted malts pair with sweeter brown malts, dark chocolate, brown sugar, good roast that sticks to the palate and provides a light floral bitterness on the backend. Still, roast is king with coffee, earthy tobbacco, and cocoa sticking. Nice, with just enough sweetness coming in. A drinker.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Mollys Titanic Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Yorktown;on tap at the brewpub. pours dark ruby brown with off white head. nose is very roasty and nutty. flavors are robust and roasty with chocolate and hazelnuts. flavors med body, big flavorful brown/porter that at times seems a tad astringent.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Mollys Titanic Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Yorktown;4oz. sample. Dark brown pour with an off white head which reduced quickly to a thin ring, leaving some light lacing. Roasted malt, nuts, a touch of coffee, bakers chocolate, and toffee with a pleasant, bitter finish. All flavors were moderately potent in a nice balance. A good representative porter. Next time around, I was served in a club mug, and detected perfumy/floral notes in the aroma and a more pronounced brown sugar sweetness to the flavor.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Mollys Titanic Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Draught. Opaque with a thin off-white head, minimal spotty lacing. Aroma is dull dry nutty malts. Nice dry quaffable beer with some toffee sweet notes and a roast character with a strong dry finish of coffee. Rich and full in the mouth with a nice carbonation.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Mollys Titanic Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Pours dark brown with a frothy, minimal tan head. Very heavy carbonation. Aroma is of brown sugar, chocolate, and light roasted malt. The roasted malt was very subdued in the aroma. Taste is very nutty, with brown sugar, hops, roasted malt, and chocolate. More of a brown then a porter, but it was very drinkable and enjoyable.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Mollys Titanic Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Yorktown;<i>Dec. 2008 batch, 5.1% abv:</i> Deep brown body with thin tan bubbles. Smell of mocha and freshly roasted malts. Taste falls right between porter and dry stout at first, with some coffee turning up in my throat. A bit of English hop, but also a perception of PNW pine. Could position between a session beer and a winter warmer. <br /><br /><i>First batch, June, 2007. 4.8% abv:</i> <i><u>Unfrosted</u> Mug Club mug.</i> at first it tends more toward brown than porter, but it’s much more complicated than that. Opaque, dark brown body under a thin head with slight lacing. Smell is light, but suggests hearty roast malts. First taste has chocolate roast malts, but not too much, as its balanced by what I think are English hops. Traces of coffee follow. Alcohol is light, but easily noticed. Earthy and nutty toward the middle, followed by almost stoutlike roasties. Very malty, but not overly sweet.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Mollys Titanic Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Yorktown;The name may be misleading, but brewmaster Tim Marshall tells me that this is a brown Porter. It pours a deep chestnut body with a bubbly, short lived off-white head. Good lacing, regardless. The aroma is light and chocolatey with a bit of toffee and some lightly roasted malts. It was perhaps a bit thin but still imparts a chocolate chip cookie flavor, completely with some chopped nuts. Pretty decent. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL
Wisconsin Dells Light Lager;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Reviewed from notes. Consumed last summer traveling through Wisconsin. The appearance has a clear yellow body, has a film of a white head, and carbonation is seen rising. The smell is basically corn/rice adjuncts, sweet malts. The taste is sweet all the way through, crisp dry finish. The palate is light, sessionable, and adequately carbonated for the style and for me. Overall, hey now, its a light lager and its not only made by a brewery, but a pizza place, so this is a pizza beer all the way through, Id probably have it again if I came through this area.
Wisconsin Dells Light Lager;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Probably their worst beer. No flavor. Similar to an old style. Pours a light yellow and is bitter ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wisconsin Dells Light Lager;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewery, sampler flight. Hazy golden in color with no noticeable head. Surprisingly hoppy for a light, with a mild hop nose and some rice. Watery, no aftertaste. Not mush real taste at all, though.
Wisconsin Dells Light Lager;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub on 6/22/07: Pours a clear pale golden with a frothy well-lacing white head. Aroma of pale malt, noble hops and some graininess. Starts fairly sweet and grainy with some light earthy bitterness. Pretty true to style and therefore bland.

Wisconsin Dells India Pale Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Not impressed with this ipa. Has a wonderful look and smell to it, but the flavor is nothing spectacular. I would not recommend to anyone or get it again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wisconsin Dells India Pale Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub in Wisconsin Dells, pours a clear copper color with a very slow dissolving off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty with some hints of brown sugar For an IPA it is missing the hop character I am used to. Taste is light flavor, bitter on the tongue with a slight hint of hops near the end. Finish is smooth and creamy and missing the hop bite that most IPAs have. I am wondering if the Kilbourn Hop Ale and IPA were switched? For an amber ale this would be very good, but this IPA seems to be a little off.
Loddon Premier Gold;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Bottle. (Brief tasting notes and rating from old records) - BCA - Refreshing, crisp, tangy, bitter grapefruit citrus hoppy & malty ale. Bitter citrus-hoppy finish. (Backlog)
Loddon Premier Gold;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Brown 500ml bottle (bottle conditioned), best before 20th Nov 2008, drank July 2008. Very lively, only got half the bottle into my pint tumbler because of the head that appeared as I tried to pour. Pale amber/yellow with a white (large) head, clear and well carbonated, bubbles rising to replenish the head. Citrus aroma, mixed with hops and malts. It claims to have a continental style (whatever that means?) and it doesn’t taste like a normal English Bitter at all. The citrus flavours within the smell are very apparant in the taste, it is almost tangy, zesty even. It tasted a little green, as in not ready, but it only had 4 months life left and it had sat in my garage for over six months. The label also told me to serve it slightly chilled on a sunny day, so I did. A little watery for 4.8%, but not wishy-washy. The spritzy citrus flavours linger in the mouth for a while. Not really ’My Cup of Tea’, but an interesting brew none-the-less.
Loddon Premier Gold;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;500ml Bottle at home 10/09/2007 Hoppy and floral aromas. Some carbonation. Clear golden coloured slightly pale and fruity with a crisp full malt finish.

Loddon Premier Gold;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Bottled. A light gold coloured beer with a rocky lasting white head. Nice lemony and orangey hops on the aroma, together with a hint of soap. Some more hops in the taste, but more restrained. After pouring and checking the head, I feared for an infected BCA but it’s actually pretty pleasant.
Loddon Premier Gold;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Bottle conditioned, 500ml, from Tesco, Banbury. Gold to brown with short lasting Head. A little bit non descript. Dry and bitter wit a flowery aroma, some hop but needs to be searched out and a little malty fruitiness, but largely disappointing with a lack of freshness.
Loddon Premier Gold;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Bottle, 500ml. A pale golden colour with a huge frothy head. A floral hop and orange aroma. Taste is caramel, roasted malt, floral hops and really juicy citrus fruits. High carbonation. Very tasty, but rather too fizzy for my liking.
Loddon Premier Gold;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;A Mes rate: Bottle from Tesco, obviously. Dark gold with a huge froth head that settled to nothing in seconds. Harsh soapy yeasty aroma with some rather unpleasant hops. Having to pluck up the courage to taste it. Actually not quite as bad as the nose. Tastes like a standard lager but with a harsh citric finish leaving some all too lengthy cardboard. Bit of a shocker all round. Actually no. The more I drink the worse it gets. Very very bad. Drain pour. Now let’s find something to cleanse my palate...
Gold Ben Thanh;Vinh Phu, Thuan An, Binh Duong Province, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tan Hiep Phat Co., Ldt.;This one’s on the lower end of wonderful world of Vietnamese lagers. Tastes like sour malt that goes flat in your mouth and sits badly in your stomach. Drank in a can in Saigon

The Twisted Hop Poplar Brown;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;The Twisted Hop;I love brown ales. I love that my local brews a brown ale and I love that it had returned after a year. The flavours were complex and nutty like a brown ale should be, and it is a credit to the man who brews it (although he is of only limited use to doing the cryptic crossword).
The Twisted Hop Poplar Brown;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;The Twisted Hop;I was surprised by this, i was expecting a standard nutty brown ale but the lovely smokey flavour to it gives it a really different aspect, very enjoyable beer

The Twisted Hop Poplar Brown;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;The Twisted Hop;Pint at the brewery. Beautiful malty dark brown colour. Rich full head. A fantastic balance of dark malts and subtle hops combines to deliver a well balanced smooth but complex enough drop. This is a great beer.
The Twisted Hop Poplar Brown;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;The Twisted Hop;Tasted 25/05/2007. Flagon, from the brewery, served via my infamous Scotsman’s beer engine (i.e. a weedsprayer). Gorgeous combination of toasty and cocoa-like dark malts and fruity hops. Suave, svelte, sexy. Creamy mouthfeel and superbly fresh. I didn’t take any notes, and I drunk too much after this one to remember the finer points, but I can assure you it’s a cracker. Looking forward to my next trip to Christchurch already...
AleWerks American Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;Well I have put off posting my rating on this for a bit because I wanted to wait for their All-American Cream Ale to come out for comparison. Draft last fall at Green Leafe Cafe. Poured a dark golden honey color with good white head. Aroma was grainy and slight caramel hints. Tasted about the same. Other people mentioned ’fruity’ but I didn’t pick up on that. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin with moderate carbonation.. Wasn’t crazy about it but the rest of my table liked it well enough because we ordered several pitchers of it.
AleWerks American Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;From Skyview. An acidic aroma and acidic flavor. Prominent unprocessed grain flavor, barley, and some hops. Gold color, dry, and fairly simple. Light on the palate.
AleWerks American Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;A growler ported in by Skyview. Dark brown color with a large head. Chalky and dry malt aroma. The malt taste manages to be both sweet and dry. A little molasses. Dry hop finish.
AleWerks American Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;My parents were kind to pick up a growler of the American Ale straight from the brewpub in Williamsburg, VA. Pours a somewhat dark golden amber brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of multi-grain malt, a touch of citrus, some yeast and a touch of honey. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with flavors of light caramel malt and some flowery hop flavors. Finish is slightly watery, light malty with a light malt aftertaste. An average ale at best.
AleWerks American Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;Draft at Greenleafe Tavern while on vacation. The pour was medium goldish, and I got aroma notes of mild hopcitrus, some pale malt, light fruit, honey, and ssome of that slight yeasty funk note that I seem to detect in most Williamsburg beers. Medium to light palate heft, with mild flavors of hopcitrus, light skinned fruit, and pale malt.
AleWerks American Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;"Draft at the Greene Leaf Cafe; Light amber and moderately carbonated. Sweet aroma kinda sneaks up on you and then there’s almost a vinegary touch. This drinks quite light, but it drinks so starchy it almost comes across like that vinegar I got in the aroma. Little odd, bitter finish, almost tart. I supposet this sounds bad, but actually the beer’s not bad ... it’s OK, but somewhat of a let down for WAW. (#2950, 5/24/2007)"
AleWerks American Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;Sampled at the Virginia Beer Fest. The keg was labeled Alewerks American Ale, but after speaking with maniac and his conversation with the brewers, for now we’ll leave it named Alewerks Ale. I’ll try and dig up as much info as I can for this. Came out golden bodied. Small white head. The nose seemed rather faint to me. Light grains, some faint caramel and light malt. Taste was on par with the aroma. Again nothing exciting but still well done. Light grains, some hops, softer malts and touches of fruit. Body is light-medium to medium. Soft carbonation. Ends with more grains, soft caramel and fruits and touches of maltiness. Average.
AleWerks American Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;"Virginia Beer Fest 2007. The head brewer told me that this is their American Ale. This is meant to be their general purpose beer. ""Give me an Alewerks"" and this is what they plan to give you. Clear golden amber body with a small white head. Somewhat grainy light caramel aroma. Grainy carmel and light fruit flavor. For a general purpose beer, this isn’t too bad."

Aroma is nutty (almond and cashew), and sweet roasted malts. Taste is light and sweet, with a clean mouthfeel that is quite refreshing, and a medium bitterness that dries out the finish a little too much.

Elliott Bay B-Town Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Dark dark brown under a thin beige cap. Dark sweet nose with a weird accompanying green apple tone.

Gambrivinus Blond;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"28 May 2018. At Café Cambrinus. Shared with Anke. Pours clear golden with a lasting, frothy, white head; lots of lacing. The aroma contains bready malt, grain, citrus, cookie, vanilla, honey, hot apple & pear, smoked bacon even. It tastes light to medium malty sweet, a bit bready & fruit, and light grainy bitter, yeast & citrus in theback. Dry, grainy finish, lingering bread & yeast. Light to medium body, slick texture, soft, almost flat, carbonation. I'd choose the brown version over this one, even though I'd recommend any other beer to tourists visiting the Cambrinus restaurant."

Gambrivinus Blond;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;The blonde house beer of Cambrinus in Brugues, also by Van Steenberge and also claimed to represent an original recipe so not an alias. Very thick, stable, off-white head, clear ’old gold’ colour, fizzy. Aroma of unmistakable DMS (cooked cauliflower), honey, caramel candy, powder sugar, dried mango, straw, coriander, apricot, dried banana. Sweet onset, banana and peach with a basic sourishness underneath, minerally carbo, smooth caramelly and somewhat honeyish malt sweetness, bit metallic, soft floral hoppiness in the end with some soapy coriander but more than anything, lingering malt sweetness. Boring and stereotypical, intended for the big masses like its brown counterpart, but more metallic.

Millis Gravesend Guzzler;Dartford, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dartford Wobbler (prev Millis Brewery);Man of Kent, Rochester. I’ve been using the Man of Kent pub more and more over the past year or two, and have been pleased that beer quality has improved. Sadly, this beer wasn’t in good condition. The beer selection was much reduced, and the landlady was saying that during quiet periods they don’t put out many beers. Seems they have been noticing. Good. Then she got talking about the length of time a beer lasts. I only like to keep them on for four days, she says, but strong beers can go longer. I agree - a 9% beer can last way longer than four days, but a weak beer - like a 3.7% - wouldn’t do well after four days. O no! She firmly disagrees - our cellar is in perfect condition to keep beer. Oh, OK, says me - recalling the amount of warm beers I’ve had here, but being aware that you get barred from this place if you complain about the beer. I take the drinks back to our table, and - ah. the Guzzler is beyond its best. It’s warm, flabby, and heading toward sour. Note to self - only drink the strong beers in the Man of Kent.
Millis Gravesend Guzzler;Dartford, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dartford Wobbler (prev Millis Brewery);Cask gravity at Crabble Corn Mill BF 2007. Rating 3300 so I suppose it is fitting that it is a Kentish beer. Gold colour with lasting off white head. Some lemony hop, bit of sweetish malt on aroma. Lemony/citrus easy drinking sessioin bitter. Dryness and citrus acids on finish pucker the cheeks. Very decent lemon/tangerine. Very refreshing, full fruit flavour.
De Molen Engelen Tranen;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottle: Many thanks to Joes for sharing this one: Vintage 2006: Very vast creamy light tan medium head on top of a deep deep dark brown to black colored beer with a light brown shine. The aroma is a nice mix of chocolate from the bottle and oatmeal, nuts, toffee, hints of roasted malts, hint of liquor/alcohol from the glass. The flavours of this beer are complex and not complex at the same time: chocolate, roast, hint of portish alcohol, light hint of coffee, oatmeal, bitter. Vinous and tasty! The aftertaste has notes of bitter, chocolate, roasted ingredients and herbs. Low carbo, soft mouthfeel, full body and a creamy light oily texture. Did this beer increase with all those years... Never had it before, so I don’t know, but after all these years it was still really good!
De Molen Engelen Tranen;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Fruchtiger Malzantrunk, sehr weich und flüssig. Angenehm aromatisch werdend, gut versteckt ist der Alkohol, der nur kurz herauslugt. Das Malz ist nicht übermäßig stark, eine dumpfe Hopfen-Getreidenote wirkt dagegen. Gutes, sehr harmonisches Bier.

De Molen Engelen Tranen;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottle, from trade with jbrus. A clear, ruby-brown beer with a finger-thick beige head. Dried fruits, some roasted malts, a little licorice and alcohol, and some maltyness in the aroma. Maybe a bit weak, but very good. Sweet flavor with dried fruits, licorice, some roasted malts and coffee. The long-lasting finish is much the same. Some bitterness, but roasted bitterness, not much hoppy bitterness to brag about. Full-bodied and slightly warming. A lovely beer, warm and tasteful. (090501)
De Molen Engelen Tranen;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottled 0,75 ltr (BB 05/2009) Courtesy of bierkoning, thanks Edo! Dark brown, almost opaque color, steady creamy tan head, lots of lace. Strong licorice, roasted malty aroma. Full-bodied. Greasy coffee beans, dark chocolate, muscovado sugar. Aftertaste is short and it it is more sweet than roasted. De Molen is a quality brewery.

De Molen Engelen Tranen;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottle, 8.6%. Fat vinous aroma, brown sugar. Almost black colour, small tight light brown head. The flavour is nicely roasted, vinous fruitiness, very flavourful. A little roasted bitterness, but by no means unpleasant. Creamy mouthfeel. Very nice.
De Molen Engelen Tranen;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottle. [thank you, Skortila!] Pours a very dark ruby-red. It is only possible to see the red when looking directly towards a lightsource. On top sits a healthy head that initially (on pouring) seemed fizzy, but is now a slowly degrading creamy mass with bigger bubbles nearer the liquid. Rich chocolate aroma, some vanilla, apples and roasted malts in there as well. Great mouthfeel, low carbonation. Flavour is sweet, lightly vinious, the chocolate again dominates. Amid this, there is slight hints of oak, vanilla, coffee. I would say that the initial flavours are just a touch too sweet. But the aftertaste is great, leaving a lasting impression of bitterness and roasted chocolate. For a very long time. The alcohol never burns either, it just warms gently. A good brew, but like the Borefts Stout, a bit on the sweet side.

Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;Growler shared by psprings -- thanks, man! Pours garnet with no discernible head, really. Nice aroma of wood, dark cherries, and bitter apples. Odd flavor combination on the palate, possibly due to oxidation, but it works. Further apples, wood, and that rascally cherry sucrets taste that I typically associate with Arctic Devil.
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;Growler from Paul the dentist. Wicked find, Paul. This is definitely not a sour anymore. Nose is really mellow dark cherry, red apple skin, sweet malt, oxidation, and a mellow, unobtrusive wood character. Gave me chills because the combined effect reminded me of Valley Brew Dec 12 Cuvee Speciale, one of the finer beers ever brewed. Color was a deep amber-ruby. Flavor was much the same as the nose but less varied. Sweet. Dusty. Good.
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;Handbottle from a growler, courtesy of SoLan. Pours a dark garnet, with a trace of a head. Nose of caramel, spice, pepper, and a touch of acidity. Mildly tart and caramel, peppery spice in the finish. A little boozy with hints of barrel, round mouthfeel and slightly tannic with low carb.
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;Handbottle from rustychiles, thanks dude. Poured a muddled brown color with some pale ruby highlights and a 1/4 inch, bubbly off-white head that faded to a thin layer. Aroma of soft caramel, some light tart cherry, grape skin, a bit of funk, and some oak. Smooth, lightly sweet entry with a warm caramel character transitions into a smooth, moderately sweet vanilla oakiness that finishes lightly tart with some soft hints of fruit and a faint bourbon spiciness. Low, soft carbonation and moderate mouthfeel. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. While the flavors weren’t overly complex, they were very enjoyable. The base beer seems pretty solid.
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;Pros: Has some nice things going on. Part of me wants to like it because it is both sweet and strong. Cons: Thin mouth feel. Overbearing sweetness, making it out of balance. Really bland up front and towards the mid-palate. Flavors seem off. Just seems like a mistake.
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;"Thanks to rustychiles for the share on this. Poured out of a growler into orval and bruery goblets. Next to no carbonation is present, but that is to be expected from a barrel-aged beer. Pours a very dark brown, much like many oud bruins. Aroma is of lots of dark candi sugars (figs, plums, dates, etc.), and some muted barrel and sour characters. First impression on taste is ""wow."" I know that’s not really saying much, but other words didn’t come to me at the time. This is a very complex beer. Lots of those dark fruits, lots of belgian yeast character, and on the tail end of the palate bourbon, oak, and lacto sourness. These final three elements really rounded out the beer. This does not taste like a 12.5%++ beer at all. It is hidden extremely well. Definitely not cloyingly sweet and extremely complex. The only major complaint I have is such low carbonation, but the quality of the beer still showed through."
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;I heard they tapped a 2005 Keg of this oak barrel aged beast at Papago and I’m pretty sure this is the same beer. If not I will make a new entry. Pours a nice hazy caramel color with a small off white head. Aroma is caramel, malts, sour mash, wood, spices, fruits and more. Flavor is fruits, significant sourness, whiskey, oak, caramel malts. Has a very nice sour barrely flavor going on and the age has done some nice things to this brew. 12.5% is hardly noticable or maybe I just don’t notice because this has such a nice flavor profile going on. Fantastic brew.
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;Fruity aroma, easy drinking for a stronger beer. Flavor is a nice sweet and sour mixture. Alcohol was noticable. Good stuff.
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;tap @ papago. bocky must be following me...? first time i’ve seen this so i had to try. smells of green apples, vanilla and whiskey. flavor reminded me of green apple pie with the cinnamon and vanilla. very rich warm mouthfeel. alcohol is definately present and the wood comes through nicely. great way to finish a meal...very strange 2005 version... they must have re-innoculated this? rich red apples, pie spice, fruit sourness, rotten grain, alcohol and yeast show in the aroma and flavor profile. sourness has appeared but this is nowhere near sour (it IS a quad after all). nonetheless, a tasty after dinner brew...
Papago Oak Aged Oh Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Papago Brewing;Tap @ Papago. Aroma had srong alcohol whisky along with some fruity sour aroma. Also some wood present. Dark body but brew pub is dimly lit average head. To me this was more in line with a whiskey old fashion sweet than a beer. And that is not all bad for me. Sweet fruity and sour flavors with an alcohol presence. Good sipping beer, easy on palate.
Fort Street Cherry Queen;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: The aroma is a nice citrus cherry combination with some mild grapefruit hops. It’s a cloudy amber with a small off-white head that leaves behind nice lacing. The flavor starts with a quick citrus and cherry taste that quickly turns to a mild grapefruit hoppiness in the finish. The cherry really blends with with the sweet citrus flavors and grapefruit hoppiness.
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;From Jul 2007 Purchased from Poplar Wine & Spirits in Casper for US$10.50. Pours from 32oz waxed and sealed swing top bottle (bottled Apr 22 3007) a cloudy deep amber-brown with a smallish head of foam but it sticks around for the entire session and it has some lacing. The smell is big on the yeast! I'm also getting some sourness and some fruit but the yeast smell is strong and oh.... the sour notes are taking center stage now and I can't wait to take a sip. The taste is really fruity up front. There's a definite sour flavour that dominates the initial taste but that is offset by some good malty caramel sweetness and it has a lot of earthy tones in the background that become more noticeable as I take further sips. It's an unusual mixture of flavours but I find that it works for *my* taste buds and I find myself taking more and more sips. Pretty drinkable in my book. Further sips in and the sourness is still there but the malt presence balances out the brew nicely. I think Grand Teton has done a nice job within the style. I'm glad I bought 2 botttles for myself and 1 for a trade to another fan of the Grand Teton's Cellar Reserve series. This one is, imho, another well crafted brew. Thanks Grand Teton!
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;3 finger head that left very nice lacing atop a hazy amber brew. Aroma is funky sweet and sour.. reminds me of a sweeter smelling Orval.. spicy. Flavor begins with a spicy slightly sweet malty blast and trails into some nice bret mid palate and finish is fairly dry with a lingering bret and mild hop flavor. Green apples and a faint oakiness. Light/medium palate with only a touch of carbonation.
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Had this on draft. Gentle acidity, complementing malt backbone. Great aroma. Not my favorite Oud Bruin, but not far from the top of the list!
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"Not an oud bruin. Smells very sweet -- malty, worty. Caramel, red apple, pear, bake bread. Got the malt side right; needs some acidity. Super-sugary flavor. Bread, caramel, toffee, apple cider, a bit of bretty funk. Zero Flanders acidity, and if this is actually 6 percent alcohol, I’ll eat my own shoes. Tastes more like a quad than anything, and not like a very good one."
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"My Bottom Line: Lactic connotations and vegetal undertones wade within this storyless Oud Bruin. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the dull, misty pale red. -A touch of butyric acid (spoiled milk) is found in the nose. -Mouthfeel is a tad fluffy, which doesn’t work with the style (for me). -Acidity levels are low for the style. -After 4 different brews, this brewery just doesn’t do it for me. Bottle; 2013 vintage."
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"What a letdown this one. GT has always been solid, if not spectacular, and this, as a sour, is just crap. Smells and tastes of barn, yes...but in that dusty old smell. Very little tartness or sour (or really a whole lot of anything going on) in the aroma and flavor. Too gassy. More like a straight belgian, and a somewhat boring one at that. One timer for sure, not worth half what they charge. Stick to what you know guys, and sour ales ain’t it."""
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;More like watered down barely wine. Too much of the malt interfere with flemish yeast character
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Aroma is fruity with apples, grapes and prune with a strong caramel sweetness under the fruity flavors. The beer has a rich caramel color and a modest tan head with some light cloudiness. Flavor is sweet with a strong raisin presence, light toasted malt which is well balanced with the sweetness. Body is modest with low carbonation. Overall a pretty good brew with a lot of sweetness present.
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;750 ml bottle- Pours an extremely hazy orange with minimal head that reduces to a collar. Aroma is extremely malty similar to a barleywine actually. The taste is similar, age has not been kind to this beer, malts similar to a barleywine. The vintage is 2013, PDT is 01/13, about 15 months, a true sour should stand up to much more than this ( possibly the retailer stored it improperly, huge windows shining sunlight right on the bottles?). From what I’ve read its the beer, WTF, extremely malty, not a sour at all!
Grand Teton Oud Bruin;Victor, Idaho, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;1L swing top? bottle. Thanks to maniac! March 2014 DC Tasting. Poured a ruby clear color without a real head to speak of. Aroma was malty, sweet notes. Malt finish, some nutty notes. Age has oxidized this a bit (bottle was first opened in Sept), the sour/acid is missing, but was still enjoyable enough.
Kerkom de Wyckeneer;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;A beer special made for the pub Take one in Maastricht. Bottled on 4/16/2006 the only place where you can find it. A very nice combination of mouts. Although not strong still very nice taste. I like good bitter beers, but this beer the bitterness is not overwelming. A very nice brew
South Street Belgian Golden Ale;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;South Street Brewery;A very clean golden, creamy looking white head. Mediocre retention, not much for stickiness off the bat but it sticks on the glass as it goes Soft malts, fruity esters - apple and pear. A modest pepperiness. Sweet, fruity, clean. Incredibly easy to drink, a near perfect amount of carbonation. Smooth and quite a dry finish. Fairly simple and straight forward, but nicely done.
South Street Belgian Golden Ale;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;South Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Apple juice-like color with a moderate head. Aroma of bananas and caramel. Taste is pineapple and banana. THin body.
South Street Belgian Golden Ale;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;South Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Clear golden body with a small white head. Fruity caramel and floral hop aroma. Caramel fruit and molassas flavor. Medium full body with medum carbonation and a slightly syrupy finish.
South Street Belgian Golden Ale;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;South Street Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub. According to the bartender, a batch of this is brewed every year, but the recipe changes. This one was 7.5% and 50 IBU. I don’t know whether the vintages vary enough to warrant different entries each year but, since the beer isn’t on RateBeer I can’t really judge. The ""other site"" has a version listed at 5.7%. It has a nice yeasty aroma, with lots of orange zest in the flavour. The mouthfeel is quite sweet and the bitterness (50 IBU seems quite pronounced for a Belgian style) doesn’t come through that strongly until the finish, but that is enough to prevent this brew seeming sticky sweet. Quite nice."
South Street Dark Summer Mild;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Mild Ale;South Street Brewery;On tap (nitro) at the brewpub. An annual July release according to the bartender. No ABV given. Dark red colour with a smooth creamy head (not surprising, given to nitro dispense). However, the dispense does interfere somewhat with the aroma, which is a light, toasty malt. On the palate, the malt is deeper and darker,, with touches of cocoa powder chocolate. A very creditable, and credible, effort at a style that is not often seen in the US.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Bottle. Pours an amber body with a thin white head. Fresh hop tones with pine and grapefruit abundantly swirling from the glass. Lighter citrus, earth hop resins, and more pine with a light (thankfully) malt bill.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;(12oz bottle) Pours a cloudy orange-brown body with a small off-white head. Aroma of toffee, citrus, caramel, maple, and some dried pine needles. Flavor of toffee, hops (grass, pine, earth), light cola, and caramel with a dry, bitter finish.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;12oz bottle. Pours a nice, hazy, sediment-filled garnet-orange with thin white head that leaves lots of lacing in its wake. Aroma is bitter hops, hops, and more hops, oh, and maybe a hint of citrus and malt. Flavor is, as one might expect, utterly dominated by sharp hop bitterness, but wit little in the way of pleasant citrus notes or balancing from the malt found in better versions of the style. Medium palate has a bitter follow-up just in case you didn’t get enough bitterness when you took the sip that you’re swallowing. Just one more example of the countless impetuous, in-your-face American IPAs done in a style I have never grown to appreciate and probably never will.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Sediment-heavy deep copper color under a short but creamy yellowhite head. Aroma is lemony, grassy, grapefruity and mildly floral. Flavor finds a pleasantly lopsided nod towards PNW hops with a dominance of grapefruit with dashes of pepper and pine. Rather full mouthfeel while the hops linger with a slow burn to the tongue and upper palate. This beer’s sharp, potent flavors make me think that the alcohol content is greater than it actually is. This is an IPA that really holds its own. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ No idea how long ago he gave it to me, but I got this from Cornfield.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Bottle. Deep golden colour with an off-white head. Aroma is hop, malt, grapefruit. Flavour is hop, malt, grapefruit. Full bodied beer, but could be more.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;A- Pours a hazy orange hue with a big, fluffy, 2 finger off white head. S- Smells sweet, hints of piney hops. T- Taste is piney with a thick, bready middle full of light fruit and caramel notes leading into a big, bitter, back end. M- Medium bodied, decent carbonation. D- This is definitely an enjoyable brew. Doesn’t particularly stand out for me but I enjoyed it none the less.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;12oz bottle via trade with FlandersNed (thanks, steve!). pours a hazy, darker ruby/copper with a few floaties and a light, whispy, tan head. aroma is solid good with spicy, citrus hops, touches of earthy pine, and a hint of candied sugar. flavor is very solid, showcasing the spicy and herbal nature of the hops on a background of lemon and orange citrus with a substantial, sweet/fruity malt presence tempering the big hop bitterness. finish is a kick of citrus followed by mild floral hop bitterness. palate is smooth and drinkable with good carbonation. overall, a solid IPA.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Bottle. A more or less clear, golden beer with an off-white head. Piney and resiny nose on a malty background. The flavor has malts in the back, with pine cones and resin up front. Nice bitterness. Maybe a bit much bitterness actually, as it gets almost astringent. Full body. The bitterness lasts for a long time, with some malty sweetness to support the resiny finish. Just plain lovely, nothing extraordinary, and very easy drinkable. (090327)
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;I can’t thank naproxen enough for the opportunity to try this brew, which I thought I would never get to try. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy caramel brown that shows bright orange when held up to light. There is also a big tan head that sticks to glass handsomely on the way down. The aroma very balanced with lots of citrus hops still showing after all this time in addition to some candied fruit aromas. However, there is plenty of caramel malts in the nose as well. I really think the taste has suffered a little more than the nose with the age on this one. There are some floral pine hops up front before giving way to the caramel malts. There is a lingering dry bitterness in the finish. I think this would have been a seriously tasty beer when fresh. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and fairly slick though the carbonation has held up well. This is a good beer that has probably lost a little over time. I’m not sure about the ABV, but I doubt it’s quite up to DIPA level and maybe that contributes to the age deterioration.
Tyranena BGW Stickin It To The Man;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Thanks kiefdog for the share. Pours a hazy brown with nose of caramel, grapefruit, malt, sugar, and noticeable pine. Flavor is lots of caramel, some sweet citrus, and lots of hop punch, finishing smoothly. Crisp, clean, and nice.

Thuringia Braumeister;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Langweilig herber, dumpf hopfiger Antrunk.

Thuringia Braumeister;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Schöne dunkelgoldene Farbe mit für ein Pils doch relativ süßlichem Geruch. Der Antrunk ist süffig-süßlich und schmeckt mehr nach Export als nach Pils. Im Hauptteil kommt eine etwas herbere Note durch, das Bier bleibt aber in der süßlichen Schiene. Auf der Zunge bleibt eine süßlich-würzige Note mit herbem Einschlag. --> Im Vergleich zum Thuringia Export nur ein bisschen Herber, sonst geschmacklich sehr ähnlich.

23rd Street Round Town Brown;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;23rd Street Brewery;Not surprised they retired this one. Tried for the first time back in 2008 and only now getting to the rating transfer. Weak and overly sweet. Chemical finish. Chocolate like a tootsie roll.
23rd Street Round Town Brown;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;23rd Street Brewery;On tap at the 2007 Parkville Microbrew Festival. Pours a clear reddish brown color with a thin off-white head that has little staying power. Very mild roasted chocolate aroma that musters up little enthusiasm. A watery beer by body, but palatable. The chocolate is quite strong in the flavor and that gives it some respect from me. The finish seems much more of a bitter semi-sweet chocolate than a candy milk chocolate.
High Noon McCracken Vanilla Porter;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Porter;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;On tap at the Parkville Microbrew Festival. Pours black with a dark beige head. Has a strong vanilla aroma that seems real, but the odd chemical mid flavors betray this. It has a great chocolate finish that I like a lot.

It pours really black with big tan head (too dark, evidence of colourant). Weak medicinal aroma.

Lost Coast Imperial Pilsner;Eureka, California, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;Aroma has some hop oil, ranging from nail polish remover-like scents to some floral aromas. A little boring and unusual in appearance, with a flat look, a little collar with a cloudy golden color. A very good malt undertone with biting hop qualities and some sharpness in flavor. Very nutty and somewhat velvety finish and a bit of the bitter.
Lost Coast Imperial Pilsner;Eureka, California, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;This poured a hazy yellow color with a big fluffy white head.

Lost Coast Imperial Pilsner;Eureka, California, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;Draught @ Brouwer’s Café: Golden in color, slightly fiery, moderate frothy off-white head, fairly sticky lacing, strong carbonation.   Mealy nose, certainly malty, but also a fairly strong hop aspect.   Even a slight floral hint.   Seems decent enough.   Forwardly hoppy, a little bit of heat, decent malt background.   Not as flavorful as the nose suggested but still quite good.   Fairly clean.   This certainly feels like an Imperial Pilsner.   More hops than most.   Body and mouthfeel are full to moderate.   Warming finish.   I enjoyed this one even if it was a little abrasive.   Will probably mellow with time.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;a pretty straight forward American Amber with American hops. Not totally sure what the hops are, but they seem like Amarillo. Who knows. At any rate, quaffable and decent. Nice.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at FFF 9/22/07. Light red colored beer, decent looking head that quickly fades, moderate lacing. Slightly piney hop aroma, not as much maltiness as I like in a good west coast red. Flavor is fairly dry, not a whole lot of malt character at all, more piney hops, very one dimensional.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at 3F during RBSG Road Trip 2007. Clear copper with a nice tan head. Solid malty nose, strong citrus. Citrus flavors well balanced with the sweet malt flavors, very easy to drink.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Slightly hazy red body with a small creamy tan head. Sweet caramel and citrus hops aroma. Very sweet citrus hops flavor with some caramel and tea in the ending.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;draft at brewpub: Reddish amber. Aroma is PNW hops with some crystal goodness, typical malty sweetness you see in reds. Much bigger hop presence for a beer of this style, and much more enjoyable. Almost like the Alpha King of ambers, but not quite. Very enjoyable.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at Three Floyds, poured into an Imperial pint glass. This beer poured a deep reddish amber color with a small tan head that quickly faded away. Not much lace to speak of. The aroma consisted of citrus hops and some sweet maltiness. The flavor was very smooth, with a big citrusy/fruity taste with a nice roastiness, finishing off with a nice hit of bitter, spicy hops. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation. Very well done. I seemed to prefer this one over the Flossmoor version due to the bigger citrus presence.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;It seems that the suppliers thought that Munster is located in Illinois, and so the 3F folk got the goods to brew this year’s Illinois Craft Brewers Guild replicale. (I can’t wait to see what they do with Indiana’s replicale... and Michigan’s... and Ohio’s...) It pours a dark reddish brown with a thick beige head and does some intricate lacing. The aroma is hoppy, of course (this is Three Floyds), pine resin with a hit of grapefruits. The malts are toasty, sweet, and spicy. The flavor is pretty well balanced to begin with, but the bitterness from the hops - pine, grapefruit, earth - intesifies as you drink. It finishes on a warm, bitter note. Nice. Three Floyds Brewing Company and Brewpub, Munster, IN
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Draught. At the brewpub. Very interesting idea, and I was stoked to try this one, then the Flossmoor version a few hours later. Poured ruby-brown with an average rocky off-white head. Solid roast malt, rye and herbal/resin hop aroma. The taste had the same components, but the rye grain was almost carbonized, making the taste more bitter than the fairly balanced aroma, to the beer’s benefit - a nice light alcohol warmth joined the resin yielding a nice bitter roasty finish. The body seemed a bit flaccid, but it didn’t detract much from the solid carbonation and astringency - nice medium-long bitter linger on my tongue. Very, very good, maybe a tad thin - seemed almost cask-like, several pints would go down very easily and smoothly.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Draft at Floyds. Mild hop nose right off the glass (suprised?). Deep red body that admits no highlight in the low light of the pub, except at the bottom. A thin scum of head. Very lightly carbonated, might even pass for a cask beer if I hadn’t been told that yes, it is pressurized. Slight warming alcohol is all that keeps it from being a great session beer. Hops finally take a stand at the end, playing footsie with every taste bud on the way down.
Three Floyds Replicale/West Coast Red Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This was a dark ruby beer with mild head ,malty but with a nice finish,very drinkable with a little FFF hop taste to it and malty.CHEERS to the guys for doing this one ,not bad at all. .
River City Happy Heifer Hefeweizen;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Tap at Midwest Brewfest. Pours a cloudy, thick yellow with an aroma of clove and banana. Flavor is watery clove. Average mouthfeel. Blah.
River City Happy Heifer Hefeweizen;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);On tap at the Parkville Microbrew Festival. An outdstanding beer! Giant liquid Woody Allen banana flavor! Strong banana esters in the aroma. This big, big sweetness disappears rapidly leaving a quick clean finish. Very good beer.
Blind Tiger Scarface Pilsener;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the Parkville Microbrew Festival. Simply a horrible beer. Totally watery in that it lacks any malt body or sweetness. This insolent cur has the audacity to throw an unpleasant burnt flavor at you upon finish.
Landmark Black Gold;Henan, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Landmark Brewery;Smells like caramel candies and b.o. Pours dark brown with a bubbly head. Taste is mostly sweet caramel with a little bitterness. Drinkable, but I don’t really know how to classify it. Way too watery, could use a lot more substance- a lot more malt and alcohol.

E9 Centennial Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;IPA;E9 Brewing Co.;Enjoyed this one on draught at the brewpub in Tacoma, WA. Pours to a slightly hazy, deep golden to amber color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is pungent and fragrant with big herbal/cirtus hop aromas that flood the nose. The palate is firm, with a good base of pale and biscuit malt, paired with a good herbal/citrus hop tang. This beer finishes with more good pale malt and tangy hop flavor up front, then ends with a bitter citrus/herbal hop bite that lingers. Excellent IPA that showcases Centennial hop aromas, flavors, and bitterness. Excellent aperitif beer, a great pint to match with foods on the brewpub’s menu, and a nice beer to sip and relax with at the bar.
E9 Centennial Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;IPA;E9 Brewing Co.;Tap - Brewery A deep golden color with a thick hop aroma. This was the best beer I had this day here at the Engine house. Liked the malt characters and the hops where very good. For a PNW they could add a few more pounds of hops to go up in IBU’s. Not bad and I will order this again when I go back.

Kácov Hubertus 10° Svìtle Vyèepni Nefiltrované;Kácov, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Hubertus Kácov;Draught at U Klokoènika in Prague. That brewery was my top surprise of a Czech tour, so it is no surprise that the yeast version of a contender as my trip favourite is killer. It is minimally hazy, bright and golden with a humongous 2-inches styrofoam top that lasts forever. Ridiculously easy 5. Somehow though, it is less delightfully straightforward as its filtered brother. Nonetheless, its freshness is to be lauded and its full-body is most impressive. Very fresh impression and convincing on the hop side with its leafy, herbal, spicy and... green side. A marvelous lager.

Plenty of lacing. Aroma: yeasty with light malt and less hops. A sour note, presumably from the yeast. Taste: a bit sweet at first, but bitter hops kick in mid-taste and leave a long lasting finish. M - moderstely carbonated and crisp, with a medium body that is somewhat full for style. A bit less dry than a typical Czech pilsner. O - very good with no flaws to complain about, unless you find the sour note in the aroma objectionable, but not special either

Dry Dock Trafalgar Braggot;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Mead;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Tried at the brewery in 2010. I appreciate the unique flavor but this beer tastes like the brewmaster used licorice as a sweetening agent. Points for inventiveness.
Dry Dock Trafalgar Braggot;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Mead;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. The brewmaster graciously gave us a sample of this BEFORE THE OFFICIAL OPENING TIME, thus likely violating all the rules of god and man. I’m so glad he lives on the edge because this is perhaps the best braggot I have ever tasted. Way better than my own homebrew braggot. I’m thinking that this is more on the mead end of the scale. I had always thought that braggot was 50-50 honey and malt, but this tastes like all honey with a slash of beer in it. So smooth. So heavenly.
Dry Dock Trafalgar Braggot;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Mead;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap @ Dry Dock poured a clear brown with a small lasting off white head. Aromas of honey, carmel, toffee and light spice. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of honey, carmel, light toffeeand a hint of fruitiness with a crisp slightly dry fruity finish.
Taylors Crossing Czech Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Truck Beer Company;Beautiful floral and spicy hops greet the nose followed by toasty malts and a touch of butter. Clear golden body is topped by a dense, fine bubbled white head that lasts well and laces. Buttery character is far stronger in the flavour with toasty malts and moderate bitterness. Medium carbonation to the light body with a fairly slick and oily texture. Sampled on tap with Oakes and CapFlu at the brewpub in May 2007.
Taylors Crossing Czech Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Truck Beer Company;(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub. Pours a nicely carbonated deep amber body with a quick dissipating head. Nose of grassy hops and a mild canned corn. Flavour is slightly spiced, oily and has tones of diacetyl. Okay but average.
Taylors Crossing Czech Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Truck Beer Company;Golden colour. The head wasn’t terribly rich, though, especially for this style. Rich saaz nose with hints at big, bready malts. Moderately bitter flavour with a nice, slightly grassy saaz character. Apparently I missed the diacetyl, but I’ve got no problem with that. I ordered another and another and another.

THIS IS NOT ONE damn you caps locki. as i was saying, this is not one i really anaylize i just ordewr it drink it and smile. a nice slightly strong session beer. on a side note, i think these guys could do a good 3.4ish session, i hope thye try it at some point.

Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Draft. Pours a ruby brune body with a thin white lacing. Big fruity flavor of raspberries, medicinal cherry and loads of alcohol, maybe vodka-esk. Light oak but just very strong.
Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;MBG Winter Fest 2008, sample from oak barrel. Poured hazy reddish brown with an average fizzy off-white head that lasted with good lacing. Heavy raspberry, tart fruity and wood aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium sweet & sour fruity balanced flavor and a medium sweet woody finish of moderate duration. Good young that should be better with some age.
Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;(Barrel) Pours a cloudy purplish-brown body with a small off-white head. Aroma of raspberries, overly ripen apples lying in an apple orchard, red grapes, light floral, and earthiness. Flavor of sweet, semi-tart raspberry, apple, grapes, and caramel with a dry oak finish. Excellent!
Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;cask sample at MBGWF....poured a nice amber reddish burnt brown with a thin soapy off-white head....nose was really woody and vinous with a big raspberry component.... flavors of red fruit, wood, and earth.
Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Served out of a cask at the MBG winter fest. This one was a surprise so I was excited to try it. Nice woody raspberry on the nose. I think somebody described this before as actually eating the raspberrys vine and all. I thought the same thing. Nice lucsious raspberry with a strong wood character. Very nice overall.
Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2008 MBG Winter Fest, served from a oak cask: Brown with lots of ruby highlights, minimal head nor lace. The aroma is indeed raspberry along with clean oak, grassy, and just a beginning hint of Brettanomyces. The taste is acidic sourness and fruit with just a dash of pale and caramel malting. The finish is a touch woody and alcoholic. The mouth feel is sprite and a bit dry, warming. A good beer that should only get better once the funk takes hold.
Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Last drops from the barrel at Michigan Winter Beer Fest 2008. Sorry everyone. Glad i got a chance to have this. Nice raspberry and oak scent and flavor. I didn’t find as much alcohol in it as other people were saying. Hidden under all the fruit.
Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Sampled at the NOTB. The biggest surprise of the night for me. Was not expecting too much. Aroma was wood and rasberry. Solid blend. Flavor was about the same. One of the few beers that stood out for me and golubj.
Kuhnhenn Framboise;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;First sample at NOTB EBF 08. Pours a murky violet tinted brownish gray with prety much no head and a very low carbonation (served from a barrel!). Aroma is intenste raspberry puree but earthy as well with some tartness- not as sweet and enticing as NG Rasp Tart though, and has a wierd phenolic alcohol burn in the end that was off-setting. Flavor is at first sweet rasp then gets a bit tart and finishes astringent with tannin, alcohol burn and paint thinner. Way too boozy and fusely for me- I almost couldnt drink it. I believe they said this was 12+% abv.
Flying Dog Woody Creek White;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flying Dog Brewery;16 ounce draft at the Flying Dog Brewery in Frederick, Maryland. Sweet what to the nose. Dark yellow and cloudy with a thin white head. Taste the wheat and the sugars. Smooth and light. Little spice aftertaste. Wonderful beer. Cheers!
Flying Dog Woody Creek White;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flying Dog Brewery;"From Aug 2007 Purchased as part of a mixed 6Pack at Wilbur's in Ft Collins Pours from 12oz bottle starting off clear but then becomes very cloudy. It was like 2 seperate layers of beer until the clouds took over. ;^) It's got a very nice head of foam and lacing and colourwise, it's more of a pale straw gold. The smell is very fruity with a lot of lemon and lime permeating my nose buds. The taste has good lemon flavour with some spice and wheat and there's also some earthiness. It's pretty noticeable and good until just before the finish when it drops off some leaving it on the watery side. Still, this isn't a bad brew and it's a welcome drink for the hot summer day here in Casper."

Brewsters Jack Beer;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Brewsters Brewing Co. - Saskatchewan;Not as bad as colt 45 or Big Bear, but close. This is the perfect example of how not to brew beer. Soapy, wheat and corn high lite the aroma. Piss yellow with a soapy white non existent head. Way too heavy of a corn taste also very soapy. Very bitter/sour. Strong corn aftertaste. Avoid.
Mussel Inn Bitter Ass Extra Bitter Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;The Mussel Inn;1.3L plastic bottle from supermarket shared in our van. Bit hazy amber with off white head. Lots of butter, caramel, light fruity hops, sweet bready malts, toast, dried berries. Medium sweet and bitter. Just medium bodied.

Aromas f amber malt, baking scones, grassines and perfume. It’s full and creamy, warm and alcoholic. Strong orange peel an amber malt flavours. Bitterness is fairly full on (around 35-40 IBU). Once you get over all the alcohol this creates thirst as good bitter should. Easily my favourite Mussel Inn beer.
Mussel Inn Bitter Ass Extra Bitter Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;The Mussel Inn;on tap at the inn. Dark copper colour. Nice hoppy aroma, think it may have been Fuggles. Light to medium body with a bitterish finish, but not nearly as bitter as the sign promised.

Harrington's Classy Red Session Red IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA - Red;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Standard longneck, bad label. Clear chestnut brown with a short, fluffy khaki head. Sweet, tannic aroma with faint notes of hard cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice type spices. I also pick up dry mustard, oddly. Lightly sweet, low bittering, a little spicy bitterness. Rudderless, but not bad. Low carbonation, watery mouthfeel. Ah well, off to watch rugby. Part of a mixpack from Pak N Save, Albany, Auckland.
Harrington's Classy Red Session Red IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA - Red;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle. Not much on the nose, some nice citrus and sweet malt on the palate, finishes off clean enough. Not memorable enough to buy again.

Aroma is a little lacking, with a little watery caramel and a fairly bland bitterness. Flavour is much more interesting though. There’s plenty of caramel and pepper, some grapefruit bitterness and a nice clean grassy finish. A surprisingly nice beer in a style I’d usually not bother with.

Harrington's Classy Red Session Red IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA - Red;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Hmm- says its american in style but to me it’s a very British tasting ale, with lots of holdings/fuggles, not too much new world ""grapefruit hops""."
Harrington's Classy Red Session Red IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA - Red;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Cloudy copper colour. Little head. Poured from bottle. Malt taste with a bitter finish. Smells like a fruity malt mixture
Harrington's Classy Red Session Red IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA - Red;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Alluring tropical aroma in an amber pour. This is an excellent middle of the road brew that shows how good a regular beer can be if the brewer actually cares.
Harrington's Razor Back;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Amber kleurig bier met een mooie volle schuimkraag, licht zoet en licht bitter met een bittere nasmaak. Medium body.

Harrington's Razor Back;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Clean bitterness, quite fizzy out of the bottle but made it very refreshing on a hot day, quite hoppy for the style but not over the top ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Harrington's Razor Back;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Draft at the source. Clear amber color, solid white head. Aroma of light caramel. Taste is sweet toasted caramel.
Harrington's Razor Back;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);’twas okay, nice chocomalts are the main thing i get from this, and a bit of typical esb fruitiness up top. no all that complex and rather thin, but not a bad effort.
Harrington's Razor Back;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Had to drink from bottle so hard to judge appearance. . Medium carbonation and body. Caramel malts. Citrus. Medium bitterness.
Harrington's Razor Back;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Poured a translucent coppery brown colour with a one- to two-finger light tan head that retained well and laced well. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of malt but strongly of roasted grain. Taste of sweet malt and roasted grain followed by hops bitterness. Not a bitter beer as it is sweeter than it is bitter. Light to medium body. Short smooth, sweet and slightly bitter finish. Different to what a ""bitter"" beer ’should’ be - enjoyable."
Harrington's Razor Back;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Rather cautious, I was expecting this beer to gut me with bitterness, like a ferocious pig would to a horse. But this was not bad at all! Great appearance, pouring dark amber, with a generous head, although it disappears rather quickly. Malty nose and malty taste. No boar taint or bacon smokiness. The bitterness is there, but perhaps not enough to make it premium. Very pleasant though. More sweet than bitter. Nice call.
Harrington's Razor Back;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle, 11C (bottle advises to serve at room temp _and_ at 4-6C), better as it warmed. Clear brown with an off white head. Aroma of chocolate, toffee and nuts. A little watery and rather overcarbonated for this sort of thing. Modest sweetness with some toffee, a little chocolate and nuts. Balancing grassy bitterness with some cocoa.
Alley Kat Herbstweizen Krystal Weizen;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottle stated 4.1%ABV. Poured a hazy straw color with quickly diminishing white head and thin lacing. Aromas of banana and yeast. Taste is yeast and banana with a citrusy hop finish. Carbonation is adequate and a light body. A very nice wheat beer.
Alley Kat Herbstweizen Krystal Weizen;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Clear deep yellow gold brew that produced almost zero head - the pour was a little careful, but there should have been alot more. Zero retention. Aroma is of cloves and dried banana chips and wheat. Taste is soft but appealing - one of the better Alley Kat brews that I have had in a long time. Nice banana taste that is mild but is held in check with the obvious presence of cloves. Wheaty too of course. Mouthfeel is smooth. Good carbonation. Near to medium bodied. Hard to describe the aftertaste as I just ran out of beer.
Alley Kat Herbstweizen Krystal Weizen;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Crystal clear golden yellow body, big rocky cap produced during pour but vanished to nothing after about 10 seconds, very large bubbles are sticking to the walls and bottom of my glass this reminds of a glass of ginger ale. The smell has banana and tons of it, sweet smelling wheat malts and I guess overall it reminds me of banana cream pie, this stuff smells very simple and is very aromatic. Taste is very simple but appealing, wheaty, lots of banana and a touch of spice taste is very light crisp and clean leaving behind no after taste. This brew is very simple tasting and taste the way it should, it’s nothing great but for Alley Kat this is above average.
Alley Kat Herbstweizen Krystal Weizen;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottled at Stockholm Beer Festival 2007. A slightly hazy golden beer with a thick yellowish head. The aroma is sweet with strong notes of citrus and banana, as well as light notes of wheat.

Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;Bottle 330ml Ibis Auckland hotel bar. Pours very dark brown with mahogany colour to the light, small white head that fades quickly. Fancy bottle like mini brandy type. Mild aroma, well carbonated and tastes clean, malty with little hops. Little of the promised chocolate coffee or toffee. By the end of the glass it seems like an inoffensive Porter but in no way memorable. Barely adequate or barely inadequate. There are definitely better NZ Porters out there.
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;500ml bottle from Liquorland Napier. Black color with slight head. Roasted malt aroma. Mild bitterness with roasted malt palate. OK porter.
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;Bottle. Clear, deep mahogany hue, finely bubbled light brown head. Aroma is brown bread and cocoa. The palate delivers the same in flavours, with predominant cola sweetness, and underlying dough and nut notes. Tannic peanut skin dryness in the finish. Thin mouthfeel. A bit odd for a porter, as it lacks both body and roast. I must comment on the bottle-- it is really quite striking in design, with a handsome etched glass emblem at the base of the neck. If only the quality of the beer held up to the quality of the packaging. Earlier Rating: 8/10/2009 Total Score: 2.8 Bottle. Looks great-- deep ruby red, thick brown head. Initially the aroma is very chocolatey, then after resting, some notes of breadcrusts and nuts. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Flavours are chocolate and brown bread, hints of roast. Quite sweet, with low bitterness in the finish. Not terrible, just lacking body really.
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;330ml bottle pours almost black in color with a finger of tan head that leaves some spotted lacing on the glass. Aroma is light toasted grains with chocolate and herbal notes. Taste is a herbal hop bitterness with a caramel and chocolate malty sweetness. Light bodied with average carbonation. Overall, this brew is too light bodied and lacks the bold flavours associated with this style. Mediocre porter at best.
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;"330ml green bottle bought at YATA in MOKO, Mong Kok. Clear blackish brown colour; Three-quarter finger head with beige foam which fades in 40 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with active slight carbonation; Fragrant and sweet aroma of dark malt, with fair roastyness, strong toffee, caramel, strong cream, coffee, light chocolate, sugar, faint dark fruits, yeast and faint grass; Close to light sweet taste of dark malt, with fair roastyness, caramel, light toffee, Cola, very light chocolate, Molasses notes, light bread, yeast, faint lemon, very light bitter hops and very light grass; Close to light body. Slick palate; Mouth Feel is fair dark maltyness in a light but slightly thick body. Roastyness is threadbare. Only some caramel to pop up the otherwise empty Cola taste. Very little chocolate and no coffee at all. Sweetness is minimal. Dry and bready with minimal lemon to end. Blah!... Hoppiness is faint grass in nose. Faint lemon and very light grass in taste; Bitterness is very low for an abrupt, almost non- astringent Cola-bready finish; Fairly dry after taste. Very easy and slightly bitter to mouth. Comments: For a 4% Porter, it has pretty promising aroma in strong toffee and coffee cream, but taste-wise, it’s a typical 4% - empty Cola with non-deScript low roastyness, almost devoid of any dark beer tastes. It’s not bad, it’s just feel like drinking a harmless exercise. Too lightweight for me!"
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;BOTTLE. Poured a cola black with solid cream head.. Dark malts on the nose, some smoke? Assortment of dark, choc & coffee malts blended together with a good creamy finish.. Sourced Rosco
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;I bought this because of the cool bottle and the fact that, according to the sticker on the bottle, it won Gold in the 2014 brewers guild awards. How did this win anything?! Absolutely zero body and very little flavour. Ends on a weird sour note. Extremely disappointing.
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;On tap as the WHANGAMOMONA REPUBLIC DARK ALE at the Whangamomona Hotel. (Katie from the Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery tells me that Whangamomona Republic Dark Ale is the same beer as the Black Duck porter). I really liked this beer and am wondering now if beer always tastes much better when I’m on holiday! Rich ruby brown hue with small diminishing coffee crema head and delicate lacing. Delicious whisky peat toasted roasted malt, wood oil, liquorice,leather, coffee and especially chocolate aromas. Possibly some of those aromas may have been environmental rather than from the beer. Nicely balanced moderate bitterness and sweetness. Tingly carbonation, medium body, mildly oily texture, long dry finish.
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;Nice beer, not too strong in porter flavor. But tast is also a bit weak. Easy to drink, easy to enjoy
Hawkes Bay Black Duck Porter;Napier, New Zealand;Porter;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;Nice roasty aroma. That’s where it stops really. Translucent brown body. Thin bodied, light roasted taste. Not a lot else going on. Heavily carbonated. Bland! Good as an introductory porter I suppose

Indian Wells Mojave Gold;Inyokern, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle at Max’s tasting. Pours a clear gold with a thin white head. Cauliflower, grain, a bit vegetal. Medium-bodied, sweet, grainy. Rather empty.

Indian Wells Mojave Gold;Inyokern, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Indian Wells Brewing;12oz Bottle pours a pale golden color without much head. Not much flavor. Just doesn't taste good even when it's 120F.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);At Mac’s Brewpub in Wellington, NZ, 05.27.10. Hazy orange gold, white head. Aroma is kiwi and citrus. Flavor is citrus hoppy with grass and malt. Thin body, but refreshing.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Draft. A dark golden beer with an off-white head. The aroma has strong notes of hop and grass as well as notes of caramel. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of grass and hops, leading to a dry and very bitter and hoppy finish.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Weirdly hop free nose given the alleged green hopping. Hints of caramel and a slight floral touch. Golden amber, like the 50/50 blend of Hoprocker and Sassy Red the bar poured me as a Brewjolais substitute when I arrived before the keg was on. Very malt driven, lots of crystal sweetness and a slightly chalky finish. No evidence of the hops other than a faint hint of lemon and remained thus even as it warmed. Nice enough beer but the 50/50 blend trumped this on balance.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pleasant hoppy, floral aroma with a nice head and good bitter taste. A seasonal beer - unusual for Lion Nathan/Macs and an attempt to produce something made by a brewer instead of an accountant. Usually served too cold at Macs bars but gets better as it warms up and a nice session beer.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pint at the brewery - day of release. Pours a radiant deep amber. Thin white head. Huge fresh hoppy aromas, bring the citrus and passionfruit home. Theres a bit of caramel malt underneath. Flavour has intense resiny hops, coating the mouth with a pleasant bitterness. The finish lasted about 10mins with the fresh brew. She became more subdued and balanced over time, still amazing. Cheers for this one Ally!
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);On tap at The Vic in Nelson. Hugely fragrant tropical fruit hop aroma. Luscious hop flavours dominate as well: passionfruit, tangerine, mango. Underlying malts are sweet and supportive. Finish is very bitter. In my mind this played as an American-style IPA but without the big ABV. Excellent.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);2009, enjoyed thoroughly with Donfardz64 on the waterfront in Wellington. Dense white head with a lovely amber hue. Floral, fruity hops, complemented by a sweet malt. Damn attractive aroma, although not strong coming out of the tap. A nice bitterness in the flavour, balanced excellently by the malt. The hops manifest as grapes, pears and lime. Clean on the palate with plenty of hop flavour in the finish. Kind of like a sexed-up Hop-Rocker.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bright orange in colour with firm white head. Citrus hoppy mouthfeel. Nice bitterness but was short. One of the better batchs.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Draught, pouring a sparkling clear golden amber with a white bubbly head. The aroma is very pleasing, juicy malts dominate with a strong fruity hop kick. A strong tropical fruit hop palate with plenty of bitterness and dryness. Reminiscent to me of the old Limburg Hopsmacker - very tasty. So much better than the rest of the Macs range it is difficult to believe it is from the same brewery.
Mac's Brewjolais;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"I’ve tried this the last couple of years and thought it was very good. Never got around to rating it, as much as I enjoyed it. The 2008 vintage is excellent. I sip a glass of water and watch the world go by, as the two ""pints"" in front of me warm up and await the arrival of BozoNZ. Rich amber in the gloomy autumnal evening light, a little shy of brilliant, and topped off with a retreating off-white snow melt head. Sweet sticky malt greets the nose all the way from the table, with a rich and ripe fruity hop note comnig through as I lift the glass. Great malt/hop balance in the mouth. The hops are earthy, slightly sappy/piny and iron-like, with those classic kiwi tropical fruit notes coming through too. The malt is at the rich-end of being ""typically Mac’s"" - bready, with hints of vanilla. Taste bud stripping bitterness sneaks up on you and demands hot salty chips. We oblige and my palate is muted. For all of this it is a pretty clean beer, and superbly drinkable. Three pints and I’m on my bike. I’ll be back. Cheers Mac’s! I call her ""Brewjolina"", she should be a celebrity couple."
Hams Brewhouse J. Allyns Robust Porter;Greenville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Hams Restaurant & Brewhouse;Sampled on draft at the brewpub. Pours a dark red tinted brown color with a medium head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma is roasted malts with some fruity notes.

Hams Brewhouse J. Allyns Robust Porter;Greenville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Hams Restaurant & Brewhouse;Courtesy of Quake1028. The aroma is mildly tart with muted roast malt notes, coffee and shoe leather. The body is a dark ruby-tinted brown color. Molasses, toasted grains, mild chcolate and coffee notes make up the flavor. Again it is a little tart and also tangy.
Hams Brewhouse J. Allyns Robust Porter;Greenville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Hams Restaurant & Brewhouse;Thanks to matador for providing the growler. Black pour, no head, but the growler leaked a bit so I can cut it some slack. On the nose we have coffee, tart fruit, cocoa, molasses, tobacco and shoe leather. The taste features many of the same elements. Average mouthfeel, medium bodied. A very average porter.
Hams Brewhouse J. Allyns Robust Porter;Greenville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Hams Restaurant & Brewhouse;Poured a dark brown from the tap. Had a frothy head , with no lacing. Had weak hints of roasted malts and barley. Had weak hints of hops, and spices. Very dissapointed. Nothing special here.
Hams Brewhouse J. Allyns Robust Porter;Greenville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Hams Restaurant & Brewhouse;Draft at Greenville location. Opaque black with a small head. Aroma is a touch of smoke, earth, and metallic spicy hops. Palate is smooth, medium-bodied, a little watery and has a slight metallic twinge. Flavors of spicy chocolate, coffee, sweet smoke. Slightly better than average porter.
Hams Brewhouse J. Allyns Robust Porter;Greenville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Hams Restaurant & Brewhouse;Growler from the brewery courtesy of frumptydumpty. Thanks Ryan. Pours a dark brown with a coca-cola like body. Nose is light chocolate, some coffee, and roasted malts. Flavor is similar to aroma, with a little tobbacco, and smoke in there too. Palate is a bit thin and lacking, but this also makes this an easy drinking porter for those just getting into the style. In any case, a noble attempt from an up and coming brewpub in eastern NC.
Craig Street Spring Bock;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Craig Street Brewing;(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub on May 26, 2007. Pours a thin, white creamy head with a deep copper body. Nose of mild malts and a tad bready. The flavour is crisp, though I doubt the server’s claim that this is a weizen bock. Traditional bocks of this style are between 9-14 ABV and this one is only a 5.7 - in addition, the wheat flavour doesn’t make itself terrible apparent. Its on the lighter side but is a nicely balanced lager none the less. I would be able to drink this regularly.
BJ's Pear Cider;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Perry;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On Tap at BJ’s Reno Location. Pours out a crisp light yellow topped with no head. Aroma of sweet pears and apples. Tast a little tart but very nice and pear like. Not bad.

BJ's Pear Cider;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Perry;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Pours with a yellowish, tinged clear hued sparkling body. Aroma is a bit artifical fruit. Taste is very sweet and cloying. Artifical tastes again. Too fizzy.

Schwarzenberg Stout;Wien, Austria;Stout;Stadtbrauerei Schwarzenberg;Lasting tan head lingers over the not completely black robe. Quite straightforward nose of coffee grains, very burnt nose with ashes notes aplenty. Still, it keeps a fair dose of residual sugars, not quite caramelly, but a bit of a brown sugar touch to them. More roast steals the finale as little hops are felt at all and the grainy bitterness takes over. Gentle carbonation, light-medium bodied. An all-roast stout, perhaps not my style, but quality stuff.
Schwarzenberg Stout;Wien, Austria;Stout;Stadtbrauerei Schwarzenberg;(Draught at the brewpub) Coffee, roasted malty and licorice aroma.

Ottos Spruce Creek Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Otto's Pub and Brewery;This is what my friends order if they don’t want anything terribly heavy or bold-flavored. That should tell you everything you need to know! Drinkable, not bitter, smooth, grainy.
Ottos Spruce Creek Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Transfer from BA - Poured from growler into pint glass. Appearance - A pale straw color with a billowing white head that dissipated quickly. Smell - Not a whole lot of aroma, maybe a bit of malt and a little bit of caramel, but not much Taste - the taste matches the smell quite well. Not much about it. At the front a little bit of sweet caramel malt. Beyond that not a whole lot of detectable flavors present. Mouthfeel - For the lightness of the beer I felt it had a relatively nice body in terms of turbidity. The level of carbonation was just right. Overall - The beer could use a bit more robustness. Not the best of the brewpubs brews. It would however possibly be a good brew on a hot day after doing some good work outside. Its lightness would be fitting there.

Hans Red Wolf;Xian, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hans Beer Brewery (Tsingtao);628 ml. bottle. Pours golden with small white head. Smells of stale hops, a little flowery but also something synthetic to it. Flavor is ok. Soapy hops dominate, also some malt and rice flavors. Some bitterness. But also an underlying plastic taste. Pretty good for a chinese lager.

Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at the brewpub. Deep hazy orange-gold beer. Creamy white head. Aroma is quite bready and malty. Very nice crackery maltiness. Quite clean with a bit of yeasty crackery maltiness. Lightly spicy hoppiness. Nice fresh bready crackery flavour. Great balance with a light peppery character on the back. Light herbal/leafy hoppiness with a peppery finish. They call this a dubbel, which it isn’t, but it’s a pretty solid altbier.
Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at BF. Aroma of sweetish, orange fruits, toasted/baked malt. Flavor more of that malt with some leafy hops, particular at the finish. A bit sweet/cloying at times, but not in an overbearing way. Honestly had no idea what style it was as I drank it, but I guess I don’t feel so bad since others have said the same. All in all, not bad.
Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a hazy light brown with a small head. Aroma of sweet malt. Flavor is quite sweet with some fruity notes and candi sugar. Ok to drink but not very exciting. I was surprised to find out that this was an Abbey Dubbel because I didn’t detect any yeasty notes nor any other flavors you typically get in dubbels. An ok beer. 6/4/7/4/13 (3.4/5)
Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;"Tap at the Brewpub: Brown pour with an amber hue, and a thin off-white head. Looks pretty muddy, and I like it! Toasty aroma with some mild brown sugar qualities. It has that nice, dense, creamy body that Black Forest’s beers generally have. The flavor shows some dark malt sweetness, caramel-like, but doesn’t seem Belgian. I think it’s the yeast he used. Stuff seems more like a Scotch Ale. Has a mild roast and an earthy touch. The Belgian candi-sugar isn’t apparent at all, but overall it’s pretty tasty; however it didn’t have much Belgian character."
Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;Describing it as ’all mixed together’ is really the best way to describe it. Rather a cloudy ruby headless pour. General flavor of some light cherry and amber flavors, with a hop finish that seemed strangely out of place. It isn’t bad, it just feels awkwardly put together. However, I must say that of the 5 things on tap at the brewpub that day, I would choose this one hands down again.
Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;Draft @ Black Forest. Nice dance between malt and hops here with a nice cherry flavor mixed in with the sweet caramels. Poor head retention though and although the flavors were all mixed up, it all comes back together. Nice job Joe.
Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at the brewpub - strange - it’s as if a doppelbock and a dubbel had a bastard child - the aroma is an interesting mix of sweet german malts and light belgian yeast and candi sugar notes - the flavor isn’t as sweet as the aroma suggests - some caramel and slight munich malt flavors, along with notes of cherries and a mild tartness on the back end - some raisin and brown sugar in the finish - fairly light and easy to drink, despite it’s strength - an interesting hybrid.
Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;sampled at the brewpub, took a growler of this one. Deep reddish amber in color. Aroma is very malty, caramel, with fruit and sugar notes. Taste is again, pretty sweet (but not overly cloying) caramal, raisins, sugar, with not much hop presence in the finish.
Black Forest Klosterbrau Brown;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Dubbel;Black Forest Brew Haus;Billed as a German/Belgian Dubbel hybrid. Tap @ brewpub, served in tall mug. Color is amber-brown, a clear beer but dark enough to make clarity medium, half the glass is filled with light translucence. Aroma is pretty strong, dark fruits, sugary maltiness, and sweet candied apples. Taste is very clean, very sweet german maltiness - sticky sweet brownie flavor. Finishes very clean with almost no bitterness at all. A light thirst quenching beer but sweet enough to keep one interested.
Goose Island 19 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Growler shared at ’Biegaman’s Summer Gathering’ -- courtesy of Lexx, all the way from Chicago. Hoppy Kool-Aid aroma - nice. Sweet nutty taste - tastes liked kicked up beery iced-tea. Interesting hops and malt here, not your run of the mill stuff. Sugary. Very nice and quite drinkable. Huge thanks to Lexx for the opportunity to try this growler!
Goose Island 19 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampler at Clybourn. Ruddy brown, semi-opaque pour with a slight glown when held to the light. Thin foam. Definite American slap of Amarillo and other Pacific hops. A nice US twist on a traditional English style, combined with well-tuned crystal malts. Dances on the tongue. GI makes some nice extreme beers, but the session styles at the brewpubs are equally worthy.
Goose Island 19 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught. At the Clybourn brewpub. Poured hazy dark copper with an average on-tap off-white head. Pleasant if mild somewhat bitter aroma of fresh grassy hops and caramel light malt aroma, very mild alcohol. Very soft and easy-drinking taste, quite hoppy but not aggressively so, grassy to herbal hops spread liberally over a solid, sweet, malty body, the finish is balanced, definitely has a bit of booze to it, but not too sweet - reminded me a bit of an organic herbal iced tea at one point. Decent ESB body - pehaps a little thick, nice restrained astringency, very mild carbonation, quick flavour finish but it did leave a bit more alcohol on my palate than I’d expect from a classic ESB. Tasty, though - nicely hoppy without being overdone.
Goose Island 19 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Chicago trip. Monday 14:17+. Muddy dark amber-orange/copper. No head. APA hop aroma. IPA taste with a strong malt body and finish. Sweet notes of alcohol. The alcohol dominates creating a dark IPA-malt liquor flavour.
Goose Island 19 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pours a deep dark iced-tea color. Quite sweet and heavier body. Not a huge fan, have had many better ESB’s from GI...

Pours a cloudy orange-amber with a small diminishing off-white head. Very nice aroma of floral hops, caramel malt, citrus and other fruit. Flavour follows the aroma: floral hops backed by caramel malt along with some citrus and toffee and a pleasant bitter finish -- very refreshing and flavourful. Medium bodied. A somewhat unique take on the style, I really enjoyed it.
Chiltern Nut Brown Mild;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Chiltern Brewery;Cask gravity at the Berko beer fest. A clear chestnut brown coloured pour with a lasting grayish head.

Palate is tangy, semi sweet, moderate carbonation. Ok. Lingering roast.
Chiltern Nut Brown Mild;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Chiltern Brewery;Decent enough dark mild although perhaps not the most flavoursome on offer. Colour is heading towards porter with (at least where I drank it) a thick off-white head. Not a particularly strong finish but that’s only what is to be expected of a mild.

Braustelle Helios Tripelbock;Cologne-Ehrenfeld, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Gasthaus-Brauerei Braustelle;0.33 l bottle from ’CraftBeer-Dealer.com’, best before February 2017. Slight gusher! Hazy, golden amber with a large, foamy, slowly diminishing, white head. Sourish-fruity, quite funky aroma of lemon, gooseberry, white grapes, sweat and urine. Sweetish-malty, a bit sourish, slightly funky and a bit fruity taste of caramel, honey, white grapes, gooseberry, lemon and some urine, followed by a rather long, medium grassy-bitter, moderately tart finish. Medium to full body, a bit astringent, slightly creamy and quite effervescent mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Quite tasty actually, expected the worst after the slight gusher and the sourish-funky aroma. Typical Braustelle stuff with an infection, but it’s not bad at all!

I really was happy to see a new beer on tap, and i went back today to have another and they were out. Hopefully it’ll be back soon. This was a pretty good Pils. Nose wast musty malt, like a cellar. Poured a golden orange color with a thin white foam head. Flavors were sort of biscuity and caramelly with some notes of some lighter malts also. Pretty tasty new beer.
Yamatogawa Rashiku Sake;Kitakata City, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Yamatogawa;Clear. The aroma is very assertive - toasty, balsa wood, bamboo shoots...nice. Sweetish palate with a clean rice note. Soft body but fills the mouth. Hints at shiitake, enoki and bamboo shoots. Very drinkable.
Silver Peak Kolsch;Reno, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;Pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Faint malty aroma and taste with a hint of grain in the finish.
Silver Peak Kolsch;Reno, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;Draft sample from brewpub. Pours clear light amber with a small white head. The aroma was bready malts with a light fruitiness and not much else. The flavor was the same as the nose with a slightly dry and lightly bitter finish. This was pretty bland overall.
Silver Peak Kolsch;Reno, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;On Tap- The beer is a light golden color with a decent head that fades. The aroma is a light mixture that is lemony and herbal. The taste is slightly lemony and crisp. It has a light body with a dry finish and is very refreshing. The beer was much better than I expected. It goes down easy and is very satisfying. This looks like a good summer brew or anytime actually.
Silver Peak Kolsch;Reno, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;A blonde beer with a creamy white head. A biscuitty malt aroma. In mouth, a rather solventy taste, with grainy malt, a bit cloying and overbearing for the style. On tap at brewpub, August 2007.
Silver Peak Kolsch;Reno, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;This a very bad funky sour milk aroma. This aroma is a precursor to the beer. Sour milk and heavy, this is certainly not what was intended. Most likely guess is that this got contaminated somehow.
Silver Peak Prohibition Pale Ale;Reno, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;A nice simple floral aroma. This is really quite nice. A light hoppiness throughout, this is definitely one pale ale that could be a great session beer.
Blue Frog Pell Ell;Fairfield, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Frog Brewery;Very good pale ale here. Big fruity nose from what was obviously a very significant dose of hops. Some malts in there as well but hops are what this brew is all about. Slightly sweet flavor up front, but finishes with a dry and crisp bitterness. Outstanding.
Stews Cerveza de Viena;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stews Sportatorium;Some light malt aroma, this is a pretty tasty beer. Light caramel notes and an easy beginning. Faint hops in the finish.
Stews Silver Spur Dark Lager;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Stews Sportatorium;A nice malty dark aroma. Coffee. The flavor has a lot of cocoa and roastiness. An alright beer that tastes heavier than the alcohol allows.
Blue Frog Maibock!;Fairfield, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blue Frog Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Light amber color with a lightly lacing white head. Light caramel aroma with a little grassy hop. Medium body with mild carbonation. Flavor is caramel with a surprising dose of citrus/grass bitter. Ends lightly sweet with lingering bitter. [I used that word in my brewpub notes hours before I saw HighWine’s rating]. Quite nice.
Blue Frog Maibock!;Fairfield, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blue Frog Brewery;Seasonal tap at the brewery. Straw color, thin white head. Faint nose witha touch of sour apple. Good balance of hops and malt. The bittering hops linger
Blue Frog Maibock!;Fairfield, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blue Frog Brewery;10 ounce sample tasted at Rubcon’s Maibock Festival. Faint, grainy, metallic hopped aroma with some cardboardy aromas, too. Transparent golden body with a small foamy off-white head. Sprizy, rather carbonated start with some sweet malts present. Some honey-like flavors then follow. Finishes with a mild metallic hoppiness. Pretty drinkable stuff.
Blue Frog Maibock!;Fairfield, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blue Frog Brewery;Pours golden with medium head. Aromas are mildly malty. Flavors are a bit sweet. It’s an average brew, nothing really stands out about it.
Stews Scooters Oatmeal Stout;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Stout;Stews Sportatorium;A nice rich aroma with a little hops. The flavor is much too thin and simple on this. Certainly didn’t pick up any oatmeal. Room for improvement.
Stews Prospector Robust Porter;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Porter;Stews Sportatorium;Not that much of an aroma. The flavor definitely has some robust roasty characters. Not too sweet but fairly malty. Pretty decent.
Stews Lucky Spur Light Lager;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stews Sportatorium;From the Jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 13/10/2007 Malt and hop aromas. Golden coloured and pale with a crisp and dry malt finish.
Stews Lucky Spur Light Lager;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stews Sportatorium;Nothing in the aroma. For a light lager beer, this was really quite pleasant. A good hop bite in the finish and clean and crisp throughout.
Stews Clark Creek Crystal Wheat;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Wheat Ale;Stews Sportatorium;Smells of the lemon they put in it. This is bad (like most of this style), with or without the fruit. Just untasty and far too wheaty.
Stews V & T Honey Ale;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stews Sportatorium;Smells like light honey. Really not so bad for a honey beer, since it only really comes out in the end. At little alcohol at the finish. Suprisingly their strongest brew.
Stews Palmeno Pale Ale;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stews Sportatorium;A nice floral citrus aroma. A little bit light in color. A pleasant beginning segues into a bit of nutty characters at the end. Decent but not outstanding.
Stews Cerveza Ligera;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stews Sportatorium;Nothing in the aroma except the lime they put in it. Mostly this doesn’t taste like anything, just yellow water. Only this and the wheat were truly undrinkable to me.
Backstreet Tiny Bubbles Bock;Anaheim, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Backstreet Brewery;On tap at the Irvine location. Pours a semi-transparent, bronze-ish amber color with a healthy finger of fizzy white head. Fruity yeast aromatics that are a bit surprising, considering the style. Bosc pears and fuji apples back up a honey malt sweet backdrop. Light bodied, tingly carbonated mouthfeel. Lots of fruity sweetness, but I feel like the sweet attributes are coming from the yeast influence rather than the malt base. A bit more honey with some sweet apple juice concentrate. A little bit of crisp toasted french bread crusts make a grasp for some semblence of a bready malt backbone. Minimal hop bitterness, but a hint of herbal qualities linger in the final smack. I definitely don’t like the sweetness or fruity characters palate-wise, but the body is nice, light, and smooth, making this a refreshing sipper.
Offshore Fogcutter Breakfast Porter;Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Offshore Ale Company;Very tasty porter. Roasty with a sweet malty undertone. A bit of coffee, but well balanced. Really good - I’m glad I picked up a couple to go. It is pretty complex, and you can savor it a bit. It cellars well too. RB says it is retired - I’m not sure about that. It shouldn’t be!
Offshore Fogcutter Breakfast Porter;Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Offshore Ale Company;Velvety black with minimal head. Can smell the coffee right off the bat. Slick palate with solid but not overwhelming carbonation. Taste is rich roasty maltiness with a massive amount of coffee added. like biting into a mocha brownie. Worth the trip across the ferry.
Back Street Rainbox Copper Ale;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);On tap at the Irvine location. Slightly hazy, brassy gold colored pour with a thin layer of wispy off-white head. Dry, bitter malt backbone that has an almost rye-like, borderline husk tannin quality that is a bit astringent. Toasted baguette with a light caraway seed spice. A moderate herbal hop bitterness heightens the astringent sensation, but doesn’t contribute much besides adding bitter grassy qualities. Light to medium bodied, crisply carbonated mouthfeel. The carbonation is the perfect compliment for the flavor profile. I hate to use the word astringent to describe both the hop and malt characters, but it really fits best. The beer is enjoyable, but the puckering qualities seem to be developed from equal contributions by the malt and hop profiles. Spent grain husks and herbal grassy hops finish this one out quickly and cleanly, resulting in a simple and straightforward, yet easy drinking brew.

Bad Münstereifeler Fest Bock;Bad Münstereifel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kleines Eifeler Brauhaus;#641 Mittleres Bernstein, leicht trüb und sehr wenig Schaum. Ein erst säuerliches, dann ins malzige umschlagende Aroma. Im Antrunk für einen Bock sehr leicht geraten. Primär süßmalziger Geschmack, ja fast schon zu süß.

Langton Hop On;Thorpe Langton, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Langton Brewery;Clear copper, very little head. Light and fairly uninteresting malty aroma.

Silver Creek Imperial Mai-Bock;Cedarburg, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Silver Creek Brewery;Beer #25 at GTMW ’09. Just looks fine in the glass. Nice lager smell, just a little heavy.

Silver Creek Imperial Mai-Bock;Cedarburg, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Silver Creek Brewery;Sampled @ GTMW ’09 - Amber clear pour with a small white head. Smells of apple, but not much else -- a little sweet malt. Taste is lots of alcohol heat, more malt, and the same apple in the smell. The carbonation was jacked up to high, and there just wasn’t much here. Not a fan.
Silver Creek Imperial Mai-Bock;Cedarburg, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Silver Creek Brewery;Orange-brown color profile. First thing that hits you is the strong peppery alcohol.

Hans Kugua Beer;Xian, China;Flavored - Fruit;Hans Beer Brewery (Tsingtao);618ml bottle. Sampled in Xi’an. Exciting, a beer made from what I think is probably the most bitter food on earth. Pour golden with short white head. Aroma is ricey lager with slight flowery hop smell. Smells fresh. A little bit more bitter than the average chinese lager, which is really very tame. No sweetness. Extremely light and watery. Dry bitterness and rice in the aftertaste. Does not have as much of the bitter melon bitterness as I would like, but overall pretty well balanced.

The only beer on there tap list at the time taking advantage of NC popping-the-cap. Pours a slightly cloudy, washed out golden color. Smells of sweet oranges and lemons. The flavor adds more hoppiness to the fruit tastes than I was expecting and it’s a nice addition. I also tasted some bananas. This is a remarkably refreshing summer brew for an 8%er and will be the first beer I order whenever it’s on tap at Top of the Hill. Too bad they don’t bottle it yet cause I’d love to have a few of these on my porch back home.
Top of the Hill Swim Test Saison;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Top of the Hill Brewery;"On tap at the brewery. Thanks for hookup Daniel--its nice having old elementary school chums working the bar. Pleasantly surprised to see a saison from the guys. Finally getting into the mix. Swim Test pours a hazy clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma is spicey and fruity with definite whiffs of yeast. Flavor is fruity and spicey with notes of orange peel and coriander. I had two imperial pints of this and I have to say I was impressed. These pints (coupled with the two ipa’s I had in additon to future liquor drinks) led to my demise later that evening and the following morning as I slept in and was late for work. At least I took some notes and actually remember enjoying these pints. I really hope ""topo"" will continue this trend with more adventurous offerings like this."

Stryke Pils;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);"Canned.

Aroma is not there, perhaps some slight roast but that is it. Taste is fruity refreshing malty fullbodied goodness. Not about hops but about malt and body.

Buntingford Highwayman;Royston, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Buntingford Brewery;Draught (Maypole, Camdbridge) Sweet caramelly aroma. Some vegetal hints. Nutty taste. Grainy too, some veg, and even beaniness. Perhaps fading a little, but wasn’t flat and dead in the mouth.

Breconshire Beacon 50 (Golden Bannau);Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Breconshire Brewery;From the Bottle at Tom’s Ultimate Glasgow Tasting, Blackfriars 01/12/2007 Some fruit and malt aromas. Amber coloured fruity and a little rich on the palate. Crisp and slightly bitter finish.
Breconshire Beacon 50 (Golden Bannau);Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Breconshire Brewery;Rich spiritous cask wood, cakey almond, sherry, toffee, mocca and single malt snout. On paper exactly the sort of malt-heavy richness that ordinarily turns me right off, in fact. But here it just works. Background chocolate and hopleaf interest to keep me guzzling. Alcohol right at the front, unfolding into choclolate creaminess, nuts, milky Rauch notes, berry fruit and currant. The usual applepeely BC tones. Chestnut and ivory with intricate lace. Slightly out of date bottle, and none the worse for it.
Breconshire Beacon 50 (Golden Bannau);Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Breconshire Brewery;Bottle (in NZ), light brown colour which is a littly hazy (not surprising as gthe neck is caked with sediment) and no head. Coffee is the most dominant aroma, but there is a little chocolate in there too, a touch bready and some stewed fruit. A touch tart, though I will put this down to the travel. The palate is a touch thin, the hops come through a lot stronger than in the aroma, with a definite raisin flavour. Interestingly, the malt doesn’t really come through at all, though the finish is a little roasty. I’ve given this the benefit of the doubt on a few counts.
Breconshire Beacon 50 (Golden Bannau);Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Breconshire Brewery;50cl. bottle: Pours a nice orangey chestnut with pretty creamy beige head. Coffee, toffee, and chocolate balanced nicely with hops, raisin, dark rum, and dried leaves. Smells a bit darker than it looks. On the tongue there is some nice toasted brown bread (think thick sliced heavy Irish brown bread) with a sprinkling of cocoa powder. Then hops come in to break up the toast a little. Some fruit follows. Possibly raisin and just a slight tough of something citrus. Roast comes back in and lasts through the finish with mild coffee. Also a touch of cookie dough adds some sweetness in the final seconds, but still ending dry. Quite nice
Breconshire Beacon 50 (Golden Bannau);Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Breconshire Brewery;Bottle. Brown with a small head. Aromas are sweet weetabix malts with some smoky notes and peppery hops. Flavours are malty with sweet toffee. Rummy and rich with prickly hops. Dry on the finish.

Breconshire Beacon 50 (Golden Bannau);Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Breconshire Brewery;Pours a hazy dark brown/burgundy color with a big white head that leaves a small film. Aroma is deep, intense and malty. It shows notes of tobbacco, chocolate, truffles, watered down coffee, banana and bailey’s whiskey cream. Flavor is bittersweet with notes of chocolate, truffles, burnt caramenl, hazelnuts and mokka. Wow I liked it a lot.... This one doesn’t need complexity. Smooth silky texture, medium body. Carbonation is medium too. Finish is long, sweet and the aftertaste is chocolatey. A nice beer to sit and enjoy. Thanks to Gazza for this bottle Shared with Lilith and davidpl

Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;"[7300-20080108] Bottle. Smells like unpasteurized honey beeswax. Clear, light yellow body with a medium-lasting foamy white head. Black currant apple tea flavour is not very beer-like at all. Light body. Interesting once you get past the non-beer qualities, could make for an interesting honey beer. (6/3/5/3/11) 2.8 Overheard: ""It’s like something crawled into a champagne bottle and died.""

Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;bottle. Pale golden with one finger head. Sweet pickles and strawberry. I’ve been avoiding this one in the back of the fridge for a few weeks now. Not nearly as terrible as I was expecting. It almost works as a flavor combination. I’ve certainly had worse from Schmohz.
Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;On tap at Quaker Steak. Color was cloudy straw, with pink tinge. Very bland taste. Medium body. Wouldn’t buy again.
Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;Pour from a 12oz bottle, make your own 6 pack from Horrocks in GR. Cloudy weiss looking brew, dirty yellow with surprisingly dense white head. Aroma conjures pickle juice - a little acetic acid overtone, spice, dill, earth, dirty socks. Taste is like sweet zima malt beverage with a little sour and dirty socks and vitamin C in the finish, though the odor - er, aroma - adds to that. Watery mouth feel and palate. This brew should totally and completely suck by any objective measure, but who’s objective? It actually tastes really good.
Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;MBGSF 2011. Poured light pinkish color and an average fizzy white head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Moderate tart fruit aroma. Light to medium body with with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium tingly berry flavor with a medium berry finish of moderate duration. Complex strange change of pace fruit beer.
Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;You know, this beer keeps changing in complexity. The first few batches were outstanding, with a nice, strawberry aroma. Now, it seem to have too much zing and not as pleasant of a seasonal beer as it had been. No bad, though.
Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;Bottle. A hazy yellow color body with a small fizzy white head , short lasting , lively carbonation. Aroma of light sweet berries with a bit of grass, maybe some dill weed . Flavor is slightly metallic with a bit of wheaty type tang ,strawberries and herbal hops ,pale malt . light body, thin feel, short fruity finish . Drinkable but a little off .
Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;12 oz bottle from Party World on Alpine, Grand Rapids, MI. Cloudy, yellow with small white head. Aroma is gross, just gross with dry grain and a weird sour vegetale note, I can’t imagine that they really put pickles in it but it is slightly vinegary. Vinegar flavor up front with vegetale, grain and some sweeter fruit, like strawberry or other red tropical fruit. Light and watery body. This is bad in so many ways. Ugh... definite drain pour.
Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;"12oz Bottle. This smells royally fucked up. When I cracked the bottle, I wasn’t sure if someone had broken a jar of pickled beans on my floor or they were manufacturing styrofoam. Putting the nose dangerously close to the glass, I get a very pungent and acidic mix of pickled vegetables, tending towards Jalapeno, Watermelon, and popcorn. Weird. Pours a clearish hazy gold, with a thin white rim. I’m afraid to drink this. In the mouth, its even worse. Oh god. Did I just drink four day old stale pickled egg juice? Did someone put a cigarette out in this? Or did an old lady die? The description for this beer says, ""No one seems to remember if the name, the logo or the recipe came first, but it was ridiculous."" Try revolting. Who would make and bottle this? Sulphur, vinegar, and ash. Not beer, really. Oh my god. If there really are pickles in this beer, and I think there are, then, well...that’s just fucked up."
Schmohz Pickle Tink;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Schmohz Brewing Co.;on tap at the brewery...cloudy yellowish body with medium white head..aroma of light sugar and strawberry..hints of wheat in the finish..the strawberry that was ever-present in the nose was more absent in the flavor, emphasizing just subtly its fruit....it tasted more like strawberry leaves than the fruit itself, but was very true to strawberry notes (all natural)..nice summer brew

Sternquell Sommerbier;Plauen, Saxony, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sternquell Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Frischer Antrunk, das Bier hat durchaus unangenehme Ansätze des Alkoholentzuges, da dieser aber nur teilweise erfolgte, bekommt das Bier nach kurzer unangenehmer Bitterkeit doch noch die Kurve und erhält die anfängliche Frische. Auch die deklarierte Spritzigkeit wird eingehalten. Es mangelt aber an Aromen, neben der Bitterkeit ist höchstens ein leichter Getreideton fassbar.

Grand Rapids Hoppy Brown Beer;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;pathetic attempt at some sort of style that just didnt work out...what they tasted was a hoppy beer that happened to be brown...genious...i wont justify this by saying a thing about this beer other than there is no malt...
Grand Rapids Hoppy Brown Beer;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;On tap at GRBC. Deep red body with non-existent head. Light, sweet toasty aroma with earthy hops, but served way too cold to develop properly. The body was bitter with a hollow, thin malt backbone that reminded me of sewage. Sometimes I just don’t understand what the point is...
Grand Rapids Lite;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;this is actually worse that most macro beers...overly carbonated water with minimal food coloring..grassy, cereal-based beer that is just fucking disgusting...
Grand Rapids Lite;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;On a night of exceptionally bad local craft beers, this one took first place. The appearance was worse than a Budweiser, with the clear straw body featuring messy soda-like fizz, akin to a Vernors Gingerale. To top that off, there was a strange jolly rancher-like artificial sweetener flavor that coated the sour, soapy, watered-down cereal notes. Unimaginably bad. Truly awful. Harrowing, as well.
Keynsham Stockwood Stout;Bristol, Somerset, England;Stout;Keynsham Brewing Co.;Cask-conditioned at the Victoria, Clifton Lido, Bristol. Near black stout with a middling, off-white head. Aromas of liquorice and black coffee. Smooth to drink with toasted flavours prominent. Very enjoyable.

Sweet malty, grainy and slightly buttery nose with a light herbal hoppy touch and a tinge of citrus. Sweet-bitter flavour, light to medium bodied with a well-carbonated, crispy mouthfeel. Initially grainy, slightly fruity (citrus) taste with a touch of butter; medium-dry malt-accented finish with a present herbal hop-character staying in the background. Compared to the very bland and weak Zwickel, this one is much better and has some qualities of a (decent) Bohemian Pils."

Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Big thanks to ibrew2or3 for this one. Pours golden aroma is very floral with subtle notes ofnhoney coming through. The flavor is earthy and very floral. No honey sweetness here. Subtle oak and a mild tartness. A little thin and watery. May be a little past it’s prime.
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Thanks for sharing, iowaherkeye. The body was medium bronze. A sweet aroma was floral with oak and honey. Plenty of booze were also apparent in the nose. The taste was nasty plastic with some wood. The honey is understated with some weird leather. This gets fairly boozy as it warms up. I wanted to like this one more, but this has some rough edges that hopefully will smooth out with age.
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"Thanks joeyiowacitysuckseye for breaking this out just for me being like ""oh yeah that is something I’d like to see opened."" Orange gold pour with no head/bubbles. Lots of honey and flower in the aroma. Flavor has honey, flowers, oak, grapes, and a bit of spice (pepper?). Finishes a bit thin. Not very sweet, or dry, or tart. Just middle of the road."
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;375mL bottle, 2004 from the brewery. Clear honey gold with some legs that did form after a few seconds. Plenty of honey, flower petals, juicy raisins, and white pepper. Flavor was kind of appley with some honey, pepper again, and a fair amount of alcohol in the bone dry finish. My label claims 8.0%, but that makes no sense at all--this is pretty boozy and a mead. Just a hint of tang present, and not terribly sweet, either. Dry finish. Full body. Pretty good mead.
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2005. Not as good as the Orange Blossom, but good anyway. Honey and flower aroma that is more complex than the simple flavor, which is on the of a dry mead.
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Purchased at the brewery. Pours still clear bold. It has a big big aroma of honey and the odd fusel mixed with mild earthiness. The taste starts thick and sweet as sweet honey attacks the senses. Then mild tropical fruitiness shows up as mild tannins arise and dry out the experience. It leaves a nice honey and faint fruitiness behind with a mild warming sensation.
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;OSLO and Guerde’s Memorial Weekend Tasting, 5/23/08. Courtesy of OSLO. Gold color. Aroma is a light mixture of clover and wildflower honey. Clover and maple syrup flavors. Light apple and a bit of grape, almost like Pinot Grigo.
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Poured from a 375 ml bottle, vintage 2005. Slick clear honey. Powdery, sweet aroma of honey, shaved coconut, lavender, fresh green apples. Vibrant, with a degenerative rub of musty carpet and weird funk. Flavor is a hot, punchy perfume with golden raisins, pineapple, vanilla, and honey. Moments of chalky alcohol and phenolic heat lend some uncomfortable synthetic quality that manages persistence, obnoxiously. Steadfast. Medium body is warm and lightly acidic. Firm sweet finish. A smooth, complex example, but the complexity is a little disjointed and random, lacking the centering, well polished, satiating simplicity that it needs. Thanks Alister!
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Sampled at Olso/Guerde’s Memorial Day tasting. A 2005 vintage and shared by Guerde. Pours a clear golden mead with no bubbles and a clean top. Aroma of honey, tart apples, some raisin and a touch of mango. Taste is a little high octane alcohol, tart apples, honey and a touch of floral character. Finish is slightly tart with a flowery aftertaste that slowly disappears.
Kuhnhenn Late Harvest Vidal Pyment;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2005 bottle courtesy Ibrew2or3. Pours a clear still golden. Aroma of alcohol, honey, and green apples. Taste is honey, green apples, golden raisins, and alcohol. Medium thin mouthfeel with smooth alcohol. Very good.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2004 bottle from the brewery, drunk 11/28/15. Clear, soft-apricot-lemon colored body has a fair amount of sediment on the bottom, but it is all left behind. As with many of my old bottles, I’m incredibly regretful of keeping them so long. Was just so irrationally obsessed with aging things but, while a mead can certainly handle some age, fruit can not and it’s utterly stupid to age this thing as long as I did. Thus, there is very little left of the fruit, at this point it’s just soft esters, with some apricot maybe being noticeable? Doubtful though and no way you’d pick it out blind. In its place, a very soft honey character, with light white bread and some peppery phenols. Minor oxidation, no flaws and no alcohol. Again in the flavor, the fruit has all but vanished. It does seem like you get some raspberry and apricot acidity, and maybe some dry, blueberry skin-like character, but again, I’m confident you wouldn’t pick up on this blind. Honey is lightly sweet, with a riesling/gruner character, light vanilla and very, very low carbonation. Still, as it warms and breathes (and sits out over night) it shows a perfectly capable mead whose only flaw is that it was aged 11 years. Very much keeping that in mind with my scoring.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;375 ml bottle thanks at Clark VV. 2004 vintage. Clear gold color. Aroma is homey and rotten apricots, maybe a hint of a berry. Flavor has lost something over time. The Apple is here but faded, I don’t get Berry or other fruit. Just old honey, traces its of oxidation. Still somewhat drinkable.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle shared by ClarkVV. Thanks, Clark! 2004 bottle! Pours light orange gold. Still. Aroma is honey, cardboard, earth. This is clearly past its prime, but still drinkable. Peach flavor is still there, honey, and cardboard oxidation.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Poured from bottle thanks ClarkVV 2004 vintage. Golden color with aroma of cinnamon and apples. Taste is faded apples and bitter honey. I am sure this was good years ago.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;This is a 2004 vintage from Clark!!!! Thanks man for sharing. This is a golden color...obviously still. The smell is baked apples and cinnamon. This smells stupid good. I’d say the apricot dominates of the listed fruit. There’s a lot of basement mold taste to this, the apple is faded to a very bitter honey. I get a faint blueberry apricot and a little bit of banana. Unique, thin, low-sweetness. I like it.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Honey in color (of course). No head (obviously). Smells like strong sweet honey. Flavor is definitely some moldy honey and old fruit. For how old this is, that’s not surprising.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"<b><i>2004 Vintage</i></b><br /><br /> <b>7/28/2007</b>: Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel is a still mead that is golden in color. It has nutty sunflower, light raspberry, and some floral blueberry notes in the aroma and flavor. The finish is slightly dry. This mead has a medium+ body and is delicate on the palate. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Kuhnhenn makes great beer and excellent mead! I want more!<br /><br /> <i>Sample from 375 mL bottle (11.5% ABV) shared at the ""Columbus Tasting: Ate, now with gramatical errors"" event. Thanks! Rating #6 for this mead...</i><br />"
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Second mead I have tasted. Pours a clear light amber color with no head. The aroma is honey (again), floral, light alcohol, and fruity. The flavor is honey, some light spice, peaches, some apple and pear as well, and a touch of alcohol (not quite 11.5% though). A touch on the dry side. This is very easy to drink.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Shared but puddintane. Aroma was of a light fruitiness and sweetness with some floral notes. Flavor was really smooth and a lot light than most other meads ive had. Not alcohol really noticable at all in this one.
Kuhnhenn Michigan Mixer Melomel;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle shared by Puddy at C-bus 8. Big thanks to Dave for this treat. Nice golden color with no head. The aroma was very floral with background of sweet honey and apples. Great balanced flavor of flowers, honey and light fruits--pears, apples and some subdued berry tastes. Easy to drink with only a hint of the alcohol. Damn good!
Town Hall Lightning Storm;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark copper color with a thick head of foam. Aroma is light but obvious ginger and a little bit of honey. The ginger comes screaming out in the flavor. Lemongrass is there, but very subdued. Moderately malty and somewhat sweet.
Town Hall Lightning Storm;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pale brown color with thin, creamy white head. Fruity nose lost in the fine breeze outside, but the taste is a most excellent ginger and some other spices.
Town Hall Lightning Storm;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Very fruity aroma on this beer, surprisingly so. The flavour was very sweet, from the honey I guess. Pigfoot hit the ginger right on the ehad as well. This is something I would figure that my wife would like as it is very unobtrusive and tasty.
Town Hall Lightning Storm;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;rass, and some spices. This one employs raspberry blossom honey, ginger, and lemon grass, American malts, American yeast....not sure about the hops. Clear, amber/dark orange color, huge billowing creamy head, intense carbonation in the glass... Ginger hits the nose, first, then the fruit...sweet honey underneath...not much from malt, little if any from hops. Pleasant on the tongue, if unobtrusive...sweetness, well balanced, is in charge...intriquing flavor, but simple interplay on the palate. Could use more something something... A unique combination of ingredients, an unusual and delightful flavor...but lacking in depth, texture, body...quite drinkable, though. A good experiment, sure to find it’s fans...just not sure if I’m one of them. If it had some hops, I’d like it better, I think...without them, this just lies on the tongue, doing nothing..
Otley Calif-O-rnia Gold;Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otley;19th February 2012 On tap at the Rake. Hazy gold beer. Smells of bad eggs. Light palate with maybe some light hops - hard to tell under the bad eggs which pervade the taste as much as the smell. Grim!

Otley Calif-O-rnia Gold;Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otley;Cask in the rake. Alround rating: Honey pale malts, perhaps a touch of wheat in the mouthfeel?, citrusy floral hop, touch of mandarin but it has a small dustyness. Drinkable stuff.
Otley Calif-O-rnia Gold;Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otley;Handpump @ The Rake. Gold with a greenish tint and a white head. Pale malt and grassy hops in the nose. Taste has a crisp hop bite, citrus hints and a nice bitter linger. Not bad.
Otley Calif-O-rnia Gold;Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otley;A Mes rate: cask cellar run at the Rake. Clean gold with a pretty impressive white head. Excellent creamy malt aroma topped off with a generous serving of grassy and aromatic hops. The flavour is similar but there is a unwanted meaty note that is really holding it back. Excellent dry grassy hop finish that has really good length. Other than the oily meaty note this is very good indeed. One of the best from Otley.

Otley Calif-O-rnia Gold;Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otley;"Cask conditioned at Brecon Beer Festival, Castle Hotel, Brecon, Powys. Pale gold with fullwhite head. It’s not often when going to a beer festival, that the best beer of the day is the last, not the first, so this was pretty dynamic to show above the previous beers. it was beautiful, hoppy throughout, dry,oily and bitter, as fresh as a daisy and, it has to be said, in absolute perfect nick. The finish is juicy and citric and had me quoting from Dylan Thomas, the Welsh poet (and boozer) who i was reading whilst in Wales. My tears are like the quiet drift; Of petals from some magic rose; And all my grief flows from the rift; Of unremembered skies and snows. I think, that if I touched the earth, It would crumble; It is so sad and beautiful, So tremulously like a dream."
Otley Calif-O-rnia Gold;Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otley;Draught half-pint at NERAX on 5/5/07 A very warm-toned honey-orange/yellow body is bright, yielding a medium amount of white head that laces lightly and shows moderate retention. Citric hops in the nose are somewhat muted by a grainy, almost nutty malt character (could be some yeast in there too). Very papery and dry, seemingly a very high attenuation. Lemon and light tangerine break through, with moderate citric bitterness. Not flawed, just too much blandness/paperiness in the nose. Hops are strong up front, leading to very lightly sweet malts that recede quickly, allowing for a strong graininess on the end. What could be a crisp, husky, bite from the lager malts really just seems rather bland, grainy and too dry. Using those malts in beers with low carbonation is very difficult, because the carbonation adds back the body and balance that those malts need (one reason why they work so well in lagers). Schiehallion (cask lager) seems to have similar problems. Don’t need to cut it out entirely, but it needs a high proportion of pils malt or an English pale malt.

Golden pour, fast fading white topping. The nose had a malty front with a light floral note or two, taste also malty/grainy with a little grass/floral twist from the hops that also gave a balanced bitterness. OK for a cheap Pilsner.

Snoqualmie Falls Dunkle Weizen;Snoqualmie, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Snoqualmie Falls Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Poured a Medium-light copper, fairly hazy with minimal head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma of lightly toasted bread and slight metallicness. Tastes like a light dunkelweizen. No strong bready flavors, nor strong typical wheat beer flavors. Fairly light bodied with a dry finish. Yeasty flavor dominates the finish, but not bready. This is an unoffensive dunkelweizen, however it does not display any outstanding qualities. The yeast is not as upfront as others nor does it take on any roasty or darker malt-type flavors. Poured quite a bit lighter than most and it was not only an indicator of overall flavor, but it was also a clue to the lack of complexity. Average at best unless it was an interpretation of the style...i.e. American style wheat beer.
Snoqualmie Falls Dunkle Weizen;Snoqualmie, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Snoqualmie Falls Brewing Company;Very similiar to the their Hefe, a little more of a roasted presence. Awfully thin with very little malt pressence. Not much bitterness to speak of and not much citrus sour either. Plain.
Grand Teton Au Naturale (Organic Blonde Ale);Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"From Feb 2007 Pours from 12oz sampler bottle(room Temp) a clear light gold with a small head of foam that reduces to a fine broken layer with some lacing. The smell is a delicate nose of hops with some malt sweetness barely noticeable. The taste is also delicate when it comes to the hops and malt. The malt doesn't impart any sweetness however and the hops are not bitter in the way I like the bitterness to taste. Strange tasting brew. I'd say the dominant flavour that hits my palate is grain...Thank goodness the finish is pretty clean. I'm always excited when I get to try a new offering from Grand Teton but...this one is just too ordinary and uninspiring. Maybe ""Organic"" Ale is not the way to go? Bottom line: I'm glad I got to try this one but I won't be buying any when it hits the retail market."
Grand Teton Au Naturale (Organic Blonde Ale);Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"1/2"" white head dies quickly leaving behind a little lacing atop a clear straw gold brew. Aroma is little more than husky pale malts... and quite a bit of yeasty fruitiness. Flavor mirrors the aroma but with bubbles. Pale malts and a sorta lingering pale malt finish. Little hop flavor or bitterness."

Grand Teton Au Naturale (Organic Blonde Ale);Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Not a very good blonde. The expected citrus is there, but it is diluted by an unnecessary malty sweetness and a strange rotten vegetable taste. Appearance is nice and the smooth palate is suitable.

Grand Teton Au Naturale (Organic Blonde Ale);Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Old bottle found while doing some cellar cleaning and rearranging. Pours a fairly clear golden orange with a sizable beiged white head. Old paper, degraded toast and a bit of sweetness. Definitely smells old. Strange coconut note as well.

Redoak Framboise Reserve;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;This one managed to gush all over Stew’s kitchen so we only ended up with about half a bottle. I wonder what you’d think if that happened after you shelled out $75 for a bottle... Anyway I thought this smelled really good. Just like the Framboise Froment with the intense jammy raspberry character and not much else. It seemed to carry the flavour of the seeds through too. The whole jammy, cooked element makes me think they’ve used extract (at least in part) but I could well be wrong. There’s not much else in the aroma, but the flavour has loads of meaty, salty, Vegemite/Marmite flavours which aren’t good at all. Stressed fermentation? Too long sitting on the yeast? I dunno, but it’s not good. Raspberry flavour is pushed into the background, but it remains nice. Malt character is all muddled and marred by the yeasty stuff. Damn. I was really excited to try this, but it was a bit of a letdown. I quite like the concept though, if they sort out the fermentation or whatever it is I think they’ll be on a winner.
Redoak Framboise Reserve;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Thin caramel head with a blood tinge. Darkish brown in colour with a cherry hue. Sweet nose, intense early, but settles quickly. Sweet fruits to taste with a weird hard, bitter edge. Can’t quite place my finger on it. Stinky fruit notes on the finish have some appeal. I hope this ain’t the $75 beer...oh dear!
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"Bottle 330ml (at the Redoak). Labelled as ‘Redoak Ice Breaker’. Served at cellar temperature. Pours a hazy dark brown. Head is small, lightly tanned quickly dissipates. Aroma is extremely rich and malty with notes of muscat soaked fruit cake, muscatels, caramelized dates, burnt toffee, chocolate and toasted raisin bread. Flavour is exceptionally smooth, with virtually no bitterness at all; toasted malts, burnt toffee, caramelized dates, sultana’s, muscat, rum and raisin chocolate and notes of earthy oak in the finish. Full bodied with very light carbonation, a slightly syrupy texture and a good length finish. Remarkably well balanced and smooth giving the ABV."
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;(bottle, many thanks to karin for this gem!) clear deep ruby colour with a creamy beige head. aroma of heavy bread dough and hazelnuts, with some big notes of marzipan, cherry syrup, milk chocolate, fudge, sugar icing and cornflakes. flavour is mostly brown sugar, fudge and yeast, not too sweet, with a hint of bubble gum, dried grapes and just a touch of alcohol in the light-bitter walnut finish. heavy-bodied with soft carbonation. impressive!
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"16-Feb-11 (250-ml sample bottle: Free bottle for stewarding the 2008 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) This eisbock is not nearly as sweet as other examples I’ve tried, and it shows greater complexity and balance. This is wonderfully malty, caramely and toasty, with a deliciously rich, melanoidin character, plus dark fruits such as figs and prunes, a modest vinous layer, toffee, molasses, and a terrific woodsy earthiness for superb contrast. An important key to this eisbock is that the sweetness is kept under control, and thus, the beer is very drinkable. The nose offers aromas of rich maltiness, decayed wood, earth, prunes, dried figs and apricots, toffee, and cocoa. It’s full bodied and rich on the palate, somewhat sticky, but also has a mild streak of earthy acidity in it, so the beer is never cloying. Carbonation is very light, so this is getting close to being still, but there is a mild layer of acidity running throughout, and this makes up for the low carbonation. The 14% alcohol is exceptionally well hidden; I can’t taste or smell the alcohol, nor is there any sensations in the mouth or throat related to higher alcohol levels. Ruddy brown in color and fairly hazy in appearance, the beer pours a thin sheet of tan-colored head that dissipates quickly to a thin ring. Overall, a very delicious and wonderfully crafted beer, one to savor for as long as your will power holds out. What a treat!"
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"At the Café. Found these notes in a jacket, must’ve been from a few years back. Tawny body, white collar, visible legs. Vinous nose; sherry, muscat, brown sugar, mollasses, sultanas, caramel, oak, obvious alcohol. Incredibly rich body, almost fortified wine-like, low carbonation, syrup texture with slight gritty dryness. Amazingly rich body; sweet caramel, dark brown sugar, sherry and muscat overtones, oak and sultanas in the background, red-wine like nuances (dark berries) as it warms. Dry somewhat tannic finish with nice warming alcohol. Costs an arm and a leg, but a very tasty treat indeed. One of those styles that feels like you’re not drinking beer at all, this could be well on-par with Redoaks Reserve."
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"A heavily alcoholic eisbock without the frame to carry its 14% abv. To be fair, this was sampled in some spectacular company - I’m not just talking about Sully, Bridge, Linc, TimE and co - and probably suffered in comparison. It was succeeded by stunners like Millennium, Abyss and Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout - and there aren’t many beers that can live in that company. Redoak’s eisbock was a burnished teak colour, basically still, with the merest hint of a corona. Slick, oily body. Rich burnt sugars in the aroma, with strong woody notes and figs. Huge mouth-tingling surge of alcohol without enough malt/hops to balance it. Cherries, demorara sugar and raisins, but overwhelmed by rummy alcohol. I like ""big"" beers but this seemed crude and unbalanced compared to the Special Reserve or their strong porters. (Bottle courtesy of Linc at Sully’s Sydney RB Xmas 07 gathering. Thanks fellas.)"
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"Bottle at the Redoak (250ml). I had high expectations for this one given the large alcohol content and I was not disappointed. Poured a deep muddy brown with virtually no head, it was very thick and looked more like motor oil coming out of the bottle rather than beer. Aroma was intense with the alcohol content present on the nose; caramelized dates and vanilla with a touch of port, sweet caramel, sticky toffee, some tart blackberries and a touch of sultanas and licorice. Flavor was fantastic and intensely complex; richly caramelized with sticky whisky notes, some prunes, vanilla, sweet toffee, burnt dates, moderate alcohol and a lightly warming finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation, a syrupy texture, sticky mouthfeel and a everlasting finish. For me this is the best brew I have had to date from the Redoak, I prefer it over the Old Baltic porter, but at $35 for 250ml’s I don’t think I will be having another any time soon."
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;I didn’t realize until I went on RB that this puppy measured in at 14%. I must say that it seemed much lighter. I found this Eisbock didn’t have the cloying sweetness that I find in others and still managed to have the depth of molassess, milk chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, cherries and oranges. It finishes warming with lingering brown sugar notes. Very nice.
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;In between the St Nick (too flat) and the Framboise Reserve (too fizzy) was this one which was just right! It shares that same dry biscuity malt flavour with the St Nick, whilst a salty palate and strong but clean alcohol give the impression of Scotch. The malt character especially is quite mellow, and definitely not fresh or vibrant. It’s not too sweet which is a major advantage when it comes to beers like this, but Eisbocks need LOTS of malt for mine, and this doesn’t deliver it. There’s really not enough going on in terms of flavour to justify the monstrous alcohol content. That said, it was a pretty enjoyable, if not memorable, experience. Good on em for doing Australia’s first (?) Eisbock.
Redoak Eisbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Eisbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Cola appearance with a very thin head. Massive, yeasty dirty nose, vegemite, complex...good. Alcohol laden palate with heat and licorice. Quite smooth and carries th 14% with incredible ease. Good fun.

Mill Street Kriek (Cherry Fruit Beer);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Tap @ Brewpub. Smells like cherry Kool-aid, cloudy red/orange, zero head. Tastes like cherry Kool-aid, light bodied,not overly sour/sweet, or much of anything else. Poor.
Mill Street Kriek (Cherry Fruit Beer);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);[332-20070609] Tap @ Mill St. (Toronto, ON). Cherry fruit punch aroma. Very hazy, light red amber body with white bubbles instead of a head. Flavour is like a tangy fruit punch of cherry orange and hints of other citrus. Medium body is fairly smooth. Not very beer-like at all but nicely blended as it packs a sly alcohol punch.
Mill Street Kriek (Cherry Fruit Beer);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Draught pint at the brewpub. Distinct reddish tinge to the colour and a fairly still body with very little head. The aroma and flavour are both sweet, but not cloying, with a good balance of slightly fruity malt and fresh cherry. Mellow hops in the finish - enough to be briefly noticeable, but not enough to seriously interfere with the primary malt and cherry characteristics. Enjoyable, if somewhat uneventful.
Mill Street Kriek (Cherry Fruit Beer);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);On tap at Brewpub, sold as Cherry Fruit Beer Appearance: colour of pomegranate juice, orange, copper-ruby overtones. Thick haze small bright ring on top. Aroma: plain sweet, fruity juice like. Light hints of black tea, hints of tobacco (cherry pits?) Medium bodied, sweet fruity character. Surprisingly juicy. Sticky, sweet cherry. Refreshing summer brew. A bit like fruit tea like. Cherry Fruit Beer suits this brew much more than Kriek listed previously.
Mill Street Kriek (Cherry Fruit Beer);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Hazy, amber body with a light pink hue throughout the body. Small white head.

Baeren (4th Anniversary) Porter;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Porter;Baeren;Thick head. Brown beer. Not getting much scent. Good body. Dry delicate chocolate. Some fruit and then hops. very drinkable and smooth.
Baeren (4th Anniversary) Porter;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Porter;Baeren;My Bottom Line: This complex Porter exhibits roastiness and molasses developing chocolatey and fruity side flavors. The balancing earthy hop finish lingers nicely, yet the overall effect is less than the sum of its parts. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy head decorates the darkest brown. -Vanilla adds more depth to the already layered maltiness. -The body is lean and active, yet I was expecting more from an anniversary selection. -The bottled version was a faithful rendition of the tapped. On tap at The Aldgate, and later from the bottle.
Baeren (4th Anniversary) Porter;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Porter;Baeren;Molasses in color with a small tan head. Roasted malts, milk chocolate, vanilla fill out the aroma. Solid, but could be stronger. Very tasty. Milky chocolate, lightly roasted malts, vanilla, and bittersweet coffee. Finishes with some sweetness and bitter maltiness. Medium, properly carbonated body. A very enjoyable porter. Different and delicious.
Baeren (4th Anniversary) Porter;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Porter;Baeren;Light brown color, thick ivory white head. Very sweet milk chocolate, lactose, vanilla, caccao nose. The theme continues in the mouth and almost is cloying, but just stops short. Lasting caccao, sweet vanilla finish. Very different, but very tasty. This was like no porter I have tried before.
Light Delster;Tehran, Iran;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Iran Behnoush Co.;It is the best non alcoholic beer I have ever drink. Very attractive design, good taste, hoppy flavour, nice color and stable foam. You can drink too much without worry about your fitness. It is low calorie less than 15kcal/100ml. Cheers!
Blakemere Sandpiper;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blakemere Brewery;Gravity Cask @ Waterloo Arms Beer Festival. Light colour. Mild hoppy aroma. Slightly stale malt. Fruity citric hops becoming more pronounced in the mouth and make up for the poor malt flavours.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;On tap at BeerFes Osaka 2019. Dark fruit nose. Medium copper/orange color, thin off-white head. Mild fruity initial flavor, raisin, tree bark spice, touch of scratchy hops, thins out quickly.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;Tap @ Kura Kura Ji-Beer House, Tokyo. Orange brown, reasonable head. Mild grain aroma. Orange biscuit malt flavour. Sharp with bitter citrus aftertaste. Decent but not outstanding pale ale.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;Tap at Popeye. Golden amber colour, not much head. Aroma is lightly fruity, berries, solid sweet maltiness. Taste is grainy, some citrus hops, biscuity malt, quite fruity, quite dry. Solid if unexciting.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;Draught at Popeye, Tokyo. Lightly hazy deep golden, small head. Aroma of tangerine and winegum. Fairly sweet with rounded mouthfeel. Light to medium bodied with caramelly malt and a bit of peach. Rather low bitterness.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;Clear copper with a wimpy head. Light malts and then nothing in the aroma. Flavor is sadly the same as the aroma. Not bad, just boring as it gets. I actually forgot I drank this until I went through my notes- and I only had three pints that night.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;On tap at Popeye. Light, very hoppy aroma. Light copper color. Very light malt flavor, hops predominate. Fragrant, fruity, bitter hops. Clean and crisp, but not enough malt for me. Great hops though.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;My Bottom Line: This modest English Pale Ale’s orangey hoppiness spices up the lightly honeyed maltiness which is barely able to ride the soft prickling of carbonation. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam tops the clear pale orange-hued copper. -The orangey, leafy hoppiness dominates the flavor profile while being far from assertive. -The hermetic nose is thankfully not imitated by the talkative flavor profile. -Maltiness needs to be bulked up for balance to be achieved and pleasure to be increased. On tap at Popeye’s.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;Apparently Preston is a brewpub in a mall in Tochigi prefecture Japan. Very small outfit with a funny name. The beer itself was a golden amber color and had a soft hoppy nose of apples and oranges. Soft hoppy body of orange and apples and just a touch of lime. Mildly bitter hoppy finish. Pleasent.
Joyful Honda Preston Ale;Tsuchiura, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Joyful Honda;Small white head. Light brown body. Light tropical fruit hop taste with very mild mouthfeel. Apple notes. No real aftertaste. Simple. but nice. (0.25l on cask at Popeye.)
Beer Works Green Man IPA;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Beer Works;Very nice creamy light beer.as useally for british beer is not to strong. IPA have few other good beer to try
Beer Works Green Man IPA;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Beer Works;"Draught pint at Fenway location on 5/5/07 Deep caramel-tinted brass with a full, off-white head that is quite dense and fairly creamy. Strong retention, with light lacing. Everyone often talks about how ""dank"" some IPAs and DIPAs smell and it’s true that hops are in the same family, but I’ve never really smelled too much a similarity...until this one. Don’t know what they used, but it was incredible! Not huge and in your face, nor even resinous and sticky. Just rather fuzzy and lightly dry, but with that distinct marajuana-like smell. Fruitiness comes on afterwards, with some light cherries and oranges and a smattering of tropical fruits. Huge burst of pine and citrus bitterness on the end is actually somewhat balanced by the strong maltiness. But it’s not hard/crystally maltiness, more of a soft, sweet, pale maltiness with some moderate caramel. No alcohol noted, no flaws, very high strength of aroma. Very bitter in the flavor, and quite dry, though there is a strong malt backbone. It really lets the hops go to work and an almost ""fuzzy"" feeling is left on the palate, I suppose it must be the hop resin. Leafy, slightly fruity and just full of wintergreen, pine and white grapefruit. Not a big IPA fan, but this one was quite good. Gravity could definitely be felt, though, and there was a fair bit of stickiness (residual sugar) on the finish, with some alcohol dryness (but no alcohol flavor). No flaws. Medium carbonation."
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Draft sample. Poured clear golden to yellow color with an average creamy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate yeast, spice and sweet citrus aroma. Medium body with a light sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet spice finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met.
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Sampled on our Great Lakes beer tour. Flavor is an orange, coriander and clove potpourri. Light aroma of oranges. Golden color, refreshing.
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Clear pale pour thin white head and spotty lace. Spicy aroma. Similar flavor profile. Meh
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Maybe this is another example where I love the style so much I’m rating it higher than most, but I thought this was a very good take on a Belgium wit and quite unique. Pours lightly hazy yellow with a small white head. The aroma has lots of sharp lemony citrus, bits of sweet orange, some some and a bit of chalk. Medium / thin crisp body with lots and lots of sharp carbonation that somehow works with the flavors. Starts with lots of lemony citrus, sharp wheat, some grapefruit and a little soapiness. This is extra tart for the style. The finish is clean, tart and short. Overall a very nice beer that I will get again if possible.
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Thanks to BBB63 for this one. It pours a hazy straw yellow with a quiclydisappering head. It’s tangy sweet and thirst quenching
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to BBB63. Poured a clear bright golden with a quickly-receding cap of white head. Aroma was very heavy on the coriander with some nutmeg and orange peel behind.. very well-spiced.. odd vegetal sweetness emerges when you dig past the spicage. Flavor was very spicy, adding white pepper to the aforementioned spices.. sweet wheaty notes in the background. Not too good a balance between the sweet and spicy aspects and a bit watery on the palate.
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Thanks BBB63. The beer pours to a thin mead-like plastic light-yellow/clear body with a thin white head. The aroma is butterscotch laden with some coriander too. The flavor is heavily spiced with coriander and sweet pale malts and light butterscotch. Average palate. The butterscotch distracts me significantly.
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pale yellow with some white head, but that damn thing way clear! There is an overwhelming perfume aroma. Pretty much the samething in the flavor. It tasted like flower pedals. A pretty heffty mouthfeel. Not all that good.
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;On tap at Mishawaka. Served in a pint glass. Pours a golden/orange with a minimal white head. Aromas of lemon, wheat and coriander. Flavor is light citrus with a good dose of coriander and spice. Mouthfeel is light and watery with weak carbonation. A light and refreshing summer brew.
Mishawaka Nit Wit;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle and served in my Hoegaarden tumbler: Clean golden hue with a fizzy fading head and minimal spotted lace. The aroma has notes of cardamom, coriander, anise, orange zest, lime leaves, biscuity malt, American wheat and yeasts esters. The taste is moderately spiced with a nice amount of acidity and tart fruits. Just a hint of diacetyl but nothing to stand in the way. A wheat and pale malt driven base adds support to the spices. The mouth feel is refreshing enough for a summer brew and the acidic nature cleans the palate nicely, could be a touch more carbonated however. A very workman like beer, not quite session due to the ABV but enjoyable.
Beer Works Sanshin Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beer Works;Draught pint at Fenway on 5/5/07 and again on 5/12/07 Glassy, light-peach colored ale is very soft on the eyes. White head is medium to small and recedes to cover readily. Moderate lacing left behind. Amazing...sake-like nose displays very similar qualities and is chalk full of esters. Peach, pear, golden apple and a very soft, leafy, but slightly juicy hoppiness sits on the back-end. Malts are quite attenuated and leave only a trace of honey and light whitebread. Almost smells like wildflowers on the end, it’s that soft. Rice adds a dry, almost papery-like quality. Medium to medium-high strengtht, no flaws. The only part I didnt like in the flavor was the dryness/paperiness that the rice produces. If this was just an all-malt beer, it might have been that much softer on the palate and given it a more supple malt feel. Mouthfeel aside, the flavors were terrific. Fruity and lightly spicy, the hops added pleasant bitterness and lots of green, leafy, almost lush, floral notes. Apples, peaches and pears build up, but the crisp rice and base malt finish helps cleanse the palate (so the rice may not be so bad afterall). No trace of alcohol or flaws. They have some really experimental things coming out of this brewery once every blue moon. This was a grand success in my book. Very drinkable and enjoyable.
Beer Works Lutin D Or;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Beer Works;This Belgian is real spiced up. Packs a punch that leaves that warm tingle in your stomach. Pours a nice bubbly golden tinge. Incredibly pleasing aroma for the first few tastes. Towards the bottom I became rather uninterested. Great to see such class produced in Salem, MA.
Beer Works Lutin D Or;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Beer Works;On draft at Fenway Park location. A clear light gold with puny head. Brewed in celebration of the Canal St. location’s sixth anniversary. Faintly sweet nose. Ripples of flavor include bubblegum, citrus, and melon. Flavor ends on a high note of hops and malt sweetness.
Beer Works Lutin D Or;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Beer Works;Sample at Beer Works Fenway: This beer pours a clear golden color with a thin ivory head that disappears quickly. S[ptty lacing. The aroma is floral hops and yeast, with touches of fruit. Light body with a floral character and mild hops and toasted malt flavor. Light yeast is present too. The finish is lightly yeasty with a slight peppery hops finish. Slightly above average overall.
Beer Works Lutin D Or;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Beer Works;Draught snifter at Fenway on 5/25/07 It seems like at least every other time I’m at BW, they’ve got a Belgian golden ale on tap and every time it’s a different name. I havent entered them all and I just fail to believe that they are changing the recipes that significantly each time. I see that this one is quite a bit higher in abv though, so why not... Fluffy white head is fairly persistent, but leaves only minor lacing. Mostly clear, deep gold body with moderate carbonation. About as standard and by-the-numbers BSGA as I can recall. Good enough interpretation of Duvel, but without the richness of malt, yeast intricacy and expressive carbonation of that one. It’s clean enough, but there’s a fair amount of acid on the finish, which also seems to have some problems with wateriness. Sweet, honey-like sugars build up with light toasted notes, resulting in a soft, somewhat malty mouthfeel (though the wateriness is evident). Light, grassy/flowery hops and just your basic yellow fruit esters with light phenolics. Alcohol well-contained.
Beer Works Lutin D Or;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Beer Works;(Canal Street) Crystal clear straw body with off-white head. Aroma is fairly mild, medium sweet, candi sugar, cardamom. Taste is moderately sweet, Belgian yeast, some cardamom, alcohol. Medium-full body, some stickiness.
Beer Works Lutin D Or;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Beer Works;Tap at the Canal Street location - served in a tulip glass, which is the first time I’ve seen a beer served here in other than a pint glass (and I’ve had the Herc and Double IPA) - perfectly clear golden pour, with minimal head - served way too cold - bright, floral, fruity aroma, with some candi sugar sweetness - very light and crisp - minimal sweetness, with no apparent alcohol - mild herbal and floral qualities, with some spice on the back of the tongue - finishes with light belgian yeast flavors - a bit thin, but refreshing for a strong ale.
Maine Coast Winter Lager;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Tap at brewpub. Dark cherry syrup, pepper and malt aroma. Dark amber with a small head. Tart cherry syrup and molasses malt flavor. A great unique beer combining dark lager and fruit flavors.
Redoak Framboise;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;As Lach says, this doesn’t seem a million miles removed from the Framboise Froment and certainly not by enough to justify the difference in price. It’s a clean, decent sipper but there’s not enough complexity here to rank it any higher. Cloudy pink with an excitable head. Soft raspberry aroma - tart but restrained. Lean, champagne-like body. Fruit acids. Dry finish. (Bottle courtesy of Linc at Sully’s 2007 RB Xmas gathering. Thanks fellas.)
Redoak Framboise;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Clear, bright pink color. The nose to me back to picking freshing raspberries out of my grandparent’s garden and soaking them in water over the sink, this time though there was a touch of caramel in there. Superb. Light, acidic raspberry mouth that is very enjoyable. This is heading towards lambic territory, but then pulls back on sourness. Mouth feel is at times somewhat creamy. Chalky, raspberry finish. Very enjoyable.
Redoak Framboise;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;The cork was in terrible shape. It was missing significant chunks and came apart on opening. Lovely looking beer though, vivid clear pink with a decent thin head. Loads of lovely fresh raspberry aroma with a significant seed character and a touch of volatile acid. Not much else is evident - it’s really hard to get a feel for the base beer at all. Very dry, with light raspberry flavour and subtle acid. Nice stuff - clean, light and dry, but there’s just not a great deal going on. And I’m still not convinced this is different to the Framboise Froment.

Isle of Skye Lord of the Ales;Uig, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Isle of Skye Brewing Co.;Cask at Prince of Wales, Aberdeen (great condition as usual). It pours dark amber, with a thin foamy white head. The nose is leather, fruit cake, raisin, plum, varnish and brandy. The taste is wood, raisin, plum, date, red grape, leather, smoke and wood polish, with a dry finish. It has a light to medium body and soft carbonation. Looking at the pervious reviews you would think this is terrible, but I thought it was really good. I even went back for another!
Isle of Skye Lord of the Ales;Uig, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Isle of Skye Brewing Co.;Copper colour. The aroma is fruity, but maybe with some sulphur as well. Thin and a bit sewagey. Really not on - something amiss here.
Isle of Skye Lord of the Ales;Uig, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Isle of Skye Brewing Co.;@ Blue Blazer. Dark coppery-red and clear. Aroma is tainted with non-acetone polish remover and glue. The yeasty flavors are quite annoying as well but not as offensive as the aromas. Sweet strawberry notes and sourdough. Not in its best form, I imagine.

Beer Works Mayflower Maybock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Beer Works;A: Amber Hue, Passes Most Light, Mild White Head Ring, Mild Lacing S: Caramel, Toffee, Malts T: Caramel, Sweet Malts M: Average Carbonation, Light to Medium Bodied, Mildly Sweet Overall, an average Maibock without any real memorable flavor.
Beer Works Mayflower Maybock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Beer Works;Draught pint at Fenway on 5/5/07 Very light peach-golden beer with a slight rusty-orange tint. Large white head quickly recedes to cover, providing little lacing. Clear. Strong honey and munich-like malts combine to give a sweet-and-sour effect in the nose, with a bit of latent corn and very soft, grassy and earthy hops providing some much needed softness. Seemingly quite dry, without much lager yeast crispness, but the sourdough-like character persists on the finish. Medium strength of aroma, no real flaws, no alcohol. Sweet, somewhat simple, maltiness is full of honey dough and a bit of munich-like sourness. Lots of water in the beer (because it’s during the Red Sox’ season), diluting the flavor, but it’s still passable and clean, despite being neither hoppy, nor overly malty. Some bland, papery, almost tannic notes sit on the end and it never gains any real richness that you would expect from a bock. Somewhat of a washed out texture, with prickly, yet loose, carbonation. No alcohol noted.

Marks & Spencer Etoile D'Or;Paddington, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Marks & Spencer Stores;"Smells like a very piss-poor lager in a can, which I say confidently after sampling way too many piss-poor lagers in a can: tinniness, some corn starch, watery stench like smelling grass that’s been freshly urinated upon. And I’ll assume it looks like a crappy lager as there’s no place to pour it on this chunnel train. Its saving grace is a very average taste with bready notes, some hops, and a slightly dry finish. But it doesn’t taste Belgian by any stretch. A poor showing all around. Avoid this ""imported Belgian""."

Indian Wells Eastern Sierra Lager;Inyokern, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Indian Wells Brewing;Slightly hazy orangish color with a small white head. Aroma is grain and caramel malt with a slightly butter effect. Its got the traditional Indian Wells flavor which can be only described as funky plus a nice crisp finish. A little sweetness as well. Light and pleasant. Like the other dude said, this is way better than the Mojave Silver.

Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Always get mead when I can. This was more medicinal than good to drink. Was hoping the raspberry would sour this up but too sicky sweet - as is the pinky colour.
Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;I couldn’t even finish this drink. There was something that just didn’t taste right about it. It was far too sweet for my liking and I had to choke down the gulps I managed. Sorry Alley Kat...you can’t win ’em all.
Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Pours a clear gold color. Average aroma of raspberries and honey. The flavor has raspberries and honey, but it feels more like a soda than a mead....
Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Really quite unpleasant overall I’m afraid to say. Pours a rather sickly orange-pink colour. Aroma of cough syrup and honey with a fair deal of alcohol (my bottle is 7.0% rather than 6.7%). The taste is just cloyingly sweet and the raspberry tastes very artificial. The mead taste is definitely there though, giving it a bit of interest, and it leaves a much better aftertaste than I’d expect. It’s trying at best to be a two trick pony - the honey and the raspberry - and it doesn’t really succeed at either.
Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Has some of that basic fermented honey that hints at being a real mead. Raspberry is just to artificial, and lacking in acidity to create a pleasurable beverage. Nice nose, that’s about it.
Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;650ml brown bottle. Pours very light yellow, no head, faint haze. Aroma has some sweet honey, faint raspberry, white wine and tea. Sweet flavour, honey notes, but fairly bland. Finishes with some nice raspberry fruit flavour. Medium body, light carbonation.
Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"Ugh. Gonna be a pour out for sure. Two very small sips in and I already don’t want any more. The colour is some unknown metallic gold /pink, crystal clear, no head, some carbonation. There is alot of raspberry and honey aroma - very sweet. The aroma is not that bad. Bleck! This is pretty awful. Maybe I am just not a fan of meads, or maybe this one sucks balls. Taste is terrible. It’s watered down pop. It’s got a nasty alcohol taste that is way to forward. It’s..the hell with it - I’m not drinking any more of this spew. Gasoline in my mouth? Mouthfeel is 100% unpleasant. Thin, watery and gasoline. The slight sweetness is overrun by nothingness. Over carbonated. Horrid. It’s like I’ve got a shot of Vodka in a pail full of melted ice. It’s possible that I consumed less than 75ml. Hello basement toilet - goodbye Alley Kat abomination. Did they even taste this BEFORE they bottled it? How could they say ""hey, this is exactly what we were after""? One of the worst things I’ve ever drank. Alley Kat should be embarrased. Also, one of the cheapest labels ever made. A dead ringer to cheap home made wine labels."
Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"""I’ve told my self every time I drink a mead I’ll never do it again and this is no different tasted like crap and was a complete waste money. Pale rose to an orangey pink in color absolutely no cap but tons of carbonation bubbling up, looks exactly like sparkling peach juice don’t look like beer or mead but I think this is what Alley Kat was going for so what ever. Aroma is very sweet tons of honey and noticeable raspberry and something that smells like feet, it is not completely offensive but it’s ungood. I can’t believe the 6% alcohol is very noticeable and what the hell is the malt they used for this baggot mead made from popcorn?!?!?! This taste like popcorn the aftertaste taste like popcorn, buttery popcorn combined with honey and raspberry HOW! WHY! Ok I just called the girl friend over to taste I did tell her what I thought this tasted like and right after the first sip she said popcorn so its not just me. I’m not to sure what Ally Kat was going for on this product but I think they wanted to make a brew that was sweet and light for girls to slam back but ended up with a huge batch of popcorn juice. This was a huge waste of money and time there is no good reason to drink this. I SHALL NEVER BUY MEAD AGAIN. Review done while watching Mythbusters."
Alley Kat Raspberry Mead;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Mead;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Dark peach colour with a touch of light pink. Nose is raspberries, chai, roses, chardonnay, and light hops. Heavy caramel right away, with cream soda and chewing gum. Where are the raspberries? The sweetness mutes out the malt and hops, but there is a pleasent cream feel. More like a soda pop with a deceiving 7% ABV.
Jacobi Original Brown;Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jacobi;Cambridge Fest. A soft and drinkable best bitter of little character. Soft, flowery hops above an undistinguished and avaerage malt base. That all makes it sound worse than it actually is. The whole is more than the sum of its parts - and the finished result is as soft and delightful as a bland beer can be.
Earle Estates Contemporary Semi-Dry;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Sampled at the meadery. Pours a very pale straw gold with no head. This is a still mead. A good bit drier and frankly less aromatic and less flavorful than their Contemporary Mead. This mead has the lowest percentage of residual sugar by far of all of their meads. I am very fond of this meadery, but I must confess that I was not at all impressed with this offering.
Earle Estates Contemporary Semi-Dry;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Crisp clean and delightful. Lightly sweet but dry enough to enjoy it. A good mead but I like them a little sweeter.
Earle Estates Contemporary Semi-Dry;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;At the meadery. A slightly drier version of the Comtempory mead. Still fairly sweet and fruit but with a darker set of flavors

Lacroix Feu Sacré;Saint-Joseph-Du-Lac, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider-Ice/Fire/Fortified;Lacroix - Verger Cidrerie (AB InBev);Sample from a bottle. Deep copper pour, clear. Aroma is really nice, candied apple, caramel, cinnamon apple, applesauce, light green apple. Taste is rich, decadent apple pie sweetness, lots of cinnamon and apple sauce. Palate is med-full bodied, quite boozy, you can certainly feel the added alcohol. Tasty stuff, not as refined as a great ice cider but certainly offers most of the same flavor profile.
Lacroix Feu Sacré;Saint-Joseph-Du-Lac, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider-Ice/Fire/Fortified;Lacroix - Verger Cidrerie (AB InBev);2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml). Appearance: Clear copper with almost no alcohol legs despite the high abv. Aroma: The 16% abv is showing up as this is quite “hot”. There’s brown sugar, caramelized apples and notes of raisins. Taste: Heavily sweet. Boozy with brown sugar, caramelized apples, raisins, nutmeg and oak. Palate: Medium to full body. Not as thick as Ice Ciders. Warming, almost burning finish. Nutmeg aftertaste. Overall: Quite boozy. I don’t have a baseline for “Cidre de feu”, but if I compare this to Ice Ciders, this is far less complex and refined. Still an enjoyable beverage, but not one that I would seek again.

Piece Big Black Mariah Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap: The aroma consists of dark chocolate, light smoke, and coffee. It’s a dark brown with a one finger tan head with good retention. The flavor starts with dark chocolate and butterscotch. The butterscotch lingers throughout. The finish has some fruitiness, a touch of smoke and roast. Medium bodied with mild carbonation and soft mouthfeel.
Piece Big Black Mariah Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Sampled on tap at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a dark blackish hue, near opaque with some brownish glowing edges. A decent frothy tannish head dies to a ring and laces small, clinging as a film. Aromas are roasted malts, chocolate and touches of anise. Some more black licorice, coffee grounds, and touches of roast, toast, and toffee. Initial is fuller bodied, a full coffee and anise feel with roasted barley, toffee sweetness and caramel, touches of cocoa, both sweet and bitter, some molasses. Sweet and thicker, a heavy porter that brings a complex vibe, full bodied feel, and a lot of sweetness. The anise actually works well here, good roast and sweetness. A solid Porter, a bit bigger. Chocolate comes in much fuller as it warms, turning sweeter and roasty with just a light kiss of smokiness dancing in the finish and front of the palate at the end. Mmmmmm.
Piece Big Black Mariah Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;I had this on tap into a tasting glass at Piece. The beer is a very dark black, hardly any brown highlights. Light tan ok retention. The aroma is super sweet a hint of vanilla and chocolate with a big smokey finish. They say only light smoke but not the case at all. The taste is all about the smoke its everywhere and dominating and only shows anything else on the finish where you get a little sweetness. Light black licorice as well. This is ok, nothing special but if you want a little smoke while your out not a terrible choice. However, they have schlenkerla there so I’d go with that.
Piece Big Black Mariah Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Deep brown almost black decent tan head. Aroma chocolate coffee vanilla licorice hints of smoke.

Pale amber beer, high carbonation. Fluffy white head which reduces to film. Light body, slight fizz on swallowing. Sweet finish with a small touch of tin.

Haake Beck 12;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Hoppig en zoetig pilsener bier. Lekker van smaak maar mist enige diepgang. Goudgeel van kleur met een witte schuimlaag. -backlog de BierApp-

Haake Beck 12;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;As a fan of Werder Bremen, I do find the comments below rather offensive. But not as offensive as the pityful quality of this beer. What can a team do? If rugby fans drink Heineken at the RWC, Werder fans might as well put up with this.
Haake Beck 12;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle design? Okay ... Pours out golden, mid carbonation, small white head. Malty and metallic on the nose. Taste is sweet malty at the start, followed by a thin hop herb. A beer without a bigger structure. Designed for the fans of the soccer team Werder Bremen, Germany. Should be okay for that kind of customers. (3. June 2012).
Haake Beck 12;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle. Pale yellow colour, disappearing head. Aroma of grains. Taste is metallic, grains, light hops. Thin, not great.

Haake Beck 12;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Der erste Gedanke eines Ruhrgebietsjungen schreckt einen natürlich von der Optik ab, der Biertrinker aber ist natürlich angetan und fair. Fair muss man sagen, dass wir hier ein Pils haben, das süffige und süße Momente auf Lager hat, aber auch durchaus bitter enden kann. Kein großes Bier, aber ein solides ist es.
Haake Beck 12;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;The bottle is quite stylish if you are interested in football, but the nose and the looks don’t promise that much. Light golden colour with unsteady and low head and medium to thin body. Nose of metall and bitter hops. Taste is also very thin and metallic with hints of bitter hops, light malt, unripe grains and grass. Very unpleasant to drink and way below average.
Elysian Wrathful Deity Saison;Seattle, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Pours a very cloudy hue that is orangey-brown with pinkish highlights. It has a thin white head that leaves lace on the glass. The aroma is big with bready malts and yeast and also has some spices and fruit (citrus, berries, bananas). The flavor has lots of sweet malt with some citrus and coriander flavors. There is also a hint of acidity and the finish is dry. The beer is fairly light in body and is very highly carbonated. Overall, a very pleasing saison.

Elysian Wrathful Deity Saison;Seattle, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Draft at Elysian Fields. Pours crystal clear medium amber with a slim rim of white. Big dust, vanilla, and pine nose. Best nose of the night so far. Fairly flat attack but otherwise nice-enough carb. Weird mix of caramel and citrus and vanilla on the mid-palate. Not so nice. Not really. Not much finish, either. Great name, middling beer.
Phipps Newbottle Ale;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hoggleys;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Northampton BF. A test brew done at Hoggleys by the Phipps family who are in the throws of setting up their own brewery in Overthorpe Northants. A copper coloured beer with some berry fruits in the aroma, but unfortunately a hint of diacetyl also. The taste is nicely balanced, but fruitiness comes to the fore. A decent first effort.
Summer Wine Roses Battle Brew;Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Summer Wine Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Northampton BF. A dark brown coloured beer with a ruby hue and an off-white head. The aroma is very malty and fruity with a hint of coffee. The taste is more of the same and it is particularly fruity. Packed with flavour for such a low ABV.

Spitting Feathers Dark Velvet Mild;Chester, Cheshire, England;Mild Ale;Spitting Feathers;Handpull cask at the Swan and Rushes, Leicester. Red-brown, translucent. Malt, oats and chocolate in the simple, honest aroma. Sweet/spicy taste, with a slightly sourish caramel biscuit finish. Weak palette. Pretty good but not a game-changer. But then again it was never meant to be.
Spitting Feathers Dark Velvet Mild;Chester, Cheshire, England;Mild Ale;Spitting Feathers;Cask. Dark amber with a tiny off white head. Malty and fruity notes. Malt, fruit and roasted caramel. Medium to light body with a bitter sweet finish.
Spitting Feathers Dark Velvet Mild;Chester, Cheshire, England;Mild Ale;Spitting Feathers;"Cask at The Blisland Inn. Pours brown with a creamy light tan head. Aroma of dark malt and something roasty which only suggests coffee to me. That’s probably not it, but that’s how my brain interprets it. A bit light in body, and the flavor has that unusual ""coffee"". There’s dark malt, but the roasty flavor is distinctive."
Spitting Feathers Dark Velvet Mild;Chester, Cheshire, England;Mild Ale;Spitting Feathers;Cask@the Spitting Feathers Brewery Tap. Clear dark brown looks with a thin tan head. Rather strange nose that somehow reminded me of pencil sharperner shavings. Lacking in body. Some roasted character in the flavour, but everything seemed just a bit wide of the mark here. Disappointing.
Spitting Feathers Dark Velvet Mild;Chester, Cheshire, England;Mild Ale;Spitting Feathers;Cask Handpump at the Community Centre, Frodsham 12/05/2007 Slightly rich aroma. Mid brown coloured smooth and rich on the palate with some bitterness in a crisp burnt roast finish.

Warcop Pit Prop;Newport, Gwent, Wales;Mild Ale;Warcop;Bottle. Dark with a full body.My bottle did say 3.8 but it tasted stronger than that. As you would expect from this brewery quirky but worth trying.
Warcop Pit Prop;Newport, Gwent, Wales;Mild Ale;Warcop;A Mes rate: 50cl bottle from Kris Wines. Aroma is ok I guess. Inoffensive but a bit too gentle. Malt and some chalky chocolate notes. Nice dark black / brown colour with a reasonable beige head. Chlorine and harsh watery stuff. Over carbed and lacking flavour. Not great.
Warcop Pit Prop;Newport, Gwent, Wales;Mild Ale;Warcop;It is Pit Prop but the label says 4.1%. Whatever, vinegary and average. Watery too. Bland. Not offensive, I just don’t like it.
Warcop Pit Prop;Newport, Gwent, Wales;Mild Ale;Warcop;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Northampton BF. An almost black coloured mild. The aroma and taste unfortunately give the impression of lemon washing-up-liquid. I got hints of ginger also. Plenty of, presumably, unintentional and undesired citricity. Odd.
Aarhus Norsminde Bryg Rabarber;Viby J, Denmark;Wheat Ale;Aarhus Bryghus;Draught at Norsminde Kro. Creamy white excellent mostly lastin g head. Yellow cloudy colour. Moderate hoppy and yeasty aroma. Light bitter flavor. Moderate bitter average finish. Only slightly rhubarbs notes. Oily palate.
Aarhus Norsminde Bryg Rabarber;Viby J, Denmark;Wheat Ale;Aarhus Bryghus;Draft. An unclear golden beer with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet and very yeasty combined with notes of esters, wheat, and grain. The flavor is sweet and very yeasty combined with notes of fruit, rhubarb, esters, and wheat, as well as a slight acidity - is it from the rhubarbs? A more interesting, than good beer.
Aarhus Norsminde Bryg Rabarber;Viby J, Denmark;Wheat Ale;Aarhus Bryghus;Draft. Cloudy golden colour. Very nice appearance and lasting head. But then.. I was expecting a wheat beer. I don´t know how to define this beer. I cant taste the rhubarb and there´s only hints of wheat. It´s an okay beer with a nice taste but its too much a undefined mix of aromas. The malty flawor being the red line thru the beer. Its a bit like an Hoegarten from last night. Fruity but boring and flat.

Breconshire Pen y Fan;Brecon, Powys, Wales;IPA;Breconshire Brewery;Cask conditioned at Brecon Beer Festival, Castle Hotel, Brecon, Powys. Clouded brown with no head.

Grebbestad Lager;Grebbestad, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grebbestad Bryggeri;"13-02-2019; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The looks of the beer are fine. It looks like a simple Pale Lager. The colour is golden yellow and the beer has a slight haziness. On top of the beer quite a lot of frothy white foam is formed. Foam retention is average. Not to special. The aroma of the beer is fine. The malts give some bready notes. It has a biscuit note too. The hops give some herbal aromas. There are also some rather earthy hops. Yeast gives a nutty touch and also a fruity hint. Not to intense or special; yet not bad. The taste of the beer is fine. Sweet malts, nice bitter hops and a slight fresh fruit note. Not to strong, but it is balanced. Not to special. The palate is fine. Light body, slightly thin texture and high carbonation. The finish is short. It has some of the bready malts and earthy hops. The end has some dry notes in it. All in all, drinkable beer, but not special. Good average."

Hansens Regattabier;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hansens Brauerei;To me it dosn’t seems like a brown ale, more like a mix between an ipa and some hefe. Amber and unclear, muddy, White head, fully lasting. Aroma is spicy, coriander, notes of citrus. Flavor has a heavy bitter finish. Dry texture.

Holmegaard Mosebryg;Holmegaard, Denmark;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Holmegaard Bryghus;on tap at the brewpub. One of the best. A very colourful taste experience.
Holmegaard Mosebryg;Holmegaard, Denmark;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Holmegaard Bryghus;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy, orange presentation, with a minimal white head. In fact, more a layer of bubbles than a proper head. Quite weak nose, with a strange spicey note, some fruityness and grain-notes. Grainy, quite fruity flavor. There’s spices, but I would like more of them, especially flavorwise. Medium body. There’s a pleasant bitterness as well, especially in the flavor, but it seems the beers from Holmegaard are aiming a bit low for my likings. They are all certainly drinkable, but very far from exciting. (071006)
Holmegaard Mosebryg;Holmegaard, Denmark;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Holmegaard Bryghus;(On tap). Completely cloudy, orangey golden with a small, off-white head. Lightly sweetish, malty nose.

Heart of Wales Innstable;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);"Cask (handpump), as Heart of Wales Inn Stable, at the Darlington Spring Thing beer festival 2011. ABV was 6.8%, according to the festival programme. Cloudy orange colour, low head. Aroma of unfermented wort, fruity and grassy (or rather: hay-like) hops. Poor condition, the flavour seems ""unfinished"" and ""raw"". Some caramel, hops and fusel alcohols, quite dry. Not much to brag about."
Heart of Wales Innstable;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);Bottle. Slightly muddy appearance on opening which was a bit off putting. Pleasantly fruity with a medium body. Some bitterness and quite a powerful presence. Shame about the appearance.

Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of frothy medium sized white colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent softly carbonated body with junk floating in it . The weak aroma was malty and grassy. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The weird flavor contained notes of malt. There was something off in the flavor. A horrible one that I would rather not drink again. What’s with these beers from Florida we bought? So many bad ones came from there. My last set of ratings were the lowest I’ve seen in a long time.
Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);12oz bottle from ABC in fort myers. copper pour. bubbly soda look - but almost no head. faint smells of medicine. tastes like flat caramel malts and skunkiness. astringent sweet finish. fairly awful.
Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);"Bottle.Small off-white head with decent retention, very little carbonation, transparent, no lacing, and a gold hue. The aroma reminds me of nothing but medicine and sulfur. The flavor was very astringent and bitter. Mouthfeel was fairly smooth and a medium bodied beer. Since I have nothing good to say about this ""beer"" other than don’t bother trying it."
Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);...well, this beer tasted like the asshole of a red dragon, if such a thing existed. Horrible, overly syrupy with overpowering medicine flavors, like a cough syrup, or nyquil. I would bever drink this again, and you should never waste your money on it either, unless you are a dumbass, then do it.
Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Single 12 oz. bottle from Total Wine in Jacksonville. Bottled in China, imported by Cuidao USA out of Hollywood FL. I’m a bit wary because this beer is in the dreaded green bottle. Let’s see what’s up with this one...Pours a amber color with very little head. A bit of sediment is evident in the bottom of the bottle. Aroma is not existent. Taste is woeful. Caramel and skunk. I’m sure this beer, when fresh, is much better, but until they can figure out a way to bring a Chinese beer to America in something other than a barge ship, this is one to avoid at all costs. Yuck!
Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Bleh. Darkish copper, somewhat like tea. No head at all, along with virtually no effervescence. Sulfuric skunky aroma. A touch of strong caramel candy. Sulfur and bad toffee on a flat palate, with a unpleasant astringency and bitterness near the finish. Immediate drain pour!
Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);I did my best job to find something, anything decent about this beer. i considered region and culture. this was horrible. the worst pale lager i have ever had. made me want to drink nat. light. since i couldnt even finsh it i will try and describe this disaister. smell is of herbs but not atractive ones such as fennel or coriander. more like medcine gone bad. taste is exactly the same, some kind of sweet medicine with NO CARBONATION. flat and replusive. light as water on the tongue and a terrible aftertaste. didnt bottle to remove it from the bottle other than pouring it down my sink. THANK GOD i bought only 1 bottle for a dollar. DON’T BOTHER TO TRY. EVER.
Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);12 oz bottle. This bottle doesn’t mention the word “light”, but then I can’t read Chinese. It has “Xtreme Beer” on the label. So I don’t know where it belongs on RateBeer. RateBeer has become more jumbled and confusing, and with beer categories that often conflict with what the bottle label says. This one is definitely a pale lager just like its category states. Aroma of sweet pale malts Cheap and sweet tasting. Cloying. Typical cheap third world lager flavor reminiscent of watered down fortified red wine (Richard’s Wild Irish Rose?). This stuff probably sells for pennies a bottle in China, and is sold for quality import prices in the US. I can brew better than this even on a bad day. Barely drinkable and not even close to being worth the price paid (and that wasn’t much). Any cheap Ameican macro lager beats this. Boo..
Red Dragon Lager (Extreme Beer);Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Bottle... Lightly hazed, golden lager with a small, fizzy, white head. Medicinal aroma with undertones of brown sugar and toffee. The flavor is a blend of orange blossom and wildflower honey... sweet, sweet, sweet with a pinch of clove and just a touch more sweetness after the initial sweetness. Did I mention sweet? Just a few hops, please! Medium-bodied and moderately oily with lively carbonation. Sweet, mead-like finish... Luden’s honey flavored cough drops come to mind.
Dobbins & Jackson Newport Pale Ale;Newport, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dobbins & Jackson;Cask conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Gold with white head. Served exceedingly cold and flat. Malty, thin bitter, a little underflavoured but that could be the temperature. Interesting that this Spoons had the barmaids wearing badges of their nationalities, not one was British.
Arctic Craft On-On Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Arctic Craft Brewery;I sampled this brew at the brewery in 2008. As it’s description says, this pale ale is light on hops which brings my rating of this beer lower than average. The flavor was not complex but it was smooth. Overall, this pale ale is average and I would probably not buy this beer again
Arctic Craft On-On Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Arctic Craft Brewery;12oz can(courtesy of RSRIZZO)-It pours a nice amber body with a small off white head and an aroma of malt and caramel.

Arctic Craft On-On Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Arctic Craft Brewery;Winning floral and caramel malt aroma, appearance of dark apple cider. Subdued NW hop profile and more malt on the tongue. Light carbonation but good bite, enough for me anyway. Not really my favorite style, but a good balance here.
Arctic Craft On-On Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Arctic Craft Brewery;Had this beer at the All Colorado Beer Fest on 11/10/2007. Aroma is light with some roasted malt tones. Color is a light hazy brown with ok carbonation and a thin yet tight head.

Nose of wood and barrel, light bourbon and soy sauce. The flavor is dry and woody, bourbon and light roast, some clean sweet chocolate. It’s ironic how so many beers to reek of diacetyl and this one actually advertises such and has none.

Arctic Craft Oak Aged Butterscotch Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arctic Craft Brewery;RBSG 07. Growler. A very candy nose that has some abv with it (now I know why). A coal black pour with no head or lace. A deep hard coffee flavor and a diacetyl flavor that could be called butterscotch. A bit thin with no carbonation. I’m surprised that it was 15%.
Arctic Craft Oak Aged Butterscotch Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arctic Craft Brewery;Growler... RBSG 07... Pitch black ale with no head. I’m able to pull no butterscotch out of the nose, but I’m getting loads of vanilla, sourmash and strong notes of chocolate. Woodsy, chocolaty flavor with a mild whisky burn. Full-bodied with an ultra-creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Burnt, medium bitter finish with a touch of ethanol warmth. As I enter this rating, I see the ABV for this beer is around 15%. Wow, didn’t taste like it. Nice job, guys, however, where was all that butterscotch I was looking forward to?
Arctic Craft Oak Aged Butterscotch Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arctic Craft Brewery;Sampled at the RBSG ’07 from growler, compliments of brewfiend. Pours a clear dark brown brew with no head except a thin bubble ring on the glass edge. Aroma of distinct butterscotch, caramel & toffee, with a touch of light creamed coffee. Taste is light to medium body, slick and smooth finish. Slight caramel aftertaste. The 15% alcohol seems to be high on the potent scale but it does has a slight alcohol warmth.
Arctic Craft Oak Aged Butterscotch Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arctic Craft Brewery;(Growler) Pours a brown body with virtually no head. Aroma of butterscotch, nuts, and roastiness. Flavor of toffee, oak, and some chocolate. Flavors are too separated and do not blend that well. Abv well hidden.
Arctic Craft Oak Aged Butterscotch Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arctic Craft Brewery;RBSG 2007 Grand Tasting - Dark brownish black, zero head. Nose was faint with alcohol, butterscotch, and coffee. Light flavor of butterscotch and coffee that ended with some soft bitter alcohol warmth. Light bodied and oily, soft carbonation, lightly bittersweet finish. My hope was high for this one, but expectations were not nearly met. They can’t all be gems...
Arctic Craft Oak Aged Butterscotch Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arctic Craft Brewery;RBSG 2007 Grand Tasting Thanks Brewfiend for bringing this unique brew to the tasting. Sweet initial flavor. Undercarbonated, yet not terribly. Something just slightly off here. Didn’t taste like it was 15% ABV. Didn’t get any of the JD whiskey flavor either. Interesting attempt. Not my favorite.
Phipps Purston Gold;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hoggleys;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Northampton BF. Another test brew for the upcoming Phipps Brewery done at Hoggleys. This one is more copper than gold despite the name. The aroma is pretty standard but again there are hints of diacetyl to spoil. The taste is pretty standard also. An acceptably balnced English bitter with decent hops and malt, but that diacetyl makes a small appearance again.
Potbelly Ambrosia;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Rather pleasant slight honey / toffee hint but certainly not sweet - nor sharply bitter. Very quaffable and interesting enough for me to have a second dose!
Potbelly Ambrosia;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Cask conditioned at Banbury Beer Fest ’14. Brown with white head. Sweet malted beer, some caramelisation, toffee notes, a little boiled character, some vegetable notes. Nothing outstanding.
Potbelly Ambrosia;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Amber color with a small white head. The nose is lightly grassy with some strawberry and caramel malt. The taste is light floral hops, more caramel and orchard fruits. Fairly simple, clean flavors. Overall, OK. Nothing special. I don’t think this is a mild, mind.
Potbelly Ambrosia;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Called a mild, but is a bitter to me. Dark gold with mid body. Fruity and sweet with light hoppy bitter.
Potbelly Ambrosia;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Potbelly Brewery;"Cask (gravity dispense) at Reading Beer Festival, 30 April 2009. Described n the festival programme as a ""dark mild"" but more of a copper colour really. Pleasant caramel aroma. Smooth and easy drinking. More caramel/toffee in the flavour than roast. A bit sweet. Fairly solid but didn’t really grab me. Not a patch on Beijing Black."

RJ King Wingwalker Summer Honey Wheat;Novato, California, United States;Wheat Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Bought cheap at the local supermarket, which is not and will not be listed in Places! It pours a golden orange body with a short-lived white head. No lace. It has an unchecked sweet aroma, bready malt with old honey, including a bit of beeswax. The flavor, too, is bready and it has the stale sweetnes of honey. Glad it was cheap.
RJ King Wingwalker Summer Honey Wheat;Novato, California, United States;Wheat Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;pours a very cloudy orange with visible chunks of sediment. Very slight sweet smell to it. The taste is just... this beer has to be skunked, but given the other beers by this brewery, it could just be the normal taste. It’s like stale honey with some bitter hop aftertaste. Another sub-par beer from a sub-par brewery.
RJ King Wingwalker Summer Honey Wheat;Novato, California, United States;Wheat Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Horrible beer with a thick milk like body. Cheap taste and reminds me more of food than beer. Skip this at all costs
RJ King Wingwalker Summer Honey Wheat;Novato, California, United States;Wheat Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Found this one bottled at my local Osco liquor store in St. Charles, Illinois. Cloudy, dark orange pour with a thick white head. Timid nose, just a touch of malty sweetness and candy apple. Bready but watery, with a smooth, balanced finish. I see what they are doing, but I’m pretty indifferent about the results.

Pours a sunset golden with a small, short lived white head. Nose of citrus hops, wheat, and malt. Flavor is smooth with maltiness and a little citrus. Rather sweet. The ""crisp finish"" is fairly mute."
RJ King Wingwalker Summer Honey Wheat;Novato, California, United States;Wheat Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Semi cloudy orange gold with minimal short lived head. Aroma is faint hence the lower rating. Mild grain with some honey sweetness and faint citrus. Mouth feel is watery but goes down quick and smooth. Just don’t let this get much warmer than fridge temps. Decent enough for what it is which is basically a Grocery Store lawn Mower beer. Better than BMC. Price about $6 a six. Have not seen it in 12’ers
RJ King Wingwalker Summer Honey Wheat;Novato, California, United States;Wheat Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Thin, watery, sweet. I dont get how this is 3.3 avg? This is better than the light however.
RJ King Wingwalker Summer Honey Wheat;Novato, California, United States;Wheat Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Unfiltered, dirty orange coloured beer, nice sized frothy white head. Aroma is rather weak,slightly cirtic ,but quite bready, not horrible. Some wheatiness in the flavour and a good semi-sweet honey tone, sweetness gives way at the end to a slight graininess. I actually liked the palate on this one, it felt full and smooth, and not to cloying. Actually not that bad of a summer beer, had far worse.
RJ King Wingwalker Summer Honey Wheat;Novato, California, United States;Wheat Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Bottle: Meh, thin, light head and lacing. Very light smell, some stale starch. A bit of husk in the flavor, which is about all the flavor this one gives up. There’s a lot better summer beers for your money.

Otley O5;Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Otley;Cask at the White Horse, 19th May 2010. Light amber with a line of white head. Thick-ish palate, lacks condition - it was hard going and it was probably the end of the barrel. Faint citrus aroma. Sharpish initial taste of clementines, then flat and lacking bite or any sort of dry finish. Will aim to re-rate when I can.

Inox Cuvée Spéciale (Bitter);Québec, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brasserie INOX Brewery;"My Bottom Line: A deft floral, soapy and orangey hop perfume offers plenty of flavors, leading to the pleasant herbal bitterness. As you have noticed, maltiness isn’t much of a player here, barely supporting this drinkable Bitter’s frugal hops. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam sits atop the hazy blond-amber. -The aroma and flavor profile are all in the same direction, which is disappointing (malt doesn’t contribute much). -This was served pretty cold, helping drinkability, but exposing the frail maltiness once it had warmed up. -Not much of a ""Cuvée Spéciale"" if you ask me, but I don’t think the brewer can do as he pleases at this brewpub. On tap at the brewpub."
La Plaisir de Au Maître Brasseur (Brune Belge);Laval, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;AMB - Au Maître Brasseur;341ml bottle purchased at La Trappe a Fromage in Gatineau, Quebec. Deep clear mahogany in colour with a thin off-white head, light lacing. Aroma is quite malty, lots of caramel sweetness, brown sugar, dark fruits. Flavour is quite sweet with lots of sugar and caramel, some alcohol, a little watery as well, burnt cake. Thin alcoholic mouthfeel, medium/light body, moderate carbonation. Finishes long with alcohol and quite sweet still. Quite a bit of alcohol is noticeable and very sweet throughout. Unbalanced and thin. Opened in 2010.
La Plaisir de Au Maître Brasseur (Brune Belge);Laval, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;AMB - Au Maître Brasseur;Purchased a while back in Laval (I think) and cellared. Comes in a brown 750ml bottle with a plastic cork (like most cheap Champagne) and the metal-wire stopper. Pours a clean darker amber colour with an off-white foamy head, average retention and a little lacing. Aromas of apples (green and red) with some roasted malt and hints of licorice. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. 8% ABV and no burn whatsoever. The taste is pretty mild too (a little too much). Still good, with some sweet malts, fruits, a touch of molasses and hints of hop in the finish. As I pour some more beer, the colour is becoming more copper and some haziness is showing from the stuff at the bottom of my bottle. I think this one is meant to be cellared a bit (as it might be unbalanced if drank too fresh).
La Plaisir de Au Maître Brasseur (Brune Belge);Laval, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;AMB - Au Maître Brasseur;Bottle. Pours a deep amber brown with a thin head light lacing.

Flavor is cobwebby, old crackery, dusty, fruity raisin esters, cookiedough, earth, must, light cinnamon hints? A bit stale and oxidized. I think this was drank in 2007.

Brewer's Alley Best of Show (BOS);Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;"Sampled on tap at the brewery. The beer was a dark amber-brown color with a small to medium white head that had decent retention. The aroma was a mixture of wheat, yeast, and some lighter fruity and floral hop notes. It had an interesting flavor, which was mostly sweet, but also had a nice, sour counterpart. The body was full and somewhat wet, with some wheaty characteristics; medium carbonation and fizzyness."

Big E Ellerweiser;Lynnwood, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ellersick Brewing Co. Big E Ales;"Draft at the brewpub. Pours a crystal clear gold with definite presence of bubbles. Thin ring of white film atop. Grassy sweet hay-ish nose; these notes persist on the mid-palate. It’s a nice clean and mild, easy-drinking pale. Getting it fresh right down the street keeps the staleness away. Not gonna make me a pale lager fan right away, but this is decent stuff. Especially given the constraints of the style."
Church End Poachers Pocket;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Church End Brewery;Hand-pulled cask @ The Church End Brewery taproom. Very subtle malt on the nose, thin in the mouth and on the finish, lacking any real bitterness or hop character. Some biscuit in the finish, but otherwise a bit of a dud.

A hazy amber pour with a tight cream head; aroma of sour cider apples; sour fruit taste with a soupy, grainy, body; and a tart finish. Poor, as this was getting towards the bottom of the barrel, but rapidly substituted by the publican, as he’s keen to ensure he serves good beer."

Uncle Stuarts North Norfolk Beauty;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Uncle Stuarts;Brown 500ml bottle, part of a mixed four pack given to me by a friend. Best before the end of June 2009, drank at the end of Nov 2008. Batch number 1009nnb. This is a bottle conditioned beer, so I poured it very slowly and carefully into a Imperial Pint sleeve glass. No sediment left the bottle. A very pale yellow almost golden body, loads of carbonisation rising up to the well formed white foaming head. We are talking straw blonde, almost lager like in appearance, but not as sparkling or bright. The aroma was of oatmeal biscuits and yeast with a hint of hops hidden away as the beer warmed in the glass. No storng over-riding flavours, oats, wheat, barley, white bread and some dry hoppy aftertaste is what I could find and I had to dig deep to find those. The carbonisation that showed its self during and after the pour wasn’t to be found in the actual drink, it wasn’t flat, but it wasn’t fizzy either, just about right. Sadly there was no real body, but it isn’t ’wishy-washy’. The sort of beer you’d blend with something stronger, and with more ’Umph’ if it was your own home-brew. Pleasant enough, but lacking in the body and flavour stakes for me. I do want the smaller guys to do well, but they have got to produce a product that ’knocks my socks off’ if they expect me and my mates (and the public in general) to pay the extra prices they need to survive, compared to the discounts the big boys can offer.

Uncle Stuarts North Norfolk Beauty;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Uncle Stuarts;A mid orange amber coloured beer with a weak white head. a strange fruit nose, some malt and a hint of hop, but a sweet strawberry jam aroma that is quite off-putting. The taste is bitter and malty, with hints of hop again, but then the jammy fruit element comes through that creates a cloying, bitter sweet finish. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).

Fresh and hoppy beer, good dry body and quite light in character. Finishes dry, citric lemon and grapefruit.

Ok nose of dark malts and citrusy hops. Fairly complex malt bill, but also pretty raw hoppy, with grapefruit hints. Good first attempt for them at this style. They should keep tweakng the recipe. Good beer overall.

Aroma is cocoa, cream, faint caramel. Lots of bitterness and chocolate dominate the palate. Slight molasses. Finish has that nice blend of roasted malt and bitter hops. Just a touch sour. Medium bodied, texture is soft. Probably FCB’s best dark ale effort since Chocolate Stout, although the two beers are similar.
Elliott Bay Noir Von Boorian;Seattle, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Pours dark brown with a tan head. The aging in Pinot Noir barrels immediately becomes apparent. An almost brett like aroma, grapes, and stone fruits spread on toast.

Had a glass of this with the chicken and sausage gumbo. Stood up well to the spicyness of the gumbo and tabasco. I like this beer a lot.
Abita Select IPA;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;IPA;Abita Brewing Company;"Draft at Lager’s in Metairie. Medium amber boy with little head. Even through all the smoke the aroma is crisp and hoppy with herbal, grassy notes. The flavor is hoppy but not overpowering; nice citrus and piney character. A light maltiness rounds out the flavor nicely. Finishes dry and sweet. This is a well-made IPA."
Black Isle Ruby;Munlochy, Ross & Cromarty, Scotland;Red Ale - Irish;Black Isle Brewing;[i] [b] Bottle from Craig, cheers mate!, had this 01-02-08 [/i] [/b] Poured dark reddy brown very murky and a real erupter to the extent that I probably lost half of it over the work surface. Quite a fruity nose even a touch of sourness quite dry to taste bit sour again very fruity but this felt quite rough to me and afraid to say not my thing at all.
Black Isle Ruby;Munlochy, Ross & Cromarty, Scotland;Red Ale - Irish;Black Isle Brewing;Bottle, thanks cgarvieuk! Lively carbonation, rocky head, cloudy red beer. Very rich beer, the label says this is ideal with roast beef, and you almost get a meaty feeling in the mouth. There are fruits and berries and loads of grain and malt, too. Sligtly oaky dry finish, a little sourness. They have managed to cram a lot of good stuff into this beer. I’d love to try it on cask!

Paddock Wood Raven Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;(Draught) Pours a lasting thin, creamy head with an orange body. Nose of mild English malt. Very thin texture and palate. Minor tart bitterness through the end. Fairly average but nice bridging beer for the general population.
Paddock Wood Organic Brown Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Brown Ale;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;(Draught) Thin, dissipated creamy tan head with a deep orange body. Nose of mild roasted malts. Very potent flavours displayed - toasted malt and a great bitter hoppiness. Delicious stuff!
Paddock Wood Organic Hefeweizen;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;(Draught) Pours a thin, dissipated white head with a highly carbonated body. Tart nose. I thought I was detecting some berry nuts aromas but I had just come from The Berry Barn so I may have had some Saskatoon Berries on my hands. Very fresh and fulfilling for a hot day like today - but I’m not getting the wheat hint I’d expect from this style.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;On tap at Craft Beer Market in Calgary, AB on 09/17/2011. Colour: Dark orange with red hue. Nose: Sweet raisin, sourdough bread, rich malt. Taste: Medium-light sweet, medium-light bitter, light sour. Soapy. Hops are stringent but do display some bitterness. Late wood blast. Average.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;Pours a peachy colour, with unfiltered look, minimal head. Not a commonly made style this ide of the bond. Tangy bitterness, apricot and peach flavours. Decent flavour for a lower abv. Bramling Cross hops.Bottle at Zyn in Calgary under the previous name.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;A pretty solid bitter style ale. The pour is amber bodied with a large foamy white head. Aroma is sweet and malty with a mild hoppy aroma. Fuggles and East Kent Golding hop nose. The taste is sweet and malty with a light hoppy finish. Overall, a sweet and very drinkable beer, just not memorable.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;"355ml brown bottle. Different label, just called ""Bramling Cross"" now. Pours an orange brown colour, slight haze. Small creamy white cap with some very creamy lacing. Nose has nutty malt up front, also a hint of toffee. Flavour is of nutty malt, caramel, slightly earthy. Nice hop fade, light leafy aftertaste. Light body, mild carboantion, gentle mouthfeel. Decent session beer."
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;Had some time ago, but remember it tasting off. Definitely not my favourite of Paddock Wood’s offerings. Would not get again.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;***on tap at sugarbowl*** Pretty much the same but fresher. Worms. A not-quite clear light copper brew that poured out a thin cap with minimal carbonation. Aroma is on the mild side, but that is not to say that there is not an ample ammount to be found. Mainly malts (a touch caramelly) and some sweet orange-like citrusy hops - possible having a slight creamsicle smell. Taste is quite malty for a second then these tasty come in. They do not overpower, just blend it nicely. The hops are quite fruity and as the tasting moves along, are becoming more prominent. Light medium bodied. The hop hit is heavier than it should be but are quite tangy. Somewhat smooth feel. Finishes dry with a lingering hoppiness. Really drinkable. Another tasty concoction from Paddock.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;Body looks hazy brown with a cooper tinge, cap was ok but quickly vanished only leaving a good sized skiff. Aroma has metallic hops that seem to turn into melon the longer you smell and lots of light creamy malt character seems to be a touch sweet but not over the top. Very bitter taste with a touch of crisp hops and tons upon tons of malt, and once again just like in the smell it has a bitter with slight melon finish. Clean taste with full bodied feel and a soft carbonation feel on the tung. Simple and tasty and easy to slam, highly enjoyable brew. Can the farmers in Saskatchewan even begin to appreciate this well crafted beer I mean it taste nothing like lucky lager.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;Pours from a bottle with a deep amber color with a small, thin, white head and medium carbonation. Aroma is very light and made up of some light bread maltiness with a little stronger grassy hops aroma at the end. Flavor starts off with a light sweet bread flavor and ends with a grassy bitterness. Beer leaves a great lacing on the side of the glass and, as with all of Paddock Woods beer I have had, has a dead on mouth feel for the beer style. Another winner by this brewery.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;Bottle courtesy of CBA: Poured an hazy amber color ale with a nice big foamy head with some good retention and some lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt with some dry hops. Taste was also dominated by some biscuit malt note with some nice English dry hops at the end. Body was above average with some nice carbonation. Very well done overall and something that I wouldn’t mind having as a regular session beer.
Paddock Wood Brambling Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Paddock Wood Microbrewery;Bottle @ TimE’s House: Pours a hazy bronze brown color, a nice head and lacing. The nose is lightly vegetal, some light bright and woody hops along with a subtle malt essence. The flavor is piney with a decent yeast and malt body, thin disappointing finish. This beer seems adjustable to what you what, quaff it, chug it, but it’s certainly not one to be savored.
Poperings Nunnebier;Vichte, West-Vlaanderen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Verhaeghe;Bottle in Molenhof, Oostvleteren. Clear golden oily looking beer with a thin white foam head. Nose is sweet, perfumed, light candy, floral, light apple juice, hints of caramel, barley sugar, toasty barley grains. Taste is sweet, candy sugar, barley sugar, bitter dry—ish hop, floral perfumed sweetness, toasted barley grains. A shade on the sweet side for me but very decent. Finish is a lingering sweet toasted grains and candy, with a little prickly hop.
Cricket Hill Tennessee Reserve;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;Clear dark brown pour with a thin ring of foam for a head. Smells like a bag of candy. Brown paper, molasses, some licorice, some vanilla and chocolate and maybe some mint too.. No hop aroma. The flavor is complex and sweet and pretty much follows the aroma. I don’t really pick up much character from the Bourbon, but perhaps it is subtle and is what is offering all of the complexities in the flavor. Caramel, dark dried fruits, molasses. Pretty tasty and I like that the Bourbon flavors are understated and balanced with the malts.
Cricket Hill Tennessee Reserve;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;On cask at the brewery. It was nice to try this one. The American Ale really went well in the barrell. It was a nice change from stouts and sours in the barrells.
Cricket Hill Tennessee Reserve;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;Served directly from oak barrel, this had a citrusy nose, and was a copper color with a small light tan head. The smoky bourbon barrel flavor was very pronounced and the mouthfeel was a tad sticky. Overall, it had a nice flavor (in a boilermaker sort of way), but I think this one is more of a winter brew. Next time, I hope they try aging their very drinkable Porter in this same fashion.
Cricket Hill Tennessee Reserve;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;on cask at the brewery party 06.02.07 Lightly hazy amber in color with a small bubby head. Aroma: caramel, floral and citrus hops, notes of berries/dark fruit, wood and bourbon. Taste- pretty much the same as American ale with a good dose of bourbon and wood. Bourbon and oak is alittle too strong for this beer, as I expected it would be. Still, an interesting experiment.
Schaumburger Lüttje Lagen;Stadthagen, Lower Saxony, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Schaumburger Privat-Brauerei;Room temperature bottle at the hotel. Thanks Erzangel for the bottle! Dark brown. Aroma of malt drink, a bit of chocolate, some metal and nuts. Nutty, slightly bitter, slightly metallic and some English cake and prune.

Stone Smoked Porter - Vanilla Bean;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;I originally saw this for about $7.99, which was a little too high for me. Then saw it for about the same price as the regular smoked porter, just under $6, so figured I'd should try it now. Vanilla adds some sweetness to it, perhaps a tad too sweet. Takes away some of the smokiness. Might add some to the aroma though. Getting some toasted and roasted malt flavors as well. Still great beer and worth the try, just not sure this it needed the variations.

Wig & Pen Hop Heads;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wig & Pen Brewery;"This was called ""Hop Heads using Modus Operandus"" when I tried it the Wig and Pen in the middle of May. An APA served through a randall and I was happy! Tasting notes stated that the hops used were Galaxy. Fresh hops both on the nose and in the taste with a decent backbone of malt. Only had one pint of this as there were other beers to try."
Wig & Pen Hop Heads;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at Wig & Pen, Canberra.

Notes and flavour of caramel, biscuit, grapefruit, passionfruit and pine. Oily mouthfeel with a smooth, bitter finish. Extremely drinkable!
Wig & Pen Hop Heads;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wig & Pen Brewery;All very interesting but foul tasting. Fish oil predominates with a rotten vegetable overtone. Will stick to the other Wig and Pen favourites.
Wig & Pen Hop Heads;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at the Wig & Pen. My first beer through a randall (topaz hops where used in this batch). Arrived copper with a creamy white head which was fully lasting. Aroma was packed to the brim with sappy pine cones and pine needles, with strong earthy and herbal notes, caramel malts, marmalade and some salt. Flavor was a strong oily hop bitterness with strong notes of fish oil, sappy resin with some toffee malts hiding beneath and a salty finish. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation, oil/watery texture, dry/creamy mouthfeel and a great finish. Superbly different.
Wig & Pen Hop Heads;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wig & Pen Brewery;cool, my first ever beer through a randall. this was a darkish IPA - copper i’d call it - quite full bodied and crystal malty - but with the most ridiculously huge hop flavour. the malt and the hop acidity reminded me of a strong cup of assam tea. the hops in the randall were Victorian Super Pride which wouldnt be my first choice! however i enjoyed the bracing eucalyptus/menthol oiliness. not subtle in the slightest but full marks for overthetopness.
Mystic Mead Cherry Mead;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;Mead;Lakewood Vineyards, Inc.;"Long legged and thinned by age, this still melomel pours a murky red with caramel golden underlying hues. Quite unattractive. The aroma is ghastly. Medicinal cherry juice and tart honey don’t stand a chance at a peaceful marriage of flavor, a flavor that’s further inhibited by intrusive alcohol. The alcohol level found here errs on the low side for a typical cherry melomel, so this is especially concerning. The flavor brings grainy, sweet cherry skins and less than adequate honey into the fold. Sweetness is moderate, tartness is mild, though at an unacceptable level. Acidity is misleading; relevant and noticeable enough to bear mention, though it also doesn’t succeed in it’s intended purpose. Alcohol is drying and probably the only aspect of the palate that keeps this drinkable. The finish is medium-dry and cloying, never approaching the nuances and sensations of pleasure so often observed in better mead recipes. The mouthfeel is slick and spiky with grainy particulates. An awful mead."
Mystic Mead Cherry Mead;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;Mead;Lakewood Vineyards, Inc.;The aroma is cherry cough syrup with gobs of honey propping it up. Copper/amber in color with no head. Very nice cherry kissed mead that is quite reserved in terms of alcohol. I don’t know much about meads, about what is ideal for them, but I do very much enjoy this.

Smooth palate with flavors of sweet malt and mellow hops and other candy flavors.

Nils Oscar KaffeCasken;Nyköping, Sweden;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Nils Oscar;Cask at Oliver Twist - Stockholm June ’07. Dominated by coffee big time. Brew with hints of roasted malts and chocolate. I wish I lived down the street from Oliver Twist - outstanding pub.
Nils Oscar KaffeCasken;Nyköping, Sweden;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Nils Oscar;Cask, Oliver Twist Deepest brown, slight film leaving without lacing. Rather profound, strong complexified coffee that only develop its cherry, jammy complexity in mouth, though it feels a bit tart there and this removes from the coffee enjoyment. pear-like nuances. Of course all about the malts, faintest leafy hops. Tough graininess throughout. Smooth, rounded palate. Not a bad one.

Roasted nose with immense notes of black coffee and hints of chocolate. Roasted taste with a dominant coffee character, hints of chocolate, moccha and bitter coffee notes in the finish. A bit like drinking cold black, strong coffee. Not very modest, but very interesting (I agree with omhper, it was about time they brewed something adventurous again). Lovely coffee character.
Nils Oscar KaffeCasken;Nyköping, Sweden;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Nils Oscar;Kaffekasken is a old Swedich way to drink coffey by adding a small amount of vodka to your coffey. This beer defenetly got the coofey aromas. As from what i could se at OT they have had some consults from a barista in making this beer. Me, not beeing a coffey drinker think that the aromas are to overvelming and the beer would be better if the aromas would be a little less.
Nils Oscar KaffeCasken;Nyköping, Sweden;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Nils Oscar;Cask@Oliver Twist (thanks omhper!) Really dark brown colour with mediumsized creamy head.

Sigtuna Scarborogh Fair Choko-Bira;Arlandastad, Sweden;Porter;Sigtuna Brygghus;Bottle, Oliver twist fest Small 70L batch, 1g of coffee per liter on top of the chocolate. Rather generous light brown head covers the pretty black pour. Rather intense, dark chocolate nose bringing out a fair bit of acidity. Deep roastiness with a mild fruitiness emerging through, but not necessarily individual notes, just a rather general fruity feel, possibly even from the chocolate. medium bodied, fairly grainy bitterness. A good effort from Sigtuna, especially having brought the cocoa back themselves!

Pump House Barley Wine;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pump House Brewery;Sampled on tap at DDC. The pour reveals a dark copper color with ruby highlights and a slightly cloudy, medium, offwhite head that leaves superb lacing on the glass. Very attractive aroma of hops, with caramel malt and candied fruits. Excellent flavor of hops, caramel malt and candied fruits, the alcohol is not detectable. The body is medium with a liquorous texture and gentle carbonation. Unlike a lot of barley wines, it’s not intense, but it’s not sybtle eather, it’s complex and an easy sipper, it’s dangerously easy to drink.
Pump House Barley Wine;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pump House Brewery;Tap at DDC. Clear redish-mahogany body topped by a beige ring of foam. Splendid barley wine that puts more emphasis on its complex fruity flavours rather than the thick caramelized malts. Dessert fruits flavours ranging from berries to kiwis(!) in a rich caramel and candy sweetness. Sweet creamy malted body with a cake/pancake taste and mouthfeel. Just the right amount of grassy hops to balance the whole thing and give the beer an overall herbal feeling. Excellent. Who could have thought I would find a top-class Barley Wine from New Brunswick in Montreal’s DDC? Certainly not my cousin Jeremy… he’s 3 years old.
Pump House Barley Wine;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pump House Brewery;On tap at DDC, June 2 2007. A clear reddish brown ale with a still appearance, a very thin light moka head. In aroma, a pleasant fruity sweet malt, like treacle candy, vinous notes and classy floral hops. In mouth, an honest and balanced caramel malt with good citrusy hops, resinous, and warming alcohol in finale....very nice.
Pump House Barley Wine;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pump House Brewery;"My Bottom Line: A luxurious mouthfeel sets the stage for a complex baccate fruitiness to ride the seductive caramel maltiness of this most classy English-style Barley Wine. A resinous hop finish is perfectly positioned, and the following sip will be taken shortly after the lips and gums have been thoroughly licked clean. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam laces atop the filtered blood red. -This vintage has been perfectly aged. -There is some alcohol warming, but in no way does it bother the experience; in fact, this warmth makes you want to slip deeper into your seat. -Earthiness tags along the resinous hop presence. -A grandiose beer from the Pump House; amazing work Daniel! 2005 vintage, on tap at Dieu du Ciel!, Montréal."

Flock Inn Bois Baaach;Brecha, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flock Inn;Hazy copper coloured ale covered by a lasting off-white ring. Spicy toasted malts appear at first bready, but remind more of pancakes and with a strange algae-like herbal touch. Blueberry and strawberry toppings join in as well. Surprising flavours that you would not expect to be so good a match, but the balance is present and the assembling is efficient. One of my favourite from Wales, but quite watery.

The aroma is sweet and fruity with lots of pulp but there does appear mto be more pear than apple notes. This is replicated in the taste. Not sure if it’s the dessert apples but it seems a bit of a hybrid to me. Hints of sourness. Very tasty but odd, but how welcome. A third cider producer in Northants.

More porter-like than properly stout. Still has plenty of roasted malt aromas and tastes, but it’s not got the depth of burntness that I expect from stouts.

3 Brasseurs La Belle Province;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);"Bottle 33cl from 3 Brasseurs Strasbourg. A cloudy amber brown beer with good head, got some gushing. Nose is spicy with caramel and slightly sour background. Taste is quite sweet, tannic. Aroma is on caramel, toasted caramel, spice, light butterscotch, light lactic / sour notes that provides cherries notes. Finish is a bit vinous, good honey and caramel touch, pleasant and correct complexity;"
3 Brasseurs La Belle Province;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);Appearance: An amber-orange body with a thick, white head and a fair amount of carbonation. Smell: Some malt with a light sweetness. No maple syrup aroma. Taste: Slight roasted malt with a bitter finish, some caramel maybe but still no sign of the maple syrup. Mouthfeel: Better than the initial taste with a slight, shy sweetness. As it warms, the elusive maple comes out a little. A bit thin but i can taste the hops finish with it’s bitterness. Maple kind of an aftertaste only. There’s also a taste reminiscent of nuts.
3 Brasseurs La Belle Province;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);Flip-top .75 litre bottle (most likely the French version): shared with my son on Christmas Day 2016. An off-white head sat on a reddy brown body that oozed maltiness from start to finish. More semi-sweet caramel and toffee notes than ’maple syrup’ in the nose and flavour for me. Quite liked it.
3 Brasseurs La Belle Province;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);From a French bottle, light yeasty aroma, this is quite well balanced for a Belgian ale, I was worried the maple syrup would make it too sweet, but there is enough spice on the finish to make it quite drinkable .
3 Brasseurs La Belle Province;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);Bottle from Les 3 Brasseurs Lille (FR). Amber with very rich beige head. Roasted carmel (not very intenese) taste with dry moderae bitterness, which stays in the aftertaste.
3 Brasseurs La Belle Province;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);Surprisingly huge gusher. Surprising because this brewer’s beers are generally quite clean, even the bottle refermented ones. This is yeasty, peachy, Vienna malts, not bad but a straightforward blonde. Medium bitter (for the style) and simple malt base. Luckily not sugary and also quite a nice mouth feel. Not nice that I lost half the bottle though... (33cl bottle from the
3 Brasseurs La Belle Province;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);Interesting dark orange pour with a hint of frothy head that dissipates. Sugary hop aroma. Oddly complex, as there’s certainly a general sugary (maple sugar!) malt backing, but also some definite hoppy and fruity notes that seem to interchange. An interesting taste, though it gets all mixed up in the finish, which makes drinking this a bit of a chore by the end of it. Certainly an interesting one!
3 Brasseurs La Belle Province;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);Swing-top bottle - 750ml. Beautiful cloudy amber body with a huge off-white foamy head. Decent malty/hoppy aroma with maple hints. Alcohol is well hidden. Taste is well balanced but it lacks complexity. Carbonation is a bit agressive. Ends with a decent bittersweet finish. Drinkable.

Schoune 1608;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Bottle (341 ml). Split 2-ways with Minderbinder. To be honest, we didn’t finished it. Appearance: Clear golden/orange with a small white head and some lacing. Aroma: Perfume, yeast/spices, alcohol notes (which is kind of weird for a 5 % abv beer) and light rotten fruits. Taste: Some spiciness, rotten fruits, perfumy notes an alcohol. Palate: Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Fruity finish. Overall: It’s pretty bad, but at least it can be drunk without the fear of passing away unlike La Place du Marché and Douce Caresse.
Schoune 1608;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Bottle 341ml. Pours dark golden with low white head. Some lacing. Aroma is of fruits, sugar.

Schoune 1608;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;I come from France and I came here last summer and I loved this beer!!!
Schoune 1608;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Summer 2012 Had this as part of a mixed 6-pack from a convenience store on St-Laurent. It poured a clear light amber with a malty caramel aroma but then with the first sip it completely fell apart. This sucked, the whole 6 pack was horrible, the color & look were fine for each style but they must have been infected or past their prime because every single beer tasted like bile. My brother finished them as no one else wanted to touch the stuff.

Lots of fresh and tart raspberries in the nose, the same in the taste. Really quite full of raspberries, sweet and tart.

Great Basin Bitchin Berry;Sparks, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Basin Brewing Company;"as a foofoo beer, it’s actually done well, but this type of ""beer"" is just not to my liking. wine-coolerish in look and flavor...and aroma. nothing delicate about it. just sweet berry. works when it’s over 90 degrees, but even then..."" 2/09 - compared to the yummy fruit lambics i’ve had lately, this just doesn’t match up. the chicks seem to like it, but my wife doesn’t."""
Great Basin Bitchin Berry;Sparks, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Basin Brewing Company;Thanks Dara for the bottle. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a semi-dark red color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There wasn’t much lacing about this. The smell had a nice light raspberry interweaving itself in and out of some sweet malt. It seemed there were some light cherries and strawberries that were there as well. The taste was slightly sweet and added a decent tartness from the raspberries. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there and decent for the style and for me. Slight tart raspberry aftertaste with a refreshing sort of crisp finish. Overall, good fruit beer, it seemed pretty authentic in the fruits that came out at least to me.
Great Basin Bitchin Berry;Sparks, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Basin Brewing Company;12 oz bottle a friend gave me for my birthday. Pours a dark red with a good white head that sticks around. Very spritzy. Got plenty of fruitiness going on. Very light-bodied, maybe a tad watery. Good raspberry presence.

Pours a murky orangeish-purplish with an off-white bubbly head. Aroma has a hint of berries, some slight fruit muffin qualities. Flavor is pleasant with some nice fruity berry accents, a hint of yeast and just a touch of sour tart candy. Mouthfeel has a pleasant spritz to it. Not bad.
J. Bello Blonde Ale;Valdivia, Chile;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Artesanal Jaime Bello;Bottle conditioned, a cloudy gold with a filmy beige head. A very yeasty and zesty citrus hop aroma. Effervescent and light, easy hopping with some fruity flavours. Quite a refreshing beer.
J. Bello Blonde Ale;Valdivia, Chile;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Artesanal Jaime Bello;"Appearance: very pale blond color, semi-transparent. Little head, of white color and few persistent. Aroma: fruitiness of green apples, peaches and pears: sourness of lemon and grapefruits. Herby and citric hoppy. Pale malty odor. Flavor: highly malty, yeasty and fruitiness. Apricots, banana and red apples. Light sourness of lemon. Reminiscences of honey and sugar. Some rancid problem. Low hoppy finish. Palate: light body, semi-oily texture. Very low carbonation. Refreshing beer; but neutral and without own character."
J. Bello Blonde Ale;Valdivia, Chile;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Artesanal Jaime Bello;"Bottle, in Valdivia’s city. Has a yellowish, very turbid color. The head is average, very rapid. The aroma is weak, malty and something of herbs, humid grass. In the palate it is soft enough, the masses appear and enough yeast (Too much). In the flavor there is no much, the malty is detected, but ""sticky"". Flour and cereals. Has a not good finish, with something of acidity. The body is light, with a just carbonation. It is not a good beer, is regular. It is better than the commercial beers of Chile, but has nothing special."
J. Bello Blonde Ale;Valdivia, Chile;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Artesanal Jaime Bello;Bottled at Backstage, Patio Bellavista Pours a very hazy yellow color. Head is medium, white and fast diminishing. It leaves a small film. Aroma has grassy, herbal hops but it’s mainly malty and underdeveloped. It shows notes of cereal, grains, dough, white bread and a touch of apricots. Clearly the fermentation period was too short. Flavor is very malty, cereally, unrefined. I get notes of bread, dough, cereal, some soft oranges and not much more. Again, unripe. Just a step above the typical macro pale lager. Light to medium body and medium carbonation. Dull finish and aftertaste. The texture is juicy. A kinda’ refreshing beer but boring and amateur-ish.
Rother Valley Summertime Blues;Northiam, East Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rother Valley Brewing Co.;Cask conditioned at Moreton in Marsh Beer Fest ’11. Amber with white head. Initially quite a tea like hop on a mid malt Rich Tea biscuit body. Then a little lemon note for some interest. Never really gets beyond this, although a dry finish. Ok.
Rother Valley Summertime Blues;Northiam, East Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rother Valley Brewing Co.;Cask at Dean Swift. It pours golden yellow, with a decent bubbly white head. The nose is wood, toffee apple and white sugar. The taste is cardboard, wood, leather, astringency, lemon pith, brown bread and sweaty sock, with a long dry finish. Light to medium body and low carbonation. Not great.

Aroma: Very light skunky, grainy something. Taste: Water....tastes like yellow water...okey, has a slightly sweet start and a very light bitter mouthfeel but don’t get me wrong, my imagination helps me out becouse it’s extremely watery.

Omaha Jacks Rancho Mirage Brown Ale;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Brown Ale;Cucamonga Brewing Company;This was served to me in the sampler instead of the porter. The aroma was sweet chocolate malt with a slight roastiness. The appearance was brown with a light red hue. Flavor was a mildly sweet malt flavor and that was about it. It was crisp, resfreshing, and light for the stlye. I guess there was a little roastiness here too. Not alot going on, but not bad I guess.
Omaha Jacks Apricot Wheat;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Cucamonga Brewing Company;Draught. Rating #7. Hazy golden yellow color with a thick white head and decent lacing. Big apricot aroma and flavor followed by a light wheat finish. (2123)

Omaha Jacks Apricot Wheat;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Cucamonga Brewing Company;Sample at brewery. Hazy orange-yellow color.

Omaha Jacks Apricot Wheat;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Cucamonga Brewing Company;I have drank this numerous times and failed to rate. Orange and hazy. Apricot essence aroma on top of a big wheatiness. The flavor is big wheat and decent apricot. Their hefe is massively wheaty, I assume this is just that with apricot essence used during fermentation. Not bad.

Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;It has a moderately creamy foam, and lots of great yeast residues floating around in the glass. It may deter some beer drinkers, but not me. I chew me like through the sediment if it is necessary for the overall impression. Wheat malts fresh aroma of freshly harvested grain is evident in the flavor and mixes lively with a little hard roasted malt. Slightly tangy berry fruits are to find only in taste but replaced over time by the hard roasted malt, newly harvested grains, dark caramel and banana and chocolate notes. It is very rich and tasteful.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Transfer from BA review on 5-29-12- Poured from bottle into pint glass Appearance – Pours a hazy brown color with a nice thick tan head. The head fades very slowly over time to give a small level of lacing. Smell – The aroma is heaviest of brown bread. These bready aromas are mixed with some dark fruit aromas of cherry and prune. Mingling with all these aromas is a very light alcohol aroma. Very nice blend overall. Taste – The flavors start out with a more malty and bready flavor. The flavors quickly change in nature, in which they sweeten at the expense of the malty due to flavors of sweeter fruit of cherry and prune entering the taste. These fruit tastes lose their sweetness however and begin lightly sour at the end the taste. As the fruit flavors begin to lightly sour, there is also the entrance of some spicy and yeasty flavors as well which when arriving with a lightly boozy flavor leave an intriguing warming taste on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is just above average with the carbonation level just below normal. Overall both suit the beer well with its sweeter then more sour flavors. Overall – A nice, slightly tart (but not too sour) weizenbock with a nice warming feel the is very pleasant to sit back and sip. I find this one a quite nice brew.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;12oz bottle. Pours a clear light amber brown color with a thin creamy tan head. Aroma of toasted malt, banana, and clove. Tastes of banana sweetness, spiciness (pepper and clove), toasted malt, and yeast.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;12 oz. bottle from Manchester Discount Beverage in Manchester, CT. Pours a cloudy rust color, not much lacing. Smell is spicy citrus, dark fruits. Definite plum and coriander, Belgian yeast. Taste is the best part, fruity, a bit roasty, sweet fruit and caramel, mild hop presence. Mouth feel is great, a bit viscous yet effervescent and alive. A great American version of this style. Definitely a smooth drinkability and plenty of kick to go with it. Advertised as a double dunkel but has single smoothness. This brewery, in general puts out really good stuff, will plan on reviewing more of their beers as soon as I can.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Heavy clove nose, with cocoa and soil underneath. Murky brown, wispy sediments, firm medium tan head. Creamy mouthfeel. Cocoa, clove, banana flavor. A tad boozy, but the brewer does label this as a double dunkelweizen. While it certainly isn’t quaffable, it’s hardly a chore. Pretty effin neat and a meal unto itself.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;17th November 2011 Opaque cloudy red - brown beer. Tidy pale tan head. Palate is smooth with a trailing carbonated bite. Sweetish caramel malt, well balanced banana esters. Lactose and a little tangy fruits before the semi dry finish. Drinkable.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Bottle. Moderate toasted cereal for the malt, light to moderate cooked orange for the hops, moderate dough for the yeast, with hints of brown sugar and cream sherry. Head is tiny, off-white with no lacing and is fully diminishing. Color is murky, dark reddish brown. Flavor starts lightly to modeately sweet and acidic, then finishes lightl sweet and acidic. Palate is medium to full, creamy with a lively carbonation and a lightly astringent finish. Nice representation of a Dunkleweizen, sweet, full and rich.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;12 oz bottle from Baruni’s in Baden, PA. Nearly perfect in every regard. Still wish my sister lived in Easton where I could get these good ales even fresher.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;200711: Brown color with a fine beige foam. Fruity aroma. Sweet caramel flavor and notes from the wheat.
Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;(35 cl bottle from Toft Vin) Pours cloudy brown with quickly dissipating head that leves lace. Aroma is malty with banana notes and a slightly acidic hint. Flavour follows the nose with some more pronounced acidity and a whiff of cardboard in addition to the caramel maltiness. Oily texture, soft carbonation, full body and a dry finish. Definitely not my kind of style.
St-Urbain Rousse;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Originally rated July 2007. Second brew tonight of the St-Urbain series. Pours a clean bronze colour with little to no carbonation. Off-white head that is foamy and does not stay as long as their blonde. A bit of lacing sticks to the glass. The aromas are pretty much the same as the blonde, and so is the mouthfeel. Again, that not-so-good metallic taste appears in the taste. The malt is different in this one, obviously, to make this a red lager. Meant to be dranked in the bottle though. I think I prefer the blonde.
St-Urbain Blonde;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Originally rated July 2007. This beer is getting bashed for trying to look like a microbrew, but being brewed by Labatt’s. Testing both of them tonight. The label does look nice though. Pours a golden colour with active carbonation. The head is pretty impressive for a macro lager. White, foamy and creamy, with lots of retention, leaving decent lacing all around. Smell of fresh malt at first pour, but then turns into some kind of adjunct aroma. Watery mouthfeel with a certain graininess to it. The taste is somewhat metallic at first, with a little malt and a smoke undertone in the finish. Kind of weird, but not really horrible. Swill material for sure.
Sprague Farm Effin Beer;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;A- dark brown with thick foamy light tan head that fades and leaves behind a good amount of lacing.

Sprague Farm Effin Beer;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;On tap at brewery: American style wheat beer which means that it has more malt profile than yeast, some nice caramel flavor along with wheat character, not real exciting however.
Sprague Farm Effin Beer;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;Draft pours a dark brown body with a tan head. Spicy nose, cinnamon and vanilla. Wheaty bubblegum. Thin malt body with some light etoh in the finish. Simple decent.
Sprague Farm Effin Beer;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;Tap at Spuyten. Pours a deep dark murky brown with a thin lasting off white head. aroma is phenolicy with some clove and light vanilla notes, with light caramel and a dry chocolate earthy character. Flavor is pretty good- lots of dark wheats, toasted malts, yeasty phenolics and some slight fruity ester tones. Mouthfeel and finish seemed pretty smooth but the carbonation was a bit dull for a weizen- seemed a bit lackluster overall. Ok though.
Sprague Farm Effin Beer;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;Poured dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma of malt and chocolate. Flavor of a typical dunkel, but very thin.
Sprague Farm Effin Beer;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;Draught: Lightly bitter aroma. Smells of banana, bubblegum, floral hops, and berries. Poured dark dark brown/black in color with a small, creamy, tan, head that diminished slowly. Odd flavor. Tasted of hops, bubblegum, light malts, and a little chocolate. Light to medium body. Thin, dry texture. Soft carbonation. Dry finish. Overall, does not smell or look anything like it tastes. Kinda the whole kitchen sink in one beer flavorwise. Boring. Not good, not bad.
Sprague Farm Effin Beer;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;On tap at Bocktown-This was a little too watery for me. Aroma was not very strong but could pick up some wheatiness to it. Pour was a dark black with a one finger off white head. That black color suprised me- I don’t think of dunkels being this dark. Taste was very different as well. Very complex- some roastiness and light fruit and a dry and sweet aftertaste. My only problem is the thin mouthfeel that almost feels watered down. Not bad but I would like to try a bottle if they bottle it.
Sprague Farm Effin Beer;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;Aren’t dunkleweizen such a cool style? This beer is dark brown and hazy and you can’t see thru it. Just like an unfiltered wheat but dark. No head to speak of. Can’t see thru this brew. Smell is wheatish, good wheat aromas. Cannot detect much spices. Oh, this stuff is good, right from the very first taste. No bitterness can be detected. Where is the alcohol? Better be careful with this, it is way too smooth. I must warn you, dunkelweizen is one of my favorite styles! There are also complexities of roasted-ness in there as well. Again, where is the bitterness? How lovely. Friendly and easy to get along with. Impy stout and IIPA lovers may not dig the splayed back attitude of this beer. Good, welcomed medium carbonation. Does seem just a little too laid back at times, but not in a negative way, you know, more acceptable! Beautiful finish, gentle and smooth. Would not hesitate to get more of this again. Dunkleweizen is great.

Spectrum Bezants;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Spectrum;Bottle, thx to fonefan. It pours a hazy, yellowish golden body under a layer of white bubbles. It starts quite fruity on the aroma, but soon sourish, citric and slightly dusty scents escape the glass. There’s a little hoppy touch to it as well. Citrusy hops in the mouth, with some pale maltyness and a decent hoppy bitterness, but there’s also that sourish, citris flavor indication infection. Medium to thin body. The finish is malty and fruity with some bitterness. Well, it’s almost a decent beer, obviously going in the wrong direction. (080822)
Spectrum Bezants;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Spectrum;50 cL bottle. Pours almost clear and golden yellow with a fully diminished white head. Mild spiced to tobacco like aroma. Flavour is dry and spiced hoppy with a classic tobacco note. Lingering bitter and spiced hops finish. Not my style of ale.
Spectrum Bezants;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Spectrum;Cask at GBBF 08. Gold, thin white head. Empty pale malts, bit of hay, not hugely exciting, bit of rubber, bit of drying hop on finish. Decent condition, bit of peach fuzz, but overall not interesting.
Bavik-De Brabandere Fancy;Harelbeke, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;De Brabandere;"Bavik's version of a low alcohol pale lager, at De Planck in Ghent. Medium thick, snow white, moussy, slowly opening head, cristal clear golden blonde robe with strings of vivid sparkling. Aroma of soggy chicken corn, cooked green beans, plastic, chalk, plaster, rubber, grass - every bit as unattractive as you'd expect from the style. Neutral onset, very sharply carbonated, numbing, accentuating a simple and thin grainy sourishness that becomes a tad sweeter and very cereally further on; chalk- and plaster-like flavours in the finish, wet paper with a slight grassy touch, as well as a lingering mineral effect from the strong carbonation. Dull, simple, thin, grainy and plastic-ish: even within its generally not very interesting style (politely put), this seems below average."

Dahlonega English Bitter;Dahlonega, Georgia, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dahlonega Brewing Co./Carusos Italian Restaurant;on tap-pours an off white head with bubbles and hazy gold color. Aroma is lots of caramel, some sweet. Taste is caramel-medium malt, citrus lemon, some bitterness. Light side of medium body. Minimum/mild carbonation.
Dahlonega English Bitter;Dahlonega, Georgia, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dahlonega Brewing Co./Carusos Italian Restaurant;This was offered up yesterday by the waitress as a new brew at Caruso’s/Dahlonega Brewing. Poured on tap to a burntamber color with a thin off-white head that lingered well and left decent lacing. Aroma was pungent hops which was almost nauseating at first, but quickly turning more what I would expect from a bitter. Mouthfeel was slightly tingly and bitter, but not real pronounced. As for the flavor, nothing in particular stuck out, but it was reasonably enjoyable. I’m not sure of the ABV, but judging by the lack of it in either the aroma or taste, I’m guessing it to be in the 5.0-5.5% range. Finally, the finish was pleasant, but not bitter enough to earn the right to be called by that name. All and all, an enjoyable beer, just more along the lines of an English Pale Ale than a bitter.
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;Citrusy almost tart aroma... Golden in color... Flavor is caramel malts, slight bitterness... Palate is where it really is weak... Kind of leaves a cigar tobacco finish, slightly dirty bitter finish... Not the best, drinkable...
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;Orange pour with white head and lace. Light malt and light citrus hop aroma. Semi sweet malt with a decent citrus bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation. nice balance.
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;On tap at the brewpub in Atlanta. Pours a clear, golden colored body with a thin, creamy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma has some distinct maltiness with a medium sweet caramel and light crystal. A lighter, soapy, earthy hop with some grapefruit. Similar flavor. A bit bready with a moderate caramel and crystal sweetness. A good amount of earthy hops grow into the finish where this dries with a medium-high, soapy bitterness. Lengthy aftertaste following a light to medium, somewhat thin feeling body with a light carbonation. Overall, a pretty bland IPA. It has a nice bitterness level, but its just not rubbing me the right way. Not bad, just unremarkable.
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;In short: A tasty, juicy and annoyingly astringent IPA. A bit off. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear dark golden body topped by an off-white ring of foam In long: Unfocussed hoppy nose that is at time fruity, leafy, piney and citric. Body has that typical run-of-the-mill brewpub feeling. Not watery or thin, just very juicy, like a breakfast juice with bubbles. Juicy fruity caramel with a basic carbonation. Hops bring a good fruity bitterness. Long finish. Given the family/touristy that Park Tavern is I expected a bland IPA but the beer is actually quite tasty. Most of it was ok except for a strange astringency. Very astringent in fact. And that bothered me a bit. Overall, just acceptable. I visited this Atlanta brewpub in late april 2010 when I had to spend a night in this city because my connection flight to Rome was grounded. I’m not 100% certain if my flight was grounded because of the Iceland volcanic ashes or because it had very strict parents.
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;Medium orange, clear. Nice aroma, citric and pine. Initial flavor had citric, pine, a touch of cat, pineapple. I would guess Simcoe, Amarillo, and Centennial floating around here. I could also be entirely wrong. Later, as it warmed, a very clear infection note arose. Apparently something sinister is lurking in the ale tanks. Too bad, this could have really been great.
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;Started going back to park tavern this month and have been pleasantly surprised to find the beer remarkably improved! This was a good solid IPA, the right amount of maltiness and strong on hops. Not overcarbonated so it slipped down the throat beautifully. This is what I expect but find it hard to get from a brewpub. Good job guys!
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;Strong, distinct malt backbone that sneaks the hops in the back door. Surprisingly strong, even for an IPA in terms of gravity.
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;Pre-carbonated version, after filtered. Like a good cask ale. Centennial, cascade and liberty hops according to Brian. A somewhat grapefruity.Grapefruit colour with soapy head. Drinkable.
Park Tavern India Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Park Tavern Brewery;Pours a deep orange with a sizable pure snow head that lingered a bit. Nose is quite similar to the pale ale, just more of it: citrus and bubblegum, very sweet. On the palate the citrus sweetness doesn’t really pan out, becomes quickly bitter with a strange menthol and celery hoppiness. Very thin on the palate. Not particularly impressed.

A very still beer. Rye is prominent in the nose and flavor. Lightly sour. Some almost wheatlike qualities, some banana. Rye and juniper are apparent in the flavor, and step on everything else.

New Albanian Jenever;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Clean golden body with a short white head. Sweet malty nose is lightly fruity with a touch of vomit (would that be the hops or juniper?). Very ’European’ to me. Thin body, spicy and herby with this great planty sweetness coming in waves. Honey. Relaxing. A touch of malt oils up the body. Very interesting, liked this a lot!
Wild Rose Marzen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wild Rose Brewery;Smells a lot like the raspberry, tastes like it too. Golden brown, no head off of the tap. Inital fruitiness, fades down in the middle, % and yeast at the end. Pretty under the radar. Good. Not spectacular or surprising.
Wild Rose Marzen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wild Rose Brewery;A amberish orange pour with a thick finger of white head. Some good carbonation in the body. The aroma is grainy with some definate spiciness from the hops. The malts are grainy and bready in the middle with a slight german yeast presence.

Wild Rose Marzen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wild Rose Brewery;On tap at the brewer’s tap room. Orange. Light head. I’ll give the aroma the benefit of the doubt since they are brewing and the kitchen is also alive with many scents. Hop start surprises. Fairly grainy with a strong malty body. Sweet and with a touch of hops at the finish.

Sockeye Dubbel Tail;Boise, Idaho, United States;Dubbel;Sockeye Brewing;Tap at brewpub: Cloudy brown with a small ring head. Flavors of bananas and cloves are evident with a soapy aftertaste. It was actually better than my rating suggests.
Sockeye Dubbel Tail;Boise, Idaho, United States;Dubbel;Sockeye Brewing;Draft: Pours a murky brown amber with a thick off-white head. Nice lacing. Sweet and malty with a strong presence of dark fruits. The normal Belgian style spices, yeasty, and with citrus & banana accents.
Sockeye Dubbel Tail;Boise, Idaho, United States;Dubbel;Sockeye Brewing;Tap: Nearly the first pint from a fresh keg. Poured a muddy, super cloudy brownish orange color. Very light carbonation, no head or lacing. The nose is bright with sharp citrusy yeast and light hop, some fig and caramel malts are hiding underneath, but it’s still a bit brash and young. The flavor is fruity with a solid malty body and gobs of yeast esters all over the place. There’s all of your banana/clove stuff, the green apples, some spice. Oh, and some alcohol in the background. Potentially good, just a bit out of its element at the moment. I’ll have to retry this one.
Sockeye Dubbel Tail;Boise, Idaho, United States;Dubbel;Sockeye Brewing;On Tap at the brewpub. Hazy orange amber with a modest sized but dense creamy light tan head. Lacing is coarse and spotty. Malty belgian yeasty sweet aroma. Damp potting soil and over ripe bananas. Flavor was at first classic sweet malty Belgian but quickly reveals an odd metallic chalky slant. woody and a bit of beauty bark. Full smooth palate and a fairly soft carbonation. Some of that banana and clove spice on the trailor but subdued and mild. Odd and somewhat forgettable.

Cotswold Wheat Beer;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cotswold Brewing Co.;Bottle. Cloudy orange appearance and pored flat with vitually no head.

Cotswold Wheat Beer;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cotswold Brewing Co.;Cask. Okay bright golden-yellow pour. Banana, clove, orange, citrus. Has all the right characteristics, but it’s undermined by a cloying sweetness that made this one a bit of a chore near the end.

Cotswold Wheat Beer;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cotswold Brewing Co.;Good effervescences, aroma clove like phenolics of a wheat beer, appearance a little too light for a German style, taste as aroma lacking the banana notes I like in a weisse, which is funny as all other beers I have tried from this brewery have a banana note to them.
Cotswold Wheat Beer;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cotswold Brewing Co.;Keg at the Earl of Essex, London. Pours a lightly hazy yellow with a faint, white foam head. Doughy wheat nose with faint lemon tang. Light to medium sweet flavor with more doughy malts, some straw, mild wheat, faint white sugar. Light bodied with fine to average carbonation. Moderately sweet finish, still more dough, faint yeasty wheat, some cereal. Very basic, easy stuff. It does the trick on a warm afternoon when cycling around London.
Cotswold Wheat Beer;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cotswold Brewing Co.;500ml Bottle. Lively really didnt cover this one. It took 15 inutes to pour it into the glass. If I hadn’t been such a fan of Cotswold’s other beers I’d given up and gone and made a cup of tea. The bottle I got were all close to their expirey date and that may have explained their vitality but it was VARY VARY fizzy. Once things had settles down and some liquid had formed the wheat beer proves to be a very pale slightly cloudy yellow. The nose was summery with wheat, hops, yeast and a slight hint of citrus. These also came out in the taste with some sspices. I beautiful drink for the summer - IF you can get past the over lively start.
Mura Mura Mountain Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Nigori;SakeOne Corporation;"Bottle from Total Wine. Chilled; shaken. Milky white pour. Aromas of fruit and alcohol. Seems to be coconut and melon. Very smooth mouthfeel. There’s heat. It’s creamy. Very mild fruits and arguably floral esters. Suggests tropical fruit juices. Finish is smooth and warm. One of the more palatable sakes I’ve had. Perhaps this one is for beginners."
Mura Mura Mountain Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Nigori;SakeOne Corporation;Served chilled. Extremely cloudy, milky white body with faint yellowish and cream colored hues. There is alot of unfiltered rice particulate, even for a Nigori. The sediment becomes very thick at the bottom of the glass if it sits for just a moment, and it is agitated with each sip. The aroma is typical sweet Nigori, with lemony, floral notes and a faint cream background. There is also quite a bit of alcohol present in the nose. The flavor follows suit exactly, though the creaminess seems more concentrated at the end of the glass where the sediment has gathered. Likewise, the mouthfeel goes from moderate to overly chunky and thick, which is not at all appealing. Overall, this is not a very well crafted rendition of the style.
Mura Mura Mountain Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Nigori;SakeOne Corporation;The aroma is strong with alcohol, rice, paint, and coconut. The appearance is white and cloudy.

Surprisingly clean and hopped, could be nominated for pilsner.
Scuttlebutt Anthonys Pale Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Pours a clear golden orange on tap with fluffy white head that dissipates to leave moderate lace.

Scuttlebutt Anthonys Pale Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Tapered Pils glass draft at Anthony’s in Spokane, Washington. The pour is clear orange golden with a one inch well formed off white head. The aroma is faint floral hops and muted cracker malt. The taste is the nose, clean enough, just very subdued malt and hop flavors. The palate is light to medium bodied, active carbonation and a dry floral finish. Decent.
Scuttlebutt Anthonys Pale Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Draft at Anthony’s at SEA. Pours a foggy copper color with a frothy white head. Not much on the aroma front. Slight hops. But outside of that, nothing. Strong, bitter taste. Maybe it’s bad hops? Dry finish but it does not really offer much else.
Scuttlebutt Anthonys Pale Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;22oz at Sea-Tac Airport. Warm, hazed gold amber. Small foam.

A quite clear one, golden-orange, and topped by an off-white head leaving lacings. Hop-driven aroma with pale malts in the back. Some caramel, borderline toffee, notes. Pine cones and citrus peel. The flavor is pretty much the same, with the added joy of bitterness. Some malty sweetness. Medium to full body, pleasant carbonation level. Bitter and fruity finish, peaches, pine cones and some grassy notes. Well, except that it’s a tad on the malty side, it’s a fine brew. 130702

Scuttlebutt Anthonys Pale Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Tap at Anthony’s at Sea Tac. Copper/Amber pour, foamy off-white head that is lacing well. Not much nose but I can detect some faint floral hoppiness. Sweet and malty up front, followed by a well rounded blast of bitterness. The lingering flavor is a combination of sweetness on the tip of the tongue and sharp bitterness in the back of the mouth. Considering how strong the sweetness and bitterness are, this is surprisingly well balanced. Pale ale isn’t my most sought after style, but I can appreciate a good one and am pleased by the glass in front of me.

Chapeau Oude Kriek;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;On tap at the brewery. It’s a flat, almost clear beer, deep ruby in color. The aroma has a lot of cherry, some citrus juice and a faint touch of almond, but I’d like it more pronounced. It’s quite dry and astringent on the palate, with flavors of lemon, cherries and some almond. Lasting finish. A quite nice one, although certainly in the commercial end of the spectrum. 110501

Rock Bottom Bethesda Jens IPA;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Bethesda;Draft and cask at the brewery in Bethesda. Tapped May 24, 2007. Cask was so much better, soft and fluffy yeast, fruity centennial and amarillo-like hop flavors, grassy and sweet. Some honey hop cone flavors, though I’m making this sounds like a hop bomb it’s not, it’s only midly hopped, mildly bitter, even light at times, so don’t get me wrong. There’s just not too much going on other than the hops, which are simply used and quite tasty. Finishes a bit wet and oily, but overall it’s not a bad IPA.

Sunshine Coast English Bitter Ale;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sunshine Coast Brewery;"Poured a dark copper colour with a thin light tan bubble head with poor lacing. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of slightly sourish malt. Taste of malt followed by slight hops then roasted grain. More roasted grain than I’d expect but it is not overly done - just the right amount.

Sunshine Coast English Bitter Ale;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sunshine Coast Brewery;330ml bottle. Very appealing to look at, copper in colour with a nicely rounded tan head and strong aroma of caramel and toffee. Robust body with a noce taste and well balanced bitterness level and good mouthfeel. Nice surprise from this relatively unknown brewery.
Sunshine Coast English Bitter Ale;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Draught at Platform Bar, Brisbane. Pours amber with medium white head. Light passionfruit and lychee on the nose. The flavour is biscuity malt, caramel, passionfruit and lychee. Good carbonation and moderate bitterness that shows through to the finish. It’s lacking the drinkablilty factor here.

Free State Big Sea ESB;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Free State Brewing Company;2007 vintage, draft at the brewery. Toasty, fruity and lightly roasty aroma, hints of cherry and grape Kool-Aid(!) as well as suggestions of tea, spice and floral sweetness. Medium-dark copper color with a slight, white head. Flavor profile is malty, toasty and bitter, with biscuity, bready, very faintly sweet malts and prominent spicy hop character and bitterness. Slight citrus on the finish, also drying considerably by the end. Some lingering red apple skin and earthiness. Thin on the palate and gently prickly, body is medium. A bit challenging, I have to say. Apparently this is the batch that won a 2007 GABF Bronze.
Free State Big Sea ESB;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Free State Brewing Company;Pint at the pub as they say. And guess what? Free state is good, nay great yet again. A nice light reddish colored beer under a simple head. The aroma was bready malts while the flavor had a slittly bitter finish. A great example of what an ESB should be like.
Free State Big Sea ESB;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Free State Brewing Company;Pint at the brewpub with csbosox and holdenn. Pour was deep red with some fiery yellow and orange hues. Not served with head. Both the aroma and flavor are what I’d be looking for if I were sitting in a pub in the UK. really big biscuity and bready malt character with fairly restrained hops until you get the a strong bitter finish. Medium body with pretty average carbonation and a dry finish. Free State has really been on a roll for me lately.
Free State Big Sea ESB;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Free State Brewing Company;Pint pour @ brewpub. A clear amber beer with a sticky head. Aroma is astringent, spiky, light but icky sweet malts. Taste is similar with light cherry as well. Eh. I had this again tonight, no astringency but just like a bland and blah ESB, there really isn’t another way to describe it.
Sunshine Coast Glasshouse Rauch;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Sunshine Coast Brewery;It’s a smoky brew which tastes like it’s been done on the BBQ with your ribs or snags. Fans like me of Laphroaig will appreciate this intense flavour with mellow after-taste but will some will find it too strong. Leave your skirt at the door and give it a go. I love it.
Sunshine Coast Glasshouse Rauch;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Smokehouse, bushfire and bacon on the nose. Great smoky flavour, offset by caramel and toffee sweetness. Slightly bitter finish. Mild diacetyl off flavour. Good effort at a smoke beer.
Sunshine Coast Glasshouse Rauch;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Sunshine Coast Brewery;This has been unretired. Same ABV. Nose is a little smoked salmon and caramel. In the mouth it’s quite light with a medium smokey finish. Decent but not a patch on the real thing.
Sunshine Coast Glasshouse Rauch;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Sunshine Coast Brewery;I’m beging to enjoy smoked beers more and more .. I found this one to be quite delightful. Rich with strong smoke and caramel flavours backed up by a nice big body. Have tasted it twice now and enjoyed it very much on both occasions. Hopefully it will be available in bottles soon
Sunshine Coast Glasshouse Rauch;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Sunshine Coast Brewery;On tap @ the Grand Central: I’d managed to sample this one while it was still in the fermenter on a tour of the brewery. A month or so on and this is a pretty dam tasty beer. Pours a deep, clear copper with a smallish head. Aroma - smokey ham with malt. Flavour is rich and smokey, slightly meaty with caramel malt notes. That probably doesn’t sound all that enticing but it is. Almost chewy mouthfeel with an faint honey like taste in the finish (with some alcohol evident). My pick of the range so far (still waiting for the Rye ESB). Hope fully this will be a regular.
Sunshine Coast Summer Ale;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Sensational flavor, light on the tummy. Midi, great for drinking during work.

Newport Storm Cyclone Series Frank;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Traded bottle. Slightly hazy amber-gold colour with a thin white head and nice lacing. Aroma has some pineapple and bubble gum to it. Flavour is a little sweet but some spice in the finish. Not as light and refreshing as I was hoping.
Newport Storm Cyclone Series Frank;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;From cletus via trade. The pour was a turbid brown and gold with a foamy white head that produced flecks of lacing. The aroma was malt, yeast and citrus. The flavor was very malty with plenty of yeast and citrus as well. Fuller mouthfeel than most wits. Had more personality than most beers of this style.
Newport Storm Cyclone Series Frank;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Bottle as a bonus from cletus. Pours an almost murky light brown color with a bit of a white head that fades off rather quickly. Citrus and lemon and mint on the nose. Medium bodied and a big minty/bubblegum flavor. Finishes with a slightly medicinal peppermint quality. Interesting take on a wheat beer.
Newport Storm Cyclone Series Frank;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;12 ounce bottle courtesy of beerbill. Pours a very hazy peach color with a thin head. Not too impressive for a witbier. Weak aroma of banana, clove and grain. Taste is caramel, pineapple, wheat. Medium bodied. A little disappointing.
Newport Storm Cyclone Series Frank;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Poured a hazy whitish yellow color with a big white head.

Newport Storm Cyclone Series Frank;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Appearance: Pours a clear, honey-hued body with a very sparse ring of white bubbles on top. Smell: Aroma of toasted spices, including clove and ginger with a backdrop of banana and lime fruitiness. Taste: Toasty, tangy wheat maltiness ushers in tastes of bananas, cloves, ginger and lime. Light, spicy bitterness. Remains toasty for the sweet finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation. A bit of a chewy, tongue-coating mouthfeel. Drinkability: I find the mouthfeel a bit heavy for me and find the lack of refreshing character to be a slight turn off.

Very nice fruity, lime and corriander aroma. Very floral nose. Fruit flavored biscuit. Lots of bread along with a nice citrus tart flavor. Dry finish.
Newport Storm Cyclone Series Frank;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;05-Aug-08 (12-oz bottle: Obtained 01-Aug-08 in trade with jjpm74, thanks John!) This may be the strangest wit I’ve come across. While the aromas of coriander and orange peel are apparent, what really jumps out is orange marmalade and coconut. Wow, the sweet coconut is almost overwhelming. But despite taking a sharp left turn from the style, the nose is exotic and interesting. A similar situation with the flavor. Lots of sugary-sweet coconut, grossly overripe bananas and sherry are partially offset by the mild bitterness and flavor of coriander and citrus peel. The problem with the heavy tropical character is that the beer is very weighty on the palate, nothing like what a real Belgian witbier should be. It’s heavy and cloying, lacking the refreshing character one expects from the style. It’s nearly 7% too, so that’s another clue. And the color is cloudy amber. Heading is small on the pour and fully dissipates, leaving no lace. An odd beer, it clearly isn’t meant to be a Hoegaarden clone. Forgetting the classic style though and treating it as its own entity, this beer still fails the drinkability test because of the syrupy, cloying body and the total lack of balance. Exotic and tropical, maybe the tropical fruit aromas and flavors are by design since this is series named after tropical storms. Too bad this hurricane came ashore.
Newport Storm Cyclone Series Frank;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Interesting nose on this one: one part damp coriander, one part potpourri, one part orange, and one part minty key lime pie. Flavor is centered more towards a typical witbier, with abundant coriander, a lot of orange and lemon peel, some wheat, and a strange bit of black pepper mixed in as well. Generally heavy on the yeast, normal for the style, and quite tasty but not really great.
Homer Belgian Abbey Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Homer Brewing Co.;Draft: Poured a hazy orange amber with a white head. Aroma is malty and yeasty. Taste was strong belgian yeast, fruits and sweet malts
Homer Belgian Abbey Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Homer Brewing Co.;Growler. Slightly hazy deep amber with a small head. Aroma of dried fruit, caramel, cloves and light musty basement. Flavor is lightly sweet caramel malt, zesty spice and some fruity yeast esters. Medium body with average carbonation. Pretty good beer, nice yeast and spice character.
Homer Belgian Abbey Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Homer Brewing Co.;19-Jan-08 (Draft: Connoisseur’s Session, 2008 Great Alaskan Beer and Barley Wine Festival in Anchorage, AK) Aromas of dark fruits, light roast and spicy yeast, but also something reminiscent of root beer. On the palate, core flavors of Belgian sugar and spicy, fruity yeast are joined by wheaty malts, brown sugar, dark molasses, dates and dark fruits, with a light hop character and soft bitterness. Medium-full bodied and medium in carbonation, but the spice helps keep the palate from weighing down. Opaque and dark brown in color, and initially capped by a small, tan head that settles to a wide ring.

Twin Rivers Pale Ale;Monroe, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Twin Rivers Brewing/Adam's Northwest Bistro;Draft at the restaurant. Pours slightly hazy golden amber with a slim rim of white mousse and a little dab of lace up the side. Rich sweet floral and grass nose. Good medium body and carb on a nicely assertive attack. Rich hay and caramel mid-palate with a lightly lingering and completely refreshing grapefruit finish. They should call this Pentitentiary Pale (there’s a supermax in town) and market it. It could really appeal to the mainstream.
Twin Rivers Amber Ale;Monroe, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twin Rivers Brewing/Adam's Northwest Bistro;Draft at the restaurant. Crystal clear garnet amber pour under a clumpy thin white filmy mousse. Pretty vacant nose. Watery, light carb. Very subdued flavors on the mid-palate: a little bit of chewy malt sugar and kind of a sticky but neutral finish. Looks great but needs a nose and some flavor.
Twin Rivers Nut Brown;Monroe, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Twin Rivers Brewing/Adam's Northwest Bistro;This is a pretty good brown ale. Nothing particularly stands out, but there's a nice malt backbone and mild hops. Just a very smooth drinking and enjoyable ale.
Twin Rivers Nut Brown;Monroe, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Twin Rivers Brewing/Adam's Northwest Bistro;Draft at the restaurant. Pours deep dark murky brown with a slim rim of white. Thickish brown-sugary nose with a little bit of dust. Tingly and medium-bodied attack. Nicely sweetened mid-palate: molasses, with some of that brown sugar again and some caramel. Thin little tingly herbal hop finish. Pretty damn drinkable for a brown.

Cobra Bite with Lemongrass;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Flavored - Other;Cobra Beer (Molson Coors);Bottle. Thanks to Enjoyit. Pours a pale yellow with a small white head. Sweetish cereal aroma with notes of lemon grass and citrus. Not as powerful as the other Cobra Bite versions. Pretty bland, really. Flavour is sweet candy citrus. Cloying. Finish has some faint lingering biscuit notes. Soft palate. This is the Cobra Bite which mostly resembles actual beer, but that says more about the others than about this one. 03-07-08.
Tryst Hillcrest Ale;Larbert, Central, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tryst Brewery;3 Judges. This could indeed be a one off brew are he made it from someone elses recipe. Appley, sweet, nutty, chestnuts, swetish fruits, floural and a fruity finish. Dont think it was in that good condition or that great a beer, neds more hops to balance.

Sankt Gallen Amber Ale;Atsugi-shi, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sankt Gallen Brewery;15th Aug 2016: shared 33cl bottle with my mate who’s wife brought this back from Japan after a cycling tour. Name gives away the colour, the head a beige affair. Caramel maltiness ruled both the aroma and taste, my sweet tooth liking it immediately: some hop action calmed the sweetness down nicely.

Westons Perry;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Westons Cider;Bottle, that is entirely different to the one in the pic on here. Asda. As Weston’s Slowly Aged Perry. Ticked off all the styles now, barring sake, prior to packing up on this now ropey website. Smells and tastes pretty much like any other Weston’s product. Sweet and fruity, with a hint of alcoholism, albeit reigned in compared to something like Vintage Cider. Drinks like pop and gets you fucked. Never been a real perry.
Westons Perry;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Westons Cider;Aroma of fresh apples and berries. Light sour, medium bitter, medium sweet taste, with a bitter finish. Good, even if it smells more like a cider than like a perry.
Westons Perry;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Westons Cider;Aus der Flasche im 2018-06 getrunken. Dieses Perry kommt zwischen Fruchtsäuere und -süße leicht säuerlich balanciert herüber. Daher ist es recht süffig. Die anfängliche Farmhausnote ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig. Somit bleibt ein feines und durstlöschendes Perry im Glas. Prost!

Guinness Mid-Strength;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);If you've got to drive, or you are on a session and need to drive the next day, then this is a pretty good tasting stout for the ABV. It's one of the few low ABV beers <3.5% that doesn't taste like it's low ABV, if someone was pouring this for me (blind) all night, I wouldn't think it's anything out of the ordinary.
Guinness Mid-Strength;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Weich malziger, süßlich röstiger Beginn. Cremig, wässrig herb, sehr süffig, langer Nachhall. Gute Alternative zum normalen Guinness. 12/9/8/9//9
Guinness Mid-Strength;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Keg pint at Beaumont House, Dublin. Black colour, the standard Guinness nitro head. Aroma and flavour nearly indiscernible from the regular Guinness. Much better than I feared.
Guinness Mid-Strength;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Can at home. Pours almost black and has that nice foam even from can. Nose is chocolate malts, roast, light sweetness. Tastes dryish roast, chocolate, very malty, watery, bland. Velvety mouthfeel. Decent low abv beer anyway.
Guinness Mid-Strength;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Can. Pours dark brown with a light red hue and a medium tan foam residing. Scent is medium notes of almond nuts. Taste is very light ale with pretty much no flavor and only minor bitterness with pretty much no value. Poor.
Guinness Mid-Strength;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);This weaker draught version looks and pours like regular strength Guinness only it?s thinner bodied and watery. It still has the characteristics but they?re all subdued. Flatter. Creamy nitro head. Aroma of burnt woods and roasted notes. Chestnut, wood and roasted malt on a thin watery body. Not good. If you can?t handle regular Guinness then I?m not sure what you?d get out of drinking this version. Who is the target consumer?
Guinness Mid-Strength;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Milder, weaker more watery version of Guinness. It looks the same and the flavour is kept, although with a little less intensity. A good effort, but Guinness is not strong anyway so a mid-strength version is not the most desirable concept
Fischer Bräu Frühlingspils;Wien, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fischer Bräu;Draught at the brewpub. Light flowerly, hoppy and a bit malty aroma. Golden color. Nice flowerly flavor, spicy, light sweet. Dry hoppy and light bitter finish.
Feral Rust;Baskerville, Australia;Dubbel;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Tap at Feral. Pours a deep copper/reddish with an off white head.

Feral Rust;Baskerville, Australia;Dubbel;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Tap at Feral. Pours a lovely cloudy amber with a small beige head. Leaves some nice lacing. Aroma shows notes of banana, cloves, pine and citrus with a slight backing of sour yeast. Rich toffee and citrus surround the mouth with typical belgian yeast. Notes of dried fruits - apricot pear come through as well. Fantastic beer
Feral Rust;Baskerville, Australia;Dubbel;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Fantastic candied banana nose. Really full on without being too much. In the mouth it loses it’s charm. A muddled medium bodied dubbel. A bit of candy sugar, caramel and not a lot of anything special.
Feral Rust;Baskerville, Australia;Dubbel;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Tap. Great beer. Nice mix of aromas, with roasted caramel, and bubblegum. Taste is sweet, with average duration. Palate is velvety, with a medium body. Dark yellow, with a frothy white head.
Feral Rust;Baskerville, Australia;Dubbel;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);"Alright, finer points aside this has already morphed from bluevegie’s rating. Is this the base for the long awaited Wine-beer. On draught at the brewhouse, the staff no help calling it a Belgian Tripel and also managing to serve us the most blonde ’Mild’ I have ever seen - it was their Pale ale!!! Anyways:- This produced an orange copper and bright in the pure sunlight. A creamy tan head bobbed atop and held, the body a tad gassy to look at for style?. Alcohol, higher alcohol fuelled caramel lathered soft mudcake nose - burnt underneath. Alcohol tickles like a strong liqueur port. Smoky, sweet burst onto the palate. Suggestively tannic, astringent burnt malt in back; deep, drawn, dark sugars upfront giving this no chance at harmony. Fizzy, served chilled?, but reasonably full as far as viscosity. Alcohol dries it right out in the swallow, and with the tannic malts doesn’t leave behind much in the way of desirables. A sharp, quite pronounced linger of smoke, dust and treacle develops on the palate and builds in the olfactories. I can’t lie, not the brewers best. But, I hope he still keeps pushing the barriers. (8.0%)"
Feral Rust;Baskerville, Australia;Dubbel;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Sampled on tap at the Western Australian Beer Week Launch. While this was reasonable, it was clearely understtenuated and thus a little overtly sweet. Tastes like a belgian that need 6 moonhts in the bottle to ripen up. Hope they bottle it.
Feral Rust;Baskerville, Australia;Dubbel;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Muddy looking, orangey brown body with a short light tan head. Some caramel, burnt honey, and a perception of soft spices, pepper with a little medicinal note right on the finish, leaves a lining in your mouth and you don’t notice the alcohol even after the second one. Served a bit cold to be fully appreciated
Three Needs Blackwatch;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Woody nose, dark brown. Dark toasted grain, tobacco and charcoal notes. Bitter burnt wood end with hops too. Intense flavor. Stands on its own--as a beer or a meal! Points for originality and for pushing the limit.
Three Needs Blackwatch;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Draught pint at the brewpub, mid-May 2007. What is it with these dark IPAs? The next new thing in beer is making with the funny colors? Anyway, this poured totally black (duh), translucent with a smallish head and a bit of lacing....dry, herbal aroma, faint hoppiness, woody....body is very, very dry and harsh at first, the malts only show up when it’s warmed for 10 minutes or so, and a light fruity/citric sweetness enters the picture....remains dusty overall and somewhat hard to drink, but by the end of the pint I’m not unhappy about it.
Defiant Highland Porter;Pearl River, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Defiant Brewing Company;Aroma is a bit hard to describe, maybe alcoholic, with a bit of plum. but the coloring is your typical dark brown with almost no lacing or head. There was none of the chocolate or espresso flavors I’ve come to expect from the style, and the mouthfeel was a bit watery, yet this was still a flavorful dark brew I’d try again.
Defiant Highland Porter;Pearl River, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Defiant Brewing Company;Hand bottle for lou18. Small head, dark brown pour. Abit on the bitter side, burnt chocolate, smoke, finished abit bitter sweet. I enjoyed it, interesting flavor.
Defiant Highland Porter;Pearl River, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Defiant Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Dark brown, with small off white head. Nose was lots of peat, smoke, caramel. There is smoke in the taste, not as much as the nose. This was nice as is all Defiant brews.
Defiant Highland Porter;Pearl River, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Defiant Brewing Company;"on tap at defiant. Brown, almost black in color with a small tan head. Aroma is smoke, chocolate, light vanilla, and that ""defiant"" character which I really can’t put a finger on. Taste is moderately smoky, some astringent black patent or light roast, with some chocolate, and light vanilla in the taste. Finishes astringent and lightly bitter."
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;"Draft. Pours a copper toned body with a white head. Has a really odd spiced profile; tyme, wheat, fennel seed, flax seed, and some light herbal and grain warming. Soft light, the spices become a bit over done quickly, but a decent offering, i can see someone really liking this one."
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;Tap at The Long Room, NYC. Pours a dark, almost hazy yellow. Medium, fluffy white head. Aroma of sweet malts, corn, grass. Flavor is earthy, with strong grassy notes and a taste I would describe as raw pumpkin. Not the sweet kind found in pumpkin ales, mind you, but raw pumpkin. And it wasn’t necessesarily bad, either. Very crisp and clean.
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;Poured from growler filled at Defiant brewery. Aroma - smells just like the brewery - sweet bread and hop. Clear golden, thin white head. Malt is noticed at first, with the hops lingering in the aftertaste. Clean and crisp feel. An enjoyable pils, would be excellent if it had a little more more hop bite to it.
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;"Tap at Barcade. Corny, cheesy, trashy, very unappealing aroma. Crisp, cheesy, basic ""beer"" flavor, like a bad corporate lager. A disappointment, and not at all a pilsener to me."
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;Tap at Barcade. The beer is very pale and straw-coloured. The nose is great. Really fresh and bright with a lot of bright fresh hoppiness. Quite zesty with a nice fresh floral character. Lots of bright lemony/citrusy character and a lot of soft spice. The malts are quite lean with a bready/crackery character. There is a lot of freshness and it is a really lovely pils.
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;Tap at Barcade: Hazy light golden with a white ring of head. Dry crackery pils aroma- dry and spicy with a light herbal saaz presence. Nice! Fluffy/spicy palate. Clean and very dry flavor with a crackery pils base. Has a nice minerally dryness. Lots of spicy noble hops (saaz/tetnang?) Nice!
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;Growler filled at Shoreline Beverage and consumed later on the same day. Pours a clear gold with a moderate white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace. Pleasant aroma that is a combination of yeast, grain and black pepper. The flavor is similar with yeast, grain and black pepper plus just a bit of cracker. Dries out just a bit towards the finish with mild-moderate bitterness. This is a nice, solid, pilsner.
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;Growler fill from Bierkraft - very hazy gold, with a thick, soapy film around the glass - somewhat lemony aroma, with slight herbal character, light wheat, bread - creamy on the palate - the flavor fails to make an impression at first, leaving nothing of much substance lingering after the first few sips - however, you start to realize that that is partly the point here - this is supposed to be a smooth, easy drinking beer - and as you get into it, you notice some bread yeast notes, dry, crackery, wheaty qualities, and crisp, dry, lightly peppery bitterness, especially on the back end - but none of these characteristics jump out at you - they never get in the way of the smooth, refreshing nature of the beer - quite a pleasure to drink, really - I’ve had my issues with Defiant, but I’m glad I tried this beer.
Defiant Prohibition Pilsner;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Cloudy body with small white head. Nose was yeasty. Light mouth feel here, refreshing brew.

Aroma is pretty nice, wheaty, bready yeast, with some grain and pils malt. Taste is light bodied, with wheat, yeast, bready malts, with a moderately bitter finish. Found this to be an interesting beer.
Jacob Bodenwöhrer Jacobator Weissbier-Bock;Bodenwöhr, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Familienbrauerei Jacob;Picked this up from Bayerisches Bierspezialitäten Pararadies Bienenfleiß, consumed at home Attenkirchen, Sunday 17th November 2019 whilst listening to Warmduscher - Tainted Lunch, cooking Goulash, Bread Dumplings, Potato Gratin and Brussels. Pours hazy puddle brown with an off white head. Toffeebanana combo', made me realise just how much I like this style of beer, nice little tang, soft mouthfeel, a little tiny retronasal thing going on. Lovely.
Jacob Bodenwöhrer Jacobator Weissbier-Bock;Bodenwöhr, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Familienbrauerei Jacob;Dunkler Weizenbock mit 7,5 % Alkohol, 17,8 % Stammwürze (ein Doppelbock braucht eigentlich mind. 18 % Stammwürze - frag mich warum der Hersteller trotzdem die Bezeichnung Doppelbock wählt). Beeindruckende Optik. Absolut extreme Trübung, viel Hefe - sieht fast wie Milchkaffee aus. Der intensive Geruch erinnert an Likör (süß und alkoholig). Geschmack: sehr süß, ohne besonders malzig zu sein (erst hintenraus klingt das Malz nach). Hefig. Nicht sehr viel Frucht. Schön weich. Schwere, fast cremige Konsistenz - selten etwas ähnliches erlebt. Den hohen Alkoholgehalt schmeckt man. Stört aber nicht. Geschmacklich trifft es nicht zu 100 % meine Präferenzen, aber allein aufgrund der Optik und der Konsistenz einer meiner Top-5 Weizendoppelböcke (auch wenn dazu 0,2 % Stammwürze fehlen).
Jacob Bodenwöhrer Jacobator Weissbier-Bock;Bodenwöhr, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Familienbrauerei Jacob;Haselnußbraun, sehr trüb mit stabiler beige Krone. Intensiver Geruch nach überreifen Bananen und süßem Malz. Auch der Alkoholgehalt ist im Geruch schon zu erahnen. Weicher Antrunk mit wohldosierter, feinperliger Kohlensäure, die ein cremiges Mundgefühl erzeugt. Viel Banane und eine sirupartige Süße, die in Verbindung mit dem deutlich spürbaren Alkohol kurz an Hustensaft erinnert. Voluminöser Körper ohne zu sättigend zu wirken.

Not much development 1/2 in to this 50cl bastard, getting sweeter upon each sip with hop balance probably faded by now. - I'll give it to these Weizenböcke that they seem to harbour a secret that seems to grow on you with age...

Hazy golden/light amber in appearance. Nose is floral, but also light notes of dish soap. Taste doesn’t get much better with that dish soap character making it’s appearance again. This is definitely not what Neil intended for this beer. maybe my palate was shot, who knows.

Brewers Pure Malt Ale;Cobden St, Kew, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Brewers' Fine Ale Pty Ltd;When I popped the top on this baby, I thought someone had just pulled a pudding out of the oven. There’s a lot of honey and some toffee on the nose. The aroma’s a little overwhelming, but the taste is much fresher than expected, with a savoury, sour finish.

Brewers Pure Malt Ale;Cobden St, Kew, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Brewers' Fine Ale Pty Ltd;"A solid session ale if you can ignore the pretentious name and the usual marketing twaddle on the label. (THE ""Original Pure Malt Ale""? Really?) Pours a hazy bronze with a nice pillowy head. Has the sort of doughy aroma you’d expect from a pure malt ale, especially the original one. Also some faint peachy notes and a less welcome metallic ring. Quite a full, creamy body for this style but it works for me, despite being more filling than refreshing. Fairly sweet in flavour, with minimal bitterness and a slightly sour, quenching finish. Toffeeish crystal malt notes in the mid-palate. (330ml bottle)"

Ithaca Excelsior! Old Habit;Ithaca, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ithaca Beer Co.;"From Aug 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with nutbrown. Thanks Alan! It pours a murky dark brown with a tiny amount of foam...by the time I set the glass down, there was only a ring around the glass and a tiny bit of lacing. The smell has notes of fruit, chocolate, and oak. Very nice nose. The taste is well, very tasty. I'm getting some fruity tones with cherries being number 1, some good chocolate, vanilla, and a very nice rye *and* nice oaky/bourbon overtone that seem to blend very well with the other flavours. Nice! Nice medium mouthfeel here and the carbonation is lightly done. Also, the alcohol is very nicely hidden and doesn't hurt the drinkability much for me at all. The more I sip, the more I notice how complex this brew is...I guess that's because it's warming up since I opened it after I took it straight out of the fridge. ;^) Man, what a great sipping brew this is...and yet another very impressive offering from the gang at Ithaca. If this is available locally to you, *Please* don't let the price tag scare you away($16.95 for the 750ml)...imnsho, it is worth every penny and was a super inclusion in this trade. Thanks again muchly, Alan!!"
Ithaca Excelsior! Old Habit;Ithaca, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ithaca Beer Co.;Bottle with Pat and James in ’10. Pours a brown shade with a nice beige head.

Ithaca Excelsior! Old Habit;Ithaca, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ithaca Beer Co.;Batch E!017 From notes. Tasted some time near the summer of 2012 from a capped 750mL bottle shared with the Nashville crew. Pours clear but very dark amber with a thick tan head that slowly recedes to thick lace. The nose is caramel and toffee with raisins, vanilla, and cinnamon oak. The flavor is a touch sweet with the vanilla, caramel, and raisin up front, moving to spicy rye and lightly bitter cinnamon. The body is full with very lively carbonation and a long caramel, toffee, and lightly bitter finish.
Ithaca Excelsior! Old Habit;Ithaca, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ithaca Beer Co.;Bottle, batch E!017. Mahogany with beige head. Huge gusher which we eventually got under control. Nice semi-sweet maltiness, chewy, prune, raisin, rye, oak, quite dry and becomes more bitter on the finish, carbonation actually dies down and becomes quite nice with a moderate body. Balanced and enjoyable.
Ithaca Excelsior! Old Habit;Ithaca, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ithaca Beer Co.;22 oz. bottle. Batch E 045. With ABV of 9 %. Purchased at One Stop Market. Dark brown/ Black color, thin fast vanishing head. Nose is large oak with hints of whiskey, light dark fruit. Flavor is mostly the same. Medium body with a soft carbonation. Starts with light rye with earthy malt and hints of tannins oak. Lightly vinous with red grapes. Is this infected? Lightly sour oak that lingers for awhile. I get mostly oak, dark fruit and red grape notes. Where is the whiskey? Because I only get oak. Not bad, still drinkable but not nearly what I had hoped for.
Ithaca Excelsior! Old Habit;Ithaca, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ithaca Beer Co.;This beer poured a murky dark brown with a thin loose head of foam that fell before I even picked up the glass. Nose is lovely. Mellow and spicy rye. Deep but not too bold. A light airy wood and a modest sweet whiskey. Dry dark fruit like raisins, nuts and a touch of expansive malt sweetness like toffee and caramel. A fragrant bit of vanilla and I can’t wait to taste this. Taste is lovely. Spicy rye that has become modest with a bit of age and from the oak barrel. Deep and tall rye flavor that is not unbounded like most rye ales but rather proper and containing all it’s loveliness so that you can have it but so that it does not overrun the other flavors. A touch of smooth vanilla and airy wood. A surprise in some brilliant tart cherry. The cherry really enlivens the palate and lets you taste all the malt sweetness by contrast. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light with some tiny prickly bubbles in the finish. A small warming form the alcohol Smooth and very mellow. This one awesome beer.
Ithaca Excelsior! Old Habit;Ithaca, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ithaca Beer Co.;A- As others have stated, this one is a gusher. I opened it in the sink and it quickly gushed out as i poured it into my glass. Very cloudy, murky brown color with a huge, tan head. S- Dark fruit, toffee, raisin and a lingering funky sweetness that worries me. T- Bold whiskey notes, dark fruit, raisin, brown sugar and a tart cherry finish. The cherry is very possibly an infection and it just throws the balance out of whack. Either my bottle wasn’t at the stage of the last two reviews or the infection hasnt nearly taken hold as much but it is still there, lingering. M- Thick with lots and lots of carbonation. D- This is not entirely undrinkable in it’s current state however it looks like sour cherry notes are pushing it there and it’s not nearly the beer it is supposed to be. I wasn’t able to finish my glass and drainpoured the rest of the bottle. Worth a shot I suppose.

Bowman Elderado;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bowman Ales;Cask at the Southampton Arms, London on 23rd July 2013. Amber with thin ring-and-film and almost no lacing. Floral hop and elderflower aromas. Fruity and floral in-mouth, with sweet elderflower, and lemon tang which extends into fruity finish.

Bowman Elderado;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bowman Ales;Watercress Line Real Ale Train 1/6/13. Not entirely disagreeable amber coloured ale- an interesting almost indescribable flavour somewhere in the middle- a sort of very faintly smoky/meaty/umami sort of flavour. Maybe slightly sulphurous, but not in a bad way. Pleasant without being exceptional.

Oakleaf Donkey's Delight;Gosport, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fallen Acorn Brewing Co.;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 06-07-07. Glorious golden colour with lovely bubbly white foam. Some sulphur on the aroma front, bitterness was quite pronounced and like Glen mentions it was actually quite dry. Tasty bitter, that maybe lacked a bit of maltiness to equal things out but I enjoyed the few small samples that I had over the weekend and another beer that had it’s own admirers.
Oakleaf Donkey's Delight;Gosport, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fallen Acorn Brewing Co.;"Gravity, Far From The Madding Crowd. Pale gold, nice frothy white head. Ripe stalky garden aroma; compost, tomatoes, herbs. Interesting. A little weird. Malt aspect of this beer is very pleasant. Good white bread, slightly toasty. Hop character has some nice cinnamon and orange pith, but then notes of that same garden decay. A peculiar beer, and one that I initially found sort of unwelcoming. But it grew on me, and by the end I was kinda digging it. Plays by it’s own rules. Yeah, this is starting to sound pretty much like the plot of every underdog sport movie. (Previous rating: Gravity, Merton Beer Festival. Sticky open foam on a gold body. Berries, sulfur and peppermint aroma. Fresh, though partly fresh swamp. Light body, refreshing and delicate. Well-balanced bitterness. A good beer, though on a day with so many truly excellent beers, this one didn’t get it’s head out in front of the pack. 3.2 overall)"

Ventnor Rock Samphire;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Gravity Cask @ Southampton Beer Festival ’07. Paleish colour. Earthy fruits. Dusty with odd sweetness. Not particularly drinkable - an uninteresting pale bitter overlaid with odd funky flavours.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Ale;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Pours an amber, somewhat malty, with a little bit of skunk. Bitter hop finish. Okay beer.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Ale;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Most of the time this was poured into a pint glass but twice it was poured into a stange. There wasn’t any difference between the two. The appearance had a gentle hazy golden color with a light transparency about it. There was a small white head that left some trickling lacing. The smell had some light sweet German malts along with a light underscore of lemon and a touch of sweet corn. The taste was mainly sweet through the previously mentioned flavors. On the palate, this one sat fairly light and had a good sessionability about it. The carbonation finishes somewhat harsh. Overall, I say it holds itself to being a good American styled kolsch worthy of having again but considering where I live and the distro I don’t mind sticking with Alaskan’s Summer Ale.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Ale;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Cape Ann Brewing Company;On tap at the Summer Shack, Alewife. Looks OK: pale gold with a thin broken head. Aromas of sour fruit, mild hops. Medium-high carbonation. Light body. Flavours of sour hops, grapefruit, bread crust. Not what I was expecting, but fresh and light. More like a lager than an koelsh.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Ale;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Bottle. Slightly hazy golden beer wit a decent offwhite head. Malty bready aroma, dough notes, fruity, some citrus. bready dough flavor, caramel ,citrus, hay, some spicy notes. Malty dough finish with some fruits.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Ale;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Smells of bready malt or biscuit or whatever that typical aroma is you get from a lot light colored german style beers. Appearance is light gold with a slightly cloudy body. Palate is a bit watered down. Taste is slightly fruity, slightly bitter. Overall, it lacks any strong flavor. This beer is not awesome....
Speakeasy Streetsweeper;San Francisco, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;On Tap Hamilton’s. Probably more of a Wheat Wine then a WeizenBock although just called a Wheat Beer at the brewery. Fusel alcohol was apparent giving it the ’hotness’. Rich body of malt and sweetness and a light banana. For a wheat wine and on draft it was tasty!
Speakeasy Streetsweeper;San Francisco, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Damn. That’s some hot tasting beer right there. For what it was, it’s good, but could use a little mellowing out. Too much alcohol flavors. Usually that’s a winner for me, but this has trouble written all over it. True to the style though.
Speakeasy Streetsweeper;San Francisco, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Pours with an orang-amber body topped by a thin head with a good amount of lacing considering the lack of head. It’s slightly sweet and malty with a touch of toffee, a hint of banana, and some other fruity esters. Full bodied and tingly from the carbonation.
River Cottage Stinger (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Right down the middle for lagers. Plus, it’s organic so that makes everyone feels good. Extremely well balanced. The bubbles, nor malt nor hops overwhelm. The picture of the brewer on the bottle is a bit much, but I’d do the same thing. Cheers to River Cottage for offering a crisp, light, refreshing drink. Light the narrow botte head - slows down the drinking process.
River Cottage Stinger (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask. An amber beer with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of hops and nettles. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of caramel, hops lending it notes of flowers, as well as notes of nettles. The body is light.

River Cottage Stinger (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask. Hazy amber with no head. Very low carbonated. Sweet aroma with quite a lot of toffee. Okay taste with caramel and a little sweetness. Very little bitterness.
River Cottage Stinger (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask Conditioned @ Jolly Sailor Bursledon. Light haze with floaters sometimes indicative of a beer not quite ready by that wasnt the case here. Quite a bit of sweet toffeish malt with some background banana and a green herbaceous mouthfeel and flavour which could easily be from hops but I imagine is the contribution of the nettles. Very restrained bitterness in the finish but thankfully the malt does dry out slightly. Smooth and drinkable if tending towards bland and MOR.
Pleasanton Main Street Train Wreck IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;Pleasanton Main Street Brewery;Draft. Dark amber beer with a dark cream head. Grapefruit and light pine aroma. Big pine and earth flavor with grapefruit and light malt. Medium bodied. Nice bitterness. Big pine lingers with grapefruit and earth.
Pleasanton Main Street Train Wreck IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;Pleasanton Main Street Brewery;On tap at the brewery. This one of their best beers on tap. Aroma is of danky hops. I asked the bartender and she called the brewmaster to confirm what kind of hops it was made with. Summit, Columbus, and Magnum. Which confirmed my thoughts that there isn’t much citrus or fruit in the hops. More earthy tones. I also noticed it is unfiltered, and surprisingly cloudy. Thin white head left little lacing on the glass. Overall a very enjoyable IPA.
Pleasanton Main Street Train Wreck IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;Pleasanton Main Street Brewery;Poured into an English pint glass from a growler from the brewery. Color is a dark amber/light copper. Aroma is slightly sweet with resinous hop notes and a rich character in the background that resembles pipe tobacco. Flavor is slightly earthy with some woody notes towards the start, transitioning into resinous and spruce hop flavors towards the finish. Body is medium with an astringent and dry finish. Overall a decent IPA with a more mild and earthy flavor than many.
Pleasanton Main Street Train Wreck IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;Pleasanton Main Street Brewery;Sampled at the Bistro IPA fest. Strange name for a beer! It had an aroma of tropical fruit, caramel, and a hint of plastic. The flavor was tropical and citrus fruit with a hint of caramel. Not bad overall.
Pleasanton Main Street Train Wreck IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;Pleasanton Main Street Brewery;Tasted at the Bistro’s 13th Annual IPA Fest 8/7/2010. This IPA pours a medium orange gold color from the tap. Medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is fruity and sweet, with a touch of citrus and floral hops. A medium bodied IPA. The malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are citrusy and floral. Medium bitter IPA. Nice balance. A touch of residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Pleasanton Main Street Train Wreck IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;Pleasanton Main Street Brewery;On tap @ Main St. Pleasanton poured a cloudy copper with a large creamy lasting ivory head.

Lafayette Alt Heidelberg;Lafayette, Indiana, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;LAF Lafayette Brewing Company;From the tap this pours a deep brown highlighted in ruby and has a creamy beige head. The aroma is sweet and worty, and at first I thought this lager might rot my teeth. But the flavor includes a mild earthy bitterness and a touch of smoke that balance it out and make it a sessionable beer. Lafayette Brewing Company, Lafayette, IN
John Harvards Beach Bum Brown;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap. Aroma of decent, standard sweetish malt. Flavor of fairly weak, metallic malt. Average palate. Bland.
John Harvards Beach Bum Brown;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap. Pours a dark brown with a small white head. Aroma of flavor of sweet roasted malt, some roasted nuts, brown sugar. Smooth, creamy palate. Not very complex, but very good and drinkable. One of my favorite JH beers so far.
John Harvards Beach Bum Brown;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;"The description of this beer says it’s an ""american version"" of a brown ale - this makes sense, because it’s a much less malt-accented brown, with a much higher hop profile - she’s got a nice foamy head on her - aroma of brown sugar, strong roasted nut presence, and herbal hops - bready and nutty flavor, with a really nice, earthy hop kick to it - the hops wrap themselves nicely around a slight roasted malt character - a very tasty variation on the style."
Ringneck I.P.A. 88;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Kettle;The beer had almost no aroma. Dry, bitter and full of flavor is the best way to describe this beer. Was glad to try but it will be a while before trying it again.
Ringneck I.P.A. 88;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Kettle;Draft at Brewkettle. Beer is a clear golden color with slighlty mal/hops aroma. The flavor is of bitter hops but not as aggressive as I would expect from an IPA. There is a bit of malt flavor as well. The beer has a medium finish that is dry and bitter. Very pleasant!
Ringneck I.P.A. 88;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Kettle;The brewer said this was the kind of IPA that came together the night the before the beer was brewed. Not bad for the quick preparation. It’s really more of a Sierra Nevada type APA than an IPA, though. The pale malt is relatively dry, and the hops are just past balancing. The hops don’t come through a lot in the aroma, but more so in the flavor.
Rock Bottom Blanche Des Moines;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Des Moines;For a good while now I’ve been the top rater for Rock Bottom Des Moines, it’s a weird quirk... but it’s always bugged me that when I bring up their page on Ratebeer, that I can see that there is not a check mark in the little box by the first listing. Thank you Rock Bottom Des Moines for amending this for me by brewing this again. Pours a hazy golden with a medium white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is floral and minerally, a tad spicy with a bright hoppy character. Not your typical wit aroma, but wonderful nonetheless. The flavor has plenty of orange rind in both the fruity and bitter sense. The beer has a touch of maltiness, not much in the way of spice besides the orangepeel. The beer is fairly dry and has some light mineral notes. Very nice beer.
Rock Bottom Blanche Des Moines;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Des Moines;"On tap a few weeks back. Color was dull gold. Aroma of citrus and wheat. Flavor was the same; alot of orange/spice. Pretty good stuff."
Rock Bottom Blanche Des Moines;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Des Moines;(Savor, draft) Medium white head atop cloudy straw body. Aroma is medium sweet, lemon, some floral, light cardamom. Taste is medium sweet, lemon, some seltzer Light body, somewhat watery, no crispness.
Rock Bottom Blanche Des Moines;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Des Moines;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a cloudy yellow color. Head was thin, white, and left some decent lace behind. Aroma was fruit dominated, mostly orange and raspberry, accompanied by fresh malty cereal grain. Distinct citrus flavors of lime and orange with buttery, yeasty bread dough. Excellent wit.
Rock Bottom Des Moines Black Belgian;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Des Moines;(Draught, labeled Belgique Noir) Pours a black body with a medium beige head. Aroma of anise, caramel, and toasted malt. Flavor of roasted/black malts, anise, caramel, and a touch of chocolate.
Rock Bottom Des Moines Black Belgian;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Des Moines;Draft at the brewpub. Opaque black in color. Head was thick and creamy with good retention and lacing. Distinct black licorice aroma. Slightly sweet on the tongue with subdued black licorice and roasty malt flavors. Full bodied with roasty bitterness lingering at the end.
Raccoon River Belgian White;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;This really didn’t look very good, flat milky sort of thick looking, actually almost white.... weird. Aroma is somewhat spicy with some lemon and chemicals, eh. Flavor was metallic with some orange and guess what, more weird chemical stuff. Palate was kind of thin. I feel like I’ve had a lot of odd experimental witbiers lately, but this one just didn’t work for me.
Raccoon River Belgian White;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Mixed results on this one. Definitely not much of a Witbier, but not bad if you ignore that. More like a hefe. Aroma is good. Some dusty compost.
Raccoon River Belgian White;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. The body was cloudy dark orange gold with a thin white head. The aroma was fairly strong orange with some bread crust. The taste was orange peels with some floral notes. I had trouble detecting any spice at all in the taste or aroma. Bland, unless you want an orange tasting beer that isn’t that way due to hops.
Raccoon River Belgian White;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Draft at the brewery. Cloudy hazed orange body with a small white head. Very juicy orange flavor with a chewy, thick wheat body. Some light spice/coriander up front, then some fresh apple and pear over the middle, leaving the mouth with a juicy, tangy, full citrus coating. A light acidity and bitterness in the finish rounds out a decent witbier. Things must have change since General Gao tried this one.
Raccoon River Belgian White;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Raccoon River Brewing;Draft at the brewpub. Golden light orange color. Only minimally hazy. I like my wits nice and cloudy. Low marks. Head was white and disappeared quickly. Citrusy aroma accompanied by a subtle cleaning solution smell, corinader, and pear. Sweet on the tongue. Tasted like weak fruit juice. Like a combination of guava and orange. There was also a light brown sugar note. Strange concoction not at all resembling a wit beer.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bomber. Light haze on the golden body Light nose of yeast, hay and lemon. Flavor is the same with a bit of wheat. Light body is tingly and smooth.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle. Hazy yellow with white head. Flavour is malt, wheat and light banana.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle: &nbsp Pale straw, very dull, cloudy, and loaded with sediment. &nbsp Moderate to large white head, decent lacing, flat in carbonation. &nbsp Very dull wheaty aroma. &nbsp A little dank, wet sock perhaps. &nbsp Certainly wheaty on the tongue, but oddly enough for an American Wheat it doesn’t have that sulpher component, but it also doesn’t have any spices. &nbsp Straight up wheat malt, a little basement perhaps. &nbsp Not that filling, or should I say not heafty for a Wheat. &nbsp Seems dead on the tongue. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate otherwise. &nbsp Dry finish, slightly grainy. &nbsp Decent, but quite boring. &nbsp Lacks zest or umph. &nbsp About what I expected for an Organic Hefe.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle sampled in Feb 2008: Pours a hazy yellow golden with a spotty white head. Aroma is slightly skunked and earthy with some clove, black pepper, and slightly estery yeastiness. Body starts lightly sweet and wheaty with a touch of lemon citrus and a drier, earthy bittersweet finish. Needs a little more body, sweetness and authentic yeast character.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;hazy gold with a bit of sediment under a small fizzy white head. crisp aroma of wheat malt, honey, and corn flakes. clean flavors with a hint of sweet banana, honey, and dry toasted corn flakes. clean. refreshing and light. dry.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle. Pale golden beer with a small whitish head. Clove and banana aroma. Wheat, clove, and light citrus flavor. Medium-light bodied. Wheat, spice, and light citrus lingers.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;From bomber pours golden straw with faint yeasty aroma. The label says Hefeweizen, Bavarian and hazy, but it looks filtered with sparse, suspended yeasties. Body is more substantial than the pastuerized look would lead you to predict. Flavor only hints at style with some pilsner malt forward and with some clove phenols, but hardly any banana esthers to speak of.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;btl by Springlicker. Straw hazed yellow pour with a bubbly white head and lace. Clove citrus and wheat on the nose. Papery, thick wheat, with a medium bitter. Watery with light carbonation. An unusual pre bitter taste but a nice bitter. Would be safe to say a beer that lacks character. Not bad but missing something
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Pours the palest beer I’ve ever seen. I mean like clear. Some haze to it. One finger frothy white head. The nose is wheaty, spicy, some clove, no banana, some lemongrass, more citrus peel than I would expect. The flavor is very mild, some wheat, some banana, otherwise very mild. Not too impressive.
Butte Creek Helltown Organic Hefeweizen;Ukiah, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butte Creek Brewing Company;To me, a Hefe should be a medium yellow with a good bit of cloudiness. This was a thin yellow and very clear. It should also boast a tall, long lasting head and this one had a small head that disappeared almost immediately. Decaying citrus aroma that moves towards some clove. Dry finish to a thin, watery disappointing start. Very thin bodied for a Hefe.
Marks & Spencer County Carlow Irish Stout;Paddington, Greater London, England;Stout - Dry;Marks & Spencer Stores;500ml bottle from M&S, Watford in 2017. Deep brown with a tan head. Aroma of roast malt, dried fruit and cake. Good body with roast malt and dates in flavour.

Slick palate; Mouth feel is very good dark maltyness in a slightly wheat-thinned but solid, chewy background. Mainly tartness with dark malt bitterness, plus quite notable black coffee with a touch of caramel. Flowery with low sweetness. Herbal with lemon to round. Effective!... Hoppiness is floral, light lemon and strawy grass in nose. Herbs, floral, lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness - malts and hops - is fairly strong for a lasting, mid to fair astringent bitter dark malty finish; Dry after taste. Coffee herbal and bitter to mouth. Comments: This one has good looks, decent toffee malty aroma, and a flat dark malt bitterness with a chewy feel. Only one small step away from being outstanding. Drinkable of course."
Maypole Cockchafer;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maypole Brewery;Tried at the Newark Beer Festival 2016. Pale yellow golden colour with a white head. Citrus aroma, not much is any ginger coming through. Taste might have warmth from the ginger, but it wasn’t that noticeable.
Maypole Cockchafer;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maypole Brewery;Cask@GBBF (thanks Mes!). Yellowish golden colour with a mediumsized white head. Aroma is fruity, floral and has some honey and mild bready notes as well. Flavour is spices, zest, caramel, herbs, grass and some toffee. Not overdoing the ginger.
Maypole Cockchafer;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maypole Brewery;A Mes rate. Cask at GBBF. I got chatting to a guy at the bar while he was ordering his third pint of this and upon hearing I had not tried it, he insisted on pouring some into my empty glass. I ended up with nigh on half a pint. Thankfully it was good. A pale petrol blonde colour with a thin off white head. Nice spritely hoppage all round on top of a faint but supportive biscuity malt base. Some spice and lemon in the finish. A little one dimensional but a very pleasant, highly quaffable drop.
Maypole Cockchafer;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maypole Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Pale straw, greenish tinge with white head. Almost a cider in appearance, there is a citric nose to it, leading to a sharpish hoppy flavour with hints of lime. There is possibly ginger in the background. It is a light and refreshing pint, tangy, zesty and yes Rick it goes very well with Free Range pickled eggs.
Cottage Captain Jack;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask handpull, The Crown, Nuneaton- this version 3.9%. Pale chestnut with a faint mistiness at the edges, tight white collar. Orange jelly peppered with ground coriander seed aroma. Sourish redcurrant and peppery orange fruit, wheat-based biscuit, earth, dab of cinnamon, light Flemish splashes. Creamy afters with hints of milk chocolate and hazelnut. Decent, but like most of Cottage’s output I wouldn’t want another pint.
Cottage Captain Jack;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask handpull at Lower Red Lion, St Albans. Deep chestnut colour with lasting beige head. Bit of vinegar maybe. Dullish. Some dull malt, bit of plum fruit, some dryness on finish.
Cottage Captain Jack;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Brown amber with white head. Another fairly average beer from Cottage, they are definitely falling into the same trap as Archers. Perfumed, bitter, dry beer but fairly plain and basically dull. A touch of soapiness on the finish.
O'Hanlon's Goldblade;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hanlon's Brewery;let bitter, har hvedens syrlighed, men ellers lidt tynd i det..............
O'Hanlon's Goldblade;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hanlon's Brewery;"Cask. Gold in colour. A clear wheat beer. Fruity; citrus-orangey, almost mild marmalade. Floral hops. Underlying wheaty malts; buttery. Mildly bitter citrus throughout. Drinkable. Not bad. (2008)"
O'Hanlon's Goldblade;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hanlon's Brewery;Tasted as O’Hanlon’s Double Champion Wheat Beer in order to show off its two medals, golden ale with wheat malt and creamy, dense, yellowish white head over a warm peach blonde colour, hazy with nice sparkling. Sweet and wheaty aroma with earthy, peppery hops, nutmeg, pumpkin, mango, cheese, pine resin, soap, chamomille. Fresh, vividly fruity onset with medium strong carbonation, dry background, bit grainy with sourish wheat malt, hoppy finish, resinous, spicy, honeyish and long. Very elegant, delicate and thirst-quenching ale, I enjoyed this a lot.
O'Hanlon's Goldblade;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hanlon's Brewery;Bottle: (as Double Champion Wheat) Pours slightly hazy, dark gold with a tall, off-white head. Light pear, apple, wheat aroma. Taste is white fruit....pear, banana, apple.... Very light, fruity....a little bready. Very pleasant.
O'Hanlon's Goldblade;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hanlon's Brewery;Pours a cloudy golden amber with a small white head. Aroma and taste of sweet banana mild fruity notes upfront mellows out to wheat, biscuit malt, yeast as it warms up with some moderate amount of mild peppery hops for balance. A light to medium body, with soft carbonation. The flavor became more prevalent as it warmed up. Overall not the best wheat ale but still goes down quite easy, a good brew.
Kassiks Beaver Tail Blonde Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kassiks Brewery;On tap. Comes pale gold with a decent white head. Aroma of malt, grain, grass, and a bit of citrus. Taste is the same. Average.

Kassiks Beaver Tail Blonde Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kassiks Brewery;on tap @ Humpy’s / Anchorage Ak --- Hazy light golden amber color, white head cover, cobwebs of lace. Taste is brisk, somewhat bitter malt that moves with no change to a swallow full of carbonation and medium pine hops. An easy-going blonde on steroids that somehow works anyway.
Kassiks Beaver Tail Blonde Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kassiks Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance is a light golden yellow colored body with a one and a half finger white foamy head, with some clingy lacing. The smell is grassy, grainy and a little bit of sweet corn, just a little spicy. The taste has a light grassy/graininess, sweet aftertaste, sticky finish. The palate is light, sessionable, carbonation seems adequate for the style - nothing sharp, nothing watery and nothing spectacular. Overall, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad, would I have it again, perhaps depending what else was served, just another American Blonde Ale.
Kassiks Beaver Tail Blonde Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kassiks Brewery;Bottle: Poured a golden with white whispery head. Sweet grains and light floral. Nice corn and grain with a wet finish.
Kassiks Beaver Tail Blonde Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kassiks Brewery;Bottle. Pours to a golden body with a white head. Aroma is bready and has a light noble hop. The flavor is biscuits with some light noble hops. Very bready. There is a light metallicness. The palate, besides the metallicness is medium bodied and clean.
Kassiks Beaver Tail Blonde Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kassiks Brewery;Thanks to Blake and Jenny for sharing! Poured lighter golden with a well-retained beige head. The aroma picked up toasted pale and bready malts with grass and light metallic accents. The flavor found pale malts at the core with a lot of metallic character and lightly-peppered grass around.. back to the metal on the finish. Tangy and metallic on the palate.. not a good feel or an enjoyable drink.
Kassiks Beaver Tail Blonde Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kassiks Brewery;Bottle: &nbsp Dirty straw, fairly hazy, large frothy off-white head, nice lacing. &nbsp Pale bready aroma, even a faint bit of wheatiness. &nbsp I might think this was an American Wheat based on the look and aroma. &nbsp Wheaty and straw on the tongue, light sweetness, a touch dry. &nbsp Had it been clearer and without the wheaty aspect, I might think Golden Ale. &nbsp However, its not bright. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Finishes clean, with a soft wheat aspect. &nbsp Faint buttery straw/hay on the exit. &nbsp Yeah, seems more in line with an American Wheat than a Golden Ale. &nbsp Tiz alright.
Kassiks Beaver Tail Blonde Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kassiks Brewery;650ml bomber pours a pale golden orange color with a 2 finger white head that settles down to leave some decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild but pleasant with some grains and citrus. Taste is a grainy malt sweetness with some light citrus hop bitterness and a dry finish. Light to medium body with good carbonation. A full flavored blonde ale that is recommended.

Kassiks Moose Point Porter;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Porter;Kassiks Brewery;Dark brown, thin head, almost smokiness in the dark malt character. Good body, slight sweetness in the balanced finish.
Kassiks Moose Point Porter;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Porter;Kassiks Brewery;Reviewed from notes. Into a mug. The appearance has a black colored body with a slim half finger white foamy head, slight foamy lacing seems to speckle just a bit. The smell came across kinda smokey and a slight dark chocolate comes through in a weird sort of way, not exactly sure how to take this. The taste came through a sort of a smokey and sweet through the most part, slight smokey/meaty aftertaste, super dry finish. This one sits about a medium on the palate, though it gives off a somewhat sessionable quality to it. Carbonation is fairly subdued, but good for the style. Overall, this is not a normal porter I’m used to, a little bit smokier than I thought it would be but still a good one. Pretty sure I’d have this one again.
Kassiks Moose Point Porter;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Porter;Kassiks Brewery;pours a dark brown with a red tint, above average carbonation, a small fizzy ten head that dissipates, and no lacing. smell is of cocoa, coffee, and a touch of vanilla. taste is fizzy, milk chocolate, coffee, and some malt. ends smooth. an easy drink.
Kassiks Moose Point Porter;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Porter;Kassiks Brewery;650ml bomber pours almost black in color with a small light beige head that leaves a few spots of lace on the glass. Aroma is light roasted grains and chocolate with hints of dark fruits. Taste is a light roasty bitterness with some chocolate malty sweetness and fruit with a dry finish. A little thin in body for the style and softly carbonated. An easy drinking porter which would be a good entry beer for a beginner to step into this style.
Kassiks Moose Point Porter;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Porter;Kassiks Brewery;Bottle: &nbsp Nearly black, thin foamy dark beige head, a few rings of lacing. &nbsp Soft buttery roasted malt nose, slight cocoa and even softer hops. &nbsp A touch tart on the tongue, pale roastiness, soft cocoa and chocolate. &nbsp Little to no hop presense found here. &nbsp Not a watery Porter, but very light. &nbsp Its smooth, but lacks any depth. &nbsp Very much middle of the road. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are average. &nbsp Clean finish, but its very lackluster. &nbsp Not a hoppy example, or big in the roasted malt department either. &nbsp Yeah... very drab and unexciting.
Kassiks Moose Point Porter;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Porter;Kassiks Brewery;Nice little BA trade Bomber into a tulip Pours a dark, murky cola color and settles black. Nice, thick light brown head. Good body to the head. Falls off quickly though and leaves a layer of lacing on the sides of the glass. Nose is of slight smoke, or oak, chocolate, coffee, and roast. More roast in the taste with some coffee acidity and a bit of sourness. Slightly thin and watery but coffee and sourness hide it well. Dry, clean finish. More acid and sourness in the front and mid palate. Nothing exciting but it is a nice beer. Would gladly drink it again
Kassiks Moose Point Porter;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Porter;Kassiks Brewery;Bottle, thanks SHIG! Pours black with a medium tan head. Aroma is roast, cocoa and light smoke. Flavor is light and semi-tart like a traditional porter. Big roast, cocoa nibs, tart cherry in the finish. Nice and highly drinkable.
Kassiks Caribou Kilt;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kassiks Brewery;Caramel and bread on the nose, negligible hops. Nice brown color. Deep caramel flavor, nice sweetness to it. Lacks a little depth but generally good flavor.
Kassiks Caribou Kilt;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kassiks Brewery;I poured this into a thistle. The appearance was a ruddy brown color with a one finger white foamy head that simmers down to a nice level coating over top of the body. There is some decent lacing clinging finely to the sides of the glass. The smell, holy caramel malty scotch, wow. This could be overbearing to some, but not too bad to me. Its just not that well balanced. The taste is super sweet through the caramel malts. There is a long caramel aftertaste leading into a dry caramel finish. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionable aspect to it. The carbonation is barely there - its almost too smooth and creamy to be true. Overall, not a bad Wee Heavy/Scotch ale, but its not exactly balanced as I didn’t get any peatiness in this one.
Kassiks Caribou Kilt;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kassiks Brewery;Ranks Mike, malty, fruity, toffee, caramel, slight nail polish, slight diacetyl, a bit metallic.
Kassiks Caribou Kilt;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kassiks Brewery;Dark amber in color, hazy with a thick head. Nice Malt flavor light hops. Nice spicy scotch ale. Easy drinking with a good finish.
Kassiks Caribou Kilt;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kassiks Brewery;Bottle:   Deep ruby hued amber, moderate frothy off-white head, spotty lacing.   Sweet and sweaty biscuity nose, some sugary fig/date like presense as well.   Strong sweet biscuity start, a touch caramel/toffee, with candied fig/dates.   No real peat, smoke, or campfire.   Very malty, sweet, and biscuity.   Needs more body and something to counteract the strong sweetness.   I will say if this is 8.5%, its well hidden.   Needs more traditional stuff, smoke, peat, charred wood, and campfire.   Can be difficult to finish a bomber by onces self.

Kassiks Caribou Kilt;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kassiks Brewery;22. Pours a murky dark brown with a dense and creamy tan head that doesn’t stick around long enough.

Kassiks Pale Moon Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kassiks Brewery;Grumbler purchase from the Breeze in, Juneau AK. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a soft hazy amber color with a decent transparency about it allowing some light carbonation to be seen rising. There was a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. The lacing was somewhat sticky but ended up sliding just a bit. The smell had a sweet sticky citrus hoppiness and then a bitter sticky hoppiness. A light pale crisp maltiness came into play after a little bit of warming. The taste was bittersweet citrus hops and crisp caramel malts. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was good for the style and for me as it was just enough harshness but managed to stay somewhat subdued. It’s crisp but settles slightly sticky over my tongue. Overall, good APA glad I was able to finally partake in an offering of Kassik’s that isn’t bottled.
Kassiks Pale Moon Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kassiks Brewery;Clear light amber color with a white head. Mild floral, piney hop aromas. Medium body. Good floral and pine hoppy flavors on a sweet pale malt base. Well balanced, full flavored Pale here. Draft@ Firetap
Kassiks Pale Moon Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kassiks Brewery;On tap @ The Peanut Farm. Clear yellow/gold with a small white head. Aroma is light on the hops for a Pale but they are there more piney with a bit of citrus, also a faint cereal aroma. Taste is sweet with a mild bitterness. Crisp and refreshing, light bodied with active carbonation. Good beer but more along the lines of a Golden/Blond, just not a lot of flavor or hop character but very drinkable.
Kassiks Pale Moon Ale;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kassiks Brewery;22-Jan-08 (Draft: Kassik’s Kenai Brew Stop in Nikiski, AK) Sweet, honey-like malts and very light hop aromas lead into a pleasant, honey-sweet grainy malt flavor with lightly bitter hops for balance. Medium-bodied with a clean, pleasantly crisp mouthfeel. Pale golden color and slightly hazy in appearance. The whitish head pours to a quarter-inch, then settles to a wide ring. It may be an easy drinker, but it’s also pretty enjoyable.

Kassiks Roughneck Stout;Kenai, Alaska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kassiks Brewery;this is good stout. when i first tryed it had a butter shots flavor to me. and i put one in fridge for 3 weeks and just drank it and the butterscotch flavor was not there anymore. i was going to hold on to it until i was reading that to age stouts u need 8 abv or above for better results. but if u like stouts and have a chance to try this one i would say give it a go. it has a medium mouth feel. taste is coffee with chocolate notes through out. some kind of fruit in it dates. or dark cherries. after 3 weeks the butterscotch flavor or toffee flavor leaves. has a light brown head. and leaves a nice lace behind on glass. and the alc is 7.2 abv.
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;09-Sep-11 (12-oz bottle, Part of the Brewer's Lunchbox Variety 12-Pack: Purchased 30-Jul-11 for $17.99 at BevMo in San Diego/Mira Mesa, CA) This pleasant-smelling IPA offers piney, grassy hops and sweet-smelling, caramely malts. The malt base is fairly grainy though, with the sweeter, caramely aspect not far behind. Hops are mostly piney, but not resiny, and the bitterness is medium. It's medium in weight and carbonation, and the finish is pleasantly dry and slightly dusty. Hazy, amber body is topped by half an inch of off-white head that settles to a patchy cap and wide ring with quite a lot of ringed and doily-like lacing up and down the glass. Overall, there isn't anything flashy here, but it's just a really nice, flavorful, and well-balanced IPA that goes down easy.
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;This is a good IPA, better than average I'd say. Is slightly lacking across the board compared to some top line IPAs, but besides that has good overall flavor and quality. Has the typical orange-gold to copper appearance, not the weak looking pale yellow IPA. Nice malty and hoppy taste....grapefruit and pine. Received as a gift, but this is something that I would buy if the price is right.
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;Fint IPA humlet, dog en anelse syrlig i eftersmagen. Det passer ikke helt slagsen
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;"From Sep 2007 This pours from 12oz bottle a clear gold with lots of bubbles and a huge billowy head of foam with lots of lacing. The smell is hoppy with big grapefruit and floral notes The taste has loads of floral hops up front with a very good malty flavour lingering in the background. At times, the hops impart a really bitter flavour, at other times the malt somewhat balances out the hops..strange. Strange but very tasty. It finishes bitter, the mouthfeel is light and the carbo, well, it's less noticeable in the taste than I expected. Must be the Sam Adams glass working its magic on the initial pour. ;^) I'm close to finishing my glass and all the flavours seemed to have mellowed some but in a good way. Pretty drinkable and certainly a better IPA than some I've tried. Note to self: Get a Growler next time I'm in Ft Collins. The draft version is better on all counts."
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;Pours a clear golden yellow w/fizzy head. Aromas of fruity hops and citrus. Smooth hoppy taste with citrus and pine tail.
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;Aroma: floral, hay, Appearance: clear golden with a huge white head. UUUGE! Taste: medium sweetness, medium bitterness, Palate: medium body, sticky, lively carbonation,, bitter finish Decent
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;This bottle was a good three or four months old when I drank it, but **** it was an unmitigated disaster. It had NO IPA characteristics - it was like a bad nut brown ale. Like somebody left a New Glarus Fat Squirrel in the sun and then spit some chew after drinking pink lemonade. Not a fan at all.
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;Pretty average for a competitive category. Aromas and Flavors are floral with a slight bitterness that lasts. Good balance with a medium weight but not very attractive. Too light.
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;Pours a hazed light brown orange.Yeast sediment. Aromas of overripe fruits, sweet caramel/ toffee, bready/ yeasty, some spices. Haven’t had this in a long time. Seems on the aged side. Decent OK IPA.
Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Fort Collins Brewery;Medium amber in color with a whitish head that faded quickly. Floral hops, citrus zest, and a slight malt base. The finish is odd and ends hastily. Not bad, not a standout.
Defiant Golden Ale;Pearl River, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Defiant Brewing Company;Sample off of Hopheads grolwer. Pours a hazy light amber/ coppery with a diminishing white head. Aroma is funky, and infected with something- either some brett or pedio- decent lactic character- some grape must, and a touch of acetobacter. While I kinda liked the funky infected arouma ( when cold it was nice, as it warmed it was kinda crappy), but the flavor was dull. Light cookie dough, herbal hops, light belgian yeast, dough, and an astringent finish.
Defiant Golden Ale;Pearl River, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Defiant Brewing Company;sampled on tap at the brewery and took out a growler. Hazy light orange in color. Aroma: Tart fruit- white grapes and notes of possible brett. Also some musty belgian yeast and light spice. Aroma is really nice. Taste I didn’t enjoy quite as much as the aroma. Taste has just about the same characteristics as the aroma- a moderate amount of white grape flavor, minus the tart and light funkyness. A little bit sugary , and becomes a bit muddled near the finish with a moderate hop bittering finish. Has some similarities to Captain Lawrence’s Cuvee De Castleton, but nowhere near as flavorful, tart and refined.

Rich bourbon aroma with notes of vanilla, roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel and oak. Pours dark brown with a thin light brown head that has little retention and good lacing. Starts with rich roasted malt, dark chocolate and caramel flavors with a nice, full body and slick, viscous mouthfeel. Finishes very smooth with bourbon, vanilla and oak flavors and just a hint of booze and sweet dark fruit at the very end. Very nice BA Russian imperial.
Sprecher Czar Brew Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sprecher Brewing Company;Black with a dark tan head. Shared a bottle. Deep coffee and chocolate note finishes well for being so heavy. Generally tasty.
Sprecher Czar Brew Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sprecher Brewing Company;Inky black pour under a thin tan head. Lovely woody and dark malty nose with cocoa and whiskey and dark chocolate. Smooth but richly sweet and boozy flavor that’s roasty and full of dark chocolate, caramelly oak, whiskey/bourbon, light wood char, light vanilla and caramel, and a black malty linger. Delightful.
Sprecher Czar Brew Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sprecher Brewing Company;"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/15/2012. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, coconut, toasted oak, and bourbon; with lighter notes of leather, tobacco, raisin, plum, coffee, smoke, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, coconut, toasted oak, and bourbon; with lighter notes of leather, tobacco, raisin, plum, coffee, smoke, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate roasted bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, coconut, toasted oak, bourbon, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Slightly drying from bitter/spiciness as well. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged Russian imperial stout! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the big ABV. This aged extremely well. Tons of barrel presence with no booziness; and well rounded stout complexity in balance with the barrel notes. A very enjoyable offering."
Sprecher Czar Brew Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sprecher Brewing Company;Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured thick and black with a small foamy brown head that left minimal lacing. The aroma was bitter with floral hops, roasty malts, wood, whiskey and cocoa. The flavor was bitter, roasty and woody with cola, cocoa, whiskey and an overwhelmingly boozy presence that was too sharp to really enjoy. Long finish. Moderately full bodied. Disappointing.
Sprecher Czar Brew Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sprecher Brewing Company;Bottle in a trade. Dat in my cellar about 18 months. Black in color, thin head. Aroma is moderate bourbon, vanilla, and coconut hints, mild roasted grain. Mild roasted malted grain backbone. Bourbon is has a light warming sensation after the swallow. Alcohol is hidden. Body fuller with a creamy/ lower carbonation. I am surprised at the lower ratings, must be batch (vintage) variations because what is in my glass is pretty nice.
Sprecher Czar Brew Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sprecher Brewing Company;Bomber, from AFH. Looks really nice, dark, tan brown head, a slight reddish hue but looks like a classic Imperial Stout. The aroma though..next-level. Vanilla, Coconut, Bourbon and chocolate. There is a little bit of smokey year here. Mouthfeel is thin, carb is spot on but there’s just not a to of malt density here. the initial bit of smoke, wood and bourbon are on spot then it fades pretty fast. Actually, yeah the carb is pretty much on point, just it’s lacking the malt backbone it ends. The vanilla at the finish is a really nice touch.
Sprecher Czar Brew Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sprecher Brewing Company;Nice deep rich black and coats the tongue, but isn’t thick. Heavy scent that lingers. A nice bourbon flavor but not bitter or harsh. The oak is even and lends to the idea of a stinky cheese pairing. Tap

Howe Sound Mettleman Copper Ale;Squamish, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Howe Sound Brewing;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy amber color with a sly transparency about it. Finger’s worth of white foamy head quickly dissipated. Left some stringy lace. The aroma had some nuts, toast, brown sugar and a touch of caramel malts. The flavor blended the prior noted aromas sweetly and then the toast and just a tad of roast. Semi-sweet malty aftertaste with a nutty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt spot on. Overall, nice amber ale worthy of coming back to if I could get it again.
Howe Sound Mettleman Copper Ale;Squamish, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Howe Sound Brewing;On tap. Pours a clear mahogany with moderate head, aromas of nuts, sweet toasted malts and brown sugar. Flavors are same tough stronger. Metallic nutty finish.

Aroma of copper-like malt and metallic notes. Flavour of metallic notes and dry English bready malts. Very bland, but dry and would be very drinkable if not for the metallic notes. Too much metallic / coppery flavour.

Howe Sound Mettleman Copper Ale;Squamish, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Howe Sound Brewing;It pours a hazy copper color with a soapy white head. It has a medium amount of carbonation The aroma is pretty boring little sweet notes but other than that not much. Even when it got warm. The flavor is nothing special. It has a huge malt base. It is not well balanced between the malt and hops. I am getting some carmel and a metallic taste. I think if I were to put a penny in my mouth it would taste just like this. It feels really thin at some points. It finishes with a dry and sweet and there is a little hops there. But it tends to linger around. Not a bad beer but nothing i would ever reach for again. These guys seem to do just ok stuff nothing that creates a wow experience
Howe Sound Mettleman Copper Ale;Squamish, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Howe Sound Brewing;1L brown swingtop. Orange colour, small and creamy whitish head which fades to a ring. Caramel malt aroma. Flavour is nutty malt with a touch of chocolate and some caramel sweetness, faint fruitiness and light citrus/grassy hop presence. Aftertaste is nutty malts with some dryness. Medium body, mild carbonation. Drinkable, but not super interesting.
Howe Sound Mettleman Copper Ale;Squamish, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Howe Sound Brewing;Not the best amber ale out there, but pretty solid. Nice barley malts, toffee, hops and mild yeast. A nice bitter hop finish. Pretty nice beer though.
Howe Sound Mettleman Copper Ale;Squamish, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Howe Sound Brewing;Lot’s of caramel in the nose, with roasted malt and some fall grass. Colour is true to its name - copper. Flavour shows walnuts, tonnes of malt, dust and some roast near the end. Palate has a slight after film, but expertly carbonated. Finish is quite a nice light roast with the caramel making another appearence. Good stuff.
Howe Sound Mettleman Copper Ale;Squamish, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Howe Sound Brewing;"Huzzah for the one-litre swing top bottles favoured by Howe Sound (and by me as well)! Not much of a head with this one, what there was being a thin, ivory-coloured layer on top of a rather nice and clear amber/copper body. The aroma was quite malty, with some hop undertones; I found the flavour to be very much the same. Mouthfeel was smooth, and it finished sweet and malty."

Yates & Jackson Lioncrest (Pasteurised);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;can from Tesco’s.No more than you expect from a cheap canned bitter.Full head upon pouring with a trace of maltiness.Orange clear appearance. Not the worst canned beer I have tried but as there in my experience is no such thing as a good canned bitter it will do
Yates & Jackson Lioncrest (Pasteurised);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;A lovely refreshing beer. love the barley taste to it pity tesco are stop selling it

Yates & Jackson Lioncrest (Pasteurised);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;440ml can from Tesco. A fairly standard low quality canned lager. Light tasting - little character. No real off flavours, but tastes like the washings through from the making of a better beer.
Yates & Jackson Lioncrest (Pasteurised);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;Pours chestnut with decent off white head. Aroma malty and a little sweet, decent balance of sweet and more toasted malt flavours with a little hop kick on the swallow, if a little metallic. Mouthfeel a little thin and finish short but without unpleasant aftertastes. Decent canned bitter and went down well with a ham sandwich.
Yates & Jackson Lioncrest (Pasteurised);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;Thwaites revive the name of the historic Lancaster Brewery for this canned bitter. No doubt former patrons of Yates & Jackson are turning in their graves. As far as canned bitters go this isn’t too bad. Amber. Faint malty aroma. Pleasant malty sweetness to begin, followed by refreshing sourness and some bitterness. However it has many of the faults of canned beers, like a metallic taste, excessive carbonation, and a generally flaccid, watery feeling.
Grand Teton Fest Bier;Victor, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;On tap at Hops & Pie. Clear reddish amber appearance with a beige head. Aroma of toasted malt, mild fruitiness and light caramel/toffee notes. Similar flavor, adding moderate sweetness and light bitterness. Light to medium body with a slight watery feel and a lingering malt finish. Not bad overall.
Grand Teton Fest Bier;Victor, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"From Aug 2007 Purchased at Poplar Wine and Spirits in Casper for US$10.50 I was just about to enter this as a new beer but I see my good buddy jwc215 beat me to it. ;^) This one pours from waxed swing top 33.8oz bottle a hazy reddish gold with a thick head of foam with lots of sticky lacing. Very appealing appearance. The foam shrinks to a fine layer by the end of the session but it's *still* looking fine in my Sam Adams glass. The smell is of caramel malt but it's very delicate. The taste is semi sweet on my first sip and very earthy, almost tastes funky. As I take further sips, I'm getting some spice and a good hop bitterness, grass and a touch of lemon, that shows up near and through the finish. This is a tasty son of a gun! It has a medium mouthfeel and the carbo is lightly done. A very quaffable offering from Grand Teton...yet again. I'm really liking what this brewery in Victor Idaho is doing with their Cellar Reserve series. Bottom Line: If you see this one in your local store, give it a try. I recommend it!"

Grand Teton Fest Bier;Victor, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;2 finger head comes up like meringue... brew is crystal clear amber orange.. head sticks around forever.. so does the pretty lace.. Very rich malty aroma.. no hops to speak of.. waves of toasted malt.. not sweet.. not caramelly.. just thick toasted malt.. very nice. It strikes me as having a pretty dry finish.. with the assumed toasted malt essence .. no sweetness on the end. Medium/high malty sweetness out of the gate.. melts to toasty malts mid palate and a subtle earthy hop flavor is still stick around... very very clean from front to back.. Medium body and carbonation has a smooth velvety texture... deep malts but it’s never too sweet.. just very smooth and clean.
Grand Teton Fest Bier;Victor, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Hazy copper with a thin white foam cap. Biscuity nose with a little toasted English muffin and sweet honey coated cereal grains. The flavor is big and full with a lot of honey and toast and sweet cereal grains. Very smooth and sweet with a good honey PPP that’s very distinctive from other marzens. A wee bit grainy and biscuity but overall, this is basically a Honey Oktoberfest.
Grand Teton Fest Bier;Victor, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;The color of this beer is a slightly hazy amber color with a medium white head. The aroma belnds yager yeast and lighter malts that are reminiscent of toast. The taste is slightly sour, a touch bitter, and a touch sweet, creating a very crisp flavor. The aftertaste is fairly abrupt, but the bite from the average carbonation does linger on the tongue. Also, the beer has a medium-light body and a slick texture.
Grand Teton Fest Bier;Victor, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Draught: med gold pour with thin head. Aroma is toasted marshmallow, caramel and light fruity hop.

Golden with a large off-white head. Musty basement, citrus, and spicy flavor with a light grassy bitter finish. Medium body.
Back Road La Porte Saison;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Back Road Brewery;A decent saison, interesting how they picked the ingredients and it makes it tasty and unique but not amazing.
Back Road La Porte Saison;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Back Road Brewery;tap at the brewery - The aroma is that nice yeasty, citrus accented, hoppy, spicy aroma that unmistakably a saison. It’s hazy dark yellow in color and has a lingering, dense head with lots of lacing. The taste is slightly sweet up front then goes to moderately strong hops bitterness, yeast, citrus, and the slightest touch of barnyard flavor. It finishes dry. Good brew.
Back Road La Porte Saison;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Back Road Brewery;12oz from BBB63, thank you Mike. Shared with my gf Cyn. Pours orange with a 2 finger tan head. Nose is sweet and spiced. Taste is spicy with touches of citrus and a bit of hoppy bitterness. The citrus bitter but also lemony. Can’t quite place the spices, but this is certainly a tasty saison.
Back Road La Porte Saison;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Back Road Brewery;Draft. Orange amber with good, creamy white head / Bread and citrus nose / Light body, overly tart and thin, with fair, bitter finish / Weak flavors of lemon, orange, and coriander / Lacks the finesse of similar tart saisons. Needs reworking.
Back Road La Porte Saison;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Back Road Brewery;Bottles courtesy of BBB. Dirty golden, huge off-white head, great lacing. Big floral and spice character up front. Either chamomile or paradise in the background, I swear, even though the description reads no. Flavor much the same, floral and fruit esters up front, dusty pils malt/spent grain through the middle, faint spice and skunk dry out the finish. Old euro hops is what I wrote in notes, but apparently it’s Mt. Hood. Could be a tad drier, but still very well done.
Back Road La Porte Saison;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Back Road Brewery;Growler shared by BBB63. Hazy orange-yellow pour with a white head.

Aroma of sweet, lightly toasted biscuity Belgian malt and some grassy hops. Body starts with a mild earthy bready sweetness and some toasty caramel balance toward a drier, more bitter finish. A nice saison.
Back Road La Porte Saison;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Back Road Brewery;Sample provided by the Big Bad Bear. Hazy, light amber/pale with a small white head. The nose is herbal and peppery with notes of pear and bread. The flavor is fairly dry, floral and hoppy with some pepper and doughy malts. Medium body is slightly rough with light carbonation.

Pours a clear orange with a slightly yellowish foamy head and nice lacings. Sweet with some dry-hops-like (think Orval) sourness. Yeasty with quite a bit of peppar. Long peppary finish.

The Bag and Kettle Trout Brook Gold Light Ale;Carrabassett Valley, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Bag and Kettle Brewing Company;(22 oz.bottle from 1828 Vintage House) Bland about sums it up...Pale yellow with off-white head. Aroma of light bread maltiness, gets a little dishrag-like as head recedes. Mouthfeel thin and slightly prickly/rough. Some light, broken rings of lacing. Flavor is minimal, faint corn/bread malt with even fainter hint of citrus tang. Not objectionable, just goes nowhere.
The Bag and Kettle Trout Brook Gold Light Ale;Carrabassett Valley, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Bag and Kettle Brewing Company;22oz bomber (contract brewed by Shipyard) from Ron’s in Farmington. Slightly hazy but fairly translucent yellow body with virtually no white head. Smell is not particularly strong, but malty sweetness dominates with a some floral hops to support. Tastes like biscuit malt with hints of floral hops and diacetyl. Thin watery mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable though. Nothing earth-shattering, but a fairly easy-drinking ale.

The Bag and Kettle Brown Bag Ale;Carrabassett Valley, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;The Bag and Kettle Brewing Company;Draught @ The Bag on Sugarloaf. It was nothing special pretty bland and boring.
The Bag and Kettle Brown Bag Ale;Carrabassett Valley, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;The Bag and Kettle Brewing Company;22oz bomber (brewed by Shipyard) from Ron’s in Farmington. Translucent reddish-brown body with a quarter inch of off-white head. Smells like caramel and chocolate malts. Caramel and chocolate malts dominate the flavor, with some supporting hop bitterness and a bit of astringency. On the lighter side of medium-bodied. Very drinkable for what it is. Not the best brown ale I’ve had, but a pretty decent one.
Braustelle Weizen Dunkel;Cologne-Ehrenfeld, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Gasthaus-Brauerei Braustelle;The head is ok, the body orange-brown and cloudy. The taste is malty, sweet, a bit yeasty. Less taste. Medium. 11/8/7/8/-/8
Braustelle Weizen Dunkel;Cologne-Ehrenfeld, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Gasthaus-Brauerei Braustelle;Darkish amber pour, opaque from the cloudiness. Adequate banana and clove nose, but tartish fruitiness, a bit like in the alt once again lays in the background. I can’t say it really disturbs in the nose, but in mouth, the thinned body obviously suffers from this phenomenon. I’m afraid they just are not at their best when playing with dark malts.
Madison River Muddler Minnow Mild;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Mild Ale;Madison River Brewing Company;Second stop during the ABA Beer Tour ’07 in Belgrade, Montana. Sampled with kyzr at the brewpub. Pours a clear medium gold brew with a nice off-white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film. Aroma of toasted multi-grain cereal malt with a hint of flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with a watery malt flavor. Finish is slightly bitter but the bitter aftertaste does not stay around very long.
Madison River Muddler Minnow Mild;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Mild Ale;Madison River Brewing Company;Dark gold with off-white head. Very weak notes of malt on the nose. Flavor is lightly toasted malt that backs into a little bit of hoppiness. Body is medium, finish leaves an odd coating on the palate.
Big Time Ave Rat Malt Liquor;Seattle, Washington, United States;Malt Liquor;Big Time Brewery;Smells and looks okay, which scores it higher than most malt liqours. First sip is extremely strong alcoholic and malt liqourish. It gets a bit better, but really isn’t nearly as great as it’s rated to me.
Big Time Ave Rat Malt Liquor;Seattle, Washington, United States;Malt Liquor;Big Time Brewery;(Growler)Nice body with a corn finish in the flavor.Yellow in color with a white head.
Big Time Ave Rat Malt Liquor;Seattle, Washington, United States;Malt Liquor;Big Time Brewery;A malt liquor! Maybe my first craft malt liquor. Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. The aroma is sweet hops, dirty malts. The flavor is a bit hot, aggressive, more hoppy than any other malt liquor ever. Not bad.
Big Time Ave Rat Malt Liquor;Seattle, Washington, United States;Malt Liquor;Big Time Brewery;Sampler at the brewery. The best malt liquor I’ve ever had, fruitier and quite a bit hoppier than I expected, quite smooth, no sign of alcohol.
Big Time Ave Rat Malt Liquor;Seattle, Washington, United States;Malt Liquor;Big Time Brewery;Sweet aroma with some grain, corn, and a touch fruity. I thought it was almost juicy.

Big Time Ave Rat Malt Liquor;Seattle, Washington, United States;Malt Liquor;Big Time Brewery;On tap at WABL Fathers Day BrewFest 2008. Pours clear gold with a thin white head. Medium body & light carbonation. Sweet aroma and taste of biscuit and almonds, maybe a touch of plastic? Not an everyday drink, but ya gotta do at least one.
Big Time Ave Rat Malt Liquor;Seattle, Washington, United States;Malt Liquor;Big Time Brewery;I had postponed tasting this one as I am not really interested in malt liquors at this point in my life and Big Time always has at least a few decent beers on tap. However, this was a surprising deviation for the style, and had I not known, I would never have pegged this as a malt liquor. It is blonde-bronze in appearance with a foamy-creamy head. Surprising burst of moderately appealing floral and perfumed notes in the aroma mingling with light graininess and alcohol. The flavor reinforces the perfumed-floweriness, with a strong hoppiness. This was akin to a highly hopped cream ale, as it has a smooth, creamy texture.
Big Time Ave Rat Malt Liquor;Seattle, Washington, United States;Malt Liquor;Big Time Brewery;Sample at the pub. Yellow. Holds it head well. Grainy nose. Thick diesel and paint thinner. Almost drinkable.
McMenamins Chocolate Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught at Kennedy school. Tarru black with tan head. Lekker chocolate nose, with notes of hop. Creamy chocolate malt flavour, with notes of roast malt and sugar. Creamy finish, with just a note of dryness and bitterness to keep it from being cloying.
McMenamins Chocolate Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;"On tap at the Kennedy School location; nitrogenated. Deep murky black color with some softer charcoal shades and a tight layer of creamy tan head. Aroma is restrained, but has a soft milk chocolate nose with a hint of vanilla bean. Creamy chocolate mouse and caramel coffee mocha. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel that’s the perfect weight and sweetness for the serving method. The flavors are really well put together on this one. Milk chocolate syrup and malt balls start out softly on the palate, matching the texture perfectly. The flavors transition seemlessly into a bit darker, more interesting ground of anise, brown sugar, and dark dry chocolate notes. Finishes dry with a pleasant smack of minty hops."
McMenamins Chocolate Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Nitro Tap at Rams Head Pub... Poured a deep black with a frothy brown head. Roasted malt aroma, mildly carbonated palate. Flavors of chocolate/mocha coffee, a touch of caramel or brown sugar. Finished silky smooth with a metallic aftertaste.
McMenamins Chocolate Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Had on nitro at the Queen Anne location in Seattle. Dark black w/ ultra creamy light brown head. Light aroma of roasted malt. Roasted malt in the flavor with coffee and chocolate. Pretty darn good. Light and sessionable, but still gives you plenty of taste.
The Rock Lite My Fire;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;On tap at the Federal Way location Clear light golden with a small white head, some lacing. Mild aroma of German malts. Taste is malty and caramel Ok
The Rock Lite My Fire;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;On tap at The Rock. Light pour with little to no head. Aroma is slim to none. Flavor is about the same. A little sweetness here and there. Watery mouthfeel.
The Rock Lite My Fire;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;Pint on tap at The Rock’s Edmonton location pours a pale straw color with a small white head that leaves very little lacing. Aroma is grassy and grainy with perhaps a hint of citrus. Taste is a grassy hop bitterness with a light malty grain sweetness. Not very inviting and not flavorful either.
The Rock Lite My Fire;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;January 29th, 2013 - I sort of knew walking into this line of samplers that I wasn’t going to like what was there. The pizza at this restaurant wasn’t good, so why should the brews? Still, I sighed and dove in, if not for the experience, than for those sweet, sweet beer review counts. The Rock’s Lite My Fire is light and pale, and almost invisible to the nose. The flavor is likewise bland, leaving a foamy palate to step in and define the drinking experience. There’s a little malt in there, but faint and, at this level of intensity, unpleasant.
The Rock Lite My Fire;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;Aroma is a sweet 2 row maltiness with only really the carbonation to add to it. Taste is fairly bland overall. Sweet grain body met with bland hopiness. Light gold body with a poorly retained head.
The Rock Lite My Fire;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;Pale piss color with white head. Light berry fruit, grainy pale malt aromas. Light bodied. Light berry fruit, grainy pale malt flavors--
The Rock Lite My Fire;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;Pour on tap at their location in Highlands Ranch, CO. Clear yellow with no head, aroma had some very slight grain and corn...that’s about it. Taste was fairly watery, some slight biscuit maybe with a hint of grass if you searched, but overall not much going on here.

Chelsea New York Rye Pale Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap at Barcade: Labeled as an IPA. Pours a deep orange topped by a thin off white sheet for head. Somewhat aromatic. Just straight forward American hops, a hint of pine. The body is a bit too carbonated IMO.

Simple, but still somewhat enjoyable.

You can tell there is some rye in this beer, but it really doesn’t jump out like you would expect. Nice bitter finish, with some citrus and pine.
Chelsea New York Rye Pale Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;"Tap at The Brazen Head. Deep golden amber beer with a thin white head. Also listed as ""IPA"" and it probably is more IPA than APA. The aroma is lightly spicy with a light rye spiciness behind the otherwise normal pale ale malt. Not much in the way of crystal malts or other sweeter components. Hops are a bit of a hybrid with a light spiciness but also a fair amount of orange fruitiness. The fruity flavour increases as the beer warms a bit. There is also a light pine/resiny bitterness that I quite enjoy. Soft spiciness on the back and a moderately hoppy finish. Decent brew."

Grain to caramel malts with a solid grapefruit hop presence and underlying sour/spicy rye flavors. Dry hoppy, almost tannic, bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Local freshness apparent. Great recipe and fine execution again from Chelsea."

Olde Main Elkman Milk Stout;Ames, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Olde Main Brewing Co.;Tap at the brewpub. Deep near black body with garnet at the edges. A light khaki head on top. Strongly roasted coffee nose with green beans. There is also some milk chocolate. The taste is like sweet grapes and green apple. There is also a strong sweet coffee finish. This would be good except for the green apple as CanIHave4Beers said about it last year.
Olde Main Elkman Milk Stout;Ames, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Olde Main Brewing Co.;Pours a deep black with a good head and some lace. The aroma is some burnt sugar and caramel with some roastiness and some odd kind of green apple infection. The flavor is more odd green apple with some toastiness and a nice sweetness. There are some coffee tones in there as well. This is basically perfectly balanced and would be exemplary for the style if it weren’t for the odd green apple flavor that really gets in the way of all the nice things going on here.

Clear, dark reddish brown pour with a thick, foamy tan head, soy sauce and chocolate malts in the nose, bitter chocolate throughout, especially in the finish, with some cherry and sweet coffee, a milky, smooth finish.

Diamond Knot Tugboat Small Ale;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Diamond Knot Brewery;"On Tap at the Everett Craft Beer fest Light amber with a small light tan head. Decent light toasted malt aroma, rather bland soft woody flavors. Nothing special, I like the ""second runnings"" idea as a traditional way to get two beers from one mash. But this doesnt quite fly.... or float, I should say."

Diamond Knot Tugboat Small Ale;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Diamond Knot Brewery;Pours medium amber with a small white head. Tastes like unfermented wort, sweet and watery. Not much to it, thin and not much fermented so it tastes flat and watery. Not my thing really, but always fun to try a revived style.

Palate is smooth and semi dry and with reasonable fine carbonation. Slighty thin malts, mildly sweet. A touch of bitterish wet wood. Tangy bourbon. Some ripe orange and marmalade. Quite a dry finish. Interesting. Not the best barrel aged IPA I've had but it's interesting and drinkable.

Columbus Brewing Maibock;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Columbus Brewing Company;Served a golden/amber with mild carbonation and a head that is but a film. Aroma of German nobles over light malts. Low diacetyl in flavor over honey & herbs. Light bitterness to finish. Mid-bodied, but it leaves an unwanted coating over the mouth.

Aromas of caramel, and biscuit mostly. Flavor is very much the same. Slight caramel, a touch of toffee, and lots of biscuit. Slight hops on the finish but not much.

Heavy evergreen spruce hops aroma has thick citrus pulp rind notes. Murky, amber orange body with a quick foamy white head. Light bitter evergreen bark flavour with hints of liquid grainy malt bread. Thick medium body. Seems boozier and heavier than the name implies, but still it is aptly named. (@ NAOBF 2010, Portland, OR)
McMenamins Concordia Ryenosarus;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;2010-06-25. Hazy dark orange body with a modest beige head that fades. 3+ Very green hop aroma, notes of fresh cut grass, and pine needles. 7+ Flavour is fairly hoppy, green vegetation, pine needles, leafy touches. Pleasant bitterness throughout, green hops linger in the finish. Average palate is smooth, lightly carbonated. Nice. On tap at NAOBFestival, Portland
McMenamins Concordia Ryenosarus;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;2007 - North American Organic Brewers Festival – Portland, Oregon Light reddish color with a tint of amber. This was a great Rye ale. Loved the flavors and the deep malts and light hops used. Some light fruit notes with a tad bitter to the finish. Little less hops in the finish would make this a perfect brew. But in all fairness this was a fun and great beer.
West Lake Devon Perry;Beaworthy, Devon, England;Perry;West Lake Cider;bottle from Waitrose Sidmouth (08/2010). Mild, sweetish and very fruity. Quite nice.
West Lake Devon Perry;Beaworthy, Devon, England;Perry;West Lake Cider;Bottle, 500ml. A hazy light pink colour. A slightly floral aroma. Taste is fresh pear with perhaps a hint of rose petals, somewhat sweet but not overly so. Very lightly carbonated. Could do with some tartness to liven things up a little. This bottle was from the first batch of Perry West Lake have ever produced and was described by the brewer as an experiment. I think it’s safe to say that it was successful, and I’ll surely be buying more of this pretty soon. I could drink this all day long, although it is somewhat expensive.
West Lake Premium Organic Cider;Beaworthy, Devon, England;Apple Cider;West Lake Cider;Bottle, 500ml. A deep, hazy golden colour. A light, somewhat sweet apple aroma. Taste is much the same. A slight amount of acidity/tartness. Perhaps a little too much sweetness for my liking, as the apple flavour is somewhat obscured by it. (cane sugar is added). Light to moderate carbonation. This is both artificially carbonated and pasteurised, which probably doesn’t help the flavour much. For a premium cider, this is pretty good - it’s actually more like a cross between a premium cider and a more traditional cider.
Outer Banks Titanic Strong Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;I think this is their best brew except for the lemon grass wheat. The cinnamon and nutmeg spice flavors seem to stand up with some slight acidity along with a fruity flavor and a decent alcoholic kick. The aroma and body could be a bit more pronounced but its a nice diversion from the other offerings, except say the big wine list at OBX.
Outer Banks Titanic Strong Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;My 500th rating, and I wish it were a little better, honestly. Oh well, no worries. Deep amber pour with a surprisingly decent head retention for ABV. The nose is of Belgian yeast and aerated sugars. Unfortunately, the flavors contradict themselves, simultaneously pale (via Crystal) and sugar-syrupy (via Candi Sugar). The mouthfeel waxes and wanes, tugging between the opposing flavors. This palate war leaves a finish that is hollow and almost astringent. As it warms, subtle bitters enter the end of the pull. The body is light for such a heavy offering. It honestly makes me wonder exactly what the brewer was aiming for. I’m not exactly sure I understand the brew. Not a typical BSA, that’s for sure. Interesting for the rate, though.
Outer Banks Titanic Strong Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;A good try at the style. Very sweet fruity taste. The beer is very dark with a small head. The alcohol is evident from the first sip though unlike others of the style. Don’t have too many of these especially in the hot summer.
Outer Banks Titanic Strong Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;snifter at brewpub, Ok aroma, sweet. Malty, caramel, sugary, lite fruitiness. Got a yeasty egginess, some berry/dried fruit, plum & raisin. Dark cloudy orangy brown color. Minor head & lace. Sweet flavor Like aroma, but Has some spice I didn’t notice in aroma, clove, big dose of the candi sugar, little caramel, really notice the 10.2% now. Medium body, smooth creamy mouthfeel, sweet biting finish. ABV again is noticable. I had a tough time finishing this one. I didn’t think the flavors came together well. To me it was like they never blended together and you got bit & pieces of them as you sipped. Oh well.
Outer Banks Poker-face Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On draft at the brewery in Kill Devil Hills NC. Pours a clear dark cola brown with a tan head. Malty nose. Flavors of chocolate and toasted nuts. Velvety mouthfeel. Crisp, dry finish.

Outer Banks Poker-face Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Growler, from brewpub. Nice aroma. Little fruity, grapefruit, little bready. Some chocolate about it. When cold the fruitiness seemed stronger that faded. Clean dark orangy brown color, Good head and lacing. Bitter sweet flavor. Fruitiness still shows up, has a bitter chocolate streak. Medium body, smoooth lite creamy mouthfeel, bitter dryish finish. I like it really like the aroma when cold, lost it as warmed. Classic to style though the Centennial gives it a little extra punch. Nice session brew.
Alehouse Head Full of Marynka;St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Verulam Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the Farmers Boy, St Albans, 8/6/07.

An easy drinking sessionable beer.
Brentwood Canary Beaver;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brentwood Brewing Co.;Cask The 3 Judges. Golden amber colour wit h slight foamy head givng a nice even lacing.

Brentwood Canary Beaver;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brentwood Brewing Co.;3 Judges. Colour fest, wheres the colour? Aroma is super fruity hoppy citrus goodness. Taste is a similar beast more body than expected from a 3.7% ale. The best beer of the nite forsure.

Brabo;Melle, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Huyghe;"For fear of rattling the can one too many times, can breweries please stop abusing the name ""pilsner""? Anyway, this beer pours a pale straw colour, which is topped off with a white fluffy head. Very little aroma, disclaimer though, I have a bit of a stuff nose - some bread, a little hay. Taste wise, mostly grainy sweetness with a dry crisp finish. Not awful, but not a pilsner either."
Brabo;Melle, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Huyghe;Served on draft at Beer Run in Charlottesville, VA. Pours a barely hazy straw color with a large frothy white head. Fair head retention and lacing. Aroma of grainy malts, saltines, faint toastiness and butter. The taste is grassy hops, grain, and an herbal note. Oddly, reminds me of Mexican food. Thin bodied.
Brabo;Melle, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Huyghe;tap at brasserie beck. liked this quite a bit, actually. not sure what’s up with the low marks. crisp. fresh cut grass. creamy. complex. tasty. sessionable. had to go back for a second glass. solid pilsner.
Brabo;Melle, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Huyghe;Sweet hop malt aroma. Clear yellow colour with poor head and lacing. Bitter hop malt flavour. Fizzy palate.
Brabo;Melle, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Huyghe;19 May 2006 - Light fruit spicy malt hop aroma. Clear yellow, reasonable head and lacing. light sweet spicy, but slight stale hop flavour. Thin and hoppy finish. This reminds me of Stella.
Brabo;Melle, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Huyghe;Uh oh, another dumping scam it seems. No other raters apart from Aussies. Is this another case of Caporal punishment being inflicted upon us downundas? So Mr Brewer, what do we have here? Its none other than the hand thrower or Antwerper in the lingo of the land that is Belgian at the sides with great beers. This is not one of them but neither is it a shocker. I have used the term Euro pils many many times here and I believe this is one of them. There is the usual floral nose and metallic taste in a typically light golden body. It is inoffensive enough that it wouldn’t make you huyghe if you had a bit too much of it. The sort of beer you can give to your mate when he lends a hand.
Brabo;Melle, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Huyghe;One of the hazards of beer hunting in Sydney is that anything unfamiliar on the store shelves as often as not turns out to be brewed by Huyghe. The Belgian brewer is as prolific as Ryan Adams, and just as hit and miss. They seem to brew several pale lagers/pilseners with an abv of around 5%, which makes me wonder if this isn’t just Rubbel Sexy Lager without the tits. Regardless, I thought this was better than most of their stuff and quite a fair lager, despite the adjuncts. The aroma was sweet, and rich with corn. There’s some peachy fruitiness but it’s battling rainwater and stale malts. Minimal bitterness. As the aroma implied, it’s sweet and fruity. Quite full-bodied for a lager. Apricots and sweetcorn. More flavoursome than most of the lagers on local shelves. Quenching. Bit metallic but better than expected. (330ml bottle from Randwick Village Cellars. BB Sept 2008)
McMenamins Crystal - Organic Liquid Friend;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;2007 - North American Organic Brewers Festival – Portland, Oregon Golden in color with a light head this had a light aroma. A great session beer with a good balance between hops and malts. A slight citrus notes. A good lawnmower beer.
The Cambridge House Honey Blonde Ale;Granby, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Cambridge House;Nothing too special, but this isn’t my favorite style. Well balanced, just enough malt and hop to make it pleasant but not distinguished. Some light honey flavors that blend well, nothing too sweet or heavy. Very much enjoyable and forgettable.
The Cambridge House Honey Blonde Ale;Granby, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Cambridge House;Draught @ Cambridge House: This one pours a hazy orangish-golden color. There was only a small white head that didn’t linger. It left some lacing. The aroma is definitely on the mild side. There some sweet notes, most likely from the honey as well as some grassiness. The taste is quite smooth. There was some sweetness from the honey, as well as some dryness in the finish. A really nice session beer.
Powerhouse Rauch;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;Tap @ Powerhouse brewpub. Clear amber pour with a minimal white head leaving moderate lace. Smoky, alcohol nose leads into an immediate smoky start which quickly mellows into a pleasant malty body. The medium weight, lightly carbonated body has pepper, toast and faint cherry flavors. I had this rauchbier fresh at The Powerhouse when it was first released in summer ’10 and liked it then despite the marked smoke dominance. It has mellowed beautifully into a coherent, tasty lager. One of the best lagers I’ve ever had and the best rauchbier to date.
Powerhouse Rauch;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;Luminous amber with a slight head. Light bacon nose and just a well-rounded smokiness to the aroma. Nicely smoked body with a middle range maltiness and touches of bacon. Warming quality. Well done and quite enjoyable.
Powerhouse Rauch;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;It’s not often that you can find an easy drinking Rauchbier. Great smoke character and firm malt backbone. Not a quaffer, but definitely a sipper. Smoke is evident but not overdone/overpowering.
Powerhouse Rauch;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled this one on draught at the brewpub in Puyallup, WA. Pours to a bright, deep amber color, with a soapy, white head that fades, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic, with big, pungent, salty, sooty, smoky aromas. The palate is firm, with good, clean, toasty and nutty malt flavors, paired with a really delicious smoky/bacon flavor from the rauch malt. This beer finishes with more really great nutty, smoky, and salty flavor, and then ends with a dry, smoky flavor that lingers. Outstanding, very authentic, domestic example of rauch bier, that pulls no punches. You really get a lot of smoked malt aromas and flavors and this one, so this beer is not for the timid. For those of us who love the style, this beer does not dissapoint.
Powerhouse Rauch;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Appears to be based off a standard Marzen. Aroma is highly smoke forward with just a light touch of sweet malt. Smoke is a bit overpowering, carrying a lot of bacon, maybe even saltiness, and obscuring any hop character. Beer is a clear light copper with a low white head. Flavor is less somkey than the aroma, with an even blend of smoke and roast malt. Flavor is lightly bitter with marginal sweetness. Texture is medium bodied with medium carb feel and a very light finish. Overall an interesting beer, but the smokiness in the nose is just too high. The flavor could use some hoppiness to add balance as well. Worth trying, but you probably won’t have more than one unless it’s paired with just the right dish.
Gahan 1772 IPA;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;IPA;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);Great looking beer with huge head and clear brown body. Aroma is soft hops of no further uniqueness. Hoppy flavour of little complexity but has a bitter lingering finish. Not my favourite kind of ipa.

It poured clear copper with a fluffy off-white head and some lacing. Aroma: brown sugar, sweetened dried citrus, some pine. Flavor: caramel, blood orange, pine resins. Mouthfeel: medium-bodied. I prefer a more bitter IPA, although this is tasty enough if you like malt-forward IPAs.
Gahan 1772 IPA;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;IPA;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);On tap. Pours a clear deep amber with a medium, frothy, long lasting, off-white head that leaves plenty of lace. Sweet aroma of caramel malt, tropical fruit, citrus, floral and pine.

Bushwakker Plum Ale;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;Tap. Lightly malty aroma. Hardly anything else though. Pours almost a maroon colour, thin white head, next to no lacing. Not much plum flavor. Reminds me of the wee heavy just for the sheer malty flavor of the first sip. After that not much sticks out. Some floral notes, a little fruitiness but nothing very distinctive.
Bushwakker Plum Ale;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;(Draught) Lasting creamy white head with a mildly carbonated amber body.

Nose is Lemon, hops, grass and barley. Taste is grassy with a nice bit of bitterness. Lemon and malt in the aftertaste. Slight lingering bitter finish. Too much carbonation and too much grassy/earthyness to it.
Bushwakker Grannys Bitter;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;Bottled sample via paco. Pale amber in colour with moderate carbonation. Aromas of both earthy and slightly floral hops, light malt, and a hint of toffee. Fairly light bodied, with the earthy hops dominating the palate. There’s also a slightly lemony element too. Not a whole lot of malt flavor. Firm bitterness, and a bit too much carbonation. Not exactly a traditional bitter, but still one you could drink a fair bit of and enjoy.
Bushwakker Grannys Bitter;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;(Draught) Thin, creamy white head with an amber body. Nose is nicely balanced of malt and bitter hops. Smooth, tasty palate of maltiness. Great lasting bitter hop finish. One of Bushwakker’s finest.
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours chestnut with a two finger tan head. Aroma is dried fruit and roast. Taste is raisin and light caramel, moving to roast and light nuttiness. Finish is toasty.
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;6 oz. short pour at the source. Little warm for a scotch ale, but I considered it my dessert. Pours a muddled red/brown with a thin beige ring. Light smoky/peat aroma with a buttery maple sweetness. Smokiness almost goes away in the flavor and it’s not as sweet as some in the style. More light maple. Thinner in body than I would have expected. Still quite nice.
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;On draught at the brewery, pours murky brown red, small head. Nose has fairly well integrated smoke notes, some sweet fruit, dried apricot, and light maple spice. However on the palate the smoke is very overly heavy and dominates in an unpleasant way, leading to notes of permanent marker and paint. The finish is sticky campfire, sweet bready maple. Not good.
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;On draft at brewery, ah this one was fantastic the smoked malt added a perfect touch that was just another complete level of flavor
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;Dark Brown pour with amber edges, little to no head. Aroma is very sweet, maple syrup, some booze. Mouthfeel is a bit slippery, syrupy. Flavor is dominated by maple syrup sweetness and a touch of vanilla bean. Full flavored, but lacking the peatiness that I love in this style of ale. Meh, relatively one dimensional but pleasant
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Murky brown with no head. I didn’t much care for this. Like a Scotch brewed for the masses. Mild caramel and really light peat, a whiff of smoke. Mild and uninteresting. Whatever.
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;Draught, sample @ brewpub. Believe this might have been past its prime or just off...Deep dark amber. Aroma of bubblegum borders on putrid. It’s all wrong. The pieces are all there: caramel, vanilla bean, and toffee, but they never come together and it’s thin and unsatisfying. Can sense the potential.
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours a brown color with ruby highlights and a ring of white lace. Strong aroma of toffee and earthy malt. Very good flavor of burnt caramel and earthy malt. The body is light and liquorous while the carbonation is moderate. This scotch ale is not very complex but highly enjoyable.
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;Draft at the brewpub - Poured a cloudy brown/amber in color with a light tan head that held up for a while. Aroma is strong of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of smokiness. Flavor is quite sweet, but not overpowering. Hint of smoke in the background. Alcohol is well hidden. I really liked this beer...
Portsmouth Scotch Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Portsmouth Brewery;(Draft @ brewpub) More nice liquid malt candy from Portsmouth...Served in a tulip. Dark reddish amber body with less than a finger of biege head (as an aside I think Portsmouth falls prone to serving their beers too cold hence the presentation is not what it could be and also some time needs to elapse before one can smell/taste). Aroma is sweet dark fruity toffee and caramel. Mouthfeel is full, smooth and a little sticky. Not really an exceptional palate but something about it still quite inviting. Light, weepy rings of lacing. Flavor is sweet caramel, toffee and hints of dark fruit. Just as I was about to give up on it as actually being a Scotch ale a subtle peat smokiness emerges as it warms. Nicely warming beer but ABV well-hidden otherwise. This is not quite up to the level of their barleywines, Imp stout or mead but still quite a nice sipper. Kind of subtle. Perhaps not a classic Scotch ale but I enjoyed it as a beer.
Portsmouth Short Fuse;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portsmouth Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub, mid-May 2007. Opaque apricot with no head....earthy-piney aroma with plenty of caramel as it warms up, faint English-y hop notes, light dry yeast....light refreshing, citric-hop dominated, moderately sweet at the front but it dries out and dulls a bit too much at the finish....it’s quite drinkable but pretty darn ordinary overall.
Goose Eye Goose Fat;Bingley, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Eye Brewery;Cask conditioned at the North Riding Hotel, Scarborough. ABV was 4.2%. Golden colour, creamy head, nice lacing. Fruity aroma, pineapple, a hint of sulphur. The flavour is reasonably hoppy but not very complex, still okay.
Goose Eye Mild Goose Chase;Bingley, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Goose Eye Brewery;Cask conditioned at the North Riding Hotel, Scarborough. The ABV was 3.8%. Copper coloured beer, creamy light tan head. Malty aroma, notes of toffee. Malty flavour, smooth mouthfeel, some caramel, dry hops in the finish. Okay. I suppose the name of the beer suggests that this is a mild, but to me it’s a typical Northern English malty bitter.

Vinous, yeasty, bready and berryish aroma. Sweetish, yeasty, bready and very vinous flavor with roasty notes, berries, caramel, toffee and port wine. Repulsive yeasty note bothers me.

BrewDog Paradox Grain (Batch 002);Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Stout - Imperial;BrewDog;Imperial Stout which has been matured in specially selected Scottish Grain whisky casks resulting in a complex vanilla overload and a unique whisky and beer fusion. Das Bier im Glas ist tiefschwarz, der Geruch ist typisch für ein Imperial Stout – schön röstmalzig-schokoladig mit leichter alkoholischer Note. Von Whisky keine Spur. Schon der erste schluck ist umwerfend aromenreich und komplex, wie ein guter Whisky – Vanille, Holz und dazu die schokoladige Kaffee-Note vom Imperial Stout. Der Hauptteil wird noch etwas komplexer mit einer leichte, schon dem Whisky sehr nahekommenden Schärfe. Es schmeckt fast so, als hätte man Bier und Whisky gemischt. Dazu eine sehr ausgeprägte Holznote. Nur der Nachgeschmack ist von Seiten des Bieres etwas flach. Es macht den Eindruck, als ob das schöne Kaffee-Schokoladenaroma aprupt abfällt und eine komische Wässrigkeit hinterlässt, die zwar nur kurz anhält, aber irgendwie nicht zu dem schönen milden Holz-Vanille-Whiskyaroma passt, das sich auch im Nachgeschmack schön lange hält. Je länger man den Geschmack auf der Zunge hat, desto weicher wird er – wie bei einem guten Whisky. Auch taucht hier die schöne kaffe-schokoladigkeit des Stout wieder auf und fügt sich sehr toll mit der Whisky-Holznote zusammen. 14+11+13+13
BrewDog Paradox Grain (Batch 002);Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Stout - Imperial;BrewDog;Bottle at home in bonnie Scotland. It pours very dark brown with a small bubbly beige head.

The taste is also rather soft: caramel, chocolate, toast, roasted malt, whisky, wood, vanilla, earth, liquorice, coffee and some dark fruit with a warming bitter-sweet finish. Medium-full body, low carbonation and oily mouth-feel. Very nice indeed. I rather like how mellow and soft these older Paradox’s get with age. Very easy drinking.

Angry Minnow Belgian Wit/IPA;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Angry Minnow;Hope this is the right beer. Bartender said yes, this is the Belgian IPA they a serving, buts it’s very busy . . . Definitely has both characteristics of a Belgian, some barnyard flavor, a bit of citrus, a bit of spice, layered over with some good bitter grass that lingers well. Beautiful golden color.
Angry Minnow Belgian Wit/IPA;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Angry Minnow;On draught, hand drawn at the brewpub in Hayward, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden amber brew with a heavy and creamy off-white head that has an excellent retention and thick lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, some citrus zest but could not pick up any orange or corlander scents. Taste is very smooth, creamy with hardly any carbonation. Flavors picked up are caramel malt and some citrus. Finish has a mild bitterness of most light IPA’s but then has a lingering and slightly sweet citrus aftertaste. The hand drawn draught version of this Wit/IPA is a nice touch.
Angry Minnow Belgian Wit/IPA;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Angry Minnow;"I like witbier, and I like IPAs, so I figured I’d really like this fusion beer (two great tastes that taste great together, right?). And from that perspective, this beer is a bit disappointing...turns out flavors are not quite as additive as I would have hoped. Nonetheless, this beer is as advertised...I thought it to be a witbier with good amounts of clove/coriander spice and a touch of citrus-ness combined with a hearty helping of hops. While I would not categorize it as exceptional in either category, it was a very unique beer and I would still recommend it. The beer smelled exceptional; and the smell indicated that brewery had named the beer aptly, if not very creatively. Taste was a bit dissapointing in comparison...those same elements were present, but they did not meld together as well in my mouth as they did in my nostrils. You could definitely pickup on the wit spiciness and also detect a significant presence of slightly sweet hops, which contributed to the citrus notes in this beer, although not in a way usually assoicated with wits. Mouthfeel was nothing special (good or bad). While I wasn’t sure what to expect from this beer, or what to categorize it as, I did find it very unique. It wasn’t the best tasting beer I’ve ever had; I couldn’t help but think that maybe there was a reason brewers had not previously tried to fuse these two styles together, but nonetheless I thought the resulting product to be more or less what I expected and still commendable."
Petes Place Leftys 363;Krebs, Oklahoma, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Krebs Brewing Company / Pete's Place / Choc Beer;bottle. pale golden with small head. not very funky for a saison, but otherwise solid. light bodied saison with a bit of a grassy, herbal twist.
Petes Place Leftys 363;Krebs, Oklahoma, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Krebs Brewing Company / Pete's Place / Choc Beer;Good saison. Nice pour, clear, orange copper with medium white head. Aroma has some hop presence..grass, pine and citrus. Flavor has components of hops (same as aroma), but also of yeast and malt. Finish is clean and smooth.
Petes Place Leftys 363;Krebs, Oklahoma, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Krebs Brewing Company / Pete's Place / Choc Beer;"On tap. This beer was brewed by the guys at Pete’s and entered into the North American Beer Awards competition under the name ""Summer Saison"" but was changed to Lefty’s 363 in honor of the late, great Warren Spahn. Spahn holds the record for most wins by a left hander in MLB histroy at 363. Spahn owned a ranch just outside of Hartshorne, Oklahoma, a tiny hamlet that neighbors Krebs, the home of Petes Place. The beer itself poured a bit cloudy initially but settled into a nice clear gold and copper color that propped up an ample white head. Generous amounts of lacing. The aroma was of mild citrus and spice with definite bit of herbs/grassy quality underneath. The flavor was citrus and grass. Clean finish. Refreshing. Easy to drink."
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;Got this at Hal's Bottle Shop in Ross Twnshp--north of Pittsburgh. Really get the taste of maple syrup in this! A really good tasting brown ale! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;The beer poured great with a dark reddish hue that passes some light through it, has an off white fomay head, and leaves some lacing on the glass. The smell is decent with a good blend of light caramal malt, toffee and maple sweetness. The beer tastes great as you the maltinepss up front, mild chocolate that gives away to the maple sweetness on the back end, not overpowering but enough to let you know that it is there. The mouthfeel is decent as the beer is well carbonated, medium bodied, and leaves you mildly dry with a sweet taste lingering. Overall, a good red maple ale that blendss together well without overpowering you.
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;Pours a dark copper color. Taste is overly sweet and has a mild nutty flavor. Don’t recommend unless you enjoy really sweet beer.
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Hazy copper pour with a medium off-white head. Malty nose with caramel and hints of apricot. Sweet caramel flavor with a bit of roast in the finish.
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;"Enjoyed via draft at the brewpub. Despite the advertisement of maple syrup being used in the brewing process, little was actually evident in the aroma or flavor of the finished beer; probably due to the fact that maple syrup is almost entirely fermentable. I was disappointed in most aspects of this beer. It was clean, but bland in scent and flavor. I realize that the brewpub is aiming for a wide variety of customers, but I don’t see that as a reason to dumb down styles to the point in which they have little to no flavor and complexity. Try the Paleo IPA instead."
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a dark copper color with a white head. The aroma was lightly fruity and nutty. The flavor was caramel, maple and light fruity hop with nutty malts underneath. The finish was medium length with notes fruit and caramel. Interesting.
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;"This ale is not for the faint of heart. If you like sweetness, but not in beer, ah maybe try something else; otherwise you maybe in for a wonderful surprise. The ale has a nice taste however you may want to limit your intake to maybe one or two pints at the max because the sweetness of this ale is a little out of control. It is worth buying a pint of it for something different."
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;Draft. Body is brownish-amber wih an aroma that promises sweetness and a touch of hops. Flavor is another mater all together. The sweetness is WAY out of control and almost nauseating. Pretty awful stuff!
North Country Copper Kettle;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;A very nice clear beer that has a color slightly darker than the ubiquitous pale yellow american lager. It is a little more brown. About the same color as a yuengling lager. Aroma is slightly hoppy. Flavor is an impact of hops and sweetness. The maple syrup is readily apparent as if it was added after the brew. However, this does not distract from the enjoyability of this brew. Only slight carbonation. The fizziness is medium low but appreciated and present. Finish is barely oppressive, some good personality. A little back of throat bitterness hangs but it is relatively mild.
North Country Cherry Garcia;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;"Pink with rimming offwhite head; aroma is of prescription cough medicine; Flava is not like medicine, it is softly sweet notes of cherry then dry wheat and rounding out with notes of licorice; feels light but foamy fizz; finishes dry notes of wheat and semi tart"
North Country Cherry Garcia;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;Poured on draft at the source. Pours a translucent amber color. White head. Aroma has some definitive cherry notes that give way to a bready nuance. Sweet and fruity cherries initially. Bready finish.
North Country Cherry Garcia;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;Fruit beers are generally hit or miss with me and I consider this a hit. The aroma is strongly cherries. The taste follows with all cherries, but isn’t overpowering. Overall the right balance of sweet cherries without losing sight of that fact it’s a beer.
North Country Cherry Garcia;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Cloudy yellow pour with a thin white head. Creamy malt and cherry nose. Creamy malt flavor with lots of sweet cherries before a semi-dry finish.
North Country Cherry Garcia;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;On tap at North Country. Aroma of cherry Sucrets and pie filling, musky and sweet with some cherry bark. Medium amber haze with light white head. Medium-light body with medium carbonation. Starts mild with light acidity, some beany character, and sweet cherry pie filling. Mild finish, very light overall and finish. Refreshing summer quaff.
North Country Cherry Garcia;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;One of this brewpubs notorious fruit beers. They have some good ones. Has a pinkish champagne hue to this beer. Barely any head tho there is a froth on top. Sweet and sour cherries aroma. The taste is definately cherries, perhaps like cherry flavoring that needs a little sweetner. Is not syrupy sweet by no means and does not taste like a wine cooler, those are sweeter than this. Leaves an interesting lingering cherry taste on the palate. Really has more alky taste than the 4.4% listed here. Finish is quite interesting, at times it seems artificial and at other times it comes on like sour cherries freshly picked off a cherry tree. The cherry flavor seems a bit out of place but I thought this to be a good representation of a fruit beer when compared to others in this style.
North Country Daum Dunkel Weizen;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;North Country Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Good banana clove aroma, sweet with light hops. Simple but very good nose. Clear dark amber with thin head. Medium body with light carbonation. Starts sweet with banana and clove, caramel malt, brown sugar. Smooth finish and after. Sweet and a bit of alcohol. Nice Dunkelweizen.
North Country Daum Dunkel Weizen;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;North Country Brewing Company;Boy, I love those wheat beer, aren’t they something else? This is a little higher on the alky percent scale when compared to many dunkel weizen. Probably should be a dunkler bock. Beatiful milky brown chocolate appearance that must be seen to appreciate! This beer has a head that just does no fade. After a while the froth just stands up on its own. Like a baloon that is slowly deflating. It just stands there like pants that need a good washing. Has a slight vinegary aroma that sticks out at ya. Also, it has hints of a strongish sweetsmelling ale. Wow, quite a wheat. Banana and spices abound in the flavors. Very, very nice and relatively complex. Lovely and friendly. Easy to like even with the uncovered hints of alky that are present. Finish does have some alky bitterness apparent on the back of the throat but is not oppressive or offensive. Just enough to let you know you drank a pretty strong brew. Just a little strong for my girlie taste buds.

NIce mild chocolate nose with sweet lactose and a hint of smoke. Nutty, coffee with molasses. Dark black opaque with thin lacing head. Medium creamy body with light carbonation.

North Country Mothers Milk Stout;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;North Country Brewing Company;Tremendous pour, reminds me of used Harley shovelhead oil. Black and more black opaque. Chocolate mousse head that fades slowly. Good stoutish aroma attracts me to this brew. Makes my mouth water. Has a caution for lactose intolerant drinkers! Good example of a sweet milk stout. Not too bitter. Decent carbonation that is welcomed in this style. Lovely, friendly and easy. Finish is like any sweet stout, just a little of the back throat charcoaled bitterness but not so much that it becomes offensive. Youi know that satisfying taste of meat that was cooked just a little too long on the grill. Would like to sample this again. Just love those no oppressive sweet stouts. Fine examples of dark beer.
North Country Dark Ages Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;North Country Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a black color with a medium sized creamy tan head that left great lacing.

North Country Dark Ages Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;North Country Brewing Company;The description sounds great, but I found this slightly disappointing. It looks great and has hints of roasted chocolate with slight bitterness.
North Country Dark Ages Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;North Country Brewing Company;Black it is, like used shovelhead oil. Pour is black and opaque. Coal black. Looks attractive and has an annessette floral licorice aroma. I think I also detect some chocolate in there. Good schartzbier taste without much offensiveness. Not too bitter. Generally OK without being in your face. Fine example of a dark beer. Can’t taste much chocolate if any. This is an enjoyable brew, very good. Some back of throat bitterness builds on the throat towards the end of the session. This bitterness hangs around for a while after you are finished.
North Country Simcoe Pale Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Country Brewing Company;Had 13 beer flight on a beautiful custom wood flight. Beers overall were solid and the service was great. Nothing extraordinary overall with flight, but most palatable and easy to drink. A few unique beers with honey and lavender. Individual beers as follows: Worth your weight in gold: Lager taste, slight malty feel, plenty of flavor for a yellow clear beer. Nice lager. Slippery rock Dew: Thick in the mouth, honey flavor readily present, fresh and refreshing Station 33:Crisp, caramel malts, simple but enjoyable Mcleods Eva: Smooth, sweet at the end. Light and watery for a malty beer. Less overwhelming, good or bad, then many in the same style Squirel Nut Brown: Good rendition for the style Amber waves of grain: Can really taste the caramel malts. Drinkable. Simcoe Pale Ale: Smells like a christmas treee. Would be nice with a big dinner to cleanse the pallate between bites. Paleo IPA: average IPA Frias Porter: Good flavor bute falls a little short. Root beer flavor at the end Stonehouse stout: On nitro. Guiness feel in the mouth but a bit more boring. Fruit bowl: neat idea, apricot flavor this go around, great summer beer Lavender Abbey: Strong aroma and flavor. Lavender hits you in the face. Polarizing experience.

North Country Simcoe Pale Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Country Brewing Company;This is first visit and I wanted to see how their APA stacked up. The amber color and smallish head was a good start. Some grapefruit and spruce but not the normal bitterness of simcoe hops. Some lemon notes were detected. The ale was smooth but thin without body. Smooth finish again with no bitterness.
North Country Simcoe Pale Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Country Brewing Company;On cask at north country. Pours a hazy dark amber color. Aroma of citrus hops. Taste is very hoppy for a pale ale which I like. This beer is much better on cask.
North Country Simcoe Pale Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Country Brewing Company;On tap at North Country. Super floral Simcoe aroma, sweet with apricot, pine resin and grapefruit. Sweet brown sugary malt. Dark amber clear with some haze, topped with a thin off-white lacing head. Medium body with medium-heavy carbonation. Starts with medium brown sugar sweetness and light grapefruit rind. Quickly descends into a full-fledged hop-heavy assault on the palate, going from fruity to floral to deep teeth-cleansing bitter. Finishes fairly smooth with light biscuit and big biter grassy hops. Nice pale ale.
North Country Simcoe Pale Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Country Brewing Company;Darker than your typical APA and a bit cloudy too. A bit piney or sprucy in the aroma. Has that bitter IPA flavor we are all familiar with, probably should be rated as an IPA. Hoppy taste that just will not quit. Good, grapefruit rind flavors. Bitter back of the throat taste that lasts and lasts and lasts. This brew is a little less acrid sharp than the Paleo IPA, but still has that IPA oppressiveness. IPA lovers, get a growler of this stuff to try.

Crisp medium-full body, chalky coating of the palate along with light bubblegum and briefly intense estery fruitiness, supported by rock solid and juicy pale malt, touch of cereal grain, vanilla, very strong mineral character, some citric sunshine. Clean and thoroughly attenuated, spritzy and repeatable, if just a touch heavy by the end. Just gobsmacked at how well this has held up, don't be deterred if it's been stored properly!

Rock Bottom Orland Park Summer Kölsch;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Mug club draft poured on tap at the brewpub (Orland Park, IL). Served as the Bottoms Up Kolsch though, same recipe though I hear. Pours a nice slightly hazy golden hue, decent whitish head that laces and stays small. Aromas are light, a bit grainy and a bit fruity, the beer doesn’t emanate a lot of aroma character. Initial is light bodied, highly summer sessionable with some fruity character, light graininess, honey sweetness is light, a touch cereal with a faint floral bitterness in the finish. A bit watery, but not a qualm, as it is quenching, a summer slammer for sure. Ok. 5, 3, 5, 2, 11: 2.6.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Summer Kölsch;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Rock Bottom Orland Park;This is the first Kölsch styled ale that I’ve had in a long time that wasn’t a honey bomb, the brewmaster apparently wanting to brew to style rather than pander to non-beer-geek brewpub patrons. It pours a bright yellow body with lively beading and a tall, frothy white head. The aroma is a smooth, somewhat grainy malt with grassy/floral hops. The grassy bitterness builds slightly in the flavor but retains a supportive role in balancing the light malty sweetness. Very smooth and refreshing with a softly bitter finish, this is a sessionable warm weather ale. Rock Bottom Orland Park, Orland Park, IL
Rock Bottom Orland Park Oatmeal Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Sampled on tap at the brewpub (Orland Park, IL). Pours a deep dark blackish brown pour, near opaque, with a small frothy light brown chocolate milk head. Dies to a film, laces small. Aromas are lighter, subtle cocoa and roast with sweet oatmeal, touches of coffee, light toffee, toast, and biscuits. Smooth and lighter. Initial is smooth, lighter end of medium bodied, cocoa up front, sweet oatmeal, some toffee, biscuits, touches of vanilla, creamy on the palate. Some light roast, toast, shortbread cookies. Backend preaches a touch of dry roast, coffee, and a light earthy ashy smoke. Pretty good sweet stout, some roast and earthy ash in the finish grabs me. The beer is lovely, lighter and creamy, with good roast, toast, sweet vanilla and oatmeal, with some cocoa. Pretty good flavor here. Aroma wasn’t great, looks ok, tastes very nice.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Oatmeal Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Brewmaster Iain Wilson nailed the style of slightly dry, nitro-pulled Stout that people in this area seem to like. It’s a tad too softly smooth and fluffy with somewhat muted aroma and flavors for my tates. It pours an intensely dark brown body with an ultra-creamy tan head that laces throughout the drink. The aroma contains lightly roasted malts and a bit of barley, strong cold coffee, and a touch of chocolate that isn’t present in the flavor. It finishes on a dry note. Not bad, but not my mug of beer. Rock Bottom Orland Park, Orland Park, IL
Great Divide Hades;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;"From Aug 2007 Purchased at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins for US$5.99 It pours from 22oz bottle(bottled in May 2007) a clear light gold with a small head of foam that, after about the third sip, all but disappears from my glass but hey, there's some good lacing so it's a trade off. The smell is good. I'm getting some spice, banana, yeast and a touch of hop. The taste has some earthy malt followed by a good banana flavour and some yeastiness and there's a citric zinger about midway through. I started drinking this right out of the fridge so I'm waiting a bit to see what else comes out as it warms up.... Well, it's been a few minutes and I'm getting a touch of clove but nothing else has changed. At this point I'll add that it's quite the smooth drinker and I shouldn't have any problem finishing this bomber. I just finished pouring the rest of this Ale in my glass and there's no sign of any yeast sediment. I was kind of hoping for that. ;^) Overall, I think this is a pretty basic entry into the world of Belgian-Style Ales but I could not see myself not recommending it. It's flavourful and interesting enough to rule that possibility out. Give it a shot and see what you think of it."
Great Divide Hades;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;On tap at Great Divide, pours a clear blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out candied sugar, Belgian yeast and light fruity esters. Flavour is on the sweeter and estery side, with candied sugar, Belgian yeast, and estery notes.

Great Divide Hades;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;Bottle from Payless Liquor, where you definitely do not pay less for anything. Pours a golden body with almost no head. Nose of sour citrus, vanilla, and bread. Flavors include banana and cheese plus the others in the aroma. I may have to let this settle a bit because I’m getting an astringent alcohol bite all around the body. Light body and medium/full carbonation. As far as Belgians go, this is no where near the best I’ve tried, but it’s drinkable.
Great Divide Hades;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;33 cl bottle @ Delirium Cafe, Brussels Aroma has apricot, moldy cellar tones and cardboard. Flavour has apricot, spicy tones, some moldy cellar and sweetish toffee. Quite well preserved, I like the spices here.
Great Divide Hades;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;Perfectly clear dandelion yellow. No bubbles. Large bubbles of head explode and leave what looks like a foamy white mountain range. The head recedes to a layer of film that leaves slight lacing. The aroma has bright floral hops, slightly metallic, with hints of apples and pear. The flavor tarts sweet with notes of citrus and grass dominating. There’s also some spicy yeast in there, and a high hoppy bitterness throughout, but more so at the finish. Medium-light mouthfeel, pleasant carbonation level -- it’s not too intense, just lets you know it’s there. Enjoyable? Sure. Memorable? Not so much.
Great Divide Hades;Denver, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Great Divide Brewing Company;Here is an oddly named Belgian golden ale. Lightly lemony with a good amount of wheat malt/hefeweizen flavor. Pale pour with lacing, and a mild sour-sweet aroma. Another good GD release.

Like the commercial description says, this is drinkable and not overly charged. The beer has a nice malty aroma and flavor. It’s got a slight strong aftertaste that lingers, but is pleasant tasting.
BJ's Portlander Weisse;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Berliner Weisse;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On draught at Belmont Station.

Mild and true to style. The perfect warm-weather beer. Great great great!
BJ's Portlander Weisse;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Berliner Weisse;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Draught at Belmont Bier Cafe Puckerfest. A 2-year-old keg. This is the age at which Berliner Weisse is reputed to hit its stride, and my experience with Schultheiss at least backs that up. Cloudy, pale yellow. Very wheaty nose, slightly tart lime and wood accents. Moderate tartness on the palate and a clean light maltiness. Not a ton of nuance. On the whole this is a mild but authentic rendition...good to see it.

Lightning Ionizer Lager;Poway, California, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Lightning Brewery;Bottle from South bay Drugs. Created a fat development of foaming with a straw blonde golden color upon the eye. The nose was empty with only a small mention of hay and grass. The flavor was bitter and bold of grassy malt grains and Euro styled hops. Overall impression of this lager was that the taste resembled a marzen but that was just a hunch of mine.
Lightning Ionizer Lager;Poway, California, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Lightning Brewery;This has a faint aroma. Interesting, beer is a bit sticky. Has quite a malt flavor at the beginning with a bit of hops at the end. Pretty good stuff.
Lightning Ionizer Lager;Poway, California, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Lightning Brewery;If you like high-quality malt liquor, you’ll find the Ionizer ironically iconic--if a bit on the high side price-wise. Good, strong stuff with a nice balance. Since I live just a stumble, stagger and a slide from the brewery--I’m gonna’ go to the tasting room this Friday and get a growler of the stuff, take it home and drink it til’ I forget about the pain of life. Then I’m a-gonna quaff some more--just for the sake of art!

Max's Farmers Daughter;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;Draft at Oregon Brewers Festival, Portland, OR. White head that mostly lasted, spotty lacing, no visible carbonation, hazy, and a straw hue. Nose was malty, lightly hoppy, crisp, coriander, fruity, and a hint of spicyness. Ditto for the flavor. Smooth mouthfeel. Very, very quaffable, nicely done, quite tasty, and I definitely would partake in this brew again if it were to come my way. Absolutely worthy of a try!
Max's Farmers Daughter;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;A light colored Belgian strong ale. Slightly sour and crisp with bright spicy notes. Great complex finish with lots of fruitiness from malts and yeast. The hops give it a unique PNW feel, too.
Max's Farmers Daughter;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;This draft brew from the Oregon Brewers festival poured a head of foamy fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a hazy and a fair lacing. The aroma was floral bready musty mild hop and fruity. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt hops fruity and floral. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Max's Farmers Daughter;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;A very nice crisp belgian style golden. Coriander and a good hop balance allow this beer to be strong while being very refreshing. Like a saison with no wild funky yeast.

Max's IPA;Tigard, Oregon, United States;IPA;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;Keg at the brewpub, 11/11/14. Lightly hazed golden amber with a decent beige covering. Nose is thin, light hops, caramel, orange, straw. Taste comprises muted grapefruit, mandarin, straw, vanilla, malty. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close. Low quality IPA, perhaps they’ve changed brewer/recipe since the previous reviews of some 4 years ago don’t put it in this camp. Kind of formulaic mon and pop family diner brewpub affair and a poor one of these at that!

Nice dark amber with plenty of head and lacings. Nice floral hop aroma and flavors. Plenty of roasted malts to almost match the hop flavors. Nice beer!

Max's Nit Wit;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;The perfect summer beer (well, that or Max’s pilsner). Crisp,straw colored, slightly bitter, and uber-quaffable. This is a lawnmower beer of the sitdown variety.
Max's Nit Wit;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;Lots of corriander and orange peel give this a very floral spicey aroma and flavor.

Max's Golden Ale;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;For those who prefer ales to lagers, here’s a sessionable summertime delight.

Max's Political Pilsner;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;I had a Pilsner on tap at Max’s Brewpub. I don’t think it was named Political Pilsner nor was that name on the beer menu. The Pilsner I had was much closer to an Amber in overall flavor but it was lighter in color. The abv was listed as 6.7% which was a surprise too. A tasty pint it was but a bit high on the alcohol for a session beer.
Max's Political Pilsner;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;Crisp and dry pils, refreshing and clean. A bit too much body, but it’s not excessive on the palate, only feels a little heavy for a pils. It’s rare to find good lagers in town, this is one of the better ones.
Max's Stout;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Stout;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;I know it was the first batch of this stuff, so i’m sure it will improve over the next few batches. This stout felt like it lacked a bit of body and felt watery on the palate. Good roasted chocolate flavors with a touch of coffee in the finish. With a bit more body this will be excellent. Pours a deep black with a smooth tan head, this will be a staple of this place.
Max's Smoked Marzen;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;The smoke kept this beer going for its 1 year old life. While thin and slightly watery on the palate, the smoke gives this beer a lot of character. I generally enjoy smoke beers, so I was quite supprised to find this on tap. This new brew pub is making some very complex styles of beer in the Portland area. This beer might be a bit passed its prime, but still holds some good flavors.
Max's Belgian Trippel;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Tripel;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;The 1 year of age has really given this trippel a malty edge to it. Too malty for a tripel, and the carbonation was a bit low, so the esters from the yeast were more subtle, but still a very enjoyable beer.
Max's Fanno Kreik;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;I found the framboise had more depth to it, the Kriek tasted a bit thin and oxidized. Great dark cherry flavor none-the-less. Slighlty passed its prime it was affected by the wet-paper oxidized taste that overtook the oakiness and sourness a bit.
Max's Framboise;Tigard, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;Aged in a barrel for 1 year, that is hard to find in the PNW. This turned out very well, like a good find out of a Belgian cafe. Tart and complex, with a medium sour finish to really get the mind going. Earthy and oak mix with a sweet raspberry flavor. Estery, dry, and sour in the finish.
Max's Gluteus Maximus;Tigard, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Max's Fanno Creek Brew Pub;Yah, not to often you find a 3 year old barleywine on tap, and when you do you expect to pay more then 3.50 or so for a glass. This beer was just incredible, big rich flavors that have gained a lot of character over the years. The 11% ABV doesn’t show at all in the flavor. Bready and a big melted caramel flavor up front, warming you up inside. Chocolate and notes of port in the finish. Here’s to hoping they have another keg to release next year for the 4 year old version.
Water Street Radler;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Radler / Shandy;Water Street Brewery;A summertime brew from Water Street. Poured a hazey golden colour, little to no head and scattered lacing.

Water Street Radler;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Radler / Shandy;Water Street Brewery;Surprised to see only one rating for this beer. It is on tap at the brewery. This is a very nice summertime beer and could quench a thirst easily. It looked and smelled pretty much like a wheat beer. Honey and lemon flavors stood out. I do like a good wheat beer.
Water Street Radler;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Radler / Shandy;Water Street Brewery;On tap at Water Street - Delafield. Poured a hazy, ugly yellow with no head sticking around. Sweet toasty banana and some darker sugars in the aroma.. not complex, but quite nice. The flavor was sweet again with banana and tangy lemon notes.. there were some residual, ugly floral notes at the finish.. some vegetal notes too. Tangy and sour notes accented the sweetness quite well.. lighter-bodied and slick on the palate.
Keweenaw Sandy Bottom Session Ale;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Keweenaw Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Aroma is pleasingly nuanced and enjoyable with subtle fruits dashed with honey, whole grain cereal and plain fruits. A bit of sea salt plays in. Yet, still a little held back. Pours a pale amber, on the brass side of the color, with a rim of sparse white. Flavor begins in refreshing gentle tones of honey toasted oat, maple syrup and plum, backed by a chorus of alcoholic brightness and some nips of sugar. Round and enjoyable. Palate bulges with some hop matter and a crisp lemony sensation develops through the background. Heavily drinkable and a real stunner for the season right now.
Keweenaw Waterfront Wheat;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Keweenaw Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Aroma tickles forth with a hexanous blast of tires and latex, confused with Indonesian raspberry candies. The traditional aromas get muddled with raspberry sauce and make a bit of a mess in the nose. Pours in murky pale orange, tinted rose and metallic in the corners. Head blushes. Flavor is a menagerie of banana, fruited chocolate, malt, candied raspberry gelato and some malt base. Acerbic and dry, seemingly well attenuated enough to stay away from stickiness. But it’s an awkward pairing, trying to blend Hefe phenols with the spritzy sourness of Framboise. Seeds and hop dust dry out the backend. Peculiar interaction of raspberries and wheat oil. I feel as if these brewers have some good ideas and try unique pairings, but don’t make the point of executing them well. Much like the Mogiana Malt, I think this could have been a winner, if they’d honed the Raspberry character and restrained some of the yeast products. Malt quality suffered. But, the spritzy bright lemon of the Hefe works. Really, as a fruit beer it’s above the majority of the field, for staying clean, unique, drinkable and not getting sickly sweet.
Sequoia Moto Brew Belgian Wit;Fresno, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sequoia Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of Irishboy. Pours a cloudy, light golden color with a white head. Head lasts a long time. Has a medium mouthfeel. Smells like yeast and oranges. Has a slight tart taste to it with yeast, orange, and fresh flowers. Is highly carbonated. Overall not a bad brew.

Sequoia Moto Brew Belgian Wit;Fresno, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sequoia Brewing Company;12oz bottle acquired in trade with odeed (thanks!).

Sequoia Moto Brew Belgian Wit;Fresno, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sequoia Brewing Company;Slightly sour citrus aroma with cardamom and other spice? Hazy gold color with lots of bubbles and a persistent white head. Near medium body with creamy/fizzy carbonation. The flavor is citrus, pale malt and some spice.

Man this is some bubbly stuff. Sediment floating around and settled to the bottom after a little bit. Smells yeasty with a little spice. Initially has a lot of lime in the flavor. after warming it has a nice amount of spice present. Not very sweet at all. Very lively carbonation. Has a sour finish that I liked but I don’t think it’s typical for this style. I haven’t had a lot of belgian whites but this is an enjoyable beer.
Sequoia Moto Brew Belgian Wit;Fresno, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sequoia Brewing Company;(Bottle) Pours a murky yellowish maize body with an average white head.

Sequoia Moto Brew Belgian Wit;Fresno, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sequoia Brewing Company;Bottle. This one is very well made. The pour is turbid yellowy canary with 3-fingers of white head and clingy lacing. Smells of clovey spices, estery yeast, hopcitrus, and some perfumy floral wafts. The taste is clovey, citric, with solid malt, hops, honey, and perfumy florals in the finish. Very complex, smooth, crisp, and flavorful, this is a fabulous wit.

21st Amendment Double Star;San Leandro, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;21st Amendment Brewery;On tap at brewpub. Half pint. Light pine and spicy peppery hops present in the nose. Decent amount of modestly sweet malts present, too. Moderately hazy amber body with a small, fleeting off-white head. Peaty maltiness to start, becoming a little sweeter and toffee-like in the middle. Finishes with a nice spicy hop kick. A little cold and a bit too carbonated. Tasty, though. This would be killer on a hand pump.

Lighthouse Brewery Cheeky Little Lager;Nelson, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);Draft. Light body, syrupy and thin, low bitterness. Massive dose diacetyl with some saccharine nutri-sweet and rice cake malt... seriously it’s like you stuck your nose inside a microwave popcorn bag.

Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;One of those ’didactic’ ales for hopheads featuring one single hop variety each time (Mikkeller, Alvinne and others have done the same thing before or after this American-style English brewery). Pretty orange blond beer with loose, off-white head and soft pale maltiness, but of course it’s the hops that stars, spicy, citrussy and herbal, ensuring a long, very agreeable finish. Great brew - and obviously a stimulus to try and find all versions.
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;I have to say this is probably the best beer I have had. I tried it several times at the Oxford, Kentish Town, as well as at a private party. It has an aroma that hits you long before the glass reaches your lips. The main characteristic I can give it is grapefruit, although I have had other beers with presumably this hop which were too much like grapefruit juice, not what I want in a beer! Couldnt get enough of this and downed many pints!
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival, September 2007. Supposed to be the One Hop beer for May/June 2007 but here it is in September, and Grand Union hasn’t published the running order since August so I don’t really know what is going on with the One Hop series. Anyway, this is a mid gold beer with a loose white head. Lashings of leafy, spicy Simcoe on the nose. Lots of grapefruit and resinous notes in the flavour, although perhaps marginally more laid back than the aroma, with just a hint of biscuity malt. The mouthfeel is crisp, sharp and refreshing. Showcases the Simcoe hop brilliantly in a UK context. Not sure why they repeated this one but I’m sure glad they did.
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;"Cask. At The Wenlock Arms, London. Oh, my - after a week and a half of pretty much nothing but bitters and ESBs, this was quite a welcome change; Golden Ale? Not by half - try IPA, mate! Poured clear gold with an average creamy/frothy lasting white head. What an aroma - lush, acidic, full-on Simcoe resin/lemon funky bitter hoppiness, just enough mild grainy malt to remind you there’s more than hops to it. Taste - well, the malt was more pronounced, definitely fresh cereal grain, strong hops but more evenly balanced than in the aroma. The body seemed light but had that wonderful cask chewiness to it, solidly astringent and high in alpha acidity, with a very long, tenacious hoppy finish and aftertaste - simply terrific, IMHO."
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;(cask - Coastguard, St. Margarets Bay) pale gold with dense white head, some lace. Citrus hops aroma. Great Simcoe hops flavor. An awesome cask ale.
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;"Gravity, Merton Beer Festival. Bright gold, lots of dense white foam. A stunning clean and bright hop expression; piney, catty, grapefruit hop goodness, reaching out of the glass to slap your face and assert respect. Catty carries over to the flavor, adding cinnamon and mineral. Mouth filling, nose tingling--a really serious hop punch-up at 4.5%! Just enough light toast to counterpoint the hop expression. I suppose it’s odd that the most genius expression of all-American Simcoes I’ve had is an English beer, but maybe not. At any rate, this is it. I’m pining for more..."
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask at Merton. In excellent nick, congrats to Fin. A stunning single hop beer. Perfect for a day outside listening to bands, eatting dodgy burgers. The flavours just went on and on.
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 06-07-07. What a stunner. For me when I had a sneaky taste of this well before we opened this beer and the Bowman Quiver were always likely to be fighting it out to be my favourite, but what a contrast. In the Red corner was the Grand Union Simcoe a beer that was looking for the big knockout it was an out and out impact beer that was exciting, vibrant and a big hitter. In the blue corner was the Bowman Quiver equally exciting but more prepared to go the distance and seeking to come out on top on points, on this occasion the Grand Union Simcoe come out on top but for all it’s attributes it was taken quite a long way by the Quiver. This beer poured golden with a superb clarity, the hoppy nose hit you straight away stunning aroma of grapefruit. The taste just zapped you wow what a zapper the citrus just smacked home, and it didn’t stop there that grapefruit and bitterness just kept on lingering, christ you get your moneys worth with this little beauty you can still taste it for ages afterwards. It reminded me of the old ’You’ve been tangoed advert’, with this beer you really had been Simcoed, it seemed like someone had came up with a half of hollowed out grapefruit and then proceed to rub it all over one’s face and stuff it in the mouth before legging it. I warned people to be wary of what they drank after this as you really needed something that would counteract that bitterness afterwards, when I initially tried this on Thursday I had a couple of more standard gentler bitters after which were totally ruined by this as the bitterness from the Simcoe was still evident in everything I drank, you needed a porter or the Smokestack Lightning after I felt. A truly great bitter, it’s just a shame that it will only be around for this month. This was [b] joint Beer of the Festival along with Bridge of Allan Red Mist [/b]
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask conditioned at Merton Beer Festival ’07. Amber with white head. For me, the beer of this Festival, beautiful hop aroma, I think the first time I have given a 10 for aroma. I wrote hops **** at the time and why change it, I like what this brewery does in presenting the different ingredients like this. Lemony, grapefruit, dusty and magnificent.
Grand Union One Hop: Simcoe;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;A Mes rate: Cask at the Wenlock. Cracker. Obviously it is all about the hops. Frankly I like the sharpness of the Simcoe. So crisp it almost stings. Lovely dust old character to it. Obviously all the citrus fruits you can think of are there in abundance. Loads of character and gloriously drinkable.

Manhattan Beach India Pale Ale;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;IPA;Manhattan Beach Brewing;This is a pretty good IPA, tasty and well-rounded. It seems a little on the softer, less hoppily pungent side for a West Coast IPA. It is amber with a thin, somewhat off-white head. This slowly shrinks to leave a ring and wispy top plus some pretty nice even rings of lace. The aroma is malty and fruity, a bit juicy, with hints of pine, lemon, grapes and honey. The taste is similar, malty body and fruity sweetness with som wine and grain plus a hint of cracker. It has light, just dominant pine-citrus hop character and bitterness that lightly takes over the finish. Its’s smooth, tasty, has balanced, fairly full flavour and a good character breadth.
Manhattan Beach India Pale Ale;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;IPA;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Draft at the brewpub. Probably my favorite of the trip. Decent hop aromas off this amber colored beer. Citrus nose gave way to more floral and grassy flavors. Nicely hopped. Very Decent.
Manhattan Beach India Pale Ale;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;IPA;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Tap @ brewpub: Clear gold with a nice off-white head & sticky lacing. Sweet perfumy hop aroma, but the question I have to ask myself and the brewer at Manhattan Beach is: Is this a pale ale? Because it sure seems like it. The hop presence is mild and kind of papery. More like a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The body is full and like a good pale ale, it has a fairly bitter aftertaste. they need to double the hops in this to make it a real standout IPA.
Manhattan Beach India Pale Ale;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;IPA;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Draught at the pub 03/2008. Floral hops lacing whitish head copper hued golden. Nice sweet full hops bitter finish. Light bodied. Nice IPA.

Manhattan Beach India Pale Ale;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;IPA;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Filtered gold, lingering small head and mild hop aroma. Strong, flavorful hops.

Manhattan Beach Chocolate Porter;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Porter;Manhattan Beach Brewing;On tap at brewery, 01/07/08. Hazy brown. After sitting for a few minutes, the strange soda style head is gone. Light aroma of chocolate. Hard to say it any other way, but it has a mild proper porter flavor. Oddly, I didn’t taste any chocolate. Bitterness appears late in flavor. A bit boring.

Celestial Meads Clarity;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Mead;Celestial Meads;This had a very unique texture and taste on the palate. A lot of residual sugar and fruitiness, a bit of eucalyptus, and a slightly menthol character, but not heavy at all on the palate. I am not sure I could drink a lot of this but I loved trying it.

Celestial Meads Rubyfruit;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Mead;Celestial Meads;Sampled several times at the ’11 GABBF. Still with a reddish hue. Nice raspberry jelly aroma. Sweet honey, natural raspberry and sour cherry fruit flavors. There is some cinnimon candy heat. Very nice drink.
Celestial Meads Rubyfruit;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Mead;Celestial Meads;The raspberries are very well highlighted in this one. A little bit on the tart side, as I was expecting something a little sweeter. and this is quite spicy, and sour. Still very well done and clean, but I honestly think this could stand to have a bigger honey background, and back off on the fruit a bit. I cannot say for sure, I am just one person talking, and I do not have a lot of experience with melomels.
Celestial Meads Rubyfruit;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Mead;Celestial Meads;If you favor fruit forward melomels, this one’s for you. Liquid raspberries in a glass with a touch of honey stirred in. These raspberries come from the fertile slopes of the Talkeetna Mountain Range, in the shadow of Denali. This mead is fun just to look at! Brilliantly clear, radiant, light violet color. Highly reflective meniscus, two ring variance. Heavy, organized legs quick to fall straight down the glass. The full-bodied, smooth, and viscous mouth-feel confirms what the legs are telling you. Spicy, peppery, raspberry aroma with minty, eucalyptus undertones that when combined seems a bit medicinal. Not much honey apparent on the nose. A tangy, acidic, and tart raspberry flavor hits the center of the tongue and hangs there forever. Honey makes a guest appearance after the raspberry diminishes. This mead has a clean, bright, fresh raspberry fruit flavor, but backing off on the fruit would allow the honey to come forward and add more balance. This is a sweet mead but not cloyingly so. Do not mistake this for a dessert only mead. It can hold its own. The fruit flavor dominates and although the fruit flavor is excellent, it leaves the mead somewhat one-dimensional, wonderful, but not particularly complex. Nothing wrong with that.

Somewhat hoppy, lightly sweet, bitter finish Palate: Smooth and very creamy mouthfeel, with a soft carbonation, and a long, dry finish Overall Impression: Good, solid beer. The pour is the standout, and the creamy feel makes it rather enjoyable. The rest of the components are solid, but nothing spectacular.
Egan & Sons IPA;Montclair, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Egan & Sons;on tap at the pub. lightly cloudy brownish rusty golden color, short light tan head. aroma is pretty straightforward, moderate hops like a little pine cone and grapefruit. flavor is pretty much the same, with a bit os lightly sweet earthy malt for balance. nothing inspirational, but a decent session beer.
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Draught (Busch Gardens, Tampa): Pours medium golden with a 1.5 inch white head that lasts 5 minutes. Aroma of a good skunky pils, with malt and saaz hops overpowering. Flavor is bitter and sweet/skunky and a little gummy. Medium body with above average carbonation. Finish is toasty malt, and bitter.
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Too light and a little watery, I guess the sunky aroma turned my off, I ’m not much of a pilsner fan anyway
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Okay.. very thin appearance, with a slightly skunky aroma.. Flavor: almost none. Palate: comparable to water. Uh...yea.. But its Bohemian!!!! woo-hoo!!
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Sampled at GABF 2007. Clear fluorescent yellow with a synthetic head. Slightly grainy aroma. Water bomb thinness. Perhaps a breif dunking of a teabag full of hops into each bottle, but other than that, I’m not sure how this differs from their other gazillion barrel madness.
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Draught into Tarpon Spoon footed pilsner on holiday. Not bad for A-B. Notes of citrus in aroma with a clean crisp flavour.
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I feel bad rating this beer because i had it on a crisp winter’s night and not a hot summer afternoon, so it really felt out of season as i consumed it. Pours a very pale color with medium head. Aroma is pleasant and mildly floral. Could have wished for a more prominent flavor and aroma but the palate is smooth. Drink this when its 80 degrees plus outside to appreciate it fully. Also disappointed to realize that its produced by AB and not locally brewed (for me at least) in Tarpon Springs, Florida.
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On tap in the Hospitality Room at the A-B Brewery, Jacksonville Florida. Clear golden yellow beer with a medium white head that fades after a short while. Light floral hop aroma. Flavor is lightly sweet pale malts, with a good hop flavor, then a clean finish. Fair amount of carbonation. Not spectacular or memorable, but certainly drinkable and decent.
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Draft... Clear yellow lager with a mid-sized, frothy, white head that’s... zap!... gone in a flash. Sweet, grainy nose and flavor. Lightly hopped to cut into the sweetness and provide a tiny hop zing. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Short, crisp, refreshing finish. Went well with raw oysters and dolphin fish.
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On tap at Don’s in Metairie, LA. Served in a frozen mug. This beer was very refreshing, but just not much flavor. A good summer beer. It really tasted like much of the mass produced beer in the U.S. but worth a try.
Tarpon Spoon;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On tap at Hurricanes in Orlando. Served in a frozen mug, so much of aroma was non existent. Nice golden color nonetheless. Nice roasted malt taste with a good balance of hops. Not bad, even after finding out it was an AB product.
Emerald Hill Stout;South Melbourne, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emerald Hill Brewery;"Dark brown with a reddish tinge. Thin creamy mocha coloured head on pouring but disappears almost instantly. Mild roast and chocolate on the nose; milky chocolate perhaps. Not bad. Smooth palate, chocolate and dry roast early, but flavours do fall away somewhat. Looks like a stout at first glance but doesn’t really have the stuffing."

San Diego Mission Trails Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Diego Brewing Company;Aroma is mild citrus and perfumey hops. Poured red/gold with a nice small head. Flavor is mild crisp citrus hops with not alot of malt. Was very carbonated and had a strange after taste that I couldnt put my finger one.

Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;16/VIII/09 - 75cl bottle, shared with my parents and parents-in-law-to-be, during our engagement dinner party @ De Heeren Van Liedekercke, as a gift for our engagement by the owners. Clear amber coloured beer, no head (from picture). Not a lot of details about the aroma or smell, but it was definitely very refreshing, drunk as aperitif in the hot summer sun. Very nice beer.
Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;Bottle @ De Heeren. Pours clear golden with a white head. Aromas of citrus, apples, mouldy dust, apricots, leather, heavy funky cheese. Taste has lots of tart fruity notes. Unripe plums, red apples, gooseberries, cheese, light mouldy dusty cellar, sweet oak. Very different gueuze compared to the older Lindemans I've tried - and very good for its age!
Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;Bottle thanks to Doug. Pours out golden straw color. Nose is funky sour horse blanket barnyard notes and lemon citrus. Tatse is more of the nice dusty barnyard funk bugs and lemon zest.
Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;Bottle @ dhvl. Pours clear golden/Cooper with a white head. Aroma of vinous grapes, dust, cheese, slight Apples, wet hay, slight note of Glue. Taste is sour, light sweet, stonefruits, vinegar, some wierd cheesy - hay alike notes, along with a barnyard thing which was a bit odd. Good condition and good beer.
Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;Bottle @ De Heeren van Liedekercke. Vintage 2000. Clear amber with a white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, barnyard and lemon. Flavor is medium sweet and rather acidic. Dry and rather acidic finish. 190317
Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;75cl bottle to cap the DHVL visit. 2010 vintage. Not the easiest of beers as body is oily and flat and flavours are complex and musty. It pours a clean rich golden color with no head. Aroma is musty and sweet with some oxidation, notes of basement, mold, complex. Taste is semi-sweet with notes of red berries and mostly strawberry jam. There’s also the same basement and mold funky notes as per the nose. Some caramel sweetness and leather notes, too. Overall, very interesting to try, but I would prefer the regular Gueuze to this Loerik version
Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;Bottle, massive, massive, massive, massive, etc....thanks to Brian for tracking this down and trading for it and then offering to bring it. Wow, talk about beers you never thought you’d have a prayer to try! Shared on 10/8/16. Wonderful condition, actually showing a moderate amount of carbonation at this point, the yeast/bacteria having perked up, as it goes. Deep, copper-bronze-golden hue as is characteristic of Cuvee Rene. White head showing light retention. Good clarity. Brings me right back to the hayday of Cuvee Rene. It’s still a good gueuze, but recent vintages are nothing like the best late 90’s and early 00’s I’ve had. This one recalls the glorious horseblanket, light cheese, big brett fruitiness and light apple, strawberry, pear qualities. Throw in some moderate lactic character, no alcohol or flaw and you’ve got yourself a beer in wonderful shape and probably easily drinkable for many years to come. Soft, tightly carbonated texture with malt and wheat providing additional softness and light honey. The brett fruitiness outdoes the lactic sourness and there is a plethora of light band aid, horseblanket, dried hay and other various barnyard qualities. Cellar mustiness quite reserved and as it warms and breathes, the big fruitiness continues to emerge. To me this seems like just another fine vintage of Cuvee Rene (which is, after all, exactly what it is), so nothing particularly weird/interesting/different here than if you’d opened a great 1998 or 2000 Cuvee Rene. But still every bit as nice as those.
Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;Bottle thanks to 4lo. Grana Padano share - pours gold white head - nose/taste of farmhouse horseblanket, orange rind, funk, lemon - medium body

Hazy, golden orange body with a thin cap that quickly fades to nil. Dank, musty funk, basement. Age has served this beer well. Super silky on the palate. Notes of strawberry, lemon, and kiwi. Delicious.
Lindemans Oude Lambik (Loerik);St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Lindemans;Poured from a bottle at DHVL. Aroma is very earthy and herbal with a light woody note. A light spiciness to it with moderate oak notes. Light acidity. A touch of citrus and a light cork note. Pours a fairly clear golden color with some copper hues and some orange with a medium small, thin white head. Flavor has a light sweetness with some light caramel and butterscotch notes. Some medium light oak notes. A nice herbal character with some earthiness and a bit of wood. Low bitterness. Medium acidity with light citrus and tropical fruit notes. Nice herbal, earthy notes that add a touch of spice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a better beer than I was expecting. The beer is still lazy, but has great woody and earthy notes. A bit of a cork note, but not corked. Since I can’t try the Cantillon Loerik I thought I would drink this one.
Michael Festbier;Weissenstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Privatbrauerei Michael;The bottle looks good, the beer in the glass also. Starts much too vapid, artifically sourish, very light hoppy notes. Nothing special!

Goose Island Reserve Trippel;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Tripel;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Beer Bistro. Transparent bronze, with some head. Sweet aroma and malts. Starts off smooth, hints of spices, malts, pines and sugar. nice mouth feeling, nothing too bitter nor tangy here. gentle carbonation and finish. Quite surprised at 7%, not noticable. Not like other Abbey Tripels I’ve had, too soft and plain in taste.

Goose Island Reserve Trippel;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Tripel;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);(Jun 07) Tap at Clybourn, served in Reserve glass: Slightly hazy deep golden hue with a small frothy head and some lace. The aroma is sugary with mango and pear esters, clove like hop spice, earthy and woody vapours as well. The taste is fruity sweet at first supported by a grainy midsection and a moderate hop spice finish. The mouth feel is warming and smooth, lush and dry finish. I found this quite good but just short of newsworthy.
Goose Island Reserve Trippel;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Tripel;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);This poured a slightly hazed golden amber with a modest white head. No lacing. The nose was sweet, fruity (citrus and cherries), and spicy, with a touch of PNW hopping. Fairly light bodied, the sweet pale malt has a nice blend of fruit and warm spices to back it up, the alcohol barely being present in the taste. It finishes on a sweet and peppery note. Better than GI’s previous tripels. Goose Island - Clybourn, Chicago, IL
Goose Island Reserve Trippel;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Tripel;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at GI - Clybourn. Poured a lightly hazy medium golden with a short cap of white head. Aroma was like a very good APA upfront with sweet candied grapefruit and pine.. white pepper and cloves accent and get stronger with warmth. The flavor had a great foray of sweet pine and grapefruit with white peppery spices and cloves washing over it.. heavier on the back-end with the spices taking over.. rather sweet overall with a long spicy finish. Medium-bodied with more sweetness on the front-end and more spices at the back-end.. decent balance.. some sharp notes at the finish.
Goose Island Marshmallow Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cask style at Clybourn pub, Chciago. I like porters but this wasn’t one of the better ones. Maybe a little too roasty for my taste and a little too sweet. A ssume the marshmallow refers to unfermentable sugars-- like a milk or sweet porter. I guess it was ok, but nothing I would order again.
Goose Island Marshmallow Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);When I saw the name, I feared this might be a cloyingly sweet tooth rotter, but it’s actually an okay Porter. It pours a deep mahogany body with a tan head that does some solid lacing. The aroma is vanilla, chocolate and some lightly roasted malt. Some dark caramel is added to the flavor. This really needs a more aggressive hop bill to tune the sweetness down a little, but at the time it suited me fine. Goose Island - Clybourn, Chicago, IL
Goose Island Marshmallow Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cask pint at GI - Clybourn. Poured a clear, deeper garnet-brown with a tall, creamy cap of off-white head. Aroma was of very sweet marshmallow fluff and vanilla with some toasty caramel and chocolate beneath.. very freakin’ sweet! The porter aspect of it was almost lost in the flavor with marshmallow and vanilla sweetness prevailing.. some lightly-toasted chocolate and caramel deep down, and that just increased the sweetness to an almost unbearable level.. lots of vanilla on the finish. Lower carbonation and creamy from the cask treatment.. some diacetyl at the finish.. too sweet.

Koreb Herbowe;£ask, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browar Koreb;Gdañsk 27/7 2019. At the St. Dominic Fair where Koreb had a little stand. Somber Monk and a King on the label. They seem pretty preoccupied with being “Traditional”. The version I am drinking has an ABV of 5,6. Pours light brown with small white head. Settles as thin, patchy layer of foam. Looks more like Coca Cola than beer. Aroma is sweet and with Christmas spices. Cinnabon, hints of Ginger, brown sugar, Christmas cookies. Sweet berries like Blackcurrant rummaging in the background. Light carbonation. Thin, oily, almost flat texture. Flavor is very sweet. Followed by a medium strong sour bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and stays with me for too long. It might be “Traditional”. But so is Public Hangings, putting people in stocks and beheadings.

Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ise Kadoya;Tap @ Kyoto/Tadgs. Appearance: pours clear amber with good staple creamy off-white head and lacing. aroma/taste: barley, toffee, bread, light raisins, light alcohol and some light fruity notes. palette: medium malty aroma, average to light sparkling carbonation, medium to full body, medium to notable sweetness, somewhat balanced by a medium bitterness, average to long duration and an oily texture. Overall: Tasteful scotch ale
Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ise Kadoya;Served in my thistle glass, this bottle pours out a clear orange-brown beer with a beige fast-disappearing head that has a bready fruity aroma. Can a beer smell thin? I don’t know why but I got that kind of impression... On closer sniff, the beer has a fruity ripe peach caramel aroma. Medium bodied but sharply carbonated and it’s got a sharp finish. The taste starts intensely fruity: peach, apricot, stone fruit galore then gives you a toasted biscuit and caramel malt hit. Not what I typically expect from a Scotch Ale but a fun brew. Judging on the style guidelines, this is off in terms of a few points at first. But as it warms the malts come to the fore and really enhance the beer with breaded chocolate covered raisin notes and caramel. It really grew on me.
Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ise Kadoya;Bottle at Small World. Initial berry and cherry fruitiness and caramel. Taste is more fruity. Nice stuff. Little prickle. Interesting twist on what’s normally a fairly standard style.
Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ise Kadoya;Tap @ Tadg’s, Kyoto. Pours unclear amber with an off white lasting head. Aromas and flavours of tart fruit, caramel, orange marmelade and honey. Medium to full body, warming alcohol.
Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ise Kadoya;Can from World Beer Market (Sake no Taniguchi). Thin fruity nose, prunes, vinegar, and even something like funk. Copper/brown color. Sour plums, thin prunes, and a weird sort of light acidity. Possibly infected. The thin, sour flavors go nowhere. The Michael Jackson reference cited in the deScription is no longer apt. A real disappointment.
Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ise Kadoya;Draught at Molto. Sour caramel, plum, dried apricot, hints of oak and spice, dry finish.Doesn’t really match the style but still fairly enjoyable and flavorful.
Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ise Kadoya;Practically exploded once it hit the glass. First pour was 90% foam and the sour cherry nose screamed infection. Nose has additional funky hay and brett character. Starts with a fizzy body and lemongrass tartness without much residual sweetness. Finishes buttery oaky and acidic. If this were labeled as a sour ale, I might score it in the low to middle 3’s, but as a Scotch ale, this has no detectable peat or caramely sweetness. Overall disappointing.
Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ise Kadoya;50cl bottle. Enormous beige head atop cloudy dark amber body. Aroma is moderately sweet, lemon, funky. Taste is moderately sweet, Brett/wood, some lemon. Medium body, some effervescence. Have to assume an infection for a Scotch Ale to have these characteristics. The fact that it tastes ok is fortuitous.

Brooklyn Abbey Singel;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);"Looks like a light lager, not that impressive ... golden ... Minor head, carbonation ... The spicy aroma of a Belgian, but light and not harsh. Smell is bubbly. Mild, doesn’t try to bludgeon you. Creamy and bubbly feeling. A bit too sweet to counter the spicy taste; some alcohol/liqueur taste. Really pleasant, not hard to drink, although light on presentation."

The smell is of wheat and a sweetness of sorts. Taste is very yeasty and full of wheat with a kind of light sweetness. Not too much to it really. The brew feels balanced but a bit doughy for me. Overall I was not impressed with this brew and would not get it again. There just is not that much to it at all. If you’re going to buy something from this brewery stick with the Black Chocolate Stout. Reviewed on: 06-28-2007

Barley's Meister Eckhart Spark Of The Divine;Columbus, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley's Brewing Company;Tosa gathering, thanks nolankowal for sharing this growler: Hazy amber hue with a small fizzy head and some lace. The aroma has notes of fruity esters (pear, apple, fig), noble and grassy hops, floral aromatics and a touch buttery. The taste is acidic fruits, biscuity and nutty malts, with a light bitterness and a hint of pepper. The mouth feel is biting and warming, does smooth out in the end, a chalky aftertaste. Not too shabby but it would be better with some age to it.
Barley's Meister Eckhart Spark Of The Divine;Columbus, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley's Brewing Company;Sampled at Brew Week in Athens. The aroma is sweet malt and ETOH. Copper and cloudy, with minimal head. Very full body and sweet though, not too heavy. The Alcohol is obvious and I’d peg the ABV as 10%. Finishes a bit long.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis St. Paul Pilsner;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #67. Draught sample at the brewpub, August 2008. Clear bright gold, a slight touch of lasting head, also a hint of lacing...grassy nose offers touches of lemon, some acerbic hoppy notes but rather weak ones...fairly sweet throughout, hops present all the time but muted, you have to search for them...mouthfeel rather soft for the style but not unpleasant. Pretty much the same quality as the Premium Lager which started off my tasting.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis St. Paul Pilsner;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Clear gold, moderately carbonated, slim white head. Mellow malty aroma with just a touch of hop presence. Smooth malt profile, nicely balanced with a slightly spicy, slightly flowery hop tang. Very smooth and easy to drink - a touch of smoke character (I don’t think smoked malt was used) in the aftertaste is intriguing.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis St. Paul Pilsner;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Draft @ Minneapolis Brewpub: Gold, light head and lacing. Nose of light chemically deet and crisp pilsner malts and noble hops. The flavor is thin, creamy but a bit lacking in hops. The finish is way too thin, just nothing there after the flavor fades.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis St. Paul Pilsner;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;On tap (sampler) at the Minneapolis location, RBSG 2007 pre-tasting dinner. Clear light gold with a white head. Sweet, grainy nose, light malt. Cereal grain flavors, lightly perfumey and a touch of honey. OK.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis St. Paul Pilsner;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;On tap (sampler) at the Minneapolis location, June 2007. Mid gold colour. Thin, but complete, white head. Not a lot of aroma - just a touch of grainy malt. Sweetish initial impact on the palate. There’s a modicum of hoppy bitterness in the flavour, combined with a little bready malt. Has rather more backbone than the North Star premium lager sampled just before but doesn’t make a huge impact. Quite pleasant and drinkable.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis St. Paul Pilsner;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Brewpub draft. Clear gold, small white head. Real grainy with some subtle, sweet perfume and some corn and a small hint of noble hops. Decent for a pils. Light body, balanced.

Rock Bottom Minneapolis St. Paul Pilsner;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Clear gold color with a thick head. Barely any aroma, but just a bit of grain. Massive raw grain taste and oddly sweet for a pils. Some floral hop on the finish that bitters it up just a bit.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis St. Paul Pilsner;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;On tap at Rock Bottom Minneapolis before the RBSG 2007 Surly tour.

Storm Beer Black Moon Iron Stout;Denpasar Selatan, Bali, Indonesia;Stout;Storm Brewing Bali;330 ml bottle, as Storm Beer Iron Stout, in Bali. ABV is 5%. Black colour, moderate tan head. Moderate but nice roasty aroma, notes of coffee, hints of dark chocolate. Relatively light bodied. Medium dry flavour, distinct roasty notes of coffee, again with hints of dark chocolate. Fairly decent beer.
Storm Beer Black Moon Iron Stout;Denpasar Selatan, Bali, Indonesia;Stout;Storm Brewing Bali;Nice and light mild stout. Light coffee, light milk chocolate, and a very tender semi-sweet bitter finish. Good stuff. Also the hardest of the Storm brews to find on Bali. Nice treat though when it’s an epic rain storm out!!!
Storm Beer Black Moon Iron Stout;Denpasar Selatan, Bali, Indonesia;Stout;Storm Brewing Bali;I’m not a big Stout drinker but this Iron Stout WOWED my pallet. Really Beautiful drop!
Storm Beer Black Moon Iron Stout;Denpasar Selatan, Bali, Indonesia;Stout;Storm Brewing Bali;The high level of carbonation made this beer almost tasteless. It could have been soda water for all I knew. However, after putting down the glass in disgust and leaving it to warm up and fizz down out came some real flavour of chocolate and coffee with only a mild after taste. Unsuited to chilling and over carbonated. Other than that, not too bad and would drink again.
Storm Beer Black Moon Iron Stout;Denpasar Selatan, Bali, Indonesia;Stout;Storm Brewing Bali;Bottle in Bali. Pour is dark clear brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is light roasted malt, light brown sugar, and a light crisp hop character. Flavor is also light malty and light caramel with hints of crisp hoppiness in the finish. Very drinkable stout for the tropics with a nice malty character.

Nose of roasted malts with hops lingering in the backgroudn. Some roasted malts wtih lacto-sweetness as well. Not to bad of a flavor, and a bit of an ashy finish.
Storm Beer Black Moon Iron Stout;Denpasar Selatan, Bali, Indonesia;Stout;Storm Brewing Bali;Fizzy light brown head over a black body. Sweet roasted malt, but hop presence as well. Taste reminded me of the Storm Golden Ale strangely enough. Early hop bite, but a late charcoal finish. Not that bad. Palate was quite thin and fizzy, further confusing me as to the brewers intent. A quirky brew that doesnt fit the style very well. No one is in Bali for a soothing quality beer, they need to keep it light for the bingers.
Craftsman Honesty;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap at Far Bar. Pours a fairly clear browned amber with a medium sized tan head. Soft fruit and toast on the nose, a bit of cherry, wood, funk. Medium bodied, soft acidity, slow malt and a bit of cherry again. Long tartness, a nice amount of acidity, more cherry and wood. Dries out nicely with a bit of funk into the finish.

S- Deep malty smell with some hop background. T- Toasted malt and fruitiness come through first. The finish is a good hop-malt balance. Some hops and sweet malt linger. P- medium to high carbonation and somewhat thin body. O- This is a good scottish ale. Interesting and enjoyable. Easily sessionable. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 06-24-2007 16:35:42
East End Old Hickory;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;East End Brewing Company;I loved that this beer was brewed for the 2007 US open. Very good scottish ale
East End Old Hickory;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;East End Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at the Map Room at Regent Square this beer poured a chestnut color with a large dark tan head. The aroma was roasty, bitter and had faint elements of fruit, smoke, caramel and toffee. The finish was dry, smoky and roasty. Very complex yet something just did not work for me with this one. Interesting though.
East End Old Hickory;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;East End Brewing Company;Growler. Pours dark hazy caramel, off white head. Aroma is caramel, malt, grass, molasses. Flavor is caramel, vanilla, wheat, grass, slight molasses, and earthiness. Lighter in body than I would have preferred.
East End Old Hickory;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;East End Brewing Company;From growler. Nice bit of grainy maltiness to this one, with caramel and toasted malt. Mild neutral fruitiness and just a bit of tang. Mild neutral hoppiness and some apple skins. Cloudy medium brown with thin off-white lacing head. Medium bodied with medium carbonation, very easy drinking. Starts with nice bit of toasted malt, light caramel, and some apple essence. A little bit of chocolate and dry nuttiness and some dull acidity. Finish is smooth, with just a bit of fruity hops bitterness. Clean smooth after and makes for a very easy, enjoyable quaff. One of Scott’s milder beers in terms of hops. Very nice ale!
East End Old Hickory;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;East End Brewing Company;Growler from brewery. Hazy copper/amber body with small tan head. Aroma is quite mild... mostly earthy malt with a slight sweetness of dark fruits. Flavor has a nice toasty/earthy malt character and a little sweetness like the aroma. There is a small hop presence right as the beer slides down your throat, but it vanishes quickly under the dry toasted malt. Apparently this is my first Scottish ale rating, but from memory I would say this was better than other Scottish ales I’ve had (but not rated).
East End Old Hickory;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;East End Brewing Company;If this is a Scottish Ale, this is great, because I have not had an SA that has rated above a 2. Much more refined than the everyday scott. Do you know what a Mashie is? Well it tastes and smells like a little bit of mashie shaft has been ground up and used to spice this brew. Smells and tastes like a mashie, even feels the same way in my hand. This was on tap at the Bocktown, excellent beer tasting venue. The pour is a little perfumy aroma and just plain beer. Cloudy and dark but not black. Even cloudier and lighter than rootbeer. Looks more like a good duneklweizen. When I taste, I think ‘why are you trying to please such a small critical niche of tasters’. This has no attributes of impy stout, and neither does it have any characteristics of IPA? Tastes and feels like the dirt that has been thrown up in a fairway when using a mashie. Hey, how did this divot get into my mouth? Not sweet and not bitter. Could be a session brew if it is not hiding a high alky content. No alky hints prevalent. Interesting, woody but not burned or charred wood. Like fresh green hickory trees broken open from a lightning or wind storm . Mild, nice and friendly. Medium low carbonation. Must be tried to appreciate, my words lack description. Interesting and better than just OK, for a beer. Good for a variety. Finish is fun and happy. No bitter medicinal qualities. Another very distinct flavor from East End. IMHO the best and most behaved Scottish ale in it’s category so far.

K's Healing Time;Fukuoka, Japan;Porter;K's Brewing Company;Tap at Garage 39's 4th Anniversary. I tried the Brewmaster healing time coffee Porter 5% A deep black with reddish highlights and a freaky beige head. The taste was big licorice, no coffee and almost infected like. Weird. This thing is ducked and tastes like a beer cocktail mixed with a low-rent boozy oaky tannic spirit. Fail, man for a 4th Anniversary Garage 39 busted out the boring from good breweries and lots of junk from budget breweries, biggest waste of a great space I've ever seen.
K's Healing Time;Fukuoka, Japan;Porter;K's Brewing Company;5.0% black with a quickly dissipating head, bitter fruit aroma, fizzy bitter tart taste with a coffee after-taste.
K's Healing Time;Fukuoka, Japan;Porter;K's Brewing Company;Botella. Clear dark brown colour, small beige like head, bubbly. Sweet aroma of dark malt and caramel with some coffee. Ok mouthfeel. Flavour is sweet with dark malt and caramel/toffee, bit nuts, some coffee. Rather thin and not a porter style brew, I would say.
K's Healing Time;Fukuoka, Japan;Porter;K's Brewing Company;A dark clear brown ale with a thcik big bubbled moka head. In aroma, a nice vanilla fudge aroma with sweet chocolate. In mouth, a nice maple and nuts taste, with caramel malt. Nice. Mondiale 2009, June 6 2009.

K's Healing Time;Fukuoka, Japan;Porter;K's Brewing Company;Bottle at Mondial 2009. Dark brown-red with a thin mocha head. Average retention. Aroma is wood, maple, sugar, alcohol, spices and caramel. Flavor is similar to the aroma. Thin body.
K's Healing Time;Fukuoka, Japan;Porter;K's Brewing Company;Bottle from the brewery. Lightish black color, dull-looking with a foamy head and lots of carbonation. Fruity, dark malt aroma, with coffee and funky yeast. Fruity flavor with cheap malt extract, funk-ass yeast, and a bit of coffee. Very bad. Less than 25% malt—what is the rest? Thin, sugary, ass. Bad all around.
K's Healing Time;Fukuoka, Japan;Porter;K's Brewing Company;Med brown color, dark fruit, molassess, dark chocolate and burnt sugar in nose. Not bad. Mouth is smooth, slightly sour, dark fruit and molassess. A bit too light, lingering molassess and soy flavors. Need a bit more umpphh to it, but still not bad.
K's Healing Time;Fukuoka, Japan;Porter;K's Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Deep brown-red beer with a thin tan head. Aroma is sweet and nutty with a chewy molasses, toast and coffee character along with some overripe fruit. Earthy and slightly malty. Strangely thin bodied for something with so much residual sweetness. A bit of rum and plumminess. Thinnish and sweet. A very strange beast… just like the other beers from this brewery.
K's Cabos and Honey;Fukuoka, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;K's Brewing Company;Bottle from Foodshow. A little old at this point I guess. Light honeydew melon and sweety fruit nose with some sugar and maybe sudachi? Body is very soda-like with a slight syrupiness. Cloying and sweet, but the fruit is there. Alcopop but like some of the johana’s not entirely awful. To be clear though, not a beer, fruit beer, but more of a soda fruit beer.
K's Cabos and Honey;Fukuoka, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;K's Brewing Company;From tap at Beerfes Tokyo. Pours hazy pale, thin layer of foam. Aroma is somewhat fresh but not in the usual way. Green fruits, a berry with some resins. Tastes sweet. At first it’s just sweet, then hops disappear and what’s left is skunky sweetness. Some fruits add on later which makes it more tolerable. Well, quite exciting though, not really sure if I’d want to have it again.
K's Cabos and Honey;Fukuoka, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;K's Brewing Company;On tap at the Kyoto Beer Fest 2014. Brewmaster was bafflingly popular at the event. A nice honey gold pour with a beige head that lingers and appetizing cabos fruit spritzy aroma. Medium bodied the taste is a bit cloying or medicinal fruitiness. Think some kind of citrusy sweet soda. Not really beer like & kind of cloying...
K's Cabos and Honey;Fukuoka, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;K's Brewing Company;Honey aroma. Sweet yuzu-like juice flavor. More of a fruit panache than a usual beer, but works quite well, and puts emphasis on nice local products.
K's Brewmaster (Fukuoka Blonde Dry);Fukuoka, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;K's Brewing Company;"Bottle, AKA ""The Brewmaster"" (Hakata omiyage gift from Neko-chan). Sweet ’n’ sour fruit aroma, some chemical note or maybe mold. Stale fruity initial, peaches, BBQ sauce, hopping like envelope flap glue. Thin and rather unpleasant mouthfeel. Doesn’t seem completely attenuated, though I doubt it would be more than marginally better if it were. Really weird falvors for a golden/blond ale. Pretty bad. Who the f*#k is ""K"", anyway? And why does he let this guy brew?"

Sierra Nevada Celebration - Whiskey Barrel Aged;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Reviewed at the 2007 Strong Ale festival A- Clear light orange hue, thin white head is mostly dissipating, light lacing S- Wonderful bourbon and wood aromas dominate, tones of smokey malts, oak wood, cherries, vanilla, dark fruits T- Initial taste is vanilla and oak, a range of fruit tones appear midway, taste is somewhat diluted and a let-down given the amazing aromas M- Medium-bodied, watery texture, light carbonation D- Easy-to-drink ale, unfortunately the wood aromas over-ride the core malts and hops, taste doesn’t keep pace with the aroma
Sierra Nevada Celebration - Whiskey Barrel Aged;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;On tap at O’brien’s. Pours with an amber-brown body topped by a thin to medium thick head with little lacing. It’s slightly sweet with nice oaky, vanilla notes, a little malt and a nice hoppiness. A touch of frutiy alcohol esters show through. Full bodied, warming and smooth.
Sierra Nevada Celebration - Whiskey Barrel Aged;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Tried a pint from tap at Obriens. From my notes and the current 4.26 rating from 5 people, I’m going to make it more difficult to be in the top 50/100. Looks like the keg was just tapped. Poured with a glass full of head. They kept pouring until the glass was full except for a 1 finger head. The head slowly settled to a 2mm thick creamy blanket. So far so good. The color is crystal clear amber, no cloudiness whatsoever. With a clean palate, I get a very mild aroma, some hops, some maltiness, kind of average beer smell. First taste has some maltiness that morphs into a background sourness, which reduces drinkability. A slight lingering hop bitterness at the back of my throat for a long finish. At the bottom of the glass, the aroma gets fresher, cleaner in a cucumber way. Certainly nothing special.
Sierra Nevada Celebration - Whiskey Barrel Aged;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"Draft at Stone Brewery. Aroma of borboun, some wood, and the citrus hops normal to sierra nevada. The flavor was good because the borboun was not overpowering; and the flavors mixed well together."
Sierra Nevada Celebration - Whiskey Barrel Aged;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"On tap at Stone. I really liked this, more than the original. Aroma was of borboun/whisky, vanilla, citrus and caramel. Flavor was much of the same; good blending and complexity. Didn’t find the whiskey overpowering at all."
Sierra Nevada Celebration - Whiskey Barrel Aged;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;On tap @ Stone - Pours a clear orangish-amber color with a small off white head. No lacing. Aroma is mostly oak/whiskey and light malt. Not the hops I was hoping for. Flavor agian, is mostly oak/whiskey, and very light hops and malt. Medium body. Palate is very whiskey like. Not sure what this beer needs. Time may round the edges, but the hops we enjoy in our annual Celebration is lost. I would have like to have tried this beer a couple months after it was brewed. A very interesting beer.
Sierra Nevada Celebration - Whiskey Barrel Aged;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;On tap. Pours copper colored with a white head. Hoppy aroma with citrus notes, vanilla and sweet bourbon. Maltier than I expected with an obvious hop character. Big vanilla and bourbon notes as well. Slightly sweet but bitter finish.
Sierra Nevada Celebration - Whiskey Barrel Aged;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;On tap at Stone. Clear orange brown with a creamy white head. Aroma of caramel, vanilla, apple, and whiskey. Thick creamy palate. A some what roasty taste of caramel and apple transitioning to a good pungent whiskey taste and finishing with a lingering oaky vanilla taste and a deep alcoholic warmth. This is an absolutely wonderful beer!
La Voie Maltée St-Do Bio;Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;La Voie Maltée - Microbrasserie du Saguenay;On tap at the brewpub St-Do is the nickname for the street where the brewpub is, known for all the bars and a general party atmosphere, so why use this name for their all bio Beer is beyond me. Slightly opaque, almost greenish blonde with tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the pint to the thin head on top. Green apple like a cider, quite fruity with a strange smell that I could only associate with Flinstones chewable vitamins. Hops come out a little harsh and throw the balance way off on this one, and it sticks to the aftertaste with a very vegetal flavor and it got pretty annoying. Body was way too light as well. Tasted like a botched batch of homebrew. I’ve tasted good bio Beers before, this one was just sub-par. I don’t think it’s the brewer who is to blame for this, it’s probably his supply of grain or hops that makes me want to say hurray for pesticides.
Kolding Special Wit;Kolding, Denmark;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kolding Bryghus;Bottle. Pours a very muddy deep yellow with a big bubbly white head that fizzes away.

Medium mouthfeel - a touch oily. Flavour is immensly sweet with little notes of anything else - there is far too much sugar. Some caramel and oranges and lightly vinious.
John Harvard's Cambridge Backporch Pilsner;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;"2 draught pints at Harvard locale on 5/19/07 Some douchebag kept remarking to the bartender that this beer was phenolic. I then remarked that, ""No, it wasn’t, are you sure you’re not just trying to sound cool?"" to which he only remarked, ""It’s phenolic."" So I left it at that. I’ve had a lot of pilsners full of diacetyl, DMS and acetyldehyde, but I dont remember too many phenolic pilsners, and this one certainly wasnt. Let’s hear it for people trying to sound like they are superior in knowledge to everyone else at the bar.... Basic American pils. Golden-brass colored body has a small white head, with poor retention, light lacing. High clarity, quite fizzy. Somewhat underattenuated, and with lots of minerals and some acetyldehyde (but no phenols) in the nose, the malts seem rather sluggish and forceful, not having that light, crisp, dainty honey appeal of the better in the style. Hops are grassy, somewhat leafy and herbal as well, but are quite dry and not overly aromatic. Probably just a cream ale, there isnt much yeast crispness. Spicy herbal hop notes produce thyme, oregano and basil hints, with a bit of acidity. But not enough to cut through the sweet, sticky, vanilla and cookie-dough-like maltiness. Still, for the underattenuation, and some paperiness, it’s got a brisk enough carbonation (and not too much of it) to keep it drinkable. Not very complex, but passable. No alcohol noted."

Alt Platz Automaton +P Märzen;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Alt Platz Brewing Company;First off, this is NOT a Marzen. Way too dark, and WAY to strong a roast character for the style. Strongly phenolic in aroma and flavor, which greatly overpowers any positive malt or hop character. Phenolic character most likely is from wild yeast infection, although in another beer the brewer claims it is from cloves. Why would anyone put cloves in a marzen? Pours clear, with a nice off-white head. I strongly doubt the claims of alcohol level. It is very likely 6-8 % at most.

Capital U.S. Pale Ale;Middleton, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Capital Brewery;Medium copper, translucent pour with a small head that leaves a bit of lace. Aroma is fairly mild with a bit of citrus and straw. Flavor follows suit. Medium body with slightly sticky mouthfeel.
Capital U.S. Pale Ale;Middleton, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Capital Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a decent hazy orange looking color with a slight transparency about it that allowed a fair carbonation to be seen rising. There was less than a finger’s worth of head. The smell was based around some light sweet pine with just a tad of light sweet caramel malt. The taste was mainly sweet around the piney hops and sweet caramel malts. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. There’s nothing off and there’s nothing spectacular about it. Overall, an everyday APA worthy of having again and would probably be a pretty good pizza beer.

Medium light body is somewhat astringent and puckering. Strong carbonation is very pointy on the tongue and cheeks. Tulip glass. Cellar temperature. Bottle (Le Gobelet, Jan-08).

Squatters Racer X Rye Golden Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Like everything else in the state of Utah.....it underwhelms you....actually, it cracks you up when you really think about it. You could lump all the Squatter’s brews in a bag--pull them out randomly--and still never guess the correct brew.

Don’t waste your money on any brew in this state unless you can get some Uinta Anniversary barley wine......that’s it...period.

Aroma of cereally malt, a bit of spice. Not much in the way of hops. As the beer warms a bit of rye comes out in the malt. It’s barely perceptible and if I wasn’t looking for it, I’m not sure I’d notice it. Low bitterness and not a lot of hop flavour either. Meh.

Aroma of pale malt and a touch of wheatiness as well. The flavour is pretty strange really with a bit of yeast and a spicy/juniper berry herbal quality over the pale malt.

The Brew Kettle Raspberry Wheat;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Brew Kettle;22oz bottle obtained aat the Brew Kettle. Amber-copper pour with a medium white ehad. Fairly clear for a wheat. Lightly sweet aroma in which the raspberries are noticable. Decent flavor. Lightly touched wheat and grain along with a hint of raspberry flavoring. Medium, somewhat wet mouthfeel. It’s drinkable, but nothing to get worked up about. Boring really.
The Brew Kettle Raspberry Wheat;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Brew Kettle;Ehh. There’s absolutely nothing that stands out in this beer. A fruit beer should at least feature the fruit. If the fruit isn’t a featured aroma and flavor, then it should a subtle complement to the bolder malt, yeast, and hop flavors and aromas. This hazy red beer has enough raspberry to be noticed, but not enough to stand out. The wheat isn’t pronounced and there is no bitterness. There is a nice subtely vanilla creaminess almost from the interaction of malt, yeast, and fruit, but it’s not being featured either.

ABK St. Martin Dunkler Bock;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;08-Jan-10 (500-ml bottle: Purchased 30-Dec-09 for $2.79 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) Aside from being slighlty lower in alcohol than the style calls for, this drinks very much like a doppelbock. Its sweet and very malty nose is loaded with chocolate, dark toast, and raisins. Deeply malty and very sweet on the palate, the beer offers a lot of chocolate, plus cocoa, prune, earth, brown sugar, dark toast, and lightly bitter roast. Full-bodied, almost syrupy on the palate, and fairly cloying after awhile. Carbonation is light-medium. Rich, medium-brown and ruddy tinted through the center with a golden edge and perfect clarity. The tan head pours rather small, barely peaking at a quarter-inch, before settling to a thin ring. Very yummy, but a bit too sweet, and it seems that this is a doppelbock with a lower attentuation level, hence the excessive sweetness and lower ABV.

Brentwood Spooky Moon;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brentwood Brewing Co.;"Cask at the Alehouse, Reading. Reddish chestnut with a tight cream head; yeasty aroma with some fruit; soft and fruity in the mouth, with some malty carmael; and a very dry, yeasty and lightly bitter finish."
Brentwood Spooky Moon;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brentwood Brewing Co.;Cask at Baxter’s Court, JDW, London. Pours clear, dark gold with a foamy, white head. Toasty malt nose, some bread. Light sweet flavor with some leafy hops, toasty bread, light dirt, hints of dry toffee. Light bodied with fine carbonation. Light dry finish with more toasty bread, modest grain, dirt, moderate dry leafy bitterness. OK. Basic.
Brentwood Spooky Moon;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brentwood Brewing Co.;On tap @ the Haymarket. Pours a toffee brown with a nice creamy head. The nose is quite tight, giving off gentle toffee and resin notes. The taste is more of the same and the toffee for me is just missing that biscuity note. The palate is medium bodied and textured with a dry but not wholly refreshing finish. Overall, a good demonstration of the style (some sort of dry bitter) but it lacks generosity on the palate.
Brentwood Spooky Moon;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brentwood Brewing Co.;Cask by handpump at Drum & Monkey, Glasgow (1 Nov 12) - hazy amber brown, thin off-white head, malty aroma, caramel, nutty, herbal, bitter, malty aftertaste

Brentwood Spooky Moon;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brentwood Brewing Co.;Cask hanpull at the old buttermarket Canterbury. Mid brown amber colour with thin lasting head from a sparkler. Its a ok bitter which is what I expect from this brewery. Touch of animal fat on the flavour. Aroma is not great with a touch of too much acidity and rest of flavour has a bit of that too. Touch of nuttiness . A bit too much like licking the i.side of a nut shell to me. Odd
Brentwood Spooky Moon;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brentwood Brewing Co.;Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow in February 2010. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear copper in colour with a thin white head. Slight hint of fresh green apple in the short aroma. Pale malts give a fiery maltloaf base with tart redcurrant fruit and toffee apple notes. Slight whiff of dusty hops gives a dry aftertaste in the balanced bitter sweet finish. An ok session bitter.
Shoreline 78 RPM;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Shoreline Brewery;On tap at brewpub, a orange look to it with a a malty sweetness that is hard to descibe,not sure how strong but it was a different type of beer for me.CHEERS!
Shoreline 78 RPM;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Shoreline Brewery;This is the first commercial brew of the new assistant brewer, and it’s not a bad effort. I was taken aback somewhat by the appearance, an orange bodied altbier. The head was okay and the lacing was constant. The aroma seem to be a bit too caramelly, but that faded in the flavor. It tasted of sweet malt with pepper and a floral/grassy bitterness that lasted into the finish. Not bad. Shoreline Brewery, Michigan City, IN
Shoreline 78 RPM;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Shoreline Brewery;Draught sample at the brewpub, June 19 2007. Medium translucent amber, bit head, no lacing...lightly spicy aroma, noble hops present if muted, a touch of banana and clove? is this a hefeweizen or an altbier?.....dry, faintly fruity body, touch of caramel, light grassy hops, bit of mushy banana....light chalky finish. Hmmm, was this an example of different beer/same name? Except I had this just a couple of days (apparently) after the last reviewer. Heck I dunno, but it was so average I really don’t care either.
Shoreline 78 RPM;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Shoreline Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Copper hue, but served with no head. Lots of hops here. Clean hop aromas, but not much malt character. Same with the flavor. Highly carbonated. They even admitted to me that it didn’t turn out the way they planned. Oh well. Give another go, and I’ll revisit this.

Robinsons Dizzy Blonde (Bottle);Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Robinsons Family Brewery;Just slightly darker than a lager, this one smells and tastes like a cheap, weak bitter.

York Sovereign;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Station bar. Served again at warmed than room temp.

Pours a fairly transparent coppery red hue with small offwhite head. Aromas of caramel malt, some biscuity presence dominates with an inkling of hops. Taste is a lighter caramel, toffee, biscuity, toasty malt body but also light on the palate and sessionable. A bit of the bitterness on the backend is not a major player, but compliments well. A touch of lemon and spice. Delicate. A sessioner.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Erik the Red;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On tap at RB – Yorktown. Poured reddish-caramel with a short cap of looser beige head. The aroma picked up semi-sweet caramel and red wheat with nice floral and fruity hops as accent pieces.. simple and solid. This was quite tasty.. toasted, almost oaked caramel with light, complimentary pine bitterness at the edges.. warmth brought out an enjoyable medium-skinned fruity bouquet. Just shy of medium-bodied with nice balance on the palate.. a touch grainy.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Erik the Red;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Sampler from cask. Amber in color like a small kerosene lantern’s light. I first catch a bit of English ale and light fruit here. This pour is almost still, and very warming. Toffee malts, a nice fruity ale character. I’m going to imagine this is what a CAMRA-approved cask ale is like until such time as I can get to England.
Rock Bottom Yorktown California Common;Lombard, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Mug Club draft at RB. Inviting light brown color, a little like iced tea except for the thin, clingy white foam up top. Clean, malty beer smell with light hop notes. Taste is light, with toasty malts. Hops are close to a milder APA, but plenty of Noble-ity to go along with it. Unless I can have one head-to-head with an Anchor Steam, I’d say this is a fine version of the style.
Rock Bottom Yorktown California Common;Lombard, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rock Bottom Yorktown;This has a deep golden, nearly amber body with an off-white head that leaves a trail of lace behind it. It has an aroma of light caramel, a non-offensive touch of corn, and a light earthy, herbal hoppiness. Very lively in the mouth, a touch of grain is added to the flavor and the hops become more herb-like, almost like tea. The finish is crisp and well balanced. Tim brewed a good one for the warm days ahead. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL

No lacing. Absolute minimum collar. Left behind a very pretty crystal clear straw colored brew. Nose is earthy hops and toasted bread. Sage and grassy herbs mixed with pale malts and Belgian candy sugar.. bubblegum and orange peel. Palate is tropical fruits and spicy hops.. American pale malts and Belgian esters are the finish.

Tennents Pilsner;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Keg at Dry Dock, Leeds. Pours a straw colour, decent pillowy head. Aroma is stagnant, skunky, very very faint hops. Taste is carbonated water with a small hop hint and a creaminess at the end. Watery body, finish is mercifully short. Taste isn’t offensive as such, but the aroma really is. This is truly terrible. I’d rather drink my own piss. Actually, I’d rather drink Chris de Burgh’s piss. Get me a doctor. UPDATE: Scratch that thing about the taste not being offensive. Drank a big gulp to get rid of it, horrible soapy aftertaste, made me almost nauseous. This is true crap.

A light golden beer with a whitish head and lacing. A cold, quick and dirty lager which has no finish and smells of ice. There’s not even a lagerish chemical kick to this. It actually tastes like water. Seriously. This is for people who don’t even like lager.

Millevertus Ricardpils;Breuvanne-Tintigny, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Artisanale Millevertus;Wow it says pils and it mentioned anis. My first impression of smell was Orange and later sure it was anis. Although i do not like anis. This beer has a very speial and complex tast. For a low alcohol beer this is fantastic. The taste of anis is there but still it is smooth
Belmont Hop Head Red;Long Beach, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Belmont Brewing Company;This is easily my favorite of the Bonaventure beers I had today. Plenty of hops in the first whiff and the first sip. A nice beer, doesn’t seem heavy. Should be a regular on tap.

Belmont Hop Head Red;Long Beach, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Belmont Brewing Company;on draft at brewery, consumed on 11/12/07. Not as dark as their amber ale, this beer is a little on the orange/copper side. A resiny hop character greets the nose. Very well-balanced malt/hops flavor, neither overpowering nor overwhelmed. Slightly astringent aftertaste where hops linger on the palate. Not as hoppy as the name would leave you to believe, though hoppier than most red ales I have had.
Belmont Hop Head Red;Long Beach, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Belmont Brewing Company;Had this one a while back and forgot to rate it. I am pretty sure it is an American Strong Ale. It had a pretty strong citrus aroma. Poured a dark red. Flavor was pretty much grapefruit and pine with some mild toffee malt flavor. Resiny and thick. This one kind of reminded me of Arrogant Bastard in a smaller sense. This was a nice special beer, and I wanted to get a growler of it, but got the Strawberry Blonde because the old lady wanted a fruit beer.

Cascade Lakes Paulina Lake Pilsner;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;22 oz bomber courtesy of bvc. Pour is slight chill haze yelloe, almost greenish tinge with a one inch pure white head. Tons of carbonation bubbles floating to the surface. Aroma is soft hay grassiness along with lemon citrus and mildly sweet floral. Fresh and clean, quite inviting.

Really nice Pils, thanks for always having your eyes open for these sorts of beers Brandon.
Cascade Lakes Paulina Lake Pilsner;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;"22 oz bought from ""Habits"" in South Salem. Probably the brightest yellow beer i have seen..bright and crystal clear. Small white head. Pleasing doughy ,bready aromas with a tinge of lemon zest hop. Good Crisp sweet malt flvoured lager..with a hoppy buzz leaving bitterness at the end. Nice palate, crisp and refreshing. A nice lager..very good American lager..but not a pils by any means."
Cascade Lakes Paulina Lake Pilsner;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;I like a crisp, clean and refreshing pilsner from time to time but it’s just not that exciting of a beer to me. So, as most of you already know, this is where the hedonistic scale doesn’t do justice. Rated to style I would have to increase everything but the palate score. Sweet grainy malt and noble hops in the nose. Light straw color with initial frothy white head that doesn’t persist and leaves slight lacing. Little carbonation visible. Substantial malt sweetness with a good hop presence that lends a long bitter finish. Medium to med. light body with medium carbonation and a smooth and creamy texture. Nice example of a Classic American Pilsner. Still, I think a nice IPA hop-bomb suits me just fine on a hot summer day.
Cascade Lakes Paulina Lake Pilsner;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Light yellow/medium straw, fluffy sticky white head. Dry fresh grassy aroma. Very clean, still dry and grassy in the sip, not much in the way of a hoppy finish, though it was a good clean and snappy contrast to the pale malt.
Cascade Lakes Paulina Lake Pilsner;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;A decent dry aroma. The flavor on this is pretty dry and quite nice, but with just a hint of butter. Certainly what I wanted at the moment anyway.
Deschutes Mint Porter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Deschutes Brewery;On the X tap at Brewpub Pours out black topped with a tan head. Looks Great smells like mint. Ok we are doing ok. But then the tast WOW holy mint field. No thanks.
Deschutes Mint Porter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Deschutes Brewery;Tap @ Brewpub: Dark black, light tan head and nice lacing. Nose of mint and tobacco, almost like a menthol cigarette, nearly identical. The flavor is fresh and minty, but there’s nothing left of the porter. Finishes with mint, tail of mint, light roasty sweet residue for the mouthfeel. Wow, there’s a crap ton of mint in here. Bonus for the uniqueness, but I couldn’t finish a pint because it was making me noxious from all the mint.
Deschutes Mint Porter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Deschutes Brewery;On Tap at the BrewPub. Deep black with a full dense tan head.

Strakonická Mìšanská Desítka 10°;Strakonice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Mìštanský Pivovar Strakonice;"Bottle: Golden, smaller, quite stable head, malty and slightly medical hoppy nose with a touch of bandaid; moderate bitter-sweet flavour, light bodied, not watery, malty base detectable; medical traces or traces of bandaid in the bitter-sweet finish. A mild beer, drinkable, even though the ""medical"" taste doesn’t make it really attractive....."
Strakonická Mìšanská Desítka 10°;Strakonice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Mìštanský Pivovar Strakonice;I came across this beer by accident, when I got lost in Strakonice trying to find the famous bagpipe festival and asked for directions at a petrol station. Mestanska Desítka (10°) pours pale yellow with a large white head. Malty and fruity, slightly hoppy especially towards the finish. Perhaps a bit thin, but this is a very pleasant desítka.

In conclusion - drinkable, but a bit tasteless.
Gampertbräu Förster-Weisse;Weissenbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gampertbräu;Hazy amber with large white head. Aroma is yeast, banana, soft and mild with a slight flowery fresh touch. Taste is soft yeasty sourness with some round fruity accents. Velvety on the tongue but also a bit watery. Well rounded, a bit watery as well. Drinkable! A good smooth and soft example of a Hefeweizen.

A good solid German Hefe.
Gampertbräu Förster-Weisse;Weissenbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gampertbräu;Interesting! Not traditional! Has a strange acrid funkiness upon full warming that I liked. Didn’t get cloying. As I stated, acrid, slightly sour/citric flavor component, more than standard. Definite lack of sweetness in this wheat beer. Bready, lip-smacking but not heavy-palated. Mostly diffuse grain and hay flavors. Pepper aroma, dusty. Clovey. No banana for me. I’d go back to this just for the shakeup. Great conditioning to the end.
Gampertbräu Förster-Weisse;Weissenbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gampertbräu;The beer in the glass has a yellow-orange color, medium cloudy with a beautiful head. The beer smells yeasty, creamy, with a slight fruity note. It starts yeasty, creamy, very tasty. Moreover, joined by a clovy spicy note, overall the Weizen is very recent. The aftertaste is also good spicy, again with lots of clove flavors. The further course is extremely spicy and yeasty, creamy, but I miss something fruitiness.

Fizzy carbonation (Dubrovnik, 28.08.2008).
Pan Lagan;Koprivnica, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Croatia;PAN Lager Light or something...The beer hasn’t got any off taste, but it has a thin body, minimal aroma, taste and texture. Will i buy it again? No, thanx!

Twin Lakes Winterthur Spring Wheat;Greenville, Delaware, United States;Wheat Ale;Twin Lakes Brewing Company;Looks like a mix of beer and lemonade.. I kind of dig the color.

Light aroma of grass. Taste is a little grassy as well with a little bitterness to it. It leaves a funkey after taste that doesnt sit well. Not bad just not good.

Poured a golden color with slight hints of orange, nice full head appearance. The aroma was herbal, slightly grassy, even somewhat corny. The flavor was herbacious, grass, more malt depth than the Spring Wheat, yet still on the light side. This was an average blonde ale, ok for the summer or joe beer drinker, but not enough character for my admiration.

Goose Island Bourbon Barrel Aged Aviator Dopplebock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Hopefully this is the right beer.

Scents of bourbon, oak, light vanilla and medicinal undertones in the scents. Start is sweet with lots of malt goodness. Alcohol, bourbon and medicine break in and disrupt things a bit in the middle and into the finish. Fairly hot and a bit too much alcohol in the flavors distract.

Esbjerg Mikrobryg ESB;Esbjerg N, Denmark;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Esbjerg Mikrobryg;Tap @ YNWA. Pours a redish brown with a small film head. Mild aroma with only a slight dose of hops. Taste has a lot of caramel and a little flowery hoppyness. It is not nearly dry enough to be an ESB, more likely a rather tame IPA. It is refreshing, but nothing exciting.

A milk-shaded pale straw colored pour, topped by a tall snowy white head. Yeast and dough up front, then a vague scent of mellow yellow fuits and banana. Taste is undistinct and sappy. Soft bready pale malts, tin-canned fruit-juice fruitiness. Medium full, juicy texture. Bland, fruity and yeast-accented malt finish. Drinkable, but utterly boring and downplayed.
Herslev Midsommer Bryg;Herslev, Roskilde, Denmark;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Herslev Bryghus;500ml bottle bought at Vinmonopolet Vika. Light yellow body with a slight haze. Lasting white head. Grass and wheat to the nose. The taste profile is a mix of lemon, wheat, and hay added by notes of light spices. Dry ending. Foamy in the mouth. Refreshing and ok (hotel room, Oslo 27.09.2011).

Great Lakes Lorelei Dunkel Weizen;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"7/07/2008: GLBC Lorelei is ""a classic dark German wheat beer with roasty malt undertones."" This description is right on the money! The aroma of this beer is like creamy wheat with a dry roastiness and hints of smoke. It’s appearance is cloudy, burnt gold. It has a thick, pillowy, ivory-colored head that creates fine, dense lacing effects. The beer tastes creamy with only some light floral hoppiness in the finish. It has a medium-full body, a soft palate, and is really creamy. It is good, but slightly disappointing overall. Draught sample (ABV 5.1%; IBU 20) at the Great Lakes Brewing Company Brewpub in Cleveland, Ohio. Rating #5 for this beer."
Great Lakes Lorelei Dunkel Weizen;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);[382-20070630] Tap @ Great Lakes (Cleveland, OH). Light banana yeast aroma. Hazy, dark brown amber body with a medium-lasting white head. Flavour is like a sweet toffee banana split. Medium-full body. Nice, fairly toned down as it seems to be missing carbonation.
Great Lakes Lorelei Dunkel Weizen;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Draft at the brewpub. Headless hazy brown body. Muted yeasty aroma of dark malt. Similar flavour, light estery yeast notes, and toasty malt with light caramel notes. Average palate is under carbonated. Not unpleasant but a bit disappointing - I was hoping for a bigger Aventinus like flavour. I doubt that the name is a reference to the Gilmore Girls, but it brings up memories of the show nonetheless. How might the show have been different had Luke’s diner been serving up micro brew and pulled pork rather than coffee and donuts? Ok that was a stretch... but I got the reference in! :) 6/3/6+/3/13
Great Lakes Lorelei Dunkel Weizen;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);This is the most unique offering from GL that I have tasted.

Great Lakes Lorelei Dunkel Weizen;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pours a murky purple brown with small almond head. Aroma is banana and some caramel sweetness. Flavor is much the same banana and caramel, with a slight roasted malt and nutty finish. The banana stays around in the background the whole time with a slight smoky sweetness in the finish. Good beer I need to go back down and have a few more.

Keswick Thirst Pitch;Keswick, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Keswick Brewing Co.;[500ml bottle from deli in Ullswater] Pours dark brownish amber, highly carbonated from the bottle. Sweet, fruity aroma with a tinge of something quite bitter. On the palate, quite thin but a decent malty flavour with a touch of smoke. The decent malt backbone saves this, there’s a definite vegetal side to it. Decent but not amazing [15012011]
Tunnel Rauchbier;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Smoked - Rauchbier;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);Bottled. Just enough smoke to qualify it as more than a smoky Bitter, and a Rauch. From the Warwickshire Alps. Creamy malt, hop bitterness and smoke in equal measure. Nibbles of earth, Twiglet and apple peel. Pours with a ruddy haze and a superbly creamy, rocky head of froth that clings to the side of the glass until it’s drained. Impressive.

Pale malts gives a fiery digestive biscuit base with tart redcurrant fruit present. Good prickle of hop resins noted in the dry, earthy flavour to the bitter aftertaste. Finish is robust and malty with berry fruit and oak cask notes giving dry moreish flavours in the mouth. An excellent session ESB and very popular with the locals.

Seven Bridges Toasted Oat Pale Ale;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Pale Ale - English;Seven Bridges Grille & Brewery (Craftworks);Pint on cask at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville FL. Had this about the end of April and forgot to rate it. Amber beer with a creamy white head. Aroma was lightly hoppy and pale malts. Flavor was malty and biscuity, with a good hop presence, but some odd flavors floating about. Not bad flavors, just unexpectedly different. Not enjoyable enough for me to go back for more, but certainly a decent enough drink. .. .. 07-15-2008 .. they brought it back as a seasonal, and I tried it again.. tasted sharp, green. Had a funky raw aroma. Not up to the usual standards for this brewpub. Maybe a few weeks of aging would settle it down, but this was hard to drink this year. Immediately switched to their regular IPA with better results.

Amber in color with a lasting, creamy white head. A little bit of diacetyl in the first sip followed by caramel, toasted malt some alcohol and some light biscuit notes. Very nice mouthfeel.

Rivertowne Buffalo Trace Bourbon Barrel Stout;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rivertowne Brewing;Please, don’t mind my numbers on this one. I rate by how much I enjoy it and this was probably one of the most offensive beers I have tasted! This beer will match up with any impy stout in the top 25. I am serious, bitter complex concoction like you have ever tasted. I’m getting growlers of this and sending it to anybody who likes oak aged Yeti or Expedition. Sweetish candy aroma, big and black appearance, like 100,000 mile used engine oil. Head like chocolate mousse. Barely any carbonation and I swear I saw an oily coffee bean slick on top. This stuff coats your mouth like a good bourbon whiskey, WOW! Killer brew, way to much for my girlie taste buds but I saw this chick across from me say how good it tasted and purred right afterwards. I can’t stop puckering. If you like that big black stuff in the top 25, better seek this out, IMHO it is a killer. It’s a wonder that stuff like this is still classified as a beer.
Rivertowne Buffalo Trace Bourbon Barrel Stout;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rivertowne Brewing;Barrel aging a beer is often a hit or miss thing with me. Generally speaking it tends to overpower the beer. This is not one of those types of beers. The barrel aging compliments and enhances with this beer. Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a dark black color with a small brown head. The aroma was strong sweet bourbon, roasty malts and sweet chocolate. The flavor was rich sweet bourbon, sweet coffee and sweet chocolate syrup. The barrel took away all the bitterness of the regular imperial stout. When sampled side by side this made their regular imperial stout taste hoppy and harsh. The finish was sweet and silky smooth and hid the alcohol well in my opinion. Ambrosia.
Rivertowne Buffalo Trace Bourbon Barrel Stout;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rivertowne Brewing;Draught sample from brewery. Dark black clear with no head. Thick oily body with smooth carbonation. Oak nose, with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, alcohol vapors and roasted dry bitterness. Starts with great oaken vanilla notes, plum and raisins. A bit of subdued smokiness, with coffee and a light fruity hoppiness. Smooth dry finish. This was done very nicely. Should get even better with aging and I hope I can try this one again. Smooth and rich with great balance.

Rivertowne Hooked Up Hefe Weizen;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rivertowne Brewing;A- Translucent golden yellow body with thin white head. Head eventually subsides to thin white collar. No lacing is left behind in the glass. Haze is moderately thick and uniform. S- Sour citrus hits the nose first along with plenty of spices. A solid bready yeast is in the background along with hints of banana. T- Big sour citrus zest upfront with lots of spiciness and yeast to balance. Citrus fades for the finish where peppery spice and yeast really come out with hints of banana. Peppery spice and sweet bready spice linger. P- Low carbonation accentuates the smooth, yeasty mouthfeel of this one. O- Other than the appearance this is almost exactly how I like my hefes. This one has bold flavor but a very light and drinkable character too. This is a bit more sour than the typical hefe-but it makes it much more interesting. Something I hope is around when I visit again-because its delicious! Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 10-08-2007 00:39:06

Rivertowne Old Wylie's IPA;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Rivertowne Brewing;How is it, in an era where breweries are throwing C&D’s at each other all willie-nillie, that Rivertowne and Rivertown can coexist, seemingly peacefully? Or have they had their squabbles? I suppose I could google it to find out, but that’s too much effort. I’ll just choose to sit back and think everything is fine.
Rivertowne Old Wylie's IPA;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Rivertowne Brewing;Pours a coppery orange with a medium head of white foam. Aroma is not very prominent. Some malts and light citrus with notes of caramel. Fairly refreshing with a malt backbone and a sharp bite at the finish. Feels like a red IPA. Pretty good. Not much pine or citrus flavors. Just a tad bitter aftertaste. Enjoyable.

Rivertowne Old Wylie's IPA;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Rivertowne Brewing;Classic IPA that lacks the citra hops and other piney or citrus hops I love. Well- crafted though. Great aroma with a standard-at-best palate. Needs fruit or complex palate to break from standard though. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Rivertowne Old Wylie's IPA;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Rivertowne Brewing;12 oz. can from Santa. Pours a clear dark golden/amber color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have a big malt character up front, caramel, light toast, with some orange and grapefruit citrus, some herbal tea, hops seem a bit faded, just ok.
Rivertowne Old Wylie's IPA;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Rivertowne Brewing;Pours translucent orange-amber into the glass with a wispy head that leaves ring lacing. The nose is of caramel and oranges. Flavors are citrusy (bright), grassiness, caramel and a grassy, lightly peppering bitter finish. The mouthfeel is semi-active and the palate is semi-juicy. Goes down well with a medium body. What it lacks in complexity, it slightly redeems itself in drinkability, especially in the hot summer months.
Rivertowne Old Wylie's IPA;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Rivertowne Brewing;Canned. No clear date. Pours honey golden, off-white head, pillowy. Aroma is malt forward, caramel notes, light orange, pineapple, lemon citrus notes, bready notes. Flavor is actually fairly hop forward, definite bite. Caramel malt, fairly bready middle of the mouth, slight hop finish. Ok.

Rivertowne Anglers Amber;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;Ignore my numbers, I don’t care for hopped up beers, if you like hops, you gotta try this. Some hints of floral hops in the aroma, just barely. Slightly darker than the typical pale yellow american lager. I think there is a little bit of haze in the appearance. Good medium hop bite, starts out wanting to be an IPA and almost gets there. Medium low carbonation. Overall, a good amber ale that borders on IPA with the hop characters. Finish is like many hopped beers, bitter and medium length lasting. Glad to have had the chance to taste this beer. IMHO Not quite as enjoyable as the less hopped Rock Bottom North Star Amber Ale.

Rivertowne Raspberry Patch;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rivertowne Brewing;Pours kind of a muddy peach with a very thin head. Big raspberries on the nose. Nice raspberries on the nose without being too cloying. I think a little sourness on the finish would make this perfect.

A slight Kool-aid-ish nose (grape specifically). Very light malt with a strong fruit start with a rather hoppy finish, but clean. Honestly a pretty aggressively thought out beer. Decent.
Rivertowne Perfectly Pomegranate;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rivertowne Brewing;One of the better, more enjoyable beers I had at the Rivertowne. Lighter and more bubbly looking than a ubiquitous pale yellow american lager. No hint of fruit in the aroma. Very low carbonation on the palate. tho there are quite a few bubbles within the brew. Wow, quite interesting and unique, simply lovely. Fruity but not artificial. I like this brew, easy to like and easy to get along with. Reminds me a bit of another fruit beer I’ve had lately, festina peche or a flemish sour. Could drink this all day, a great session brew.

Rivertowne Perfectly Pomegranate;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rivertowne Brewing;Draught sample at brewery. Fruity and cheesy aroma. Light tart nose with a bit of grainy sweetness and just a tad funky. Hazy pale golden with little head. Medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Starts with a good bit of honey flavor and a sweet fruity taste of what is presumed to be pomegranate. I’ve eaten pomegranate but have never just had the juice, so I’m not sure how close it comes. Light grainy notes with honey and mild hoppy finish. Smooth and fruity and not bitter at all. Clean sweet finish, with an interesting mix of flavors.

Ragtime Tavern Honey Bock;Atlantic Beach, Florida, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ragtime Tavern (Craftworks);The aroma has orange blossoms, honey and lots of fusel alcohol notes. The body is gold/yellow and holds a thinnish white head. Dry, spent honey notes in the fore with a big blast of alcohol. Very reminiscent of Orange Blossom Pilsner but with much more alcohol. Some light sweet fruit notes in the finish and vague hints of toasted wheat cakes.

Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;I tried this stuff a few years back. If awards were given for beer that was so TERRIBLE that it was almost genius, this beer would have collected one. This offering was so bad that one just had to laugh…really it was hilarious! I don’t think that most brewers could come up with something of this caliber if they tried for 3 years strait, yet somehow the wrecking crew at Sprecher managed to pull it off! I tip my hat to you Sprecher, you’ve truly outdone yourselves. What will you come up with next? Not to give you master brewers at Sprecher advice or anything…but if you’re going to brew a fruit beer you may want to try using actual fruit! Keep brewing the beers that keeps us laughing in Chigagoland...Sprecher RULZ!!!
Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Pretty brew. Cloudy peach pour with a light pink head. Smells like a strawberry scented candle. Not as overly sweet as I thought it would be. In fact, it could be a tad sweeter. What really, Really, REALLY, REALLY kills this is the after taste of artificial flavor. This is obviously not all natural. There is a chemical in this that was rejected by Frankenberry! You’re better than this, Sprecher. Try again!!!!
Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Unfiltered peach color with a thin quickly diminishing off-white head. Aroma of wheat, strawberry and yeast. Taste of strawberry, candy sugar and sweet malt. Sugary and syrupy with a diet cola like finish. A touch too sweet but overall drinkable.
Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Horrible. Taste like bad cold medicine. Big head, no wheat flavor and seems like corn syrup was added???
Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;16 oz bottle. Poured a slightly hazy and very masculine orange-pink color. Head was two fingers high and white with decent retention. There wasn’t any lace. Aroma was of buttery pancakes, yeasty bread dough, and liquid strawberry flavored penicillin. It was cloyingly sweet on the tongue with a malt extracty note (not sure if this is even an extract beer). Imagine strawberry frosting mixed into strawberry soda with a splash of vanilla syrup. Pour that mixture onto a bowl of Franken Berry cereal and that’s what this beer tasted like. I wouldn’t recommend running out to grab one of these from you nearest retailer.
Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Strong aroma of strawberry. Very aromatic, smells very sweet. Hazy Peach colored with a vey thin small fizzy head that was pinkish white. Head remained very consistant in size till the end. Left a light lacing on the pint glass. Taste is a very sweet Strawberry bubblegum flavor. Was like drinking strawberry bubblegum. Medium body, oily texture with average carbonation. The finish is liike when you finish strawberry bubblegum, when the flavor is gone and you get that gum aftertaste. This beer would be great on a hot summer day! It goes down smooth, and if you like your beer sweet you would really like this. Its something different and while I wouldn’t drink it regularly or add it to my favorite rotation I would not hesitate to drink one again, especially when it is hot outside. A nice beer, a nice change of pace. Served at 36 degrees in a pint glass. For those who like traditional beer I would pass on this one. But, if you like to try new and different beer you might very well like this one.
Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Courtesy SoLan. Pours a cloudy orange/red, with a small white head. Smells of bubblegum, maybe some mild banana, and very faint wheat characters. Sweet smelling, like candy. Tastes like huge bubblegum. Sugary, not really close to a strawberry flavor either. I cant drink too much of this as it would upset my stomach. It might be interesting for 1 or 2 sips as a dessert beer, but other than that poorly crafted.
Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Courtesy MrFacto. Pours a hazy pinkish salmon with just a bit of white carbonation. Strawberry candy, sunblock, subtle wheat, other light or tropical fruits, sweet incense, candle wax- aroma. Same flavor- more beer like. Too sweet. Medium body, balanced carbonation, sticky sweet. Juice box drink in a beer bottle.
Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;16oz bottle discount liquors(milwaukee)-Cloudy orangish amber body with a small white head and an aroma of sweetness.

Sprecher Strawberry Wheat;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;16 oz bottle from discount liqours in milwaukee. Hazy light red-amber with tiny pink head. Very frutiy aroma with very sweet aroma. Flavor is like when you let a strawberry icee sit in a hot car too long and then you go to take a sip and all you get is dilluted syrup... yeah that’s pretty much what it tastes like, also... some wheat. Body is creamy but syrupy and light to med bodied. i was looking forward to this beer and was utterly dissapointed.

Holdens Jungle Jim;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Holdens Brewery;Cask. June 2007. Light amber with a short head. Sugar and toffee in the scent. Really bitter. Nice body with some sweetness and a slightly dry finish. Slightly sugary-biscuity taste, and a hint of citrus fruits but this is nearly masked by the overwhelming hops and bitter.
Holdens Jungle Jim;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Holdens Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Wheatsheaf, West Bromwich, W.Midlands. Yellow to straw with white head. Quite a thin body for the ABV, biscuity malt with a light flowery bittersweet hop note. Part of the Saints and Sinners range, which I am reliably informed are blends. Its ok without being spectacular. Lovely pub though to start our Black Country tour.
Toll End Summer Hill;Tipton, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Toll End;Cask conditioned at The Waggon & Horses, Tipton, W.Midlands. Gold with white head. There is a good depth to the body in this one, a biscuity malt with a drying, tartish character although there is a wet cardboard note too. Bitter, but not particularly hoppy finish. The Brewpub is worth a visit when you are in this area.
Titanic Crispy Nail;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Titanic Brewery (UK);Cask conditioned at The Jolly Crispin, Upper Gornal, W.Midlands. Pale straw with white head. I think that Titanic have certainly improved over time and this is a classic example of what they now do really well. Lightly set up session ale, good malty body without being intrusive and plenty of hoppy bitterness throughout with a long dry finish. I appreciate that this is a rebadge, I will sort out the Alias bit when I can find out more.
Nottingham Spanker;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nottingham Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Jolly Crispin, Upper Gornal, W.Midlands. Pale gold with thin white head.

Church End Bounty Bitter;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Church End Brewery;Stinks of lemon and ammonia. Hairs-on-your-chest grapefruit hop bitterness with a long, sweet gust of biscuity malt after the swallow. Exemplary, quinine-bitter biscuity sessions sampled fresh at the brewery. Two completely independent extremes of flavour at once. Marvellous.
Church End Bounty Bitter;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Church End Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Cottage Tavern, Ashorne, Warks. Gold with white head.

Flossmoor Station ZikadeWeiss;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Rated from notes. Served draft at the pub. Poured a cloudy strawlike yellow with a vibrant white foamy head. Aromas were definately of esters, giving me that banana smell I just love. Other sweet aromas and a bit of the typical wheat. Initial tastes are sweet, banana and clove, with orange zest. Aftertaste hangs pleasantly leaving me remembering the nice esters and refreshing nature of this brew (in my humble opinion). A nice light bodied summer brew in honor of the Cicada invasion of 2007.
Flossmoor Station ZikadeWeiss;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"pours cloudy gold, white head. the aroma is sweet and has a banana in it. the flavor is also sweet, and has a banana in it. a thin mouth feel, sweet finish. not a bad wheat; wheat is not my style."
Flossmoor Station ZikadeWeiss;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap @ brewpub. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Aroma of banana, yeast and some light mint. Flavors of banana, lemon zest, light mint and yeast. Light body, yeasty/fruity with a somewhat fruity finish.
Flossmoor Station ZikadeWeiss;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Had a light color and body for this style, and seemed a bit tame. It was more of a wheat ale than anything, but still had the qualities of a hefe. It was full of banana, clove, and even a slight vanilla character, but lacked the fullness I like in this style. It was drinkable, but average.
Flossmoor Station ZikadeWeiss;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at brewpub This pint came at about the same time as the Bride Ale. I opted to go for the other first so this one was my second sample of the afternoon. I was caught off guard by a brewpub doing a passable hefeweizen. Most of the ones I’ve had are lacking but this one is pretty solid. While I would not place it among the best examples of the style it is good enough that I would easily recommend it to friends. Aroma / Appearance - The bubbling golden body was glazed by a white head. Dried banana chips, raspberries and white bread were the strongest elements. It is summarized best as liquid banana nut bread. I prefer my hefeweizens to be a bit fruitier but this one isn’t bad. Flavor / Palate - Banana, chocolate chips, spices (orange zest and nutmeg) hit the senses after a brief delay. The aftertaste is firmly banana and hangs heavy in the throat. The total experience is creamy and filling but yet somehow just a bit dulled. I don’t know if it is because I like my beers more crisp and vibrant or this one just doesn’t stand out but I found it hard to get excited. It’s not bad by any stretch. I just don’t know that I would rush to try it again.

Fox Chinook;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);The Fox and Hounds, Heacham (the brewery/tap). Orange gold with a slight haze and thinning head. Brazen grapefruit aroma punching with citrus and fibrous hop resins. Soft and earthy in the mouth with Oakham-like zest and pith aplenty, and a late flourish of softening pale malt digestive sweetness.

Trout River Dominator Doppelbock;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Trout River Brewing Company;"6 ounce draught sample at the Vermont Brewer’s Fest (July 2007). Very little head sticks around atop the murky caramel body, little to no lacing....big caramel aroma, bit of cherry, blackberry and tobacco; not too dissimilar from the Weizenbock, I’d guess the same yeast and similar (barley) malts; and like that, it portends good things to come....which alas are not evident in the flaccid, sour and lactic body, which is a bit sweet at the front but quickly goes wrong; there’s also a ""dirtiness"" to it that strikes me as indicative of poor sanitation, in this case probably at the festival as all 3 of TR’s beers that I tried were off to one degree or another. Too bad, for once they were one of the breweries I was most looking forward to."

Mouthfeel is light bodied, citrusy, with orange and lemon grazing the palate towards a dry finish. More funk beers, please!

It has a quite pleasant aroma of malt and cereals, of moderate intensity. The body is lean and the mouthfeel is dry; there is some malt flavor with appreciated but mild crispy tones; the bitterness is quite strong, but the hop doesn’t come with adequate aromatic qualities. It’s a honest Pilsner, able to provide the necessary refreshment, although without thrills. 2010-11-28, draught at the brauhaus, 5-4-6-3-10=28 Hazy blond color; compact head. Quite strong aroma of butter. The mouthfeel is quite dry; there is not much malt flavor, but at least a quite strong bitterness, with limited hop qualities too; unfortunately the diacetyl is almost unbearable; the final is too bitter. Rough. 2007-06-13, draught at the brauhaus, 6-3-6-3-11=29 Cloudy blond color; creamy head. The malt/hop aroma (classic German) is light. The body, as the others, is soft, there are only traces of crispy malt and aromatic hops; it reminds me the many Pils brewed in buy-the-equipment-and-brew-by-yourself around Europe. Not bad, but too simple."

As for the Märzen, the aroma is mellow, sweet, but maybe here there is a hint of hop. Also the flavor is a notch better than the Märzen, still similar; soft mouthfeel, sweet, some malt taste, very light fruitiness from the yeast, some more bitterness. Drinkable."

Aroma of lightly sweet and roasty dark malts with some grainy character and a hint of noble hops. Body starts with good fullness and carbonation with a grainy dark malty sweetness and some mild bitter balance. Has a lingering roasty coffee finish. Pretty true to style and drinkable.
Capitol City Schwarzbier;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Capitol City Brewing Company;On cask at the Shirlington location. Pour was typical for the style although the color wasn’t as deep and black as I was anticipating, more on the dark brown side of things. The aroma was chocolate cocoa and some licorice. The flavor followed the aroma with some cocoa chocolate, licorice and munich type malts mixed in underneath to the point where this pulled up just short of the depth of a schwarz, getting stuck in between a dunkel and schwarzbier? Mouthfeel was malty but semi-dry, fairly drinkable.
Capitol City Schwarzbier;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Capitol City Brewing Company;Cask at the Shirlington location. Clear, dark brown with a beige head that lasts to the bottom, somehow leaving no lace. Roasty and lightly smoky nose, a bit nutty. Mild flavor, roasty, light charcoal, caramel. A rather drinkable Schwarz, but nothing spectacular.

Pours a transparent dark brown with a whispy white head. Aroma of toasted malts, some fruitiness, grains. Flavor has more of the same, toasted grains, caramel. Thin on the tongue.

Big Horse Flora;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Big Horse Brewing;Flora is the name for the house single hop brew. Mine was Summit. Hazy light amber colour. Light woody nose with a hint of lemon. Lots of woody flavours...it would appear that Summit is a great bittering hop, but not so much on the aroma as that part of the beer is AWOL. Judging from Jordan’s comments it would appear the structure of the beer - very scant pale malt backbone backing a big hop profile, is the M.O. and the only real changes are going to be the profile of the specific hop. And that’s how a single-hop beer series should be.
Big Horse Flora;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Big Horse Brewing;On Tap at the Brewpub pours out a ligth hazy yellow topped with a nice little head. A little floral hops on the aroma. pretty cool beer.

Middle Ages 12th Anniversary Imperial Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Middle Ages Brewing;"on-tap in a tulip snifter at Hop Devil Grill’s ""Daze of the Devil"" festival, 1/19/08 A: As served, this beer is a roasty dark brown. Light does not go where this beer’s soul lies! A nice ample 2-finger beige head weighs in, and slowly dissipates over time, leaving a moderate amount of nice, sticky lacing. S: I was a bit taken back by how richly chocolate this beer smelt; I expected the almost burnt roasted aromas, but not the chocolate! A nice oaked character present as well. T/M: Big alcohol bite up front, quickly warms and gives way that roasted cocoa flavoring and a syrupy cherry-like finish. Alcohol remains present, but tight carbonation and smooth, velvety feel help make this an easy-drinker. D: Very easy to drink, especially after one’s palate adjusts to the slight booziness. 9% though, so not a session beer. Quite good, seek this one out."

Words to describe this beer are toasted malts, caramel, light banana, light cloves, hint off, some alcohol.
Heavy Seas Mutiny Fleet Hang Ten;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;At first I wasn't too into this beer, but by the last of the 4-pack, it grew on me somwehat. Definitely meant for sipping. Has a redish-brown cloudy appearance. Almost like an unfiltered cider. Fruity and wheaty aroma...on the sour side. Lots going on with the flavor....fruits, wheat, some caramel malt, and medium hops. There are better beers out there in this style (mainly imports from Belgian, etc.). But for a domestic microbrew and for the price, it really is a decent brew. I have enjoyed all the Heavy Seas, and am liking Clipper City.
Heavy Seas Mutiny Fleet Hang Ten;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Catch up rating. Color is cloudy caramel-brown. Reddish orange hues, with a big foamy head sitting high. Tall head leaving sticky spots all over the top of the glass. Lots of fruits in the nose, mainly banana. Sweat malt and hints of clove and mild spices. Taste is sweet malt and bananas. Spiced alcohol, slightly nutty. Bitter hop twist and and alcohol kick. Booze soaked raisins as well.
Heavy Seas Mutiny Fleet Hang Ten;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;"Bottle: best by feb ’08 Pours nearly clear, red-brown with a small tan head. Aroma is sweet...dark, ripe fruit, spiced wheat. Taste is also sweet, dark caramel malt, dark fruit, baked bread, yeast, a little booze. A little funkiness....raisin... thickly sweet. Very smooth...not too flat for such an advanced age of a specimen...still has a little tickle of carbonation....a little ""agey"" tang...but no oxidation or spoiling. Pretty impressive for such a relic."
Heavy Seas Mutiny Fleet Hang Ten;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;I must have seen this one in the store about a million times over the years but have never taken the plunge until now. It’s time to surf the waves dude!: Ap: EXTREMELY cloudy dark brown, with a slight hazy head, and moderate carbonation. Ar: It smells like some sort of ultra, ultra, ultra sweet caramel candy. A hint of banana adds to the funkiness. T: The overbearing sweetness is really hitting me hard upfront. I can only detect wheat if I really concentrate on it. The more I drink of it, I start to get a mild nuttiness. P: Kind of syrupy, with the alcohol burning after about the 4th or 5th sip. O: Not very....the sugariness is just way too over the top for my tastes. However, I’m willing to admit that this style just may not be my cup of tea...or beer.
Heavy Seas Mutiny Fleet Hang Ten;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Refrigerated 2011 brown bomber poured into a weizen glass. Pours translucent medium brown at top which transitions to light brown at the bottom with small beige head. Little lacing, medium body, lighter carbonation, and rich dark fruit aroma. Taste is caramel, dark fruit (mostly raisin with some fig), roasted malt, nuts, some banana, and some alcohol. Pretty heavy but not in a real bad way, alcohol is not covered or I would rate this one much higher. Blind taste test and I would have said a dark strong belgian ale.
Heavy Seas Mutiny Fleet Hang Ten;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a Belgian style tulip. Pours a dark amber color with a very nice, creamy, beige head of foam. Nice retention. Aroma is big on the dark fruits and dried and candied fruits. Raisins and some plum come through. I don’t get much in the way of esters here, unfortunately. The taste is malty sweetness with more of the raisiny notes mentioned before. This beer is pretty good, but if a person had given it to me blindly and said it was a barley wine, I would have believed them.

The aroma offers up prunes, brown sugar and molasses. The taste delivers a pulse of cherry, dates and prune fruity sweetness leading to brown sugar and molasses. To midway a nice yet modest in strength kettle caramelization creates another tasty facet to the experience. This is a real nice English barelywine sipper.

Odell Double IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Odell Brewing Company;Poured from a growler on a hot day. Goes down easy. Maybe too easy. Glad I am not driving.
Odell Double IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Odell Brewing Company;Draught keg at Head of Steam, Durham. Amber body. Medium white head. Nose is hops, alcohol, citrus, pine, spice. Bittersweet. Dry finish.
Odell Double IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Odell Brewing Company;Thought I loved the Odell IPA so gave this a try. The hop nose was nonexistent. The color was cloudy. I can’t put my finger on it but there was an overall bitter flavor that I have to say did not taste like hop alpha lupulin. Tasted more like a soapy flavor. I really did not like this double IPA and I drink a lot of Titan by Great Divide, Arogant Bastard by Stone and similar brews by Epic and others. I don’t know if someone didn’t rinse the kegs or if the Mash temperature got over 170. There are lots of ways to goof up a batch of beer. My wife tasted citrus notes in this brew. This brew lacked the floral nose I was expecting, the sweet nectar of malt was not apparant because there was the other flavor I previously described. I am wondering if this batch or keg had a bacterial infection. The haze and off flavors tell me something went wrong. I’ll try it again somewhere before I put a nail in the coffin for Odell’s double IPA

Stonecutters Red Ale;Barre, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stonecutters Brewhouse (formerly Granite City Brew Pub);Objectively speaking: A problematic brown ale with no roastiness. I like: Terrible beer. I dislike: Murky reddish brown, depressingly headless. Rather lifeless yeasty palate. Highly watery body.
Stonecutters Red Ale;Barre, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stonecutters Brewhouse (formerly Granite City Brew Pub);Draft at the Brew Pub - Poured a very cloudy brown in color (not red at all).

Stonecutters Boom Derrick Brown Ale;Barre, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Stonecutters Brewhouse (formerly Granite City Brew Pub);Draft at the Brew Pub - Poured an almost clear dark brown amber in color with a very small tan head that faded. Little carbonation. Some chill haze to cloud it. Aroma was malty with a hint of nuttiness and mild hops. Flavor tracked the aroma pretty closely. Mildly bitter with a pleasant nutty/maltiness that carried through to the end. A bit watery. Mildly bitter on the finish. OK, but needs some work still. I’ll be back to try it again soon.
Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;When somebody types a beer as a Smoke Chocolate Chipotle Porter, you know I have to give it a whirl. They pretty much nailed it as there’s a definite spicy kick to the start of the flavor that mellows out into a smoky malt and finishes with chocolate overtones. The overall flavors were kinda weak though leaving me unfulfilled and although I liked the idea, the flavors just didn’t mesh that well together.
Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Pours the color of cola with a thin beige head. Aroma of salty smoke and nice roast. Roasted malts and a nice medium smoke effect. A little thin and watery perhaps.
Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Brown-black with a ring of head. Hints of spice and licorice swirl around a black patent centric roast. Flavor quality diminished by strong burnt charcoal note and dank sock character.

Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;"Draft at the Diamond Knot brewhouse. Black. Thin but solid-looking grayish head with bountiful lace. Not much nose happening, pleasant or unpleasant. Great body, though; just starting to creep out of the medium range (but only just). Roasty and patenty, kinda acrid, even, right from the attack. Creamy and chocolately but definitely not to the detriment of the roastiness. Light cocoa finish. Nice enough."
Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Draft at Diamond Knot Brewery. Pours a dark brown with a tan head on top. Aroma is of roasted coffee, vanilla, and malts. Flavor is very watered down with vanilla, roasted malt, and coffee sneaking in. Lacking way to much on the palate as well.
Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Draft at Stix. Deep, rich brown. Thin, light tan head. Roasted coffee flavor. More soda-like carbonation than most porters gives this the feeling of a pale ale, but the flavor’s all porter. Toasted malts, clean finish. I don’t know why nobody else likes this one, but I sure did.
Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;On Draught at Washington Brewers Festival. Aroma has some phenols and fruity malt forward. Dark brown, with a tan head, ok retention. Flavor is dried fruit forward, some roast bite, slightly metallic and sour. Body is medium/full, with very low carb texture. Was definitely put off by some strange sourness and bad roast feel.
Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Tap at fest : I probably wouldn’t have tried this, but at the Festival, they were the only place that had any kind of palate cleanser (pretzels). It was brown with a loose fast fading head. Light and thin, no noticeable roast, seemed like a bland brown ale
Stix Pool Shark Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;This is a very unusual interpretation of the style. On a blind tasting I would have pegged this as a sweet stout. It has a full, slightly syrupy body and seems way to roasty for a porter, but they list it as a porter, so what are ya gonna do. Lots of vanilla/nut/coffee in the middle leading to an espresso finish. As a porter it’s an OK stout.
Icefiord Cloudberry Ale;Ilulissat, Greenland;Flavored - Fruit;Icefiord Bryghus;Enjoyed at the Icefjord Bryghus in lovely Ilulissat, Greenland. Tastes like it has no hops.

Kelt 10%;Hurbanovo, Slovakia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Slovensko;Angeblich wurde Tschechien und die Slowakei unter anderem von den Kelten besiedelt. Diese errichteten in der Nähe des heutigen Bratislava eine Siedlung. Ob das wahr ist weiß ich nicht, aber dieses Bier ist ihnen gewidmet. Ich trank meine Dose dieses Biers als ich an der Grenze Vyšné Nemecké warten musste. Es ist ein einfaches Zehngrädiges, das anfangs einen komischen süßlichen Geschmack hat, aber je mehr man davon trinkt, umso bekömmlicher wird es. Bestimmt kein besonders weiter Wurf, aber doch gut trinkbar.

Light copper and clear under bubbly white that quickly drops to some patches and a ring. Cardboardy hay with only slight hops flavour. The only redeeming quality of this beer is that the bitterness is not overboard for the lack of malt and hops flavour. Light body, moderate carbonation, crisp and clean finish.

This was easily amongst my favourites of 100+ beers tried in Austria. From what I think I understood, they brewed it using no basic pale malt and went for only specialty ones, though obviously munich and Vienna would be a fair proportion of the grain bill. That explains the “pure” from the name. I found it malt profile to be fabulous, very complex, fruity lager with a profound, spot on toastiness and beautifully nuances all throughout. And for all its maltiness and shy hops, it never becomes to sweet. Subtlety as an art.

Cerveza Regional Draft;Maracaibo, Venezuela;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecería Regional;Better than regular Regional, but mostly it’s just a thirst-quencher made to be consumed in enormous quantities.
Cerveza Regional Draft;Maracaibo, Venezuela;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecería Regional;Pale golden look with average white head. Light grassy aroma. Refreshing, light sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour. Short aftertaste. Average lager. This one is especially popular in night clubs and in baseball games of Caracas stadium. Fashion marketing, but with decent taste.
Cerveza Regional Draft;Maracaibo, Venezuela;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecería Regional;Can – 250 ml. - Has a golden and yellowish color. The aroma is good enough, hoppy. Has head small, very rapid, but with a decent cord. In the palate the herbs are well-known, ultimately it becomes rather tart, but it is surprisingly dry. Has an average, luminous and transparent body. I would say that it is a beer that leaves a pleasant viciousness. It is better than the regional normal beer.
Milton Iconic;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Milton Brewery;Cask, Last Plantagenet, Leicester. Hazy gold with a dense head. Aromas are dry with bitter grapefruit.

Wyre Piddle Marcos King of the Watusi;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;Clear light amber. Lacy, lasting white head. Little aroma manages to peak through the foam. Still, a pretty hoppy ale in mouth where a mineral and floral bitterness displays the bittering intentions. Pretty bland grainy malts fail to excite or provide more than minimal support. Average.

Steelhead U.C.I.P.A.;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;"On tap at the brewery in boringville. Chalk board said ""low"" so this HAS to be a super old batch that should have been dumped. No way it deserves even the less than stellar reviews if everyone on here had this beer. Pours a hazy orange with no head served in a pint glass. Aroma is bread, slight paper to cardboard and some stale malt. Taste is bread, malt, diacetyl and no hop presence at all. I wouldn’t even guess this was an IPA but rather a golden amber or something. This was the last chance for anything at Steelhead. Done."
Steelhead U.C.I.P.A.;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Clear orange pour with a white head. Butter, orange, and bready malts on the nose. Some cracker malts, light pine, and some grass. Flavor has a touch of citrus to it, but too much diacytel flavor. Some bread, a bit of cracker, and a mild pine bitterness. Light herbal and floral hop notes. Kind of acidic as it warms, too.
Steelhead U.C.I.P.A.;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Tasted on 1/23/11 on draft at Steelhead Irvine. Pours cloudy golden with a thin white head that leaves a thin collar of lace. The nose is citrus and floral hops with a good amount of bread and hay malts. The flavor starts off with a hint of caramel, moving to the bread and hay, and then finishing with a good dose of the floral and lemon citrus hops. The body is medium and somewhat sticky with average carbonation and a long bitter hops finish.
Steelhead U.C.I.P.A.;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Tap at the Irvine location. Rating #7. Hazy glowing orange with a nice lacing white head. Resiny and a bit piney. Fruity, tropical fruit as a matter of fact, light citrus and tasty. (1388)

Steelhead U.C.I.P.A.;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;OC tour, tap at Irvine brewpub: Slightly hazy golden hue with frothy head and okay lace. The aroma has notes of piney citric hops, biscuit and cardboardy malt, allspice, and cobweb. The taste is moderate bitter over chalky pale malts, nutty and has a hint of citric twang. The mouth feel is dry and snappy. A drinkable IPA methinks.
Steelhead U.C.I.P.A.;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Had this a while back and forgot to rate. This one was on tap at the Irvine, CA location. It had apparently just won an award at the GABF. It was an unfiltered looking IPA. Was a murky orange/brown color. Aroma was nice and hoppy. Lots of grapefruit and citrus. Flavor was much of the same. Nice hop bitterness. Mildly malty for balance purposes, but it was pretty much hop favored. It was my favorite of their brews at the Irvine location.

Double Mountain Hop Lava;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Good enough if all other IPAs are sold out but not the hop monster I was hoping for. I admit I love extremely hoppy beers like Rogue 8 hop.
Double Mountain Hop Lava;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Bottle shared with Ladi at Bad flash on his historic last day at work. Picked up this and the IRA and had them side by side. both were disappointing honestly but I think the IRA was narrowly better. It’s a decent beer. Went down smooth but the hop levels were not fit for purpose. Picking up an IPA from Oregon, I mistakenly believed the hops would dominate.
Double Mountain Hop Lava;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Tap at Woodstock. A: Cloudy copper with a thin white head.

O: Standard IPA, but one that’s a lot more refined than I remember.
Double Mountain Hop Lava;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;"West Coast IPA from a 50 cl bottle; at more than one and a half year of age, this is clearly too old for an American IPA, but anyway, I promise I won’t let this get in the way of my appreciation of this Oregon micro brewery, which is completely new to me. Thick and frothy, irregularly edged, egg-white head, thinning but remaining closed for a long time and leaving patches of thick ’membranous’ lacing around the edge, clearly hops-enhanced, crowning a ’sunset’ orange hued, deep and warm golden beer with tiny strings of fizz here and there, lightly hazy, turning equally cloudy and even more intensely ’sunset orange’ with sediment. Aroma is already faded due to age, but still breathes the remnants of powerful hops over a firm malty background, with impressions of moist white pepper, old pine branches, grapefruit peel, ginger powder, dried wormwood, tonic water, old bread crust and dito biscuit, dried out orange flesh, faint hints of parsley, gin, lemon zest, straw, cold fried chicken skin, cardboard, soap. Sweetish fruit in the onset, traces of apricot, apple and vague orange sweetness but everything rather subdued, with a sourish edge as well as the first signs of grapefruity hop bitterness; carbonation remains very soft, a bit too soft even for this style, to my taste at least, but tingles very subtly on the sides of the tongue. Smooth, lightly oily, very supple, soft mouthfeel. Soft cereally sweetish core with a clear toasted edge, gaining some strength in the finish just as the hops, that have been developing in bitterness right from the start, take over completely and ensure a long, spicy, leafy, ’bright green’ bitterness coating the back of the mouth, resinous and tonic water-like with retronasal hints of grapefruit peel and pine, while some juicy maltiness peeps through in the very end; alcohol remains practically hidden. The aroma is clearly suffering from age after 1.5 years on a shelf - unsurprisingly, of course - and showing the first signs of oxidation, apart from having largely lost the more delicate Cascade and Centennial features it must doubtlessly have when fresh; still, based on experience alone, I can feel that this must have been a solid IPA when young, with a firm toasted edge in its malt department to support a strong, rooty and spicy hop bitterness that lasts for a long time. It is that basic bitterness that has remained firmly in place so in the mouth, this beer still behaves more than decent for its style. Too bad for the faded and withering aroma, I’d love to taste this young and ’green’, but from a merely didactical point of view, it is also interesting to taste an IPA at this age if only to experience first hand what age does with it. As for style: this is about as West Coast as it gets even at this age."
Double Mountain Hop Lava;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;"Bottle 50cl. poured into a pint glass.

Double Mountain Hop Lava;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Decent IPA. Tasty enough. Some hops, not overwhelming though. Not bad, but could be better.
Double Mountain Hop Lava;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Bottle from PCC Fremont Seattle. Pours clear deep amber with off-white head. Nose is spicy pine resin with some caramel malt. Flavor is very big - a rush of very fresh tasting alpha acid-infused maltiness, just slightly sweet but also quite rich. Good backbone. Aftertaste is long-lingering hop resin fruity bitterness. Another spectacular IPA from my favor PNW Coast ale brewers. They deserve accolades for every single beer I’ve tried since moving to the PNW - Killer Green, The Vaporizer, etc.- each has its own character and each is a new, distinct and bold contribution to a world oversaturated with mediocre IPAs. I’ve stopped rating beers after ten years of seeking out the best and brightest- and I just have to return to rave about this brewery.

Iron Horse Cream Ale;Ellensburg, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Iron Horse Brewery;FYI I am rating this beer based on it’s style. This cream ale pours brilliantly clear and with a minimal amount of head that is pure white. Slight DMS in the aroma (which is accurate to style) and with a slight sweetness. It drinks clean and dry. There is a very subtle hint of noble American hops that gives off a slight amount of citrus, grass, and hay. Flavor is crisp and clean, low-carbonate water gives off the impression of a softer beer. A true American’s lawnmower beer! Cream ales are hard to find these days, especially fresh, and well-made versions. Wish the carbonation was increased a bit to enhance the impression of a spritzy, refreshing, summer guzzler.
Iron Horse Cream Ale;Ellensburg, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Iron Horse Brewery;Aroma is adjunct laden bready malt sweetness. Pours a hazy yellow gold with a nice head. Smooth flavors with a light ale sweetness, some corn and a crisp finish. Drinks well and is flavorful for what it is. I like cream ales and I enjoyed this one, my only complaint is that it might have been a little too adjuncty.
Iron Horse Cream Ale;Ellensburg, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Iron Horse Brewery;9/8/07 On draught at the brewery. Aroma and flavor are well blended between slight sourness, sweetness of malt and a very round hop character. Texture has a light creaminess and low bite of any kind.
Iron Horse Cream Ale;Ellensburg, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Iron Horse Brewery;Golden yellow colored pour with medium sized head. This had a malty aroma with some citrus. A slight hoppy sweet finish. Not bad at all.
Iron Horse Cream Ale;Ellensburg, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Iron Horse Brewery;Very light golden color. A good session beer at about 4%. Light and very drinkable on a hot day. A very ight citrus aroma with a very clean finish. Not enough hops for this hop head but could throw back a couple of these while washing the old truck!
Iron Horse Cream Ale;Ellensburg, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Iron Horse Brewery;2007 - Washington Brewers Festival – Kenmore WA A light golden yellow clear through the glass with a thin head. This beer was light and refreshing and had a great malt background. Loved the mild hops and the crisp finish was great. Had a slight fruity nose to the finish. Good beer.
McMenamins Solar Flare;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Had this at Thompsons as Solar Wheat. I am guessing it is the same brew. Hazy dark golden with a lovelly bubbly eggshell white head. McMenamins always look good in the imperial pint glass. Aroma as usual is subdued bready malts a little hop but not unpleasing Taste i was expecting more whet and clove, but this is typical golden ale/American wheat crossover territory..sweet, caramel and a touch of hop..not horrific but very average. Actually not too thin on the palate ompred to many from this brewer.\ Overall a very average brew ..the only big PLUS being the green power aspect. So a tentative thumbs up(ish).

McMenamins Solar Flare;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;For a beer that is made entirely with solar power, its tasty. Nothing exciting, a simple golden ale, perhaps a bit more spicy.
McMenamins Solar Flare;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught, Six ArmsLight golden-amber. Limey, orangey, peppery aroma. Massive ginger flavour. Maybe there’s some pepper or cardamom in there but this is really heavy on the ginger. Quick, refreshing finish.

Diamond Knot Dortmunder (DKD);Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Diamond Knot Brewery;Sampled this one on draught at the brewpub in Mukilteo, WA. Pours to a beautiful, bright, golden color, with a tight, white head that fades, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is well balanced, with good, crisp, pale malt aroma, paired with fresh, grassy/herbal hop aromas. Palate is fairly clean with some good pale malt flavors, but becomes muddled, with some estery fruitness, that is a flaw in this style of beer. This beer finishes with more pale malt, and some estery fruit flavor up front, then ends with some grassy hop bitterenss to balance. Stylistically, this beer could have been cleaner, and the esters were clearly a flaw. Tasty enough brew, but no a great example of dortmunder.
Diamond Knot Dortmunder (DKD);Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Diamond Knot Brewery;Clear golden body. Thick, low head. Fresh malty aroma with light herbal hops. Er...fruity, off-flavour of too warm fermentation. This smelled so promising but really came unglued. Damn.
Stix One Ball Weiss;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Dark cloudy golden with thin head. Wheat aroma with a bit of citrus and fruit. Light bodied. OK.
Stix One Ball Weiss;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Draft. Cloudy dark orange color. Mild fruity nose with more roasted undertones than most hefe’s. The taste is almost as much pale ale as hefe with caramel flavors blending with citrus and hops. Interesting, but doesn’t leave a clean feeling in the mouth. Interesting, and a good effort, but not quite perfect.
Stix One Ball Weiss;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;9/26/07 On draught at Larry’s brewing supply, Kent, Wa. Aroma is caramel and fruity esters forward. Appearance is a hazy gold with a good off-white head. Flavor is very fruity banana with very light malt character. Mouthfeel is fairly watery with medium body and almost no carb bite. Overall, very easy drinking, but definitely needs more texture and bite.
Stix One Ball Weiss;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Amber in color, loose beige head. Lightly spiced banana nose.More banana in the taste, but quite thin and undercarbonated.
Stix One Ball Weiss;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Hazy dark amber colour. Somewhat loose head. The aroma is of banana, cinnamon and pale malt. As it warms it really picks up some Schneidery yeast notes. The body is thin and this does it great disservice on the palate as it comes across slightly toasty & fruity but gutless. Weissbier needs sugars. The finish is watery. Not sure how many of these I could sink.
Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Nice dark yellow color. Strong hop taste like a IPA should have. However it's smoother than most. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Taps clear topaz with a fair ivory head. Aroma yields fresh malt and a little resiny hops. Much bolder flavor presents piney hops, fresh malt, a hint of citrus. Texture offers fair body and fizz. Not the best IPA out there, but number it among those worthy of at least a snort.
Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Sampled at the brewpub on my honeymoon - It pours lightly hazy golden with a white head. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation. The taste has pale malt, floral notes and spicy hops. the finish has dried leaves and is fairly woody. Decent.

Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Pours s clear yellow Amber. Good lacing. Taste has a strange note of fresh mint. Maybe celery.
Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Appearance: Medium amber. Slightly hazy. Finger of white foam. Nose: Light hop aroma. Grass, citrus and some floral. Lightly roasted malt. Taste: mildly bittersweet grass and citrus hops with lightly sweet caramel. Body: medium to lighter, nitro bubbles. Parting thoughts: I did have this on the nitro tap. The creamy texture was classic nitro. I feel like it might have detracted a bit from this more subtle ale.
Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Draft flight at Ram Columbus on June 22, 2017. Medium dark orange/amber hue, sweet somewhat medicinal aroma, somewhat soapy/malty taste with very little hop character. Pass!
Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"Draft to taster at the Fishers brewpub. Looks decent; a transparent golden orange with white lacing. Smells and tastes of aged fruity and grassy hops with a mildly bittersweet backbone. A touch of spice on the tongue as well. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. An inoffensive but underwhelming example of the style."
Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);An okay pale ale. Tried this during HILT in Indianapolis in 2016. Mild and citrusy. Well balanced with caramel sweetness.
Big Horn '71 Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Draft at source. Aroma is very floral and fruity with light citrus hop notes. Not a bad aroma. Fairly hazy orange with minimal white head. Initially bitter followed by a supporting malt but not caramel sweet. Light bread. Hop flavor is very floral like the nose, roses. Decent enough beer but I don’t care for the hops.
Big Time Firecracker Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Pours a nice amber hue. A good amount of malt, caramel, with a nice hop bitterness. Pretty nice.
Big Time Firecracker Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Full-bodied, as the description claims. Pours cloudy amber with a hearty head. Heavy malt presence is very well balanced by plenty of hops. This is heavier and more flavorful than a typical pale ale. Pretty good.
Big Time Firecracker Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Biscuit, grainy malt aromas with some pepperry, floral hops too. Pours amber with a decent thin head. Flavors of grainy buttery malt and peppery, aspiriny, and floral hops. Did not really do it for me.
Big Time Firecracker Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Draft at Brouwer’s. Hazy dark coppery amber with a thin whitish head. Butter, caramel, and piney hops on the nose. Rich, creamy, buttery body. Active, lively carb. Caramel, butter, toast, butter, and piney hops on the mid-palate. Serious QA issues with this batch. Gonna hafta re-rate at some point.
Big Time Firecracker Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Easy light bronze color with filmy head. Very mild hop aroma of perhaps Willamette or Mt. Hood. Not the firecracker of explosive hop flavors for which I had hoped. A mild, slightly light-bodied APA that is rather boring for the PNW.
Big Time Firecracker Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;"Draught pint at Redbones on 11/15/07 Chill-hazed amber/peach-golden body is well carbonated and topped by a neatly retained white head that leaves moderate lacing. Hoppy nose, of course, with a full floral aroma and plentiful orange, lemon and grapefruit brace on the finish. Some traces of ""hop tea"" in the nose, but lightly sweet vanilla-honey malts help disperse those suggestions and provide a balance. Some fresh yeast adds a light papery blandness on the finish. Liberally hopped in the nose, but I think some deeper malt sweetness would allow the hop aromatics to unfold better. As is, there’s too much exposed bitterness that dominates. No flaws, alcohol. Flavor, then, is not surprisingly quite bitter. Not too much so, I guess (though more than I prefer), but the malt is more woody than it is sugary, which seems unfavorable here, as it allows a lot of tea-like bitterness and near astringency on the finish. Tons of grapefruit and lemon. As it warms, more honeyish and graham cracker-like maltiness emerges, allowing for more balance. Really clean, with perfect carbonation and an unfiltered, almost chewy texture. Good, if rather mundane."
Big Time Firecracker Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;On CASK at Big Time Brewery Seattle, For a Ohio State Football game. Pours out a hazy amber topped with a white head. Light floral and citrus hops. A pretty bitter end. Pretty tasty from CASK.
Big Time Firecracker Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Tap at the Big Time. Cloudy orange-brown with a nice head. The first glass of this was awesome: nice nose, fruity, lots of citrus hop flavor without the aggressiveness of most IPAs, a splendid session-style beer. After a glass of Scarlet Fire to put it into context, the second glass was still pretty darn good, though weaker on the front and more metallic-bitter on the back than that classic IPA.

Schooner Exact Regrade Pale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Schooner Exact Brewing Co.;A light hop aroma with some malt. Flavor is a bit plain. Some hops but really pretty smooth. Almost a bit flat. The finish is just blah, leaves things to be desired.
Schooner Exact Regrade Pale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Schooner Exact Brewing Co.;Tap @ Parkway. Clear, light gold pour with a short white head leaving heavy lace. Toasty, medium-light body with a musty, bitter-umami hoppiness. Not a bad APA, but more like a golden to me. A solid standby from an up and coming brewery.
Schooner Exact Regrade Pale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Schooner Exact Brewing Co.;Clear golden pour with a loose, sudsy white head, falls to a frayed fringe about the edges. Smells a little floral, earthy, grassy. Oddly nutty, toasty malt flavor on a light body. Hop flavor is more earthy, grassy, herbal, slightly soapy, with a mildly resinous bitter finish. This is a pretty easy sipper, but a little off in flavor.

Hazy gold pour with a brief, short head which leaves a moderate coarse lace. Resinous hop nose transitions into a nutty, toasty medium body with a light-roasted malt sweetness.

Schooner Exact Regrade Pale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Schooner Exact Brewing Co.;Gold colored brew with a thin head. Aroma was very similar to their IPA to me.

Iron Horse Quilter's Irish Death;Ellensburg, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Iron Horse Brewery;12 oz can. Can says it all “dark smooth ale”. It is smooth as heck. On the sweet side due to massive malting. Tiny tiny hop detection. Sips nearly like a Russian Imperial Stout, but ‘only’ 7.8 abv. In that realm, I guess it could be considered relatively ‘sessionable’.

The beer in glass is orange-yellow and medium cloudy, which loses its head, unfortunately, very fast. The smell is yeasty clovy. Starts very yeasty, subtle clove flavor, while very spicy effect. Towards the middle part it gets a little fruity, tangy, what does the whole very good. The finish is then fermented fruity, sour becoming minimal.

McKenzie Glacier IPA;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;McKenzie Brew House;Chadds Ford. Poured a medium amber color body with a small slippery off-white head. The aroma was a sweet resiny pine with someflral notes and a little sourdough. The flavors are mostly sticky grapefruit and resiny pine with a little citrus and some mild yeast. Good enough for me to take home a growler.
McKenzie Glacier IPA;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;McKenzie Brew House;Draft at Chadds Ford. The pour was deep copper with off-white head. The aroma was hoppy, piney, tannic, with not a lot of malt. It looked very good and smelled pretty good, but the taste was rather weak in the malt department, giving a sort of hoppy iced tea flavor, but not sweet. This isn’t one I’d quaff again.
Fort Street Hendrix Hefeweizen;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: Nice banana aroma with light bubblegum and hints of citrus.

Drafting Room 13th Anniversary Lager;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Tröegs Brewing Company;On tap at the D Room. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a medium creamy lacing white head. Aroma of light citrus, floral, cereal grains and pretzels. Lots of hop flavor and bitterness, some grapefruit, bready and piney. Being a lager there is not a whole lot of fruitiness so the hop flavor and bitterest is up front.
Drafting Room 13th Anniversary Lager;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Tröegs Brewing Company;Tap. Yellow with nice white head. Aroma was pilsner like. Malty note throughout. The taste was pretty firm with some sweetness. citrus hop finish. Thicker. The sign stated that this was an imperial pilsner.....thats what it looked and tasted like, not a european strong ale.
Drafting Room 13th Anniversary Lager;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Tröegs Brewing Company;"As far as ""regular ol-"" lagers go, this is one of the best, a dark golden color with a modest white head, left a nice lacing around the glass, nose of wheat, slight citrus & bread, flavors of grapefruit, caramel & toast, full-bodied, got that ""full"" feeling after finishing a pint of this, a very well-done lager"
Drafting Room 13th Anniversary Lager;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Tröegs Brewing Company;Clear golden body with a clean foamy white head. Citrusy pineapple aroma with sourdough and hay notes. Doughy pale malt background in the flaovr, plus abundant fresh hops. Has a vague lemony-cat box quality. Lightly sweet with some notable tartness and developing bitterness. A big, hoppy pilsner. This is a little rough around the edges, but grew on me.
Drafting Room 13th Anniversary Lager;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Tröegs Brewing Company;Poured a hazy dark golden color with a small, white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of bread, toffee malts, citrus, cereal, and floral hops.

Drafting Room 13th Anniversary Lager;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Tröegs Brewing Company;Draft at DRE. Hazy medium golden pour with 1-finger whitish head. The aroma is very hoppy and citric, with a solid amount of floral spicy peppery hints. It smelled to me like a sort of hoppy saison at first, with a lot of peppery notes. The palate is medium, crisp, and complex, with flavors of pale malt, citric hops, and a lot of finishing black pepper and some floral notes, all while stylistically retaining the pilsner signature. I had a pint, then a growler, and I’ll be going back for another growler or two of this. And, indeed, the 7% alcohol is truly well hidden. This one is great.
Drafting Room 13th Anniversary Lager;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Tröegs Brewing Company;On tap at TDR Springhouse. Happens to be my RB rating #3,200. Poured a meduim golden color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas and tastes of grass (not an overpowering grassiness), light spices, some citrus and somewhat of a honey sweetness.

Schornstein Pommern Bier Pale Ale;Pomerode (Santa Catarina), Brazil;Pale Ale - English;Cervejaria Schornstein;This pale ale is not bad, but it is not very interesting either. Malty flavour and little bitterness, weak hop aroma and taste. But it has improved, as the first time I tasted it it was all diacetyl. A little more bitterness would make it a lot better.
Schornstein Bock;Pomerode (Santa Catarina), Brazil;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cervejaria Schornstein;Hazy light brown liquid, small head. Sweet aroma of malt with hints of fruit and berries. Light body, average carbonation. Taste is sweet, a bit sour.
Elysian Pretzeldorf Weizen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Draught, Capitol HillCloudy dark amber. Not much head. Fruity aroma (banana, with hints of smoke). Whoa - really pithy hop bitterness. Fluffy body (that’s good malts) but kind of fizzy (and bad carbo). Interesting - a way overhopped weizen - but the components aren’t working all that well together. The grapefruity bitterness is doing its own thing, the sweet banana weizen is doing its own thing, but they aren’t coming together and the beer suffers as a result.

Durham White Whopper;Bowburn, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Durham Brewery;Tasted this in the Three Judges, Glasgow in April 2006. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale straw in colour with a thin creamy white head. Strong lingering aroma of dusty hops in this. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt base gives a slight digestive biscuit note with really tart grapefruit peel and lemon drop notes. Any sweetness is soon lost amid a big whack of drying hop resins sucking all the moisture out of your mouth like a wet vac. Finish is dry, astringent and very bitter with dry hop flowers evident. Not my favourite from the portfolio but if you like moisture sucking bitters then this is for you.

Aromas are carmel malts with hay, yeast and lemon. Some acidicy. Flavours are fruity with lemon, especially in marmalade form. Clean hops with spices. Fairly bitter. Apparently this is a light version of Tabatha the Knackered. I would class it as a blond ale.
Wyre Piddle Piddle on Holiday;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wyre Piddle;Bon Accord, gareth forgot to ask for the sparkler off. Aroma is minimal due to sparkler, hints of grass and herble hop. Taste is slightly acidic, going onto citrus hints and pale malts, a bit of chalkness in the mouthfeel.

Pours deep brown with a thin mocha brown head that has little retention or lacing. Starts with rich roasted malt, chocolate and coffee flavors as well as having a rich, but medium body and slick, viscous mouthfeel. Finishes quite smooth with bourbon, oak and vanilla flavors joining the rich roasted malt. May have lost a step after 11 years (especially in the body) but still quite excellent.

Deschutes Black Butte XXI;Bend, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;"Bottle via an impromptu trade with the Mitch that is mad cheers Ken; was going to save this for a special occasion with the KFC drought of 2018 and the beast from the east have fucked up my plans so I’ve decided to drink it alone, firstly it’s a shame this review will disappear along with Ratebeer I’ve gained about 2 stone because of this site which I don’t mind about because I was destined to be obese, but JoeT when we spoke you said you didn’t want to commit website suicide but you’re on that path but seriously I don’t care as long as I get to 10k, ok back to the beer it pours opaque dark brown with a thin creamy tan head, aroma has big chocolate and rich malt, taste has sweet chocolate, light bourbon, vanilla hints, very sweet, got some coconut, I like this beer,"
Deschutes Black Butte XXI;Bend, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;"Bottle at home on our last night in this house in Seattle. This week I’ve gone through XXV, XXIV, XXIII, and finally we’re down to the last bottle. I don’t know anymore why I wanted to buy all of these in the first place, or why I would want to hold onto them for so long, but those questions are irrelevant now. Dark pour with creamy brown head that dissipates to a ring but never disappears. Smells old (faded hops), but once it’s in the mouth it comes to life. Lovely milk chocolate with a surprisingly pleasant coffee backing. Moderately sweet; its age doesn’t detract at all at this point, and I can honestly say this is my favorite of the bunch. The rest ... aging did them no favors. Maybe that’s true here, too, but unlike those I’m actually enjoying this one. I guess they just don’t make them like they used to."
Deschutes Black Butte XXI;Bend, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;XXI Pours Black with dirty foam colored medium head. Big nose of roasted coffee. Flavor has dark chocolate, espresso and hints of bourbon. Nice thick body that is made to sip. From Old Notes
Deschutes Black Butte XXI;Bend, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;[Backlog 2014] Bottle courtesy of Eric at his place for a tasting. Pours a deep blackish brown body with nice thick tan head. Nose is oak, soft vanilla notes, toast, cream and coffee roast. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with notes of toasted malt, oak, bourbon, coffee roast, caramel and very faint sharpie marker.
Deschutes Black Butte XXI;Bend, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;First of all this is the XX version. Secondly, this is one of the weirdest beers I’ve ever had. Appearance is a short-lived brown head, no lace, and opaque brown black color. Aroma at first is dark ripe fruits, cocoa, coffee, lumber, leather, but soon that goes waaay bad - to a dirty public toilet! And that aroma kind of comes and goes, but it’s nasty. And when I went to take my first sip, my god, that nasty aroma was going into my mouth!! That wasn’t easy. After a bit the flavor gives way to the initial aroma qualities, plus whiskey, vanilla and a bit of tang and bitter. Body is so so as carbonation is on the flat side. Luckily the nastiness don’t persist into the finish.
Deschutes Black Butte XXI;Bend, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;Poured from the bottle into a small tasting glass, the first of many beers brought from home and popped open at Dark Lord Day 2011. Espresso brown in color and mostly opaque, save some amber highlights. A frothy, sticky, one-finger head the color of cocoa powder remains in place for a long while. Hints of bourbon and vanilla in the nose, along with tangy dark chocolate and too-old coffee, which may be a result of the beer’s age (close to two years now). A bit of Sourdough tang pops up. Interesting amounts of piney hops remain. When cold, Black Butte tastes like a mouthful of bottlecaps — it’s heavily metallic. Warm is much, much better, exhibiting espresso mingled with sweet cocoa powder and more bitter dark chocolate, as well as a bit of Sourdough bread and some pine. Smooth blend. Extremely light carbonation is all that remains. Silky, creamy, slightly chalky medium body. Alcohol in the nose. Coffee-forward porters aren’t usually the most graceful cellar beers, but Black Butte XXI is still pretty awesome after all this time.
Deschutes Black Butte XXI;Bend, Oregon, United States;Porter - Imperial;Deschutes Brewery;Bottle thanks to Rick, pours a very dark brown with small tan head. The aroma is strong roast, coffee, wood. Medium mouthfeel with strong roast, dark chocolate, wood, vanilla, held up very well.

Archers Seaside Special;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);(Cask at Wenlock Arms, London, 9 Aug 2008) Golden colour with frothy, off-white head. Fruity nose with orange, hints of dusty hops and malt sweetness. Fruity taste with notes of citrus and biscuity malt. Short, citrussy finish. Decent, but rather boring.
Archers Seaside Special;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);"Cask at the Back of Beyond (JDW), Reading. Straw colour with a white head; sweet vanilla aroma; creamy in the mouth with honey and a trace of citrus; a sweet and honeyed finish. Light and refreshing, but too sweet for me."
Archers Seaside Special;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask-conditioned at the Bag O’Nails, Bristol 19/6/07. Pale gold with slight white head. This was a bit like the old BBC Seaside Specials of the 1970s: inoffensive, superficially attractive, unmemorable and creating little impact. This had little aroma or flavour worth mentioning, but was easy enough to drink once.
Amherst Double Vision IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;This must be a big seller so freshness could not be an issue. C hop aroma, small head and lace in the glass, OK so far. Grapefruit taste but dry, chemical taste, terrible something gone wrong in a chemical factory aftertaste.Incredibly dissapointing double.
Amherst Double Vision IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;"16oz draft at the restaurant downstairs. The Amherst Brewing Company is the best place in Amherst for a burger and a beer. This beer stood out on the chalkboard. The ""double"" was underlined. The aroma was lemon, citrus, and boozy pine. The color was dark orange and brown with a small head. The flavors were pine trees, molasses, oranges, and alcohol. This was similar to the Great Divide Hercules that I had last weekend. This was by far the best ABC beer that I have had. The imperial stout was 2nd. The Puffer’s Smoked Porter is 3rd."

Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"my dad-in-law got this one at a grocery outlet, so it may be just past it’s prime, but there’s no date. the hop aroma and flavor are there, but not very floral or aromatic, and it’s a bit malt/spice/fruit heavy for my taste. medium-well bodied, ornage with small white head. even compared to east coast ipa’s, the hops (simcoe?) are overpowered by the malt and probably a little old...not the brewer’s fault, but it’s all i got. not good enough to have again."""

Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Not a fan. Nutty and Carmel taste mild hops. Malty. Pours dark orange and head doesn't stick at all. Would not have this again ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Maybe the worst IPA I have tried. Skunky and weak flavor; and not Hoppy. How could an IPA not be hoppy. I love IPAs, but shouldn’t have ventured too far from Dogfish Head or the other’s that I have been enjoying"
Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours very light, with a thin head. Head dissipates after a couple minutes. The taste is a bit alcohol-like. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and light. Overall a decent beer for the price. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);26 may 2012, bottle. Yellow, clear, occasional bubbles. Nose is cane sugar malt and slightly grassy malt. Med body and mildly fizzy. Mild grassy hops, some faint sugary malt malt. Faint grapefruit bitter finish. Meh. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz. bottle from Bert’s Better Beers. Good looking brew. Thick lacing in a somewhat transparent gold color. The nose is very lightly hopped. Mostly pale malts. Some easy malt and bread like qualities. Almost no hops in the finish. Feels very much like an APA rather than a true IPA. No way to tell the age, but I know Bert doesn’t sell old beer so…. This is a very low end IPA. Not bad, just nothing to get excited about.
Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle at home, out of my Maudite glass, thanks to Duffman for the trade! Pours clar golden bronze, with a 1-finger thick cream-coloured head, solid lacing. Nose is... offputting. Pencil shavings, vague citrus, hot metal, some grain/chaff notes here, also spent grains, almost tannic... lots of sawdust in the aroma too. Like sawdust and hot metal filings... Flavours of round clean grain, some vegetal hops, really not much going on. Almost disappointingly good after how genuinely wretched the nose was. Dreadful stuff. Avoid at all costs.
Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);bottle. sneaking f-ing pyramid brewery! always making up new breweries to try and sling their products. same average pyramid beer in a different labeled bottle. keep trying guys.........I do however appreciate the fish label.
Metolius Dolly Varden India Pale Ale;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From a bottle. I think Duffman gave me this beer from a six pack. Didn’t care for it. Not bad, but by no means good... tons of better IPAs.
Matsons XL Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;(Bottle) Very bad beer. Amber colour, weak head that disappears quickly. Aroma is sweet, tea like... Tea with lemon. Taste is very watery. In absolute distance I can taste little bit of malt and slight bitterness. Finish is like mineral water. Almost no body with high carbonation. This beer is as if someone made this half beer and half water. Week, watery and almost no features.
Matsons XL Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;Bottle. Pours a golden amber with a short-lived white head. Stale sweet grainy aroma. Watery graint palate, sweet but light, with a boxboard note in the finish. Don’t bother.
Matsons XL Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;On tap at the brewery bar. Pours golden with a fluffy dissapearing head. Little malt aroma. Slightly bitter hop palate, good malty body, clean crisp finish. Some lingering malt and hop.
Matsons XL Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;(On tap) Clear, deep golden with a creamy, white head. Lightly sweet caramel nose. Light in body, light notes of malt - everything about this beer seem light! Short and dry finish. 190208
Matsons XL Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;Tasted 27/10/2007. 5oz sampler from the brewery bar. Amber, caramelly, watery, fizzy, alcohol, sans hops. We’ve all tasted this before, haven’t we?
Matsons XL Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;330ml bottle. Little or no aroma. Moderate malty notes but no bitterness nor too sweet. Clean but uneventful.
Matsons Classic Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;"Bottle from Queens Plaza Beer & Wine 220215. Thin looking and thn in the mouth. Looks like a weak glass of cold tea. No head, very little aroma and flavour. Not sure where the ""classic"" part of the name comes into it."
Matsons Classic Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;Bottle. Clear light amber, thin brief head. Weak aroma of caramel and apples. Thin palate with weak flavours of caramel and cider. Finish is dry with a boxboard staleness. On the poor side of average.
Matsons Classic Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;On tap at brewery bar. Pours pale golden. Small malt aromas, clean body, bitter, not much hop, a bit watery. Nutty malt lingers a bit. Quite simple.
Matsons Classic Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;(On tap) Clear, amber golden with a small, white head. Sweetish malt aroma. Light in body with light notes of malt and caramel. There’s also a light, underlying acidity. The finish is dry. 190208
Matsons Classic Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;Tasted 27/10/2006. 5oz taster from tap at the brewery bar. Brown, whispy off-white head, caramelly, slight ester. Cold, quite thin and with a sugary cidery bite. Nothing wrong with this, besides the philosophy behind it’s recipe.
Matsons Classic Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Matsons;330 ml bottle. Std NZ draught colour. Slight biscuity and a damp cotton aroma. Quite malt/mealy flavours but a thin finish. Decent alternative to other mainstream offerings.
Matsons Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Matsons;This appears on the golden side of lager with minimal head from the pour into the glass. There runs an almost standard lager malt aroma with just a faint suggestion of noble hops, or I could be talking out my arse and it smells of non-noble varieties. To give it its due, it smells like a legion of standard lagers. Sadly in this age of celebrated differentiation, it isn’t enough. The flavour is a little plain with pale malt and a twinge of bitterness. Probably ideal as a quaffing beer on a warm day when critical analysis is the last thing on your mind.
Matsons Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Matsons;Drank this last night whilst watching my mates play indoor football. Forced to sit out due to a fractured ankle i thought I might as well enjoy a beer whilst i watched. bargain price of $3.50 which almost exactly matched the change in my pocket, so I was pleased, but only momentarily. Had a sip and thought ’somethings amiss here’ . It claimed it was all malt but it was so thin and wrong tasting i doubted its veracity but looking closer saw the label indicated a small amount of wheat in the grist which might account for the thin-ness in the mouth. No hops to speak of and possibly the least appealing beer I’ve had in a while. At least the boys won at football though
Matsons Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Matsons;On tap at Matson’s brewery bar. Pours golden with a thin head. Bit of malt and hop in the aroma but not very strong. Starts with bitter hops then a robust malthy body comes through which stays with you for a while. Quite a nice aftertaste which mkes you want another sip. Excellent social beer but nothing out of the ordinary.
Matsons Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Matsons;(On tap) Clear golden with a small, white head. Vaguely perfumy aroma. Light-bodied with weak malty accents. The finish is dry and lightly bitter. 190208
Matsons Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Matsons;"Tasted 27/10/2006. 5oz taster from the brewery bar. Honey malt sweetness, carbonic dryness doesn’t quite cut through, and absolutely nothing to show in the hop department. Another well made beer with ""Old school beer drinker"" written all over it. Why, oh why? Good plant, obviously well used (given that the beers are prtty clean), but there’s nothing going for these beers in the recipe."
Matsons Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Matsons;330ml bottle. Light straw golden, fair fluffy head. Faint citrus/lemon aroma. Brief but unremarkable, slight hints of dryness and flirts with wheat but nothing to test the tastebuds. Again, fairly mainstream.
CooperSmiths Kaiser Brau;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Thin head, clear dark brown body. Light nutty aroma. Taste is grassy hops, light buttery malts. Slightly toasted. Finishes light sour, molasses. Hint of burn. Light texture, slightly oily.
Harviestoun Old Engine Oil Special (Cask);Alva, Scotland;Old Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Nose is leather, wet hay, vanilla, mild chocolate, coffee, and toffee notes. Quickly disappearing head, very dark brown. Wonderfully complex flavor features everything on the nose with the addition of vinous dark fruit notes. Wonderful mouth feel which is slightly hurt by alcohol. A very nice drinking experience. I actually prefer the regular Old Engine Oil, but this is definatly a little bit more complex beer due to the dark/dried fruits and leather/vanilla notes.
Harviestoun Old Engine Oil Special (Cask);Alva, Scotland;Old Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Pours near black, perhaps very very dark brown with brown head. Nose has a clean, marshmallowy roastiness at first. Start to notice some baking chocolate too after a few whiffs. On the palate is baker’s chocolate, spirity/alcohol, and a smooth chocolate finish. The chocolate comes across in a dry way - not very sweet. Finish is a little chalky and alcoholic.
Harviestoun Old Engine Oil Special (Cask);Alva, Scotland;Old Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Roundhouse, Barrow Hill 19/05/2007 Small tan head. Black rich strong and fruity with a smooth and bitter burnt roast finish. ABV 9.0%
Harviestoun Old Engine Oil Special (Cask);Alva, Scotland;Old Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;STBF07. Beautiful beer to look at.

Tinkoff Temnoe 6.0% (Porter);St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Tinkoff;Good.. But somehow generic. (This beer rating was imported from FB and unfortunately lacks any further comments.)
Tinkoff Temnoe 6.0% (Porter);St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Tinkoff;On tap at Tinkoff Brewpub, St Petersburg. A little thin but drinkable porter. Slightly sweet caramel and some roasted malt flavour. By no means a great beer but worth a try if you’re in the area.
Tinkoff Temnoe 6.0% (Porter);St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Tinkoff;Bottled, 6.0% / 14%. Neither a porter, nor a dunkel (as his less stronger predecessor). It is probably vienna, but with lack of normal hop bitterness. Dark amber with thin head. Taste is neutral and slightly grainy and alcoholic.
Tinkoff Temnoe 6.0% (Porter);St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Tinkoff;Bottle. Brown color, little head. Fruity aroma. Sweet malty, can feel alcohol too. Aftertaste isnt long.

Nose is syrupy malts, some vanilla like wood and rye pudding. Flavor has roasted malts, quite sweet & syrupy. Some raisins and liquorice, not much hops. Medium bodied and a bit sticky palate. This one is more like a sweet dunkel.
Tinkoff Temnoe 6.0% (Porter);St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Tinkoff;Bottled Amberish brown with a very small head. Sweet toffee aroma with notes of tobacco and maybe some smoke. Dry flavour of dark, bitter chocolate. Somewhat harsh finish.

Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;Had on tap at Fitgers, with raspberry syrup, cloudy grapefruit pour. Aroma of raspberry and a nice light funk. Taste is light raspberry and solid sour.
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at Winterfest 2013. Yellow pour with head. Wheat with a tart fruitiness, wish they would have had the syrup like Pour Decisions had with Acerbity at the event.
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;Tap at Winterfest 2013. Gold pour with a big white head. Wheat and mild fruit, slightly tart. Decent berliner weisse, but falls a little short of Acerbity in my opinion.
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;Thanks to Mike for this... Clear honey gold, nice bright white head... Nose is honey wheat with a bit of lemon and a bit of musk... The taste is mostly lemon with some brett, super easy to drink
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours clear yellow from a growler, with nice white head. Aroma has notes of lemon, biscuit, touch of funk. Tastes starts slightly tart, goes into lemon and biscuit, and a slightly harsh bitter finish from the lively carbonation. Not a bad berliner, has all the right components, just needs to get more sour to really close it all.
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;Growler. Clear light yellow pour, plenty of effervesence and a bready lemon aroma. Flavor was watery thin, lemons and a little malt on the finish. Not quite what I was hoping for, but this would be great for a hot summer day (hope they consider changing the release date someday).
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;[Growler] Pours very hazy orange with a tiny white head. Aroma is certainly big on wheat, with pear and lemon also present. Taste is very nice, with the big wheat character balanced with green apple, peach skin, pear, and nice acidity. I don’t like high carbonation, but was this was a little flat even for me. Otherwise, medium mouthfeel, with a very long finish. Overall, a very nice beer that is dangerously drinkable, and only got better as I drank more of it.
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;Approx. 4oz pour out of a growler. Thank you so very much for saving a bit of this for me Will! Pours a hell of a lot darker than any Berliner Weiss I’ve ever encountered. Dark, thick, muddy brown with some orange highlights. Little appearance of carbonation. Funky and lightly tart yeast on the nose. Slightly malty. Definite hints of brown sugar. A bit of candy/toffee sweetness. Green apple and pear skin upon warming. Flavor is incredibly tart and acidic for a Berliner Weiss... awesome! Very tart on the sides and back of the tongue with a bruisingly acidic finish. Definitely full bodied for the style. The finish lasts forever... I wish this were on tap all the time, I’d drink the hell out of this! Thanks a ton Will!
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;(growler, thanks STLWill!) Pours hazy gold with a white head. This is far darker than most Berliner Weisses. Aroma is not really sour, but instead there are scents of grapes and some yeastiness, along with lightly toasted malt. The taste is definitely sour, and tastes just like a sweet-tart candy. The finish is just very dry and sour, and carries on well after drinking. This is really good, and it is significantly underrated.
Fitgers Champagne of the North;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fitgers Brewhouse;Growler RBSG 07. Murky orange pour with a white head. Aroma of appl skin, light cherry, toasted malt, vinous and sour notes. Flavors of dry white wine, sour, and apple skin. Light body, sour throughout with a super dry finish. Nice way to start the evening.
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;(Growler) Pours a dark brown body with a small beige head. Aroma of tobacco, toasted bread, orange peel, and coriander. Flavor of herbs, toasted malt, caramel, and cocoa with a dry finish.
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Growler... RBSG 07... Pours dark with a mid-sized, frothy, tan head. This wit’s aroma is of the usual suspects (bread dough, orange peel, coriander, banana), but with a nice dose of cocoa thrown into the mix. Spicy, caramel flavor with moderate sweetness, mild bitterness and lots of coriander and cocoa. Light bodied and pretty thin with medium carbonation. Crisp, spicy, chocolate finish. Strange brew!
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Thanks to JK and Badgerben for bringing this growler south from Duluth to the Twin Cities. Sampled at the RBSG ’07 Grand Tasting room, pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thick tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, cloves, and a touch of vegetable margarine. Taste of roasted wheat malt, yeast, coriander, and some bubblegum. Palate is light bodied, carbonated with a slight metalic feel. Finish is dry malty, with some spice aftertaste.
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;RBSG07. From growler. Pours black with a creamy head. Aroma is butterish, coriander and bubblegum yeast. Flavour is wheaty with notes of yeast. Malty finish. Solid but nothing really great. I had this at the end of the evening, so I guess even though the cap was on the growler it had oxidised a bit.
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Dark black body with a tan head. Coriander spice with some other spices. Caramel and some other spices.
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;RBSG 2007, dark and tan: spicy nose with caramelly taste. Very syrupy finish.
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;(RBSG07, growler) Cola black body with beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, some sourness, wheat, light clove. Taste is medium sweet, wheat, light caramel, coriander. Watery light body. I assume this is a stab at a Tarwebier.
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;"I will echo JK--at the brewpub they had this labeled a ""white night"". Very interesting beer. Dark black, clinging head. Interesting flavors, suggesting of curry (that coriander, perhaps). It works interesting things with food pairings. Worth a try. (on tap at brewpub)"
Fitgers Black Knight Wit Noir;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;RBSG 2007: Poured dark brown with a tan head. Aroma, cloves, some spice, sweet malts. Flavor, very spicy, caramel, some floral notes. Sweet and spicy on the finish.

New Holland Moxie;Holland, Michigan, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Holland Brewing Company;Bottle 49/424. Pours a hazy brine color with minimal tan head.

New Holland Moxie;Holland, Michigan, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Holland Brewing Company;750mL bottle, #181/424. Poured very deep garnety-brown with a nice cap of toasted beige head. The aroma picked up sour cherries, Bretty funk, lactic notes, and oak over warmer fruity sugars.. this was very good. The flavor found sour cherries, oak, and a bit of Balsamic vinegar over pale and fruity malts.. sour, spicy, and a bit refreshing on the finish. Medium-bodied and engaging on the palate.. this was way better than expected.

Red Star Derailed Imperial Stout;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Red Star Agave Grille;Of all the beers I’ve tasted at Red Star, this is definitely the most offensive. IMHO Red Star is usually known for their gentle and impressive lager variations. IF you like imp stout you otta get a growler of this stuff. I’m not an imp stout lover so ignore my numbers and just read the text if you are a liker of that style. Imperial stout aroma and appearance. Barely any head but lots of cool looking lacing. Very little if any carbonation greets the palate. Oppressive bitterness on the initial slug that is so common with many imp stouts. Bitter back of throat impression like somebody made me eat a piece of meat that was cooked way to long and charred on the grill. Oh yes, imp stout style to the max. Such a contrast to the rest of the beers I’ve had at Red Star! Overall, imp stouts are just a little too much for my girlie taste buds. Not quite as good as Old Heathen but I liked Old Heathen because it is a bit milder than most imp stouts.
Red Star Derailed Imperial Stout;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Red Star Agave Grille;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured pitch black with a large dark brown head that lingered. The aroma was fairly strong roasty malts, coffee and floral hops. The flavor was dry, very roasty and had elements of bitter coffee, toffee and floral hops. There was a long bitter roasty finish. The beer had a fairly thick mouthfeel.

Flavors of malt, light caramel, hops, vegetal. Quite crisp and refreshing but ends slightly sticky, with notes of caramel and sweet malt. A very acceptable commercial beer.
Tuborg Red (Israel);Ashkelon, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Israel Beer Breweries (Carlsberg);"Well it's an improvement on the ""Green"" pale lager, but still sub-par and overall unappetizing. This amber lager pours a dirty earthy bronze appearance, decent head and lacing. Aroma is nonexistent but clean. Taste is malty, caramel, some hop bitterness actually palatable, but something's off. The mouthfeel was alright, smooth and medium bodied. I would say it's Yuengling's awkward European half-brother, haha. In Israel, Goldstar definitely recommended over this."
Tuborg Red (Israel);Ashkelon, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Israel Beer Breweries (Carlsberg);On tap. Pours amber, clear, frothy head, some lacing. Aroma: caramel, metal, malt. Taste: caramel, malt, hint of hops, hint of buckwheat honey.
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Pours a clear amber brown on tap with fluffy off-white head that leaves light lace. Aroma of sweet malt and a hint of crisp yeast. Taste follows, almost lager like. Really not that exciting, which is probably what most people want at a baseball game.
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Tastes like it would be served at a ballpark. Got a pint in the ATL airport. Nice deep color. Very brown. Vaguely reminiscent of a brown ale actually. Not hoppy. Simple.
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Not bad for AB. A good amber similar to Yuengling but a little sweeter. Perfect for some Georgia Bulldog ball cap tip-it-on-back-to-me-nah-nah-nah ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Before craft beer was available at Turner Field, Tomahawk was my jam. Virtually scentless. Pours a very pale brown. Honestly, this is just a sweet mess. More carbonation would probably help to mask how utterly average this beer tastes Draft - Turner Field - Atlanta, GA
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On tap at the Braves bar at the ATL airport. Pours a brown amber color. Not much of a head. Aroma of alcohol and malts. Fizzy mouth feel.
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On draught @ The Chop House. Poured an decent looking amber with just a small head. Aroma was of caramel malts and some bread. Flavors were a bit subdued but pleasant. A bit of sweetness from the caramel malts. Drank smooth, well carbonated. Given the bleak selection at Braves games this is the way to go.
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);When I heard this beer was from Anheuser-Busch I was skeptical. But since it’s only served at Turner Field in the Chop House I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised. Came out of the tap a medium deep amber color with a slightly off white head. Roasted/earthen aroma with a hint of almond. Pretty decent mouth feel, being fresh helps a ton. Nice bitter taste with an after taste of slight honey. Overall I really enjoyed it for what it is and I will definitely have it again at the next game!!
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On draught at Chophouse in plastic cup. Pours a deep copper with ample foamy crown that has very decent retention and leaves lots of fingery lacing on the plastic cup. Aroma is malty, with toffee and some some adjunct on the nose (either corn or rice), with only a slight hint of grassy hops, but a slight EtOH burn. Flavour is sweet malt, a bit of roasted character, close to toffee, and finishes cleanly with a semi-dry hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy with moderate carbonation that is sufficient to bring out hop flavours in the mouth without overpowering the malt character of the beer. The only beer I can drink at Turner Field. Unfortunately I have only found two locations in the ballpark that sell this beer, one of them being the Chop House and the other one a stand on the lower level of the right field terrace. I’m sure they have this elsewhere, like the 755 Club but they should distribute it more throughout the stadium!!!
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Sept. 19, 2008. Braves vs. Mets. Draft, $6.50 / pint. Pours copper color, creamy head. Aroma of malts. Initial flavors were of honeydew melon. Wow. Then it continued to taste like any old amber ale. Sweet malt character, woody hop finish. The best thing Turner Field has to offer. The beer was definitely better than the game. Braves lost 9-5.
Tomahawk Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Draft at the 755 club at Turner Field. I went out on a limb and tried the only thing on draft I had never heard of and was pleasantly surprised. Poured a deep orange/amber (hard to tell in the plastic pint glass they gave me) with a pillowy white head. Mostly sweet malt and corn in the nose but some caramel and slight notion of a hop showed up at some point. Body was mostly sweet malts throughout with an off-dry finish. Good carbonation, very drinkable, a no-brainer for Turner Field’s draft list. Surprised this is an AB product.
Fog City Diners Fog City Ale;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);I had this at the iconoclastic Fog City Diner in San Francisco with an unbelievably delicious cobb sandwhich. The waitress told me it was a Gordon Biersch brew made just for the restaurant-- can’t confirm this. Anyway, it came in a nice shaker glass, slightly orange golden, a little hazy with a thin white cap. Saazy hop aroma, woody and leafy. More like a Bohemian pilsener than anything, but actually really nice. The whole vibe of the afternoon was great, which of course plays into the rating.
Uinta Wyld Extra Pale Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Uinta Brewing Company;Golden color with a modest off-white head. Very light aromas, with some honey, citrus, floral perfume, and light toasted bread. Pale malts and and clove honey in the flavors. Finish has a generic bitterness which dries things out and at the end it seems flavorless. Refreshing, but not fulfilling. 2/12

Not nearly as wyld as that wily Teuton from foreign shores known as VAL FUCKING BLATZ! That man was truly & verily WYLD. Crazy WYLD.

If he would have been on a plane that had snakes on it, those verminous little bastards would have jumped out on a suicide mission to avoid his righteous wrath.....errr...where was I going with this? Dunno. This beer is OK, just don’t expect it to be comparable in any way, shape or form to the original WYLD beverage of bacchanalian mayhem: BLATZ!

Uinta Wyld Extra Pale Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Uinta Brewing Company;Bottle from Harvest Market, Bedford NH. Aroma is citrusy hops, a little bit of sulfur, basement. Appearance is pale yellow with greenish tint. Cloudy with sediment and 2 finger width pillowy white head with nice sparkle, retention that was too long, and foamy lacing. Taste is citrusy with a bit of skunk but way overpowered by palate. Palate is light bodied with thin texture but all of that is obscured by way too much fizzy carbonation (like a cheap champagne). Finish is like you are drowning in foam but then is abruptly gone. Overall, this may not have been the fairest representation of this beer--it was a bit old. I’ll have to get another at some point and re-rate. This version had a lot of negatives.

Harveys Brown Bull Stout;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Stout;Harveys Brewery;Bottle@Chris_o’s. Nice stout. Nice aromas of chocolate, caramel, and mocha. Palate is lightly sweet to start, but combatted nicely in the finish with a nice long roasty malt finish, which also shows notes of dark chocolate, and also rum n’ raisin. This was very nice.
Harveys Brown Bull Stout;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Stout;Harveys Brewery;Aug 2007 chris_o Shindig Smooth chocolate stout - soft and oh so dreamy delicious. Lingering bitterness. Enjoyable and full of character. It has the the clean, lifeless taste of a filtered beer - however, still awesome.
Harveys Brown Bull Stout;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Stout;Harveys Brewery;Lovely really rich, deep brown, almost black appearance. Lots of roasty malt, coffee and chocolate in the aroma. More of the same on the palate. Smooth, but firm, mouthfeel. Quite tarry, but not heavy. Beautifully balanced and possibly the best beer of the day, despite the very strong opposition. I’d love to try this one on cask. Shame it seems to be a one-off.
Harveys Brown Bull Stout;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Stout;Harveys Brewery;Bottled. Black with a light brown, medium sized head. Weak roast aroma with toffee and caramel and licorice. The roast flavour has notes of smoke and charcoal, and a long lasting burned aftertaste. Seemed a little thin for that rich flavour.
Harveys Brown Bull Stout;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Stout;Harveys Brewery;Bottle @ Chris_o shindig 2007. Dark brown color with a small to average, fizzy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, light brown head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, burnt, strong coffee, coal.

Harveys Brown Bull Stout;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Stout;Harveys Brewery;Bottle at the Chris_o shindig. Deep black, nice rust colored head. Luscious caramel brown sweetness--deep and comforting in a way I associate with a good doppelbock. Flavor is an oceany iodine, soft sour chocolate, a bit of apple esters, nice chalky bitterness. A real stunner at less than 5%, and one of my most memorable beers of the tasting.
Harveys Brown Bull Stout;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Stout;Harveys Brewery;Bottle. Jet black beer with a tiny chocolate head. Roasted malt aroma. Fairly sweet to taste, some roasted malt, chocolate and coffee, a bit of smoke and a touch of pop corn. One of the best beers at the tasting.

Hammer N Tongs Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Faint aroma of grains? Taste is relatively sweet and corn-like with some mild hay. It is not the worst, but not good by any means.
Hammer N Tongs Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);In it’s catagory as a large commercial beer, this is my second prefered. Loverly colour but not pale or golden as many in here say. Very poor head retention. Perfect mouthfeel. Right amount of bitterness. very flat flavour but better than most of the others. It is not a home brew or a craft brew. Don’t expect it to be. It should be judged in it’s class and if done so, comes out pretty good. Nice experience and refreshing.

Crow Peak Lazy Daze Summer Ale;Spearfish, South Dakota, United States;Wheat Ale;Crow Peak Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewery’s taproom in Spearfish, South Dakota. Pours a semi-hazy golden blonde brew with an average white head that quickly dissolves to ring with good lacing. Aroma of some llight roasted multi-grain malt, some green vegetable and flowery/herbal hops. Taste is highly carbonated, light bodied, with flavors of light white bread dough, cloves, some earthy herbs and grassy hop bitterness. Finish is dry, light, crisp with a slight herbal spice aftertaste.
Crow Peak Bear Butte Brown Ale;Spearfish, South Dakota, United States;Brown Ale;Crow Peak Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Thanks Scott. This was poured into a mug. The appearance was a brown color with a film of a little white head that fell off fairly quick. Light stringy lace. The aroma had some coffee, earthy hops, light roast and a little bit of dark chocolate at the very end. The flavor took all of the previously mentioned aromas and brought them together somewhat sweet to lead into the aftertaste and mildly into the finish. The feel was just a tad under medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt as projected. Overall, good brown ale worthy of coming back to.

Crow Peak Eleventh Hour IPA;Spearfish, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Crow Peak Brewing Company;12oz can. Pretty shwaggy aroma. Shwaggy borderline off tones, brewhouse. Really weak brewing. Filtered, which might be the only thing that helps it. Antiquated caramel and toffee tones that pretty much no one wants in an IPA in 2017. More of a tan orange body than amber in my opinion. Drinkable, but on the edge. No real impressive hop tone, and an off aroma. Weak.

DuClaw Oak Barrel Aged Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;Dark mahogany pour with a thin and fully diminishing beige head, oily with a cola appearance. The aroma contains toffee, bourbon, wet oak, burned caramel, vinous notes, stale cherries and mild peat and chocolate. The flavor is rapidly dispersed across the palate, toffee and chocolate nearly disintegrating upon impact. Sweetness is medium high, bitterness low, acidity low and astringency mild. Stale nuances surround what little evidence of good taste remains. The finish has mild vanilla introduced, caramel and toffee, mild peaty spice lingering. The mouthfeel is undercarbonated, thin and watery, tannic and boring, though nothing strikes the palate as offensive. Drab defined.

DuClaw Oak Barrel Aged Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;Bottle… RBSG 07… Mostly clear, very dark ruby ale with a small, creamy, khaki head. Good retention. Earthy nose with notes of red wine and white oak. Lots of tanginess and sweetness on the palate as what was modest hopping to begin with must have been sucked up into the oak barrel. The oak provides vanilla in return. Medium-bodied and syrupy with soft carbonation. Woodsy, sweet finish. A huge disappointment from one of my favorite brewpubs, but they can’t all be “dead-on”, I guess.

DuClaw Oak Barrel Aged Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;RBSG 2007 Grand Tasting - Ruby brown, thin tan creamy head. Nose was soft with notes of toffee, vanilla, oak, and hints of cherry. Flavor was a touch lighter with notes of wood, caramel, and tangy vanilla and cherry.

Angry Hanks Street Fight Imperial Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Angry Hanks Micro Brewery;This is by far the best Red Ale that I have ever tried. It has the best taste and best appearance out of any other Red Ale.
Angry Hanks Street Fight Imperial Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Angry Hanks Micro Brewery;"Draft at the brewery taproom.. Pours lightly hazed amber red with nice white head... sweetish caramel malt and light dry toast, hops are bitter but add not enough flavor or aroma... And since when is 6.5% ""imperial""? This place is sorta a joke IMO."
Angry Hanks Street Fight Imperial Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Angry Hanks Micro Brewery;Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served deep amber color with a one finger head of fizzy white foam. The head fades rather rapidly, leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the beer is strongest of a citrus smell mixed with some fruitiness of apple and pear. Along with these flavors some lighter citrus of tangerine and a little bit of a grassy hop smell are there as well. Taste – Upfront the taste is strongest of a slightly citrus flavor with both a grapefruit hop as well as a tangerine sweetness. Along with these flavors comes some other fruit flavors of an apple and pear nature. These sweeter flavors lighten up a bit all while the grapefruit hop remains constant and is joined by other hop tastes of grass and a bit of pine at the finish taking the taste to its end. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that was a tad lighter. For the flavors and styles it was rather appropriate and made for a rather easy drinker. Overall – A decent brew overall, but nothing out of this world. A nice one to a least give a try to if you get the chance.

Wentworth Gun Park Light Mild;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Wentworth;Tasted by a pint at the Swim Inn, a JDW pub on the West Street, Sheffield, where I often found Wentworth’s seasonal/occasional brews on offer. Served on a handpump fixed with a sparkler. Appearance: dark golden with a brown shade, coming with a thick & creamy white froth that refuses to retreat--the work of a sparkler. Aroma: a light note of cream & honey comes with almost feather light lager malts... lack of hops on the nose. Flavour: intense toasted malts upfront, a tad sour, added with a deepening dryish mouthfeel of toastiness as well as a lingering bitter undertone--so there are considerable hops after all~~ The lovely, lingering malt aroma intensifies quietly, hand in hand with a slightly tangy/zesty kick of fruitiness. Palate: thanks to the sparkler, the texture is soft and smooth, yet a slightly spritzy mouthfeel is retained due to the freshness of this cask, I presume. All in all, a solid light mild well worth a try!

Grand River Plowmans Ale;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);Appearance: Big thick white head with tanned tinges. Body looks like burnished copper but when held to the light it’ very reddish in color. Smell: Initial weird metallic aroma that gradually dissipates. Roasted smell and as it warms, i get a gentle hop presence. Taste: A nice robust yet discreet taste. Some hops in the fore with a subdued dry bitter finish. There’s also some tea and a type of herbal presence lurking in there. I’m also getting some earthy notes, maybe barley? Mouthfeel: Just a tad too carbonated at first but not uncomfortable by any means and definitely eases as it warms. Nice full body with a smooth flavorful feel.

Highly sweet with the right amount of grassy hops and red ale spices. Creamy smooth medium to full body with carbonation. Medium strength finish with a nice lingering mouthfeel of cinnamon spices, caramel, and grassy noble spices.

Grand River Plowmans Ale;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);Appearance: clear medium amber with one finger of creamy ivory head diminishing gradually to a thin cap, patchy lacing. (4/5) Aroma: caramel/toffee malt, pine, toast, citrus zest, earth. (7/10) Taste: moderate-low sweet, moderate bitter. (7/10) Medium body, moderate-soft carbonation, off-dry slightly sticky lingering bitter finish. (4/5) Well, that’s a bit of a surprise: it looks like an amber, but the aromas include a decent hop character in addition to the malt. Moreover, although the taste has some malt elements, it’s not sweet at all, and the bitterness is quite pronounced. I find it hard to believe that it’s only 35 IBU, actually, and can definitely taste the super-alpha hops. The bitterness really sticks around in the slightly sticky finish, lingering and growing. An amber I actually like - who’d’a thunk it? (15/20)

Slightly sweet and vinous, better said cheap vinous nose; yeasty with light malt character and a fruity (grapes) touch. Sweet and sour flavour, light to medium bodied with a medium carbonation. Strange taste: the sparkling wine and its fruitiness (grapes, citrus) is dominating the taste, just a weak (wheat-) malty base is still detectable; sweet and quite sour finish. Might be refreshing and even drinkable for someone else but me. My first sample of the “style” and I have to admit that I´m stuffed with this kind of “beer” for the rest of my life. At least it has a proper sweetness-sourness ratio."

Charleville Pumpkin Ale;Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Charleville Vineyard & Microbrewery;Draft at the brewpub in the City. Pours a clear orange with a small off-white head that settles into a ring. Light-bodied, with modest carbonation. What stands out in this particular pumpkin ale is the ginger. This thing is really, really ginger-forward in the nose and flavor alike, while many pumpkin ales eschew ginger altogether in favor of some nutmeg-cinnamon-allspice-clove combo. There's a bit of sweet malt in here, but not much. It's all about the spice. And as a ginger/pumpkin ale, it's good.

Bubbled spiraling bone white head. Lotta spices in the nose with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon and a touch ginger. Touch grassy citrus, almost lemongrass aromas. Medium bodied with a great malt base. Soft effervescence with smooth malts. Spicy middle and a bitter, dry finish. Good rolling spice palate and a great drinkability. Good tingling body and an ample dose of hops. The hop character plays intermixed with the similar spice characteristics of the ginger and cinnamon. The spices dominate most of the palate, especially the finish. The initial malt profile is a mix of pumpkin pie filling and caramel based crust. Everything shines in a nice rolling package!

Brew 42 Red Tale;Lake Clifton, WA, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Brew 42;"Tasting from early 2008. Tried this on draught at the brewery, then a few too many later on that afternoon out the bottle at home. Can’t fault it for presentation; precision, sexy, alluring, artful. Deep set fiery copper with a little chestnut coming through. Shimmers in the light, emits a radiance that dances, and as translucent as polished crystal. A lot of very, very fine carbonation eddies its way up to an inch thick, tight, creamy off-white crown that holds its place to leave a nice web of lace. Gingersnap biscuits, salted peanuts, powdery cocoa, nutmeg and varnished timber, a little rust and ashen wood on the nose, very interesting. Equally complex mix of burnt and charred caramel and demerara up front, smoke, wood, and rough darker malts, tree-bark and mildly astringent, husky grains throughout the rest into the malty and full, mildly bitter, chocolaty and woody swallow. A little cola and peanut cookies linger. I loved this flavour combo and couldn’t understand why. It just works. The body is lighter than the flavour suggests, the mouthfeel soft and comfortable. Goes down a treat just off cool. Very nice stuff. (50cL, Brew-42, Collie)"

Clear light copper pour, bit of lasting head, touch of lacing....hoppy citric/piny aroma, hits all the right notes but never quite excites; pungent without being nose-altering....really juicy, but solidly bitter body, bracing and fairly harsh, enough pale and lightly caramelized malts show up to keep you going to the moderately dry, very bitter finish....guess I’m not as blown away as most were, but this was certainly a nice pint that I’d be happy to have again."

Snowy Mountains Razorback Red Ale;East Lindfield, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snowy Mountains Brewery;A top Irish Red... balance bitterness with lots of dark tasty malts!!! Not much hop aroma to take away from the malts so it was done right IMO. Great during winter and or with desert... CHOCOLATE! Another great loss...
Snowy Mountains Razorback Red Ale;East Lindfield, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snowy Mountains Brewery;Malty aroma. Clear dark brown colour with good head. Nice coffee flavor with nice creamy finish. Medium to heavy body with low carbonation.
Snowy Mountains Razorback Red Ale;East Lindfield, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snowy Mountains Brewery;Pours dark amber/copper with a large, lasting head. Nose shows some nutty malt and chocolate, quite sweet smelling but faint. Similar flavours but after the initial burst of malt it falls flat very quickly. Too much carbonation for my liking.
Snowy Mountains Razorback Red Ale;East Lindfield, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snowy Mountains Brewery;I prefered the Snowy pale ale to this amber style, althoug I usually like a good amber ale.

Snowy Mountains Razorback Red Ale;East Lindfield, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snowy Mountains Brewery;Bottle. Clear darkish amber with a small light beige head. Aroma of toffee and nuts.

Snowy Mountains Razorback Red Ale;East Lindfield, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snowy Mountains Brewery;Out the bottle, chilled, and into a nice flat-wall schooner. Chestnut brown, sparkling and headless, a few off-white bubbles gather on the meniscus. Awkward clingy carbonation sits upon the glass walls. It doesn’t look on the money, but it makes up for it! Pronounced, big, biscuity, woody malt nose. Arguably sweet, a little burnt sugar edge, some cola soda, dried dark fruit, a little rust, very enticing, very alluring. All malt in the mouth, nice rounded woody, smokiness, a little pasty in feel with generous licks of vanilla, cola and praline. Very, very subtle malt astringency late. Dry, malty length has long, long hints of dried, savoury dark fruit. The body is medium, it’s quite bold both in flavour and feel. Nice, relaxed carbonation makes for more pleasantries, this is a nice drinking ale. The fruit starts to dazzle on the palate giving it a rustic savoury edge. I liked this one. An honest, sessionable, malt driven ale. Well done!!! (33cL, no date stamp, Dan Murphy’s)

Snowy Mountains Razorback Red Ale;East Lindfield, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snowy Mountains Brewery;330ml bottle. Pours a dark amber-red colour, with a small head. Starts off with strong citrus hops, with notes of lemon and lime in the middle. The finish is smooth, with the coffee and chocolate notes of roast malt. Doubtless an interesting flavour combination, but it seems to work quite well in fact. A beer for winter, and one I would definitely buy again.

Charleville Oatmeal Stout;Ste.

I wanted it to be better, but the flavors were just not that exciting. The smoothness of the mouthfeel was probably the best part of this one.
Charleville Oatmeal Stout;Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Charleville Vineyard & Microbrewery;This 22 oz bottle was sent to me courtesy of Stykzone. It poured pretty much black with some red around the edges, and raised a medium sized tan head that settled quickly and left moderate lacing. The nose is roasted malts with aromas of chocolate, coffee, oatmeal, ripe fruit, and ashes. Medium in body it was somewhat thin in mouthfeel. The flavor is complex and similar to the nose but vanilla is detected as well. The finish is a tiny bit sour. Overall this a quite decent oatmeal stout.

Charleville Oatmeal Stout;Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Charleville Vineyard & Microbrewery;25-Sep-10 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 31-Dec-10 for $4.69 at www.wineandcheeseplace.com) The Charleville beers haven’t really been much to write home about, and though this Oatmeal Stout isn’t exceptional, it is quite pleasant. The beer is dark brown in the glass with solid clarity evident at the edges. The tan head pours to nearly half an inch, but quickly subsides to a razor-thin ring. The nose offers dark chocolate, oatmeal, dark toast, ashtray, decayed wood, licorice, prune and a hint of tart berry. On the palate, moderately sweet, dark chocolate, oatmeal, licorice, earth, wood, and a bit of ashiness are joined once again by a touch of fruity tartness and prunes. The weight is medium-full and the mouthfeel is generally dry despite the light sweetness in the flavor, but the carbonation is a bit rough and prickly for a style that is usually characterized by smooth creaminess. Overall, a pretty nice oatmeal stout, and probably the best beer I’ve tried from this brewery.

Has some light hops to balance. Taste is heavy with dark fruits, berries, and malt. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Heavy and syrupy. Thick and rich. Though no alcohol to be tasted. Overall it’s good. I enjoy it. I would recommend it and I would buy it again.
Charleville Barleywine;Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Charleville Vineyard & Microbrewery;"Got in a BIF from jdell15. 12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours moderately murky dark ruby red, light copper/brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, plum, prune, fig, pear, apricot, red apple, date, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toffee, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of nuttiness, molasses, roast, wood, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Slight oxidation coming out as it warms. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, fig, pear, apricot, red apple, date, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toffee, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of nuttiness, molasses, roast, wood, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/grassy hop and roast bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark fruit, pear, apricot, red apple, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toffee, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, light roast, wood, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy, silky, and bready mouthfeel that is awesome. Slightly slick, syrupy, sticky, and chalky. Alcohol is very well hidden; very mild warmth of 10.5% lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent English barleywine! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV. Very rich and complex with perfect balance of yeast fruits and dark/bready malt sweetness. Just enough earthy hop presence to balance. This aged really well, not much oxidation. A really enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."
Charleville Barleywine;Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Charleville Vineyard & Microbrewery;"2015 Bottle; Pour is mahogany, with a dense, fine bubbled beige head into this glass. The appearance is nice initially, and as the head fades on this one - all hope eventually does as well. The nose unveils some typical barleywine features - caramel toffee notes, dark fruit presence. However: The flavor profile is harsh up front - bittering, booze, not -quite- off notes but not quite right either - it melds terribly. There’s some minerality, more dark fruit presence , with candied fruits and I just can’t do it. Not because it’s a barleywine like the previous rater mentioned - but because it’s a poor example of style."

Charleville Barleywine;Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Charleville Vineyard & Microbrewery;2015 version. Aroma is disappointing. Boozy, malty and not much else with a faint trace of cardboard. Pours a nice reddish color with a tiny ring of white foam. Taste has elements of fig, plum and raisin. Spicy up front with more sweetness than is typical for the style. Alcohol burn in the aftertaste. Not very complex. Palate is thin and weak. I didn’t like this one very much. I should have known this brewery couldn’t produce a decent barleywine. I will be aging a few bottles mostly because I don’t want to drink them. Hopefully some age will open this one up a bit.
Charleville Barleywine;Ste.

Lunar Golden Moon;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lunar Brewing Company;This has a hazy golden body with a dense ecru head that laces the glass in sheets as you drink. It has an aroma of pale malts sweetened by honey and has the additional smell of wheat. The flavor is lgiht and sweet with pale malt. In the middle a sturdy floral/grassy bitterness appears that lasts long into the finish. Not bad. Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL
Lunar 143 Moon Ale;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lunar Brewing Company;From the tap this pours a cloudy yellow/straw body with a thick head. Nice lacing. The aroma is toffee covered by floral and citric hops. It seems slightly watery and the listed 7% ABV surprizes me, but it does deliver a flavorful drink in which the hoppy bitterness builds as the drinking progresses. Okay. Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;Tap at The Farmhouse in Burlington. Commonshawn, rosskyle, and samadouche involved. Snifter pour. Orange and golden with orange wearing the pants in the color relationship. Aroma is definitely citrus with heavy grapefruit influence. Sugars also come through. Taste is bright and also citrus forward. Breakfast juice comes to mind. Mostly bitterness especially at the finish and aftertaste. I think it’s that element that holds it back from really good. Should also be noted the menu calls this the Grapefruit Double IPA.
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;Enjoyed a bottle of this beer in a restaurant in Woodstock, Vermont, poured into a tulip glass to drink. The beer had a deep amber-copper color with a very large and foamy off white head that had great retention, and very good cling and lacing. It had a pretty strong floral and citrus hops aroma along with a bit of pine and yeast with spice. The taste was mostly bitter with a blend of citrus and floral flavors along with some spices. It was a mostly dry beer with above average carbonation and a thicker, fuller mouthfeel.
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;On tap. Deep orange with a small head. Very light and grassy. Light body and mouthfeel. Dry.
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;"Deep burnt copper coloured body with a two centimetre tall off-white head and more loose sediment than i’ve ever seen in a beer before - this one is a pure colloid. Aroma of bright grassy and herbal hops with a hint of grapefruit, a decent amount of yeast and some light sugars noticeable. Medium-bodied; Assertive grassy and grapefruity hops with a very mild and perhaps light malt backbone, more of a single IPA than double, for sure. Aftertaste has the grassy and lightly herbal hops with a little malt, some sweetness and not much else - no depth nor complexity. Overall, more of a single IPA (which is fine by me), but still lacking in depth and malt backbone with no complexity at all. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Liqour Outlet in Boonton, New Jersey on 28-May-2012 for US$5.55 sampled at home in Washington on 14-October-2012."
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;"Orange, amber with white lacing. Mighty spicy full-bodied hop flavor; big palette and slightly dry. Really good, will drink again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;Pours a light brown with rocky off white  head. Pulp makes it appear to be apple cider. Aroma of apples and yeast. Tastes of hop notes of pine and fruit. Strong delayed malt presence that is buttery and rich. Bitterness reemerges from the creamy caramel malt and follows into the aftertaste. Butter flavor is what stands out about this IPA.
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;Amber pour, good sized white head. Pine, Grapefruit in the aroma, some caramel sweetness as well. Lots of Pine up front, Grapefruit, Lemon rind, caramel malt. Medium body, fairly good carbonation. Not a world beater by any stretch but a solid IIPA. Off topic - I wish this brewery would challenge itself a bit more.
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;22oz bottle in a styrofoam cup. Pours copper with a lacy, cream-colored head. Aroma of citrusy hops, a little light fruits, and some caramel malts. Flavor the same, with some fruitiness. Average texture. A decent beer, but not the best of its style.
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;Bomber courtesy of some on a BA. Translucent amber capped by small off white head with fair retention. Nose is inviting with caramel over pine and grapefruit. Bitter is the taste, overly bitter with little malt coming through. Pine lingers in the mouth. A bit watery feeling the the mouth.
Rock Art IPA (II) Double IPA;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Art Brewery;On tap at Rock art 2 finger crystal clear head. SRM of 4. Light gold and orange appearance. Smell is great hop backbone. Citra and amarillo. Taste is gigantic. Lots of Hops. Dominating the glass entirely. Heavy body. No balance.
John Harvards Natural Mystic Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Previous incarnations of this stout have been quite good, but this year’s batch is lacking for me - fairly light for the style, with a rather one-dimensional, innocuous sweetness and roasty character - there is an almost tart quality through the middle, with notes of prune and plum that try to make things interesting - this salvages the beer a little, but this brewer makes better stouts than this.
John Harvards Natural Mystic Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at JH. Aroma of sweet chocolate, mellow roasted coffee. Flavor again largely sweet with a mild roasted component and coffee notes more milky than anything remotely bitter, sweet chocolate remains. Pretty sweet overall and a bit light body-wise for me, but solid in the flavor department.
John Harvards Natural Mystic Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at JH. Pours a cloudy brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of sweet roasted malt and vanilla. Flavor is more roasted with some bitter chocolate and a sweet finish. A solid, but pretty typical stout. 6/4/7/4/14 (3.5/5)
John Harvards Natural Mystic Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap @ Lake Grove. Poured black with a copper rim and minimal head. The aroma is roasty with mild coffee notes but overall is fairly light. The aroma startss roasty but light. Not much in the middle then coffee shows up quickly before turning to a light thon finish with some semi-dry bitterness.
John Harvards Natural Mystic Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Deep brown-black with a ruby tint throughout. Thin light brown head. The aroma is great with earthy dark chocolate, light roast coffee and a light rye/wheat spiciness. A fairly aromatic stout, soft chocolate and even a bit floral on the back which is fairly unusual. Flavour is softly sweet, with an earthy/perfumy flavour. Mild roast, dark chocolate. Fairly interesting maltiness with a low to moderate bitterness. Pretty solid stout.
John Harvards Natural Mystic Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;For editors: I doubt this should be combined with the Corporate version b/c: Was known as Seven Grain Stout but the name was changed to Natural Mystic in the honor of an employee of the pub that recently died (his favorite song apparently). Proceeds go to his family. Pours black with a small tan head, just a smidgen of light brown tips. Aroma is roasty-ific. So damn roasty and as the beer warms a light alcohol pruniness emerges (something more common in Imp Stouts but not as strong). Taste is again full of roast and sweet prune. However, the great thing about the beer is the flavor is well balanced in a light and extremely quaffable body. Low on bitterness with coffee and toffee flavors sprinkled throughout. SO damn drinkable and so damn tasty.
Montgomery IPA;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;IPA;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);Run of the mill brewpub IPA, but done fairly well. Not too hoppy, or boozy. Your usual hallmarks: copper color, caramel flavor and aroma, west coast hops.
Montgomery IPA;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;IPA;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);"Draft at the brewery in a pint glass. Offered as a ""summer seasonal"" in August. Nice amber colour with a stable white head and good lacing. Aroma was atringent hops but the flavour was nice and light with the hops. No real pungent finish but good bitterness. Good IPA."
Montgomery IPA;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;IPA;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);The IPA was great. A summer seasonal that I really enjoyed. It had by far the most taste of any other beers at the restaurant. Slightly piney with a definite hop taste. Low malt character. Bitter finish.
Town Hall Ruby Jack;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Draft @ Brewpub. Deep orange-red pour with a white head. Aroma of apple skin, light spice, oak, yeast, coconut, and light pineapple. Flavors of oak, coconut, pineapple, and sweet caramel malt. Thick body, woody/dry/sweet with a dry finish. Neat stuff, I’m glad I got to try it.
Town Hall Ruby Jack;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewpub on 6/22/07: Pours a transparent copper ruby with a thin frothy white head. Aroma of sweet rich caramel malt with a healthy dose of bourbon oak. Body starts with a full carbonation and thick, viscous wheaty malty sweetness before giving way to complex oaky bourbon that lasts through the finish with a touch of butterscotch. Nicely balanced and enjoyable brew with a touch of warmth.
Town Hall Ruby Jack;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Draft @ Brewpub: Murky mahogany, no head or lacing. Nose of bright fruit and melon, some alcohol. Lots of malt and sweet fruit, some citrusy hops, raisin and plenty of resinous fermented fruit and alcohol. Nice.
Town Hall Ruby Jack;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Im not the biggest fan of barrel beers, certainly not bourban barrell ones. This had a huge bourban nose and flavor to it, to much for me. Fairly stong alcohol burn as well. The 3oz sample was enough for me, glad to try it though.

Town Hall Ruby Jack;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at Thall RBSG 07. A redish brown pour with a tan head and lace. A strong presence of abv and a bit of malt in the nose. A sweet beer with alot of abv. Some bitter. An almost mediciny taste. Mouthfeel is solid and carbonation is good. A good offering but a high abv that is not masked well. A trait that I think more aging would have done this beer some good.
Town Hall Ruby Jack;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark Amber Color. Wheat, Vinous, Syrupy Sweet Aroma. You Taste the Barrel and Alcohol Initially...Much Warming...Sweet, Syrupy...Lightly Crisped Bittersweet Aftertaste. Overall Quite Nice, Especially After Having Tried the Rubicon..Which Can Hold Its Own with This As Well.
Town Hall Ruby Jack;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;A magenta hued amber pour. Simple, dense whiskey and port aroma, soaked into biscuits and caramel scones. Orange and honey blossoms on the tongue – rather a forceful black licorice sweetness with a cough syrup bite. Cloying and medicinal in general, though certainly not to an offensive degree. Syrupy palate with just a hint of carbonation, lacking movement and clarity. A bit much.
Town Hall Ruby Jack;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Clear amber brown with a small (if any) head. Taste has that big alcohol burn with maple, vanilla and candi sugar. Mouthfeel and body is full with some dried fruit notes as well.
Bellevaux Black;Malmedy, Belgium;Old Ale;Brasserie de Bellevaux;Nice, dark brown, small, mocha head. Mostly decent, fruity hops and licorice with some darker fruits underneath, light tobacco, a little sweetness of brown sugar and butterscotch. Decent, well balanced hops and sweetness. Pours thinner than a stout which together with the distinct hoppy aroma and taste give this a unique character, quite unusual for a typical belgian ale.
Bellevaux Black;Malmedy, Belgium;Old Ale;Brasserie de Bellevaux;On tap at Brasserie de Bellevaux, Saturday 16th March 2019 en route to our new home in Attenkirchen, Bavaria via a stop off for the night in Heidelberg. Pours dark brown with a ruby glint when the light catches it. This is a decent beer and actually not so different from the Old Peculiar that it's trying to head towards. Malty with a very light roast a bitterness not unlike a UK bitter or porter. A touch of dark fruit, it's good.
Bellevaux Black;Malmedy, Belgium;Old Ale;Brasserie de Bellevaux;From the bottle. Very dark brown with a tall and foamy head. Aroma of blackcurrant, chocolate and overdone toast. Taste is mildly bitter with herbal undertones, including tea and parsley. Body is to the light side of medium, carbonation moderate to prickly, at times a bit empty. Overall though decent stuff.

North Cotswold Summer Solstice;Stretton on Fosse, Warwickshire, England;Wheat Ale;North Cotswold Brewery;The Jug and Jester (JDW), Leamington, 17/07/11. Pale, finely-laced gold. Sharp, acetic, white wine vinegar on strawberries aroma leaning into Payottenland. Wild and strange with a presumably unintended lambic sharpness, mildewed cardboard, lemon juice, wisp of smoke, TCP, strawberry hints. Very nearly unblended English lambic. Couldn’t finish. More off-the-scale weirdness from North Cotswold.

Some tanginess, served a bit too cool, aroma dulled by being slightly too cool.

Traditional Scottish Ales Sporran Warmer Blonde;Stirling, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Black Wolf Brewery;Sampled this in the Three Judges, Glasgow in July 2009. Cask, handpump dispense. Opaque pale amber in colour with a creamy white head. Strong and intense aroma of caramel and buttery toffee notes. Silky smooth mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts gives a sweet base with soft vanilla toffee and caramelised banana flavours. Very slight hop presence but really overpowered by the sweet malt right through to the toffee finish. A cracking Scottish blonde ale but some might find this too overly sweet.

Traditional Scottish Ales Sporran Warmer Blonde;Stirling, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Black Wolf Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at Pigs Ear Beer Festival, day 4 on 2 December 2010. Definitely listed on the TSA website as a Spring & Summer seasonal so I don’t know what it was doing at a festival in December. And it was certainly the Blonde as is was, well, blonde. But it wasn’t a zesty, hoppy blonde. Creamy malt was more prominent. And some toffee notes. Not a lot of hop presence at all. A bit odd really. Clean enough but not really to my taste.

De Koninck Zomerkoninck;Antwerpen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);"Draught Pours overwhelming head, pink & dense, pretty resistant; fruit-red/orange beer. Artificial raspberry nose, vanilla, ice cream, Delphi wild strawberry liqueur. Bitter, even hoppiness fighting & clashing with the strawberry/raspberry flavouring, even when served ice-cold. It’s like trying to bite (drink) a piece of flavoured soap. Finish is very empty, just a return of the hops, metallic in their context. Watery despite the 6%. Refreshing, maybe - unless you would let it warm up, I suppose - but it does not urge to continue. Whatever brings the perpetrators of the immortal bolleke to brew this kind of rubbish? Utter despair?"
De Koninck Zomerkoninck;Antwerpen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);Draught at the In de Wildeman. Nice red-amber color. Sweet, very candy-like strawberry essence aroma.

So here it is, Smells pretty good, taste like metal (not good) like the kind of spoon that leaves an extra touch to the taste of your corn flakes.

River City (CA) Double Woodenhead;Carmichael, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;River City (CA) Brewing;16 ounce pint on tap. I asked for the cask version of this but the bartender fucked up and gave me the draught version instead. Oh well. Piney, hoppy aroma present with plenty of caramel, roasty, malty notes present.

Pours dark gold with a huge off-white colored head. The aroma seems very promising as it has a pleasant hop floral scent. Unfortunately, the flavor is absolutely awful. It tastes like there is some sort of bacterial contamination. A strong and unpleasant acidic sournes is the dominant flavor.
Thunderhead Golden Fraü;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Smells of dried wheat or hay that got wet. This reminds of Wolavers organic honey wheat but doesn't capture the honey as well as that. You can catch a little honey up front but it fads quickly and you don't have any of the floral citrus or clover of the honey left. Very light and drinkable but not necessarily something I would go out of my way for. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Bull & Bush Black Bull Lager;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bull & Bush Brewery;This was my first schwarzbier/black lager. It was mostly black in color with brown around the edges where the light could peek through. The initial smell was malt vinegar, so much so that I thought they might have accidentally gotten some in my glass. It was a good smell though and I pushed onward to the tasting. The taste was a clean, lager taste with a smooth mouth-feel. I enjoyed this beer and one day I think I will be able to truly appreciate well made lagers.

Empyrean Better World Belgian-Style Wheat Ale;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Empyrean Brewing Company;Had on draft at the brewery in Lincoln, NE. Did not expect much and frankly, got an average to above avg. wheat. The pour was cloudy with flavors of spice and some fruity citrus with traces of banana. Very clean and refreshing and easy to quaff, but not much in the way of Belgian yeast flavors that I so love in a white. If your in the neighborhood, and the Haymarket in Lincoln is a great place to hang out, then stop in, the place is more of a restaurant with decent beers than a brewpub.

Bluegrass Chai Meade;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Mead;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Pours light golden with a fully receding white head. Aroma of insane chai spiciness, and that’s about it, I wish there was more to smell. Taste is 100% chai. In a blind smell/taste comparison to brewed chai tea, I doubt I could have detected the difference. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, slightly sticky with light carbonation. Chalk this one up as a failed experiment, I don’t think I would have served this one.

The Cidery Blackwood Wheat;Bridgetown, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cidery;The Cidery Blackwood Wheat (on draught at the brewery/restaurant, Bridgetown) The sun had just peaked through the deepest of cloud formation above the tree tops of this lovely brasserie on the upper hill side of a town known more as ‘fridge-town’, on account of it being oh-so-cold for a good portion of each year, than its own namesake, a logging town amongst rivers and streams – beautifully preserved and bursting with charm. The ciders available dominate, but the beers fresh off the wall mounted casks should not be missed upon a visit. This was the first:- Into a stemmed tulip, it produces an ochre tinged, yellow gold, highly translucent with little evident carbonation – are these served straight from the conditioning tanks, I wonder? Crowned off by a nicely formed frothy white head that retains well but laces little. The nose is subdued, a little . wheat malt and pale pils malt. The palate produces a massive burst of strawberries, raspberries and cherries – the ester profile is profound and dominates the softer, mildly earthy malt tones and subtle clove note in back. Very mellow, smooth and endearing presence in the mouth. The swallow is tangy, sweet meets dusty, with more fruit esters and a mild touch of phenols. This was the first wheat beer I have tasted to break right into the berry esters post fermentation. This was a charmingly refreshing wheat beer, one for the people who don’t drink beer that tastes like beer. Original!!!
The Cidery Blackwood Wheat;Bridgetown, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cidery;Tried on tap at the The Cidery. Dull, hazy straw coloured body with non-lasting head. Slight cloves, mushy over ripe banana and soft lemon in the taste but all tastes are a bit flat and a little uninspiring.

It actually tastes like a flemish sour ale now. still i couldnt dinrk it, the vinegar flavour was way too much to stand
Spinnakers Currant Noir;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;Grapey brown colour with no real head. Aroma is current and some alcohol. Tastes like currant juice as there is little carbonation or noticeable malts. Very sweet and quite easy to drink despite not tasting very beerlike.
Spinnakers Currant Noir;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;Bomber from Brewery Creek (bloody expensive too!) Poured a reddish brown with no head. Strong currant aroma, young red wine tones, some malt backing it up. Flat tasting, soft dark fruit flavours, some alc presence. Underwhelming. I was hoping for a bigger belgian flavour. Upon opening there was no release of pressure and no head formed when poured, perhaps my bottle was poorly capped...???

Old Bog Best Bitter;Oxford, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Bog;Gravity, Chester Arms beer festival. Warm amber red, loose soapy white foam. Musky, marmalade hops, a bit of wet dog, blackberries. Warm chewy hop flavor. Rustic. Some apricot dried fruit esters. Surprisingly full bodied for a 4% bitter. Maybe more fitting as a winter sort of beer, but fresh and full of character.

Steg 150;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery;For the malt-heads out there. It sort of reminded of cheap beer, powerful cheap beer. Although, the Steg was a bit lighter, which made it much more palatable.
Steg 150;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery;Where can I obtain this in the Boston, MA area? I am looking to use a ’150’ beer to celebrate the 150th anniversary of an event. Thanks.
Steg 150;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery;It poured a dark amber with a good sized light tan head. I expected a strong heavy malted drink from the color. It was much lighter bodied than I expected, more like a Vienna in the title. It was crisp and refreshing, words I normally write about a good Pilsner. It was well balanced with a light malt aftertaste.
Steg 150;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery;"Sometimes I worry when the bottle says ""all-malt"" because it implies that we would think it WASN’T all-malt. This is not just a normal crappy macro lager though, it’s a good bit darker and has a different flavor. I’m using ""different’ because I’m not sure if it’s good yet, but I have 2 more in the fridge so I will find out. It will be a BOLD EXPERIMENT."
Steg 150;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery;January 2009 Beer of the Month Club Overall Impression: Definitely a solid lager style beer, smooth and enjoyable, nothing particularly distinguishable about it, but it drinks nicely. **Photo submitted for this one today.
Steg 150;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery;Bottle, thanks to Mei. Caramel pour. Syrupy sweet malt aroma, maybe some sweet oats. Flavor is the same, mostly sweet, with the grain and oats in the background. Somewhat crisp finish, maybe a little floral hops.

Steg 150;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery;Solid. The aroma was overloaded w/ malts and subtle hops. It’s appearance is a dark amber color. It’s flavor is heavy malt and sublte hops, it ends curiosly with a sweetness, possibly fruit or sugars. This rather smooth. A nice session beer.
Steg 150;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery;this was a decent beer. Easy drinking and fairly smooth. Very average .

Hereford & Hops Soleil;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On draught at the brewpub in Wausau, WIsconsin. Pours a clear golden pale blonde brew with a fast dissolving white head the dissipates clean with no ring or lacing. Aroma of buttered popcorn, a touch of coconut, some faint grassy hops and some light herbal spice.

Hereford & Hops Soleil;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;A light grainy taste with a dry, faintyly coconut flavor. Light tan color. Slightly sweet aroma. Buttery finish.
Hereford & Hops Soleil;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Second time I tried this. On tap at the Cranberry H&H. Clear yellow, looks like the ubiquitous pale yellow american lager, filtered and refined. More candy like and sweet than harvest wheat. Slight to medium hop bitterness. Earthy candy attack. Below average carbonation. I think I like their harvest wheat a little more than this even tho it is supposedly a wit bier. This is not a witbier by euro standards. The small amount of hop bitterness in the finish must be to appeal to the hop lovers, but I don’t care for them. This is more like an APA.
Hereford & Hops Scottish Export;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;From 2007 notes. +++ Sampled on draft a the brewpub this beer poured a medium amber color with a small white head. The aroma was sweet and malty with a hint of vague fruits. The flavor was sweet and malty with hints of molasses and vague fruits. Short finish. Smooth.
Hereford & Hops Scottish Export;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Sweet smelling and the aroma of beer. Tan like iced tea. Has a decent size alabaster head. Very nice non offensive initial flavor. Easy and well behaved, has that Scottish gentleman courtesy. This beer seems to have more carbonation than the rest of the H&H beers I’ve tasted, a welcomed addition. Many of the good qualities of a session beer. Barely taste any alcohol, it is well hidden. Of course it is a low alky beer, nice for a change. Friendly easy and fun. Has a slight amount of malt bitterness building on the back of the palate. This is one of the better Scottish ales, nearly ranks right up there with East Ens Old Hickory. IMHO much better than the likes of McEwans and Three Floyyd Robert the Bruce!

Caramel colored with a nice thick off white head. Good retention and thin sticky lacing. Aroma begins caramel but soon becomes tart citrus and pine. Flavor behaves pretty much the same. Caramel with grapefruit and pine. A bit of spice. Unfortunately there is a bit of soap as well. Still, a pretty good APA.

Wasatch Blueberry Hefeweizen;Park City, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Can shared at Lucky Bamboo. Pours a clearish gold with a finger of foam that lingers. Big blueberry forward nose with nothing much else. Sweet and artificial blueberry flavors...a bit thin on the palate. Lingering vanilla and blueberry. Not for me.

Wasatch Blueberry Hefeweizen;Park City, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);This is more of a fruit beer than a Hefeweizen. It’s pleasant, and thirst quenching. Blueberry isn’t shy, but the Hefeweizen isn’t present as much as needed. Still it’s ok.
Wasatch Blueberry Hefeweizen;Park City, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Aroma is blueberries and slight funk/smelly socks. The flavor is blueberries/berries/muffin, malts, fruit and a mix of tart and mildly sweet in the finish.

Wasatch Blueberry Hefeweizen;Park City, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Hazy dark gold with decent head and a very clear blueberry aroma. Taste is not as zesty as many hefeweizens but that is good because it lets the blueberry really stand out. I love blueberries and this one is great because it is not overpowering or taste artificial. Overall I had to get it in the CAN and it is a wimpy 4% for the premium price tag so maybe not something I am going to stock up on.
Wasatch Blueberry Hefeweizen;Park City, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Tastes like a blueberry muffin. Comes in a recyclable can-- great for summer trips! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;From a 12 oz bottle called Organic Hop Cuvee Session IPA with Amarillo hops. Pours yellow with head and lace. Aroma of grains, minerals and amber malts. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Flavors of light malts, flowery hops, light minerals. Overall a nice session IPA.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;24-Sep-08 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 09-Sep-08 for $3.29 at BevMo in Encinitas, CA) Continuing on with this fun little series, the use of Amarillo hops in this beer really showcasing what you expect from this hops, imparting a fairly strong presence of sweet orange citrus up front while adding moderate earthiness and a touch of citrus rind bitterness in the finish. It’s a very enjoyable and balanced flavor profile, fruity, bright and crisp, but smooth and only moderately bitter, so no trashing of the palate with sharp, resiny bitterness. The base malts are lightly sweet, maybe a touch caramely, but generally a fairly clean pale ale flavor. The nose offers an inviting aroma of sweet oranges, but no pine or aggressive citrus rind. Medium in body with no thinning in the finish, and the moderate carbonation is soft on the palate. Golden-amber in color with a slight haze persisting throughout the session. The off-white head rises to half an inch before slowly settling to a thin, broken layer, leaving a wide, intricate ring of lace at the top of the glass and modest amounts of patchy and stringy lacing below. Overall, this is a really enjoyable IPA. Probably not bitter enough for hopheads, but wonderfully drinkable for the rest of us.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Bison IPA--Single Hop Series--Amarillo Hop--Organic--2007 22 oz. Bottle. 6.80% ABV. 50 IBU’s? (4.0 / 5.0) Thin mild lace head. Clear thin bright light gold color. Mild floral earthy hop front. Crisp clean dry sweet mild caramel body. Mild pine hop spice end. Balanced thinnish malt body highlights. Sampled 7/24/2007.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Pours amber with a white head. Smells of citrus and floral. Tastes of sweet citrus with some wildflower hints and a more restrained bitterness than the others in this series. Nice spicy finish.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Bomber pours clear copper with modest frothy off white head. The aroma is mild with sweet tangelo citrus, malt sweetness, a touch of earthiness and hinting toward organic malt cardboard. The taste is tangelo hops mixing with a pulse of malt sweetness making it taste sweet and citrusy right off. Toward midway I get increasing hop bitterness with pine hops and hop spiciness. The malt sweetness in the background balances this brew out nicely and only shows hints at the organic malt notes I consider off and distracting. But since the organic malt twang is so light it is not a problem. It ends with delicious citrus hop bitterness.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Amber with an off white one finger head. Good amount of lacings. Aroma is orange citrus and floral hop. Taste is quickly earthy bitter hops with enough malt sweetness to take some of the bitter edge off. Some orange and leather. Fairly dry bitter finish. Kudos to Bison for doing these single hop brews. Very interesting. Will look for more in the series.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;22oz bottle. Poured a medium and clear amber color with an averaged sized head. Aromas citrus and some tangerines. Tastes of citrus - oranges and grapefruits, and some pine. Had a lighter maltiness to it as well. Lightly bitter. If I had this blind, I would have guessed this was a Pale Ale.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Not horrible, not great - but this does get high marks for isolating the hop flavor so you know what hops you like. Amarillo by itself is pretty boring. But now I know how to isolate it. Ends on a nice citrus note, and doesn’t have much pine flavor in it.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;22 ounce bottle in the series of single hopped Bison IPAs--Poured darker than the others in the series. A rich, clouded amber body with a fluffy white head. Nose of piny, resinous hops. Bitter and dry in the smell alone. Flavor not as potent as nose might lead one to believe. Grapefruit pine stereotype is true here. Somewhat chalky, bitterness-laden and creamy caramel finish. Pretty good, but not the best single hopped IPA in the series.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Amarillo;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Decent, texbook IPA. Nice hop flavor with a caramel , medium bodied malt. I love this single hop series - really gives you a good impression of what each ingredient brings to the drink. This does highlight the alpha acid as it is very astringent and bitter. Heavy pine needle and grapefruit peel. Not a big fan of the Amarillo hop, single or in blends. really decent organic ale.

AleSmith Decadence 2006;San Diego, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;AleSmith Brewing Company;Bottle buried deep in the cellar and re-discovered during move prep. I have no idea what this was originally but it has aged into something fantastic. It starts with a hit of hops in the aroma and flavor. I have no idea how the hops have held on over the years. It quickly mellows into a caramel, sweet, malty English barley wine style ale. This is drinking fantastically right now if you have a bottle tucked somewhere and are wondering if you should open it.
AleSmith Decadence 2006;San Diego, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;AleSmith Brewing Company;Poured from a 22 ounce bomber, thanks to Jeff. Big notes of caramel, toffee, raisin. This beer has aged well.

AleSmith Decadence 2006;San Diego, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;AleSmith Brewing Company;Notes from June 2010. Pours a murky mahogany with a thick light tan head, lots of lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt, caramel, dark dried fruits, brown sugar, and slight resin. Flavor matches well and this beer held up surprisingly well. I really wonder what this was like fresh.
AleSmith Decadence 2006;San Diego, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;AleSmith Brewing Company;750mL bottle, sent from Glouglouburp (thanks a lot Dany!), pours a beautiful dark mahogany with a large foamy beige head. Divine aroma of plums, raisins, brown sugar, heaps of caramel malt / toffee, and even a feint trace of hops still roaming around. Flavour brings out huge grapes, some plum and maybe raisins, toffee, and brown sugar - hops have all but died, but doesn’t matter, this is exceedingly well-balanced and sort of reminiscent of a barley wine. Absolutely no signs of oxidation or anything going off about this. Finishes quite dry and semi-sweet, with everything working in perfect harmony. Sticky, viscous palate and uber-decadent in all aspects.
AleSmith Decadence 2006;San Diego, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;AleSmith Brewing Company;Bottle at Churchills, San Marcos. It pours very deep ruby, with a thick off-white head. The nose is pine, resin, raisin, currant, plum, caramel and brown sugar. The taste is caramel, varnish, dark fruit - cherry, prune, plum ,raisin, earth and toast, with alcohol warmth in the finish. Full body, moderate carbonation and slightly sticky mouth-feel. Great balance. All-round it’s very good.

Short beige head with good retention. Aroma’s: some roasted malts, drop/licorice, fruit confit, slightly sour, just a hint of banana. Retronasal there’s a bit of the sourness of the wheat. Flavor is light to moderate sweet, roasted malt. Body is rather full. Flavor lingers. Maybe it got too old, but it’s not very true to the style. Pleasant enough though.
Minamishinshu Dunkel Weizen;Komagane, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Cherry aroma, red fruit, roasted malt. Plum juice, biscuit, sour finish. Nice creamy and fruity Dunkel.

Minamishinshu Porter;Komagane, Japan;Porter;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Bottle at Hotel Iidaya, Matsumoto - shared with Mette. Black - white head. Roasted malts, light coffee, licorice, ok medium bitterness, light smokey notes, milkey feeling.
Minamishinshu Porter;Komagane, Japan;Porter;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Draught at Beer Republic. Jet black, glowing, very smooth, fine head. Roasty chocolate nose, charcoal and coffee. Light fruit. Well roasted, clean flavor, with dark chocolate, coffee, and wood. Bitter and straight-forward. Nice, but a bit simple. Smooth, medium body.
Minamishinshu Porter;Komagane, Japan;Porter;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Black colored with little beige head. Caramelly and sweet roasted aroma with thin licorice, somehow tangy still. Thin to medium bodied. Flavor is more dry in start with licorice and roastiness too, aftertaste has nice hops with grassy notes.
Minamishinshu Porter;Komagane, Japan;Porter;Minamishinshu Beer Company;My Bottom Line: Roasted malts and thin caramel brethren laxly meet and never agree on a common goal. This lightly tart, lean Porter remains a decent dark ale, but it is overshadowed by its Minamishinsyu acolytes. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam laces atop the burgundy-sleeved black. -A pleasant fruitiness recalls raisins. -The soft effervescence helps drinkability. -Roastiness returns in the finale, but doesn’t have much help. -Earthiness attempts to link the caramel and roastiness, sometimes succeeds. -Not much of a success as a Porter imho, but you can’t say this is not well brewed. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Minamishinshu Porter;Komagane, Japan;Porter;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Dark brown color. Sweet chocolate malty nose with just a faint hint of dark fruit and brownies. Mouth is medium, but flavors are a bit too muted. Dry semi-sweet finish that had me thinking brownies, but I was reaching for something. Decent, but not great. Rerating 12 years on and nothing really new to add. It’s the same beer and I would give it between 3.4 to 3.5 now, but maybe that’s how I felt back then. Detected a bit more soy sauce or vegemite in this. Decent, but not great summaries this perfectly
Minamishinshu Ki No Sato;Komagane, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Bottle from Shinshu Sake Mura. 4.5% a lightly cloudy gold with a foamy white head. Bready sweet and mildly floral aroma. Med-full bodied, the taste is like seltzer water, crackers, and light bitting hoppiness in the finish. Meh.
Minamishinshu Ki No Sato;Komagane, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Bottle at Shinshu Sake Mura. Cloudy blond colour, off white creamy head. Aroma is grainy, malty. Taste similar, very grainy again, flour, slight fruitiness. Bit boring, but ok.
Minamishinshu Ki No Sato;Komagane, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Bottle at the Nagano Sake Village. Dark gold color. Clear medium height, fine head. Very fruity aroma, honey, caramel, sweet. Honey-like flavor. Very malty, but not very interesting. Not enough hops. Thick and cloyingly sweet.
Minamishinshu Ki No Sato;Komagane, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Minamishinshu Beer Company;My Bottom Line: This Blond Ale’s shy straw and subtle citrusy, herbal hops definitely point at a watered down version of their regular Golden Ale recipe, and a semi-successful one at that. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam disappears into the very pale golden. -This is quite carbonated, but it doesn’t bother that much in the end. -The body is obviously feathery, but the maltiness still retains some crispness. -This is a well-brewed, low gravity Blond Ale, but its flavor profile is surely not for the beer geek. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Minamishinshu Ki No Sato;Komagane, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Minamishinshu Beer Company;Pale golden color. Peaches, pineapples bananas in the nose. Light body, citrus and peachy. Light dry citrusy finish. It reminded me of a watered down version of the golden ale.
Baird Protruding Nail Citrus Porter;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Baird Brewing Co.;Skip the aroma since having it in sampler glass. Dark with minimum head. Sweet with faint bitterness, orange chocolate just like described and some herbal. Long lasting, medium to full bodied. Good but a little bit on the sweet side. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Baird Protruding Nail Citrus Porter;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Baird Brewing Co.;My Bottom Line: The roasted maltiness and citrusy fruitiness of this wacky Porter ingeniously meld into a perilously drinkable vehicle, ending on a refreshingly bitter note of more roastiness. Believe it or not, this actually works! Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the brown-sleeved black. -Most of Baird’s many fruit beers of the same quality, it seems. -Even though some chocolate cake can be tasted in here, maltiness is not the center of attention. -Carbonation is smooth and thus the mouthfeel is easygoing, like most of Baird’s mouthfeels. On tap at the brewery tap room.
Baird Protruding Nail Citrus Porter;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Baird Brewing Co.;Dark brown color. Chocoate malt and citrusy nose that is not particularly strong. The mouth jumps out with tooties rolls, caramel, citrus, brownies. Slightly tart, but well balanced. Chocolately finish with moderate tartness and bitterness. Kind of like an unsweet tooties roll liquified and put in grapefruit juice.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;10 oz tulip draft at the Baird Harajuku Taproom in Los Angeles, California. The pour is a hazed brown with a 1/2 inch tan head that leaves behind a thick coating of lace. The aroma is soft roast, citrus orange fruit, clean and natural. The taste is orange fruit and citrus resin, the fruit soft sweetness is cut by the soft roast malt. The palate is light to medium bodied with soft carbonation and the citrus and roast finish. Simple but incredibly clean and fresh. The balance and cleanliness of this beer are amazing.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;Dark brown, big head. Roasty porterish aroma. Quite toasty, light roast, moderate bitterness, like a hoppy, toasty porter.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle. Pours almost black, beige head, decent head and foam that leaves nice lacings. Aroma is relatively soft, with some injected robust roastiness and a bit of fresh hops, green apple. Taste is quite fruity, hop bitterness mixed with some soft raisins and dark plums. Long lingering bitterness at the end, half of it coming from hops and second half from burnt-roasted malts. Overall, the body feels quite round and soft, medium, so the strong hop profile at the end comes a bit of a surprise. Good stuff.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;Review from last year. On tap at Nakameguro Taproom. Served in a stemmed tulip. Jet black with purple highlights and a nice big soapy head. Strong chocolatey malt aroma with hints of currant, muscat, citrus, cacao, seaweed and kale. Burned flavors are also present along with some pine needles. Mouthfeel is oily with an astringent finish of charred vegetables. Really interesting and awesome offering from Baird. Easily one of the best seasonals they offer.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle from Yamaoka. Black with beige head. Chocolate malt aroma, no hint of hops. Flavour has a nice hop finish to balance the initial malty chocolate hit.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;One of the nicest Baird seasonals in a while, dark chocolate malt balanced with nice fruity hops and hints of berries. Very smooth for a black IPA, okawari kudasai!
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;On tap at Bungalow. A dark reddish brown pour with a thick foamy light beige head. A good dose of chocolate malts & resinous hops in the nose. Medium bodied with a good chocolatey creamy flavor and a lightly bitting bitter hop finish. Good.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle from The Craic, Takamatsu. Good stinky nose of dark fruits, musty hops, and, yes, kelp. Medium to high fizz, but nicely rounded. Slightly sticky aftertaste. Sweetness of licorice and blackcurrents there too. Juicy and hoppy. I like.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;Tap at Good Beer Faucets. Dark brown, very dark red colour with golden head. Aroma is cream, chocolate, roast malt, bit of smokiness, pine and citrus hops. Taste has some dark fruits, lots of malt, ovaltine-like almost. Touch of spice in there too giving it a bit of a prickle. At the same time, some chocolatey sweetness. Maybe something herbal in there too. Finish is toasty with subtle bitterness. Very smooth and medium bodied. Very nice. Rerate Jun 15. Very different, oaty and treacle, smoke and caramel. Interesting. Lots of malt and light hoppiness at the end. Quite different.
Baird Rainy Season Black Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle, 12C. Black with a large beige head. Smells very fruity with stone and citrus fruits, some chocolate, pine and slight burnt notes. Oily mouthfeel. Not all that sweet. Astringent roasted and coffee notes straight away, but peaches and a little citrus are there too. A bit of dark toffee and pine are underneath. Bitterness is there but not as pronounced as I’d guess - there’s nearly as much astringency at the end as bitterness. Tasty and well-balanced.
Sankt Gallen Kokutou Sweet Stout;Atsugi-shi, Japan;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sankt Gallen Brewery;Botella. Deep dark brown colour, medium light brown head. Sweet roasty malty aroma. Flavour is sweet with roasted malt, some chocolate and bit dark fruit. Thin like.
Hogs Back Brooklands Gold Star (Cask);Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Nose very typical fruity hogs back. Dark chestnut colour, fine off-white head.

Hogs Back Brooklands Gold Star (Cask);Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;BCA. Sweet toffeeish malts with hints of richer roast flavours. A bit of the usual Hogs Back yeast flavour which can be slightly offputting to me. Drinkable enough but not great.
Hogs Back Brooklands Gold Star (Cask);Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Bottle. Copper with a small head. Aromas are malty with cookies. Some pear and spices. Flavours are sweet toffee and chocolate with pear and some citrus. Dry on the finish. Decent.

Good copper colour... light fruit nose ... Decent enough main beer , little balanced fruit malt but its too drying bitter in linger for me... decent enough session ale.
Hogs Back Brooklands Gold Star (Cask);Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Bottle. A boring bitter. Balanced beween the hop and the malt. Boring, grainy, lightly sweet mouthfeel. Some chemically type stuff happening in the finish.
Hogs Back Brooklands Gold Star (Cask);Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask handpull at the Wetherspoons in Kingston. Reddish amber colour. Hogs Back yeasty aroma, plenty of deep red berry fruit in mouth and then harsh, but balanced brambly hedgerow hop finish that lasted for a good 5 minutes in the mouth. Malts are hedgerow and berry fruits that are juicy and mix well with this harsh hop finish.

Chstnut with a deep creamy beige head; citrus aromas; fruity and sharp with a predominantly orange flavour, but smooth and creamy and easy to drink; leaves a lingering bitterness."
Hakusekikan Dual Porter;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Porter;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Draught at Popeye Tokyo (rated Apr 2008). Head is mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, chocolate, caramel, nuts), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of gum and plum. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Interesting example, quite rich in the malt department, dare I say decadent. Yummy stuff.
Hakusekikan Dual Porter;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Porter;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Bottle @ RBESG 09 Shefield ... Black color. Raosted malt aroma, with aramel notes. Flavor is raosted malt with an infected sourness. Too bad, it would have been much beter if it wasn’t infected.

Fujizakura Heights Märzen (~2014);Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;2013 version Aroma: rather mild and hard to name given it was rather cold. Palate: deceptively medium-bodied but quite filling. Flavor: understated roast, malt hint of smoke, and orange. Lingering malty orange flavor. Comment: well integrated flavors gave this an edge over the 2014 version.
Fujizakura Heights Märzen (~2014);Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Keyaki. Ratings getting messy. Nice sweetness, caramel, good maltiness, good stuff.
Fujizakura Heights Märzen (~2014);Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;At World Craft Tasting 2013, Osaka. An opaque orange-red color with a fruity aroma. The flavor is grainy malty caramel. Some bready toasty qualities but it doesn’t measure up to their normal high standard.
Fujizakura Heights Märzen (~2014);Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;"Draught at the brewery. Rather deep amber color with a huge head. Mild, creamy, caramel flavor; slightly fruity and also slightly alcoholic for its strength. OK, but disappointing compared to their other beers."
Fujizakura Heights Märzen (~2014);Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Draught at the brewpub. Clear brownish amber, rich head. Lightly roasty with a whiff of butter. Medium bodied, well rounded. Lightly caramelly with low bitterness. Pleasant, but not the most outstanding beer at Fujizakura.
Fujizakura Heights Märzen (~2014);Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Had on draught at the Oktoberfest in Hibiya Park. Clear orange in color with thre fingers of white head. Bread, caramel malts, some fruit hops. Very drinkable and really refreshing. I wish I could have had more.
Fujizakura Heights Märzen (~2014);Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;My Bottom Line: This Märzen’s crunchy biscuity malts and apricot fruitiness thrive unabated in a starkly unfiltered garb. A drying hop finish seals the deal, and one is amazed at how well this has held up. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam decorates the yeast microcosm living within the orange glow. -A 3-year-old regular gravity lager in tip-top shape. Wow. -The doughy yeast adds a layer of complexity. -The malts also develop some caramel. -Nourishing yet drinkable, flavorful yet at times incohesive (old age, surely). 2004 bottle at Popeye’s.
Fujizakura Heights Märzen (~2014);Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Found this at the back of the fridge at Popeye’s. Expired in July 2004 and had it in June 2007. Damn, it held up well!!! Would love to try this fresh. Deep amber color, bready, caramel malt with somewhat peachy nose. Somewhat austre malty buscuity mouth with notes of peaches and caramel. Austre buscuity, carmelly finish. Hope they make this again.

Laško Bandidos Power;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Average aroma, appearance, taste and palate. Not particularly memorable. Rated in the past from the bottle.
Laško Bandidos Power;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;"Typical slovenian beer. Nothing special, average quality but if there is nothing special around it can make you better evening or more refreshing summer :). Added aroma makes this ""beer"" not a real beer but more pop-drink. --not available any more"
Laško Bandidos Power;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Bottled in Logatec. Looks like lemonade. Smells like Red Bull. Tastes sweet, thin perfumy, soapy and heavily artificial. Un-beery, but not toally horrible. Think Red Bull, but more artificial.
Laško Bandidos Power;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Can. Looks weaker than the cider I just rated before but bit more greenish. Very fast disappearing fizzy head. Strong sweet Red Bull aroma. The flavour is quite sweet with Red Bull...... hmm there is some trace of beer but quite weak..... Sweet bit dry Red Bull bit fruitish finish. Not that bad but nothing to do with beer... as I know it. Well, if I could I would drink this as a substitute to Red Bull but I never drink that either..... Energy Beer...?........ Hvala Ogi.
Laško Bandidos Power;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;0.33l can. I told no more bandidos, but a friend brought it from Rijeka, so I had to drink one. Let me see... Some poop color, no head, actually there is somewhat like in orange juice, just some traces of beer in the taste, red bull...yes, more like it but not still... stupid combination anyway and this is not beer however.
Laško Bandidos Power;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Canned(330ml). -From some local store in Rogaška Slatina, Slovenia. Pale green-yellow (like there was a seaweed for a week in a glass and filled it with color), some small fizzy white head and red bull nose. The taste is also red bull with some weak malt and dry (hop) notes. Contains guarana????!!!Stupid...
Laško Bandidos Power;Laško, Slovenia;Flavored - Other;Pivovarna Laško;Can shared with and courtesy of ozujsko (thanks!) A surprising new addition to the Bandidos line that replaced Hot. The two share some of the ingredients (safflower for example), but this one’s pretty much supposed to be beer with red bull. And it shows, especially in the aroma, which is 100% red-bull like energy drink (the 0.01% of guarana seemed to show). The appearance made me question (again) the 85% of beer. It’s extremely, extremely pale green-yellow. The base beer must be damn weak taste and colour-wise... Anyway, the taste is sweet, without the saltiness the energy drinks tend to show.... guarana, a bit malt, caramel even. Crap. Drinkable, passable, but still crap.

Karl Strauss Raspberry Windansea Wheat Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Firkin at Beach To BreweryAroma is definitlely tart raspberries, some sweet clove and banana are there but not as pronounced as Karl’s regular hefe. Pours hazy yellow. Tart flavor of fresh raspberries. Definitley a natural fruit flavor dominates the original clovey flavor of the standard hefe. Is smooth and mildly carbonated, as it was out of a firkin. Smooth, yet tart, very refreshing. A nice special offering from Karl.

This poured a hazy golden colour with a small thick & creamy white head that went away slowly. The nose was quite fine... honey, creamy, bit hoppy.

OK, bready taste, a bit on the sweet side, soft, slightly empty, with a strange note somewhere between herbal and alcohol-like, ends up beet-like and a tad bitterish. Eh, still sub-par for what it is, but likely serves its purpose @Gastro well. up to 2.5, but 2.4 would’ve done as well. June 2007: Plastic bottle shared with and courtesy of ozujsko (thanks!) Imagine that, a few days after I thought I sorted out all the breweries in Slovenia, ozujsko finds a new one. And I’m definitely not complaining. Though, considering the quality, I probably should. This poured a light golden-yellow colour with lively carbonation and a medium sized thick creamy white head that went away slowly. The nose is quite grainy with notes of hay and eggs. The taste is quite grainy with some hay and weak, weak hopiness. Bit creamy but unimpressive and one dimensional. Not bad but distinctly average. Overly so even. 4/2/5/2/11
Lipnik Svetlo Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Pivovarna Lipnik;Pours a clear darker golden color, topped with a small, lasting white head. Mild malty aroma with some bready notes. Taste is gentle, grassy hops with some lemony feel to it and some bready notes again. Moderate bitterness. Crisp and refreshing. Ok.
Lipnik Svetlo Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Pivovarna Lipnik;Slightly cloudy yellow appearance, medium head. Mildly hoppy, light body, not overly balanced. Nothing special, average Premium Lager.
Lipnik Svetlo Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Pivovarna Lipnik;0,50L on tap at Orient Express pub in Divaca, Slovenia. Slightly hazy, yellow colour with average big, thick, white head. Aroma of citrusy hops. Taste is moderate bitter with a lot of lemon and some grapefruit on tongue. Finish is acidic. Watery mouthfeel, soft carbonation, light to medium body.
Lipnik Svetlo Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Pivovarna Lipnik;Draught at Pivovarna Lipnik, Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia. After 6 hours on pools in Rogaška Slatina on +33degrees (celsius), I couldn’t wait to drink beer, especially new one. And that new one disappointed me. Light hazy honey yellow coloured, small airy but lasting white head, lively carbonation. Mild malty and hoppy aroma with slight sweet honey and yeasty notes. Short bitterish finish.
Lipnik Temno Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Lipnik;From beer fountain in Zalec. Pitch black color, with a medium beige head. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee. Taste is roasted malts, coffee, some little sourness, nice bitterness too, enough. Easy drinkability for a schwarzbier. Nice.
Lipnik Temno Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Lipnik;Pours a pitch black color, topped with a small and quickly disappearing beige colored head. Aroma of roasted malts dominating, perhaps a little bit of chocolate. Starts sweet, roasty body with some coffee, soury finish with minimal bitterness. Aftertaste is coffee and roasty, but mild. Easily drinkable, surprisingly light and nice.
Lipnik Temno Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Lipnik;Pours dark brown with light brown tiny head. Aroma of roasted malts, little presence of chocolate. Similar is taste with sweet notes of chocolate and little too roasted finish. Overall drinkable beer. Medium body, soft carbonation, well balanced bitterness.
Lipnik Temno Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Lipnik;Dark red to black appearance, medium to thick head. Roasted malty aroma, mild chocolate and coffee. Decent dark beer.
Lipnik Temno Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Lipnik;0,50L on tap at Orient Express pub in Divaca, Slovenia. Clear, dark amber colour with creamy, light brown head. Nice aroma of milk chocolate, roasted malts, cacao and white coffee. Taste starts light acidic, what is kinda weird for this kind of beer, but it turns bitter in the aftertaste. Light to medium body, soft carbonation, astringent finish. Beer with potencial, but this acidity spoils it a bit.
Lipnik Temno Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Lipnik;Pours dark with a low head, smell is yeasty and not very strong. The taste is gentle and with low carbonation. A gentle soir aftertaste
Lipnik Temno Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Lipnik;Draught at Pivovarna Lipnik, Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia. Black coloured, medium sized pale beige head, buttery and coffee nose. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, mild chocolate and stracciatella. Pleasant chocolate notes in the finish.
Lipnik Temno Pivo;Šmarje pri Jelšah, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Lipnik;Plastic bottle shared with and courtesy of ozujsko (thanks!) Poured a black (really really dark red really) colour body on top of which stood a medium to small white head that went away at a medium pace. The nose was light and pleasant... cocoa and coffee. The taste was similar... strong coffee-cappuccino, maybe a bit thin/watery but very bitter. Too one dimensional for my taste but showed potential.
Tuš Premium Svetlo Pivo;Lohnbrauhausen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Unknown Origin - Germany (Brauerei Nemo Namenlos);Canned, 0.50l. Clear golden color with medium frothy white head. Aroma is grainy, grassy and dusty. Taste starts with sweet malt, follows by cooked vegetables flavor with dry mouthfeel and strong typical German bitterness at finish. Light body, thin texture and lively carbonation in palate. Cheap trick...
Tuš Premium Svetlo Pivo;Lohnbrauhausen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Unknown Origin - Germany (Brauerei Nemo Namenlos);Average aroma, appearance, taste and palate. Decent, somewhat memorable. Rated in the past from the can.
Tuš Premium Svetlo Pivo;Lohnbrauhausen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Unknown Origin - Germany (Brauerei Nemo Namenlos);Canned in Logatec, Slovenia. Clear golden, brief head. Fruity nose with alcohol and vegetables. Sweet and messy. Sticky syrup where rotting fruits are swimming. The sickening sweetness taks the edge of the foul off-flavours caused by cost cutting in the production. Barely tolerable.
Tuš Premium Svetlo Pivo;Lohnbrauhausen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Unknown Origin - Germany (Brauerei Nemo Namenlos);Canned(500ml). -Pale golden with small white head and dusty nose. Grainy with sweet notes of malt and faint hop aroma. Strong corn presence and sharp unpleasant bitter finish.

Poured a lasting white medium sized thick head. The nose is weak... grainy and dusty. The taste is bad... corn primarily, some malt and hopiness. Premium? Don’t make me laugh.
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Can 0,5l from Tus supermarket in Koper. Pale golden crystal liquid, almost water like, minimal head. Light smell, a hint of lemon. Light body and carbonation. Light taste of lemon, a hint of metal, medium sweetness, a hint of wine in taste. Weird. -- rated with beerbasher/winphone
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Clear yellow color, very small white head with no retention. Aroma of artificial lemon, ice tea. Very sweet, syrupy...light body, light carbonation. More like lemon ice tea... And a bad one. -- rated with beerbasher/winphone
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Pours a very pale golden color, topped with a small and quickly disappearing white head. Mild malty aroma, some very faint notes of citruses, but more aroma of grass - skunky and dusty as well (not nice). Taste has a mild sugary sweetness and slight fruity feel, although barely. Not unpleasant taste, but nothing to be excited about.
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Slightly hazy pale yellow appearance with low head. Strong lemon and citrus aroma, artificial notes. Refreshing, typical supermarket chain Radler, but below average overall.
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Canned, 0.50l. Hazy straw color with medium frothy white head and sparkling appearance. Strong citric aroma, quite artificial. Taste starts with sour refreshing lemon juice, while finished with very light maltiness. Light body, sticky texture and lively carbonation in palate. Pretty decent radler, however still without any beer character...
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);.5l can from Tus Supermarket in Sarajevo. Pale, light radler, not very sweet as these balkan fruit beers go. Lighter lager body, with artificial lemonade overtones. Sticky, not very quenching, odd and not very good
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);02/08 0.5 l can from Tuš, Jesenice. Had pale yellow body with small head and typical artificial cheap radler aroma. Sweetish sprite radler flavor, too carbonated... OK, it was drinkable, but boring and it’s radler and, the most important, is very bad, so what else to say...
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Canned(500ml). -Pale yellow coloured, airy white head, lively carbonation. Sweet lemony taste with some dusty notes and nothing else.
Tuš Rener;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Can courtesy of and shared with ozujsko (thanks!) Medium to big white head, really pale yellow, bit greenish colour, even for a Radler. Very lively carbonation. The nose... citric acid. The taste is quite sweet and there’s nothing but lemon. Unimpressive, but had worse radlers. This one at least avoids being foul.
Weeping Radish Corolla Light;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;Bottle from Manteo location. I couldn’t find any info on the fest this beer was made for. Ok aroma, Toasty, yeasty. Cereal, grass, sourdough. Pale, tad hazed, golden yellow color. Small head that did manage to stay for a while, ok lacing. Bittersweet flavor, like aroma, though in my notes I wrote grainy, doughy, grassy. Lite body, watery mouthfeel, bitter grassy finish. Pleasant enough. easy to drink, classic pale lager.
John Harvards Hugh Hefe;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap. Extremely cloudy. I got an unusual sourish aspect out of this one in the citrus (orange, lemon) area, with decent amounts of spices. Maybe I’m crazy, as it was from the same glass as LilBeerDoctor, below. Mustily, earthily yeasty as well. To me unique if nothing else.
John Harvards Hugh Hefe;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap. The cloudiest beer I’ve ever seen. Looked like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, no head. Aroma of yeast, bread, spices, and rotten eggs. Flavor of the usual clove and other spices, orange peel. Very thick. Decent hefe.
John Harvards Hugh Hefe;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at the Lake Grove location. Arrived at the table a cloudy yellow gold with a very narrow white ring for a head, which promptly disappeared after the first sip. Mild aroma of banana, cloves, and wheat. The wheat is stronger in the flavor than in the aroma, as are the cloves. Some light banana also in the flavor. As the beer warms, a pleasant lemon flavor develops, especially in the aftertaste. An ok beer.
John Harvards Hugh Hefe;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Pint pour. Color is a yellow and misty (as opposed to murky). Aroma is more like a spiced Wit, only lightly estery with a bit of corn. Taste is a bit corn again and again lightly spiced wit mixed with hefe. Not the worst version of a hefe that I have tried at a JH, they really need to rework the angle on this style.
John Harvards Hugh Hefe;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap @ Lake Grove John Harvards. Poured a mildly hazed yellow color with no head. Phenolic clovey aroma is mild with some wheaty lemon notes. The flavor has some mild clove to start then a banana middle with the spice coming back again to finish long. Light bodied.
John Harvards Hugh Hefe;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Cloudy yellow beer with no head at all... I’ve never seen such a limp-looking hefeweizen. The aroma is fairly spicy, but more wit than weizen. Lemony citrus, orange peel and a touch of clove. No real banana character speak of. Quite sweet tasting with fairly bready wheaty character. Wheaty spice, full-bodied. It’s okay, but it’s fairly pedestrian.
John Harvards Hugh Hefe;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;First of all, best name for a hefeweizen...ever - I like that the bartender asked if I wanted a lemon or not - most just stick it right on there - cloudy yellow pour, with a quickly fading head - moderate wheat malt aroma, with apparent yeastiness, hints of clove, soft earthiness - the expected clove flavor is there, but not too much so, and the banana that so often dominates these beers is hardly there (a welcome change) - medium honey and orange sweetness and mild spicy/peppery notes - a light, slightly unwelcome hop profile develops in the finish - a decent hefe.
John Harvards Dunkelweizen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a very dark brown with some reddish hues along the edge when held against a light. There is a very thin off-white head that completely disappears within the first two sips. Pleasant aroma of sweet malt and some floral hops. The flavor is again sweet malt with some light roast and just a bit of cocoa. Very mild bitterness at the finish. Very quaffable. Overall, an enjoyable and solid dunkel.
John Harvards Dunkelweizen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap. Aroma of some sweet dark fruits, sweet malt, lightly roasted. Flavor quite sweet with some chocolate. A little thin. Not bad, but a touch sweet, didn’t get me going.
John Harvards Dunkelweizen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at John Harvards. Pours a dark brown/amber with a tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, flowery hops. Flavor is quite sweet, with roasted malt. Smooth-bodied and easily drinkable. One of the better JH beers I’ve had.
John Harvards Dunkelweizen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Poured a hazy dark brown color with a medium sized creamy tan head. The aroma was wheaty and roasty with a light spice to it. The flavor is light and again wheaty and roasty. Light bodied with a clean finish and mild hop.
John Harvards Dunkelweizen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;"Pint glass, pours black with a tan head, looks like a porter. Aroma is slightly charred and spiced wheat mixing with dark fruits (some light prune). Taste is a light roast. Leaves a slight roasty, fruity-sweet aftertaste. Very quaffable and refreshing despite this ""dark"" flavors. Recommended for sure."
John Harvards Dunkelweizen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Gorgeous brown beer with a thick moussey dark brown head. Aroma is fairly soapy initially, although a touch of nuttiness kicks in. It’s really hard to get much of anything out of the nose. The flavour shows a soft toasted wheat character. Full-bodied with soft chocolate and dates. Body lovely and creamy though. There is a chewy chocolatey flavour. The yeast seems awfully clean to me though, lacking all the fruit and spice that I normally go for. Nice enough, but lacks a lot of character.
John Harvards Dunkelweizen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Dark ruby hue, with a thick ring of off-white foam - aroma of chocolate-covered cherries, caramel, strong wheat malt, faint spices - light-bodied, but a creamy mouthfeel despite this - lightly tart up front, with cherry flavors (pits and skins included), followed by a dry cocoa character, a touch of nutmeg and other spices - complex and refreshing at the same time - the new brewer here has really hit his stride.
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Bottle from Yamaoka. Full and rich aromas of banana, chocolate malts and hint of spice. Nicely textured, with smooth rounded finish. Just enough depth, and a nice mellowness that had it go well with food. Good stuff.
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Well made and clean as with all their product. Nice chocolate and cherry notes accompany their classic Weizen taste. Good stuff.
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Keyaki. Dark brown with golden head. Aroma bit of banana, lots of roast, soy sauce. Taste is similar, banana, vanilla, bit of booze. Slightly savory. Pretty good.
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;On tap at the Kyoto Craft Beer Fest. A nice dark color with a tan head. A fruity aroma with a slight spiciness to it. The flavor is like a weizen with fruits with clove taste over a rich malt base with perhaps a bit of sour finish. Another solid beer from Fujizakura.
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Bottle from Yamaoka. Rather dark brown with a huge, fine, tan head. Fragrant aroma of banana, clove, and a touch of caramel and chocolate. Rich, thick wheat malt flavor with creamy banana and spice. Cloves. Relatively sweet with a touch of sour to balance. Has a slight chocolate touch. Could have more dark malt. Finish is slightly sour and malty with bananas and fruit. Very nice indeed, and certainly very reliably made, although maybe not quite dark enough.
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Bottle from trade with TimE. Huge foamy head. Creamy off-white color. Brown-amber color. Not sweet or dry. Not bitter. Easy to drink. Some long-boil caramelization in the aroma.
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Bottle. Dark, thick muddy colour with slight amber tones. Nice banana smell from the lavender brown head. Mouthfeel is balanced, but thin, taste is biscuits, cherry coke, slight herbal presence, The taste just sort of creeps out and then fadesd away, so if lacks a real distinguishable finish..but overall a nice beer when the mood strikes. Curious to try this on tap to compare.
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Draft at Ushitora. Deep caramel in color with a heavy tan head. Sweet malty aroma with fruit and some wheat. Very flavorful. Fruity, sweet malts, some toasted malts, and a bit of banana. I couldn’t stop drinking this beer, it was too tasty. Could easily drink this all night (and into the morning).
Fujizakura Heights Dunkel Weizen;Kawaguchiko-cho, Yamanashi-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fujikankokaihatsu Co. / Sylvans Restaurant;Hazy dark brown color. Cookies, dark chocolate, baked cake and bananas in the nose makes me wish this was sometype of cake. Bananas, chocolate, cookies, mildly sweet mouth. Chocolate banana cake finish. Found this better in the bottle on draft surprisingly.
North Rock St Davids Light;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Rock Brewing Co.;Cask@Frog and Onion, Dockyards, Bermuda. Golden beer with a light head. The aroma is very weak and the flavour is lightly dry. Overall an average dry lager.
North Rock St Davids Light;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Rock Brewing Co.;Pours yellow to almost white with a thin white head. Smells of dry malt, some biscuits, earthy. Tastes perfumy with some nice dry grass and hay elements. Refreshing.
North Rock St Davids Light;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Rock Brewing Co.;Sample at the Frog & Onion in Bermuda: Pale yellow-gold color with a thin and foamy white head. Patchy lacing on the glass. Light hoppy aroma persists throughout, along with notes of grass. Light-bodied and effervescent with a clean hops flavor, as well as a bit of fruit. The finish is mildly bitter hops with a short fruity aftertaste. Overall it is decent.
Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);"Happoshu or ’bubbling spirit’ is an easier way to digest that this is a rice fermented beverage more than a beer, but here goes. Smuggled back from Taiwan. Translucent amber with a fine bead and whispy white foam. Aroma of gumboots - oh that is a first! Urinal cakes otherwise. It definitely doesn’t smell like the product it was fermented with. Frothy, foamy, calcium carbonate strong - at least I won’t get heart burn. Nothing in between. Distant malt. Distant grassy hops. Distant hipster that digs a beer like this! Look; nothing offensive as I can see this appealing to the masses, but meh!!! (35cL, can, BBE 06/16, Puro [?], Hai’an road, Tainan, Taiwan)"
Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Vile concoction, weak and ugly. That is, except for the smell and taste, quite full and ugly. Puke aroma, rotten cabbage taste. Avoid.
Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Can in Macau. 5.5%. The beer starts slightly sweetish. Like all Orion beers, this has nearly the same taste: none. Watery grainy aftertaste. Very watery with hints of sweetish grain.
Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Even for a Haposhu it is bad. Tastes like soda water with some hops thrown in at the end. It is almost like some guy drank beer once and tried to recreate the taste from his memory.
Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);35 cl can from Wellcome in Hong Kong, i think 4.5% to 5.5% ABV, can’t understand exacly what it says. Clear light yellow color, big bubbly white head. Aroma is uncertain, with some sugary grains, apple, alcohol and cardboard, metallic bitterness. Light body, dusty finish.
Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Floral toilet paper. Cardboard, dry popcorn, wash-up liquid, watery finish. Pretty naughty, probably wouldn’t finish it without a pack of peanuts...

Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);"coffee, cereal, orange, clear, white foam, light sweetness, light body, thin feel, sticky, light body, flat. Watered down, flat and has virtually nothing in common with actual ~beer~. Very difficult to ascertain that this is actually an alcoholic beverage; the taste is reminiscent of apple juice left sitting overnight. Almost offensive aftertastes, as it seems to leave a sticky film coating your mouth and teeth. As a fairly regular happoshu drinker, this is bottom-of-barrel stuff."
Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Can from a souvenir store in central Naha, Okinawa. Clear yellow colour. Small white head. Mild mineral grainy aroma. Thin mouthfeel. Flavour is mild with mineral, grains, bit sweet. Mild short bitterness.
Orion Southern Star;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);"330 ml can bought at Sogo Freshmart in Tsim Sha Tsui. Clear golden yellow colour; Thin head and white foam which last for about 1 minute; Minimal lacing and active carbonation; Aroma of malt, corn syrup, light rice, light bread and faint grass; Minimal light sweet taste of malt, with corn, rice, light rubber, light wet cardboard, and hint of citrus / bitterness; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is highly carbo beer-water with notable paint stripper / solvent, pretty uncomfortable, coupled with wet cardboard, this is bad; Hoppiness is faint grassy nose, trace of citrus in taste, and close to zero bitterness. Only fusel finish. Yuck! Slightly Dry after taste, very easy to mouth if you ignore the fusel. Comments: As a happoshu, this one comes at an hefty import price tag but it’s faulted as hell - a fusel-driven beer-water with wet cardboard - makes me wonder why Japanese macros can hit so low and put fabulously-marketed crap such as this. Drain pour, of course."
Sapporo W-Dry;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Pours very crappy and dissapointingly. Pale yellow with a fizzy worthless head that dissapears quickly. Not much aroma here and what little I did get was skunky and boozy. Taste is pretty hoppy and bitter. In fact much more so than I expected, all malts and sweetness are masked by the hops. The hop profile sucks though all bittering hops and nothing for the aroma. This stuff isn’t that great.
Sapporo W-Dry;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Can: Pours a clear gold, no head or lacing, very fizzy and dissapointing appearance like the other japanese beers I’ve had so far. The nose is thin and dry, some light malts and a pleasant lightly hopped tail. The flavor is thin, dry, a hint of malts. Relatively unappetizing and nearly devoid of flavor. Bravo.
Sapporo W-Dry;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;"i did note dry--overall, a bit buttery in the palate with plain popcorn taste; yeaup...actually, inoffensive and if i had to choose a few among many japanese macros to drink, this would be one of them; clean without a prick; interestingly, the head becomes rocky and leaves some chaotic lacing..."
Wädi-Brau-Huus Wädenswiler Blond Premium;Wädenswil, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wädi-Brau-Huus;Mich hat es positiv überrascht. Ein feines Bier für den Genuss und für den gesellschaftlichen Abend! 4.75 ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wädi-Brau-Huus Wädenswiler Blond Premium;Wädenswil, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wädi-Brau-Huus;I bought this bottle in the coop city, bahnhof or bling-blingstrasse in Zürich. I drank it the last Sunday at home with my wife at Lausanne. In my point of view, it is a regular lager, fully drinkable. The taste is malty, bready, a bit fruity, hop, decently bitter for the style, a bit watery. The color is yellow/clear and troubled, white foam, regular carbonation. It is a normal lager, better than one cardinal from this beautiful spot of the Zürichsee.
Wädi-Brau-Huus Wädenswiler Blond Premium;Wädenswil, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wädi-Brau-Huus;Clear golden color with white head. Aroma is corn grains, slightly sweet aroma. Taste is very sweet, corn. A standard boring Lager. Mouthfeel is smoother than expected.
Wädi-Brau-Huus Wädenswiler Blond Premium;Wädenswil, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wädi-Brau-Huus;Sour grass aroma with some yeast Pours golden with thin white head. Tastes bready and mild. Pretty well balanced. Oily mouthfeel and tight carbonation

Capitol City Belgian Chocolate;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Capitol City Brewing Company;Draught at the Downtown location. Dark brown with light lacing. Roasted malt and cocoa powder aroma. French roast coffee, dark chocolate, and light fruity flavors. Finishes dry with a roasted, but not astringent bitter chocolate. Medium-light bodied. Big props for not being sticky and sweet like I figured it might be after having their triple. A pretty nice, dry, dark chocolate ale with great drinkability. Belgian porter?
Capitol City Belgian Chocolate;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Capitol City Brewing Company;Am I supposed to know that style this is? The color is a muddy brown that I imagine I would get if I mashed some wheat bread into a glass of water. The nose is faint cocoa butter and a composition of spices that are pretty indistinguishable... tastes of light bakers chocolate up front then more of a cocoa butter over the middle. Mildly prickling the tongue, finishing empty and almost flavorless. Weird beer, I don’t know if they used chocolate malts in this or some form of actual chocolate.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis 10 Barrel Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Well, I’m not a fan of pale ales, and this one didn’t win me over. The flavor is mostly grassy hops backstopped by citrus and wheat. It’s not bad...just not my thing.

Rock Bottom Minneapolis 10 Barrel Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Question: why does the abbreviation for a word with one ’b’ in it, have two ’b’s in it? Just one of those things, and something that has nothing to do with this beer... Very clear, very light, a whispery pear-ish coloration, under a solid lovely white head. Big fruit in the nose...pears, again, some citrus, apple, melon, ...but no, why not stop with pear, ...weird, but that’s it...nice, though... Taste: lightness and bareness reign high ...minimal finish, as well, and small texture, too...not enough smack on the lips, here....and hardly enough body. pity, I’m not happy being unhappy with beers from here...gets dry a bit at the end. But the body is so slim, and the flavor so scant, it’s very dsiappointing. Needs more MORE, dammit! Feels rushed, like a fill-in, ...ah, well...
Rock Bottom Minneapolis 10 Barrel Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;"On tap (sampler) at the Minneapolis location, June 2007. Pale gold colour. Modicum of spicy, flowery hop in the aroma. The hop character is more herbaceous and ""green"" in the flavour profile, with a subtle bitterness. The mouthfeel, however, was softer and flatter than the Itasca sampled just before. Not bad, but I much preferred the Itasca, which was considerably more assertive and tasty."

Ise Kadoya Genmai (brown rice) Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Ise Kadoya;This is a backlog rating from 2012 from a bottle picked up at Party Source, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are grainy, sweet, rice is prominent, some fruit, soft finish.
Ise Kadoya Genmai (brown rice) Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Ise Kadoya;Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting. Body is hazy light to medium amber. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain/cereal), lightly to moderately yeasty (horseblanket, barnyard), with notes of unripe peach, kumquat, gum, band-aid. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Have had this many times both at bars and at home, just getting around to rating it finally. Fun and wild beer with some Orval-ish notes and neat fruit character. The toasty rice aroma is distinct but blends well with the other components.

Little savory, not as interesting as the nose. Interesting, though just decent-tasting ale, in the end. After the initial surprise from the unique flavor, I quickly lost interest. No staying power.

Colour is a really nice reddish brown with a decent white foam head. Nose has some citrous hop notes but also bit of toastey roasted grain. Taste is very toasty rice and grain.

The rye is very pronounced, which is welcome. Citrusy hops give it a little kick. The flavor is on the metallic side.

Unser Bier Sommerbier;Basel, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;Unser Bier;33cl bb11/2016, merci Jan. - Bref: easily sessionable Helles goes the oragnic/natural way towards Holundersirup. Light, moderately carbonated yellow pour. Malt-sweetness matches the added elderflower to create on-point Holundersirup Radler lemonade in aroma - more enticing than many a coriander broth Wit. - Slightly slick mouthfeel hightens the impression of an elderflower-spiked secco. Taste is mainly pale/pilsner malt natural sweetness again matched with class by the organic sweet and flowery additions. Interesting how this contrasts with e.g. a more complex elderflower-dryherbed saison, - Remains well drinkable and indeed summery, going easier on the added natural aromas in taste than in bouquet.

Archipelago Travellers Wheat;Singapore, Singapore;Wheat Ale;Archipelago Brewery;On tap at brewpub. My least favourite of their lineup. Very fruity gingery nose, with more of the same in the taste. Finish is a too spicey for my liking.
Archipelago Travellers Wheat;Singapore, Singapore;Wheat Ale;Archipelago Brewery;"It’s rather spicy and too variant in taste. The aroma is reminiscent of a herb and spice shop with a couple of fruits thrown in; not that of a usual wheat malt beverage This requires a real effort to try acquiring any liking. If you want a very exotic departure from the usual spectrum of wheat beers/ales, this is your ticket. I suspect if a non-professional taster is not informed, he might not realise it’s a wheat ale unless he is aware that wheat tends to be paired with lots of stuff (but not to this extent..). Good for experimentation in my view. But, not as a regular."

Archipelago Travellers Wheat;Singapore, Singapore;Wheat Ale;Archipelago Brewery;This one is a bit flat and by the numbers. Aroma is lacking any direction, slight cloves coming though. Murky orange with a thin white head. Flavour is a bit wierd, there is a slight spike of lime sourness that moves in to a more orange citrus. There is some bitterness that leaves a strange finish.

Archipelago Traders Brown Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Ale - American / APA;Archipelago Brewery;On tap at brewpub. My favourite of their lineup. Pours deep red with minimal head. Sweet malts, big ginger spicyness, some nuts. Good, but not something I would want to drink much of.
Archipelago Traders Brown Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Ale - American / APA;Archipelago Brewery;On tap. Rich lathery head. Deep brown+red colour. A beautiful beer. There is a strong note of hops in the aroma. Ginger - yup. Gula melaka (palm sugar) - better believe it! This beer works really really well. In my opinion, this is because the underlying beer would stand on its own, with the spices added in, it really flies! The solid hop/malt foundation is quite solid and the spices augment, rather than overwhelm the beer itself. Top knotch!
Archipelago Traders Brown Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Ale - American / APA;Archipelago Brewery;A confusing ale. Beerwise, the yin and yang are all out of balance. The various components do not seem to communicate with each other productively. Uphill task for a palate - like some kind of cultural revolution in your mouth. Queer aroma. Does this brew complement Asian cooking or, is it an Asian dish? If you take out the alcohol and throw in some crushed ice, it can pass off as a street desert in Southeast Asia.
Archipelago Traders Brown Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Ale - American / APA;Archipelago Brewery;Bottled. A hazy deep red beer with an orangey head.

Archipelago Traders Brown Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Ale - American / APA;Archipelago Brewery;Definitely a mislabeled style. Bottle shared by Mark at a recent tasting. Thanks! Pours a dark clear brown color with no head. Smell is warm, toasty cinnamon and ginger along with a chocolatey flavor from the malt. Slightly hoppy, and clean with the toasty brown ale flavors mingling with the light ginger-y spiciness
Archipelago Traders Brown Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Ale - American / APA;Archipelago Brewery;dark brown pour with no real head at all. nothing but molasses and syrup on the nose. nothing but molasses and syrup on the palate besides the ridiculous amount of ginger in this thing.

Old Capitol Qunintons Raspberry Wheat;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;On tap @ Quentin’s 7/19/07. Cloudy pink (think pink grapefruit flesh) with a one finger pinkish white head that fades quickly to a thick film--bah, they served it with a lemon, so that could have something to do with the head. Oh well. Aroma was simply of lemon and tart raspberry. Flavor was lots of tart raspberry and some bitter hairspray, some earthy bitterness as well (peaked at a 3 1/2). There was also some sweat. Moderate carbonation with a light to medium body. Did not care for this one.
Old Capitol Qunintons Raspberry Wheat;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;On tap at the brewpub. This poured a cloudy dark red with a white head. The aroma was raspberries with some hints of peahes. There was also a little bit of black pepper spice. The taste was nasty fake raspberry. Yes, I understand they used real raspberries, but it didn’t work. There was also some plastic and grass.
Old Capitol Qunintons Raspberry Wheat;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draft at Quinton’s in Iowa City. Poured a cloudy, opaque purple-red color. Head was bubbly and white with a pinkish tint. Aroma was of corn bread, citrus, and a touch of raspberry. Slightly sweet on the tongue. Tasted of buttered pancakes and freezer burned berries with citrus tang at the end. So so.
Oakshire The Perfect Storm Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Oakshire Brewing;Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, wort), lightly to moderately hoppy (apricot), with light notes of plastic, onions. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, slightly unclean/vegetal. Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Meh, pretty clunky all around...simple hops paired with off notes makes for a non-enticing aroma. Syrupy/flabby mouthfeel and a dirty, vegetal aftertaste makes it a bit unpleasant to drink too. Drain pour for me.
Oakshire The Perfect Storm Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Oakshire Brewing;It pours clear golden with a white head. It has a rich body with soft carbonation. The taste has tropical fruit, rich malt and mild citrus on finish. Really nice.

Oakshire The Perfect Storm Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Oakshire Brewing;Draft. Light copper. Nose is orange citrus and piney hops, toffee malts. Big malt body but balanced hop bitterness. Solid west coast impy IPA.
Oakshire The Perfect Storm Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Oakshire Brewing;"Bottle from The Beer Junction, Seattle; 9% ABV Clean golden color with medium head. The aroma provides a blend af resiny, fruity, dunk hops, and toffee (8.5). Lean body, can’t believe this is 9% beer, with strong toffee malt flavor, light residual sweetness, followed by a strong presence of piney hops and some citrus fruits. Well balanced.. Surgically clean IIPA with excellent malt and hops."

Flavor is sweet pale malt, citric fruit and good bitterness. Well balanced pleasant body and long lasting aftertaste with smooth malt and pleasant bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden, just as a warming feeling in the aftertaste. Not really complex, pretty straight forward, but very smooth and well made. Nice one.

The Brewhouse Donovan Oat Meal Stout;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Stout;The Brewhouse (California);(growler thanks to jjfoodie) clear gold, wispy white bubbles. Nose and taste is dank, lavender, wit beer like, agave, herbal, liked it when it was colder.
The Brewhouse Donovan Oat Meal Stout;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Stout;The Brewhouse (California);On tap at the brewpub. Pitch black with dark tan creamy head. 1/2 finger head lingers forever. Nice. Roasty aroma, with underlying maltiness. No off aromas. The roastiness is less present in the taste. A bit mild, to be expected at 5.3%. Wonderful. Not my favorite style, but done as well as can be.
The Brewhouse Donovan Oat Meal Stout;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Stout;The Brewhouse (California);This had a lasting tight head.Color a nice black.Aroma was of roasted coffee.Palate was a nice sticky one.Perfect palate.The flavor was of roasted coffee and not much else.I was hoping for that elusive chocolate flavor.Creamy taste due to the head which also complements the oatmeal ,Had an underlying sourness to the taste..Creamy like oatmeal.Finished bitter and sour.Decent stout,but needs that chocolate to be one of the best.Will buy again.Had on tap at brewer.
The Brewhouse Saint Barb IPA;Santa Barbara, California, United States;IPA;The Brewhouse (California);Draft at The Brewhouse. Fairly nice hoppy aroma. Hint of citrus fruits in the aroma. The taste quite mild for a IPA but nice flavor of the citrus fruits and hops. Ovrerall an Ok IPA. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
The Brewhouse Saint Barb IPA;Santa Barbara, California, United States;IPA;The Brewhouse (California);Tap at the brewpub. Maybe just hard to screw up a good hoppy west-coast IPA, but this was better than average for the style and by a long mark the best beer of the night. Pours surprisingly light yellow with a very piney aroma. The flavor is a nice dry bitterness, herbial and medicinal without the caramel and candied grapefruit often found in the style. This one is in the Diamond Knot IPA vein, and quite reasonable though not quite in the league of the Diamon Knot. Still, a nice drink.
The Brewhouse Saint Barb IPA;Santa Barbara, California, United States;IPA;The Brewhouse (California);This had an average head.Color a medium dark amber.Had a nice aroma of floral and citrus.The palate was sticky.The taste was of oranges and bitter hops.I wanted to taste more subtlties,but none detected.I liked this IPA,but not one of the best.It is a very good one.Much better than average.
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I live in central Texas so we were one of the first markets to get this beer. This is my go to morning drink and hot afternoon refresher. Being that I like bloody mary's, this beer is a natural substitute in a pinch and without all the work. While it does have clamato, the taste is very subtle. It helps mellow out the bland taste of budweiser which i don't really drink by itself anymore. it's pretty much a love it or hate it type beer.
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"25 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 2/24/2018. Pours moderately murky/cloudy reddish orange/amber color with a minimal foamy off white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing pretty quickly. No lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass. Okay appearance. Aromas of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of clams, vinegar, and herbal/spice earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt notes; with solid strrength. Taste of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of clams, vinegar, and herbal/spice earthiness. Mild herbal bitterness and peppery spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt flavors; great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky/creamy tomato mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Lightly increasing pleasant lingering pepper heat through the glass. Overall this is a delicious fruit/spice/vegetable beer. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/spicy finish. This is the best one in this style I have had. Was even better than the bud light version, very similar but with more clean malt presence. Most other cheladas I've had were too heavy on tomato juice/body. This is perfect balance of Budweiser and Clamato flavors; with plenty of malt presence for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example."
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"I like to drink this in lieu of a bloody Mary. It's a nice Latino inspired substitute for the vodka, horseradish, tomato concoction. Easy to grab at most any decent sized liquor store or convenience store, Only about $3.50 a tallboy. Get over the whole ""clam"" flavor fears. There is barely a hint of it here. Avoid the Modelo version, it's absolutely horrendous."
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);The appearance was a rough looking burnt orange tomato color with no head or lace. The aroma was toast, burnt tomatoes, salt, cooked lime, burnt hay and skunk. The flavor was salty burnt tomatoes and skunk with some metallic sliding in. Aftertaste was beyond repulsive. The palate was somewhat light bodied with no sessionability about it. Exceptionally distracting all around from off flavors all up in there. Carbonation seemed a bit prickly. ABV did feel fine. Overall, how is this an enjoyable drink, even if I’m supposed to water it down even further with excessive ice?
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Aroma is tomatoes, salt and mild malts/grains. The flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma. Could only stand a sip, knew it was going to be a mistake.
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Haha I love reading reviews in this one. It is a beer that does crazy well in my hometown because of the Hispanic clientele. Although, that really has nothing to do with my interpretation of it, I enjoy every incantation of it. On this scale where rating should be taken seriously does it score well, but in its own right this tomato, pepper, clam juice brew is a Central Valley staple.
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);A big dirty 24fl oz can from a random liquor store in Houston. It pours bright pink - read with minimal head. The aroma is very savoury, loads of tomato, salty, dull spice and green veg. The taste is sweet - spicy, wishy washy tomato juice, something meaty, salt water, some spice and savoury vibe with a sweet, tangy tomato finish. Light - medium body and fine, prickly. I wanted to like this infamous beer, but it engaged my gag reflex. Pretty rotten stuff.
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Pours a golden reddish yellow. Aromas of grass, malts, and a touch of briney tomato. Flavor is briney, tomato, cheap lager...but I love me some red beer.
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Mega-can, part of the Chelada taste-off. Pinkish-red, opaque, short-lived link head, more vibrant than the Modelo, less sero-sanguinous in appearance. Similar briny, spicy, aroma and flavour, but sweeter and less watery (am I seriously saying that about a Budweiser product?). Could be a touch spicier, but I guess that’s why there is a Picante version (which happens to be next on the docket...)
Budweiser Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Backlog from Brony Bottle Share at Travlr’s. Terrible, awful, no good garbage juice.

Bier Factory Rapperswil Linth Maisbier;Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland;Specialty Grain - Other;Bier Factory Rapperswil;It is kind of a summery ale and has a nice foamy head, but the color is a dirty hazy amber. Very little aroma. Flavor is a bit tangy. Not a fan of the corn.
Bier Factory Rapperswil Linth Maisbier;Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland;Specialty Grain - Other;Bier Factory Rapperswil;Bottle 49 cl from Bier-Bienne (CH). Pale and haty blonde with short fleeting foam. Grassy aromas, malted sweetness, lemon. The taste is grassy and lemony, smell of corn and its sweetness, present acidity and sourness. A bit disgusting. Herbaceouis bitter, lemon and citrus. Interesting work on a style which is not it.
Bier Factory Rapperswil Linth Maisbier;Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland;Specialty Grain - Other;Bier Factory Rapperswil;Hopfiger, schnell abflachender Antrunk. Der Mittelteil ist so etwas schwach, dann kommen aber geringe Fruchtnoten auf, die das Bier zwar nicht sonderlich intensiver, dafür aber deutlich interessanter machen.

Müller Bräu Non Alcoholic;Baden, Switzerland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Müller Bräu;Wenig herber, platt getreidiger Antrunk mit dem typisch alkoholfreien bitteren Aroma, das zu Anfang noch angenehm mild ausfällt. Dan wird das Bier etwas penetranter, nach ein paar Schlücken reguliert sich das Ganze bzw. man gewöhnt sich weitestgehend an die Intensität. Erfrischend, trinkbar, nur im Abgang etwas zu pappig. OK. 7/6/5/6/7/5
Müller Bräu Non Alcoholic;Baden, Switzerland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Müller Bräu;Bottled 33cl. It pours a golden beer with a bubbly white head. The nose is decent, malty with notes of chestnuts. Apart from that a typical non alcoholic lager. Very sweet.
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;Bottled. A very light yelloe cider with no head. The aroma is sweet with ntoes of alcohol and apples. The flavor is sweet with notes of apples as well as a light acidity, the flavor is a bit artificial. The body is a bit tart. Thanks Papsoe for sharing.
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;(Bottle 27,5 cl) Courtesy of yngwie. Pours almost crystal clear with a small white head. Tart apple aroma. Light in body with a heavy carbonation and distinct tart apple notes. Rather authentic and by no means commercial and stickingly sweet. 030608
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;27.5 cL clear bottle. Pours clear and pale yellow to white with no head. Artificial sweet apple aroma. Flavour on the contrary is not as sweet but still artifical. Goes into a rather dry and acidic to citric flavour and finish. Somewhat bland and quite artificial.
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;"Very pale golden body with a green shine, white head; Not a lot of aroma, what there is is very fresh and flowery; Super fresh body ,great carbonation, sweet and slightly acidy; Long fresh apple flowery finish. Very, very drinkable. Thanks Yngwie."
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;Medium coarse white head disappears immediately. Nearly colourless body with just a hint of something that might be yellow. Sweet mealy artifical apple aroma with toffeeish notes. Sweetish earthy apple taste with notes of toffee. Quite watery, but clean and smooth mouthfeel. A touch of pear as well. Sharpish on the tongue from the carbonation. No aftertaste. Easy to drink, but too watery, and doesn’t really have much to recommend it. Can imagine teenagers find this easy to get drunk on, though. (0.275l bottle from Ica Gourmet, Aker Brygge, Oslo.)
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;Bottle. Yellow colour . Aroma is ripe apple. flavour is also ripe apple, yeast. OK cider.
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;Bottle. Brilliant pale straw yellow. Noisy carbonatian. Medium white coarse head , quickly diminishing. Aroma is part dry apples, part a regular white wine. Scents of yeast. Taste is more like a dry wine-cooler than a cider. Body is light and the palate is not very filling, but still beyond the usual Norwegian alcopops labelled as ’Cider’.
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;275 ml clear slimline bottle with twist-off cap. Extremely pale straw coloured, fizzy. Moderate apple aroma and flavour (of eating apples, not cider apples), not very exciting but not offensive either. Fizzy and watery mouthfeel. An okay refreshment, no more than that.
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;Bottle. It pours very pale, just a yellow touch to it, with a nice carbonation. There’s a yeasty sensation to the aroma, which consist mostly of apples, but there’s a pear note as well, even though there’s no pear used in the process. The flavor has apples and yeast, and there’s a note of alcohol as well. Medium to thin mouthfeel. Quite fizzy in the mouth, but not in an unpleasant way. The finish has the same apples and yeast as in the initial flavor, and some alcohol notes. Not a complex cider, but far much better than the other horrible, artificial-tasting, sweet ciders we get in the Norwegian super-markets. Quite easy to down as well. (070713)
Seljord Eplecider;Seljord, Norway;Apple Cider;Seljord Vin;250ml bottle. Pale body, close to water in color. Flavor is ripe apple, almost a bit sherry-like, yeast, a hint of alcohol and rather sweet with some sourness. The sweetness feels more natural and balanced than some terrible Norwegian alcopop versions of cider. I’m not to keen on ciders, and believe a cider should be a bit rougher in style, but this is anyway a quite refreshing drink and deserves more success than it probably would get. This is more like a commercial version of a farmer cider.
Bowland Great Jemima;Clitheroe, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bowland Brewery;Cask (handpump) at Peter Kavanaghs, Liverpool, April 2008. Nice bright amber colour. Unfortunately, that’s where the good bits end. The aroma majors on diacetyl and this carries through into a buttery character on the palate, although its not quite as prominent there. Couldn’t really delve below the diacetyl to explore the underlying beer. Drinkable (just) but not a very enjoyable experience. Mark down for a re-rate.
Bowland Great Jemima;Clitheroe, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bowland Brewery;[Cask from The Three Judges] Deep amber colour with a light foamy head. Floral with buttery toffee notes and some ripe berry fruit. Light on the palate, fruity and dry.
Flossmoor Station Black Moon Rye-Sin;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Rated from notes on a Flossmoor Station coaster found while cleaning out my beer glass collection. Sampled on tap at the brewpub while out to lunch for work. The day is coming back to me. Poured an impressive blackish hue, almost opaque, with a small but sufficient brownish head. Aromas are largely roasted malts, with coffee and chocolate, mixed with a nice hoppiness. Taste mirrors this: Chocolate and coffee dominant, mixed with some nice roasted malts and rye. Hoppy bite gives it a nice different approach. Hops in these porters and stouts are definitely great. Tad thin in the body. Glad I found this rating. Cheers!

Flossmoor Station Black Moon Rye-Sin;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap, with espresso beans. Pours almost black with a smallish beige colored head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, roast, floral hops. Flavor is huge blast of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, a hint of citrus hops. Palate is medium bodied, medium carbonation, finished bitter. This was decent but the coffee overwhelmed and the body was a bit thin for my liking. Decent but not great.
Flossmoor Station Black Moon Rye-Sin;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the Station for Andrew’s bachelor party.

Flossmoor Station Black Moon Rye-Sin;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Flossmoor, 9/22/07. Very deep black color, hints of red around the corners, tan foam with great lacing and retention. Aroma is huge on the dark malts, maybe some tiny bit of hops in there somewhere. Flavor again very big on the malts, the rye comes through very nicely right before the hops hit. Silky smooth texture, only 5.5%? Give me more!

Flossmoor Station Black Moon Rye-Sin;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"I split a growler with SurlySober, who picked this up over his weekend travels. SurlySober thought this beer was similar to Founder’s Black Rye, and I respectfully disagree. While I really liked both beers, I thought Black Rye had more of the ""burned pizza crust"" character I prize in roasty stouts although Black Moon Rye-Sin certainly had plenty. Black Moon Rye-Sin had a lot more hoppiness than Black Rye, and in fact considerably more hop character than any stout I’ve had in recent memory (maybe ever). The end result is a beer that’s extremely malty, with a ton of dry roastiness, but is also fairly heavily hopped. It is really quite good and highly recommended. This beer is an opaque black with plentiful tan head. Aroma is very roasty, a bit sour, and surprisingly hoppy. Flavor is as is I’ve described. Mouthfeel is exceedingly dry, so much so that it hurts drinkability a bit but this is still a very good beer."

Flossmoor Station Black Moon Rye-Sin;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at the Pub 6/26/07. I came in for dinner, and upon hearing I’d have to wait until eight I stuck around to get one of the first of these served. It was worth the wait. An opaque dark brown with a healthy light brown head. Laced the glass considerably. Roast aroma with obvious rye character. Very tasty. Flavor was potently roast malt, rye was very forward and pleasantly dry.

Aroma is acidic wooden and fruity notes along with some slight sourness and raspberries. Flavour is acidic berries, some mild tart and sourness as well as mild wooden notes. A bit too acidic for my taste, but that’s always a risk when buying oldies...

Vanderlinden Framboise;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Vanderlinden;In short: A boring semi-lambic with a red fruit hard candy flavor How: Bottle, 1993 vintage, at Bier Circus, Brussels The look: Almost clear golden red body topped by a medium beige head In long: The nose is musty, a little dusty and with a sweet red fruit aroma that I would describe as cherry flavored hard-candy. The bottle seemed to be in good shape with adequate carbonation, although it had an ugly layer of yeast glued at the bottom of the bottle. The taste is pretty much what the nose hinted on. A strong red fruit flavored hard-candy flavor, a bit sweet, light funk. Kind of boring really. This is the type of taste I expect from sweetened commercial fruit lambic like a Mort Subite Framboise or a Boon Framboise. I had never had a beer from Vanderlinden, this old out of business lambic brewery. I saw it (overpriced) at Bier Circus and it was one of those “now or never” moment. I jumped on the occasion but it was not the right move. I got tangled in the screen door of my window of opportunity.

Mouthfeel is light, moderate to high carbonation. Finishes a little sweet, mild bitter hops in the finish. Would make an ok patio or beach beer in a pinch.

Fernie Rocky Mountain Genuine Lager;Fernie, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Fernie Brewing Company;Nose is rich with buttered corn on the cob, sea salt and dandelion. Big corn trend with these Fernie beers! Colour is an interesting Sauvignon Blanc hue. Things fade drastically in the mouth. Not much to report other than a tug of war in all directions. Not really bitter, not really rich, not fruity or flowery. One thing it is however is slightly watery. Often these multi-facet profiles can work in sync but not here. Saving grace: nice butter cream finish.
Fernie Rocky Mountain Genuine Lager;Fernie, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Fernie Brewing Company;Sample at Canadian Brewing Awards 2008. Light, clear golden with a small head.

Poorly balanced, and just not very good.
Fernie Rocky Mountain Genuine Lager;Fernie, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Fernie Brewing Company;A great canned brew to throw into the golf bag. For a canned lager, this is unsurprisingly straightforward with sweet grainy pale malt as it’s sole feature, however it is above macro standards in that it finishes clean and doesn’t become harsh or cloying as it warms above 3 degrees Celsius.

Opat Svetlý Medový Ležák 12°;Broumov, Czech Republic;Flavored - Other;Pivovar Broumov (Olivìtínský Opat);Bottle from Tesco. Heavily lightstruck aroma, which should be hard to do in brown bottles, or so I guessed. Apparently these guys are trying hard. Taste is not so tragic, though it is far from perfect. Light metallic and lightstruck, fizzy, with the blunt bitterness characteristic of extracts. What am I even drinking? And Why?

Gale's Summer Breeze;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);This beer was brewed again for the 2011 Sainsbury’s beer comp (it didn’t win): brown 500ml bottle, best before 30 Dec 2011, drank Oct 2011. Poured into a UK pint sleeve. Lager looking golden body with very little head. The bottle label asked for the beer to be served chilled, unusual for a British ale, I chilled it as requested. Saaz hops dominated the smell, some cereal odours too (barley and wheat used in the brew). The taste had a sharp hop bitterness with no malt content showing throughout the pint in smell or flavour. A true summery beer, not really my sort, but OK if you like light bodied ales that lean more towards hops than malts.
Gale's Summer Breeze;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Pale gold, cold and fizzy with hints of diacetyl. Having said that, it was very drinkable and I quite liked it.

Light bodied, slick mouthfeel and a light, sweet, bitter finish. Some unpleasant cardboard notes in the finish too. Rather boring for a Golden Ale. This is more of a pils.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Nit Wit;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Draft on tap at the brewpub (Lombard, IL). Pours a nice golden yellow hue, decent murky haze but bright, a frothy white head that dies to a thicker film, laces lightly. Aromas are a light cereal wheat, touch of pear and banana, coriander, faint spicing, mellow cereal wheat, flaked white wheat. Initial is light wheaty cereal grains, a touch of orange and banana, bready, touch of sweetness, mellow flaked white wheat, light coriander mellows it out. A fairly light wit that has lost it’s identity. It’s mellow, and it’s fruit base is a bit questionable. Not bad, a bit lost on me though.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Nit Wit;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Sampler glass at Yorktown. The color was a hazy straw tone with a foamy, white head and good, sticky lacing. The aroma was light notes of malt, grain, ripe apple, spice, and slight hints of lemon zest and caramel. The flavor mimicked the nose resulting in an altogether very light and sessionable brew.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Nit Wit;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Draft at RBY. Pours cloudy yellow with a fizzy head. Nose is phenolic, bananas and cloves. A touch spicy, but it’s really missing out with the citric qualities that are usually in these beers. Too fizzy as well, which makes the body seem thin. I guess I was expecting more coriander (which does finally come out near the end) and a creamier body. Not one of my favorite wits...

The flavor had tangy wheat with grainy bananas and lighter fruity sweetness.. pepper and clovey spices at the back.. OK components, but very drinkable. Lighter-bodied with creamy, thick carbonation on the palate.. a bit too effervescent for my liking.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Nit Wit;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Even served in an unfrosted mug, this beer was way too cold to begin with. It’s body is a cloudy yellow/gold and it’s topped by a modest, fizzy white head. The aroma (once it warmed) was wheaty with soft malt and a citric twist. Even warmer, a touch of bubblegum joins the fray. The mouthfeel is a touch more harsh than is usual with this style. It tastes of wheat flakes, bubblegum, lemongrass, and a soapy spiciness. Refreshing. An interesting interpretation of the style. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL

Aroma was of floral hops with some grainy malt. Flavour started with biscuity malt before a hoppy finish kicked in. Good.
Tröegs Scratch 2;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours amber brown with an off white head. Sweet toffee malts, moderate oxidation, some earthy notes, and a sweet toffee finish. Not horrible for how old it is.
Tröegs Scratch 2;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Tröegs Brewing Company;Pours a solid brown with beautiful ruby highlights when held to the light. Large creamy/bubbly off-white head made this difficult to pour. This beer is over carbonated. Smells of citrus hops, some chocolate and some roast. Taste follows the smell. Nice subtle malty roasty taste with some hops mixed in and a lingering chocolate in the aftertaste. Medium body, thin mouthfeel. This isn’t a bad brew, and were it not over carbonated it would have been a tasty almost sessionable brew. I suppose I should have tried this one fresher too.
Tröegs Scratch 2;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Tröegs Brewing Company;A: The pour is incredibly light for a porter. Seems like a dark amber color with a big khaki head and a lot of carbonation. S: Very fruity, almost like cherries. I get a strange woody note out of the nose. Still some roasted malt there, which is one of the few indications of this being a porter. Also seems to be a bit of cough syrup. T: The cherries and cough syrup are picked up right away on the palate. That woodiness is there again, which I can’t quite figure out. Maybe some grapes, too, and a mild roasted malt character. M: Medium in body with a moderate to high level of carbonation. D: Eh, sort of what you would expect from a 3-4 year old porter. Hopefully not too many people are really holding on to these anymore.
Tröegs Scratch 2;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottled. A hazy deep red beer with a lazing tan head. The aroma has notes of malt and citrusy as well as dusty hops. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt and both citrusy and dusty hops, as well as light notes of prunes.
Tröegs Scratch 2;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Tröegs Brewing Company;Dark brown with a huge beige head. Herbal aroma with roasted malt and caramel notes. Flavour was sweet with roasted malt, caramel, chocolate and bourbon notes.
Tröegs Scratch 2;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Tröegs Brewing Company;"This is explosively carbonated; a reasonable pour yields me five-fingers of lightly browned, dark tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass. The beer is a dark brown / concentrated amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, deep red-plum color when held up to the light. The aroma smells a touch musty, with the beginnings of a phenolic, almost Brettanomyces like influence. Touches of acetone, and an light note of artificial fruitiness are also found here in the nose. A touch of fruity, vegetal roast grain notes as well as some nutty toasted malt aromas and a smooth browned malt character. The fruitiness also reminds me of tart berries and perhaps even some pomegranate like notes. Definitely an interesting nose on this beer, I am not quite sure what to think of it. Up front this beer is lightly sweet tasting with a touch of roastiness to balance things out. Browned bread crust flavors and a nice toasted grain character are also found before some fake fruitiness and acetone notes kick in. The finish has a bit of bitter, burnt vegetal notes as well as a hop bitterness. There is also a touch of lightly roasted coffee character in the finish. The “off” flavors are not nearly as noticeable in the flavor as they were in the nose, but still do influence the character of this brew. The body is light, though not quite watery, and has likely been reduced by the infection that has taken hold (the excess carbonation had to come from somewhere), but is still retains a nice quaffable quality. This has definitely turned south and clearly some low grade infection has taken hold here. The beer is not undrinkable yet, but I would definitely recommend drinking all you have on hand at this point. If this had not been infected it would have easily been able to stand up to the two years of bottle age. I am ranking this one at the average, as it is clearly past its best by date, but if rated as is I would put it at a 2.6 (4/3/5/3/11)"

Aiken Double Pale Ale;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Aiken Brewing Company;8.5% ABV. The aroma was caramel citrus and a strong presence of alcohol. The aroma was fruity and a bit phenolic. Caramel, biscuit and toast were present along with a very strong presence of acetaldehyde (fresh cut green apple). The beer arrived lightly hazy deep golden amber with a tall beige long lasting head which laced the glass. The flavor was fruity with a strong citrusy presence and an extra strong acetaldehyde character. The finish was dry with lasting strong green apple far too long and awfully into the aftertaste. The body was medium-full with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy texture on the palate. The alcohol warming post consumption was substantial. A beer to surely be skipped! Pint at Aiken.
Aiken Double Pale Ale;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Aiken Brewing Company;"Draft. Dark brown-copper with a creamy and lasting head. Aroma is earthy fruit - cantaloupe maybe - and some caramel malt. Flavor is big malt with a great cantaloupe-fruity-earthy hop balance, and some alcohol. Medium bodied and alcohol tingly; would make a nice warmer. Unique and tasty."
Aiken Double Pale Ale;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Aiken Brewing Company;Draught. Pours stark red with a tan head. The aroma is quite tame for the style with minimal bitterness. Similar to their English IPA, I get mostly malts on this one. Strong hints of fruit and bread are there but also hints of grapefruit and pine. The mouthfeel is slick with heavy suggestions of sweet, dried fruits. It’s a very malty IIPA with hops as a backdrop, considering the style boundaries. However, the nuances in this are many: melons, grass, grapes, berries, rye. I’m glad to see something like this brewed in South Carolina finally. It’s a good start after raising the 6% cap.
Aiken Double Pale Ale;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Aiken Brewing Company;Tap. Strong caramel malt and citrus hops aroma. Dark amber color with small head. Sweet caramel malt masterfully blended with a strong sweet orange-pineapple hops flavor. Full bodied with alcohol level not apparent. Given it’s only been legal to brew a strong beer like this in SC for about 2 months, Aiken BC didn’t waste any time and did a great job to boot. A great beer.
Aiken Doppel Bock;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Aiken Brewing Company;Pours a deep reddish brown on tap with thin tan head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of dark fruits, sugar, and sweet malts, almost as if its with ale yeast and not lager. Taste follows, a little thin and sugary, but not bad for what it is. Definitely one of the better beers I had while there.

Hoppin' Frog Mean Manalishi;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hoppin' Frog Brewery;Aus der Flasche im 2018-10 getrunken. Oj ja das ist klar ein IPA wo leider über die Jahre der Flaschenlagerung nur ein Hauch von Citrusaromen übrig geblieben ist und nur die sehr domminierde Hopfenbitterkeit bestimmt mir dieses Ale zu sehr.

Hoppin' Frog Mean Manalishi;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hoppin' Frog Brewery;Really intense hoppy brew. But balanced nicely by the caramel malts. Pours an orange\brown.

Pours a deep Amber orange color topped by medium sized frothy beige cap with nice lacing. Caramel malt and pine needle hop nose. First sip follows the nose.

Pours a clear amber with a nice sticky head of mixed bubbles and cream. Plenty of lacing. Aroma is beautiful malt and sticky hops. Of course the alcohol is high and the hops are plentiful, but Hoppin Frog brings these components together seamlessly and with artistry. The malts are sweet, chewy, delicious, and clean. The hops are sticky and bitter. The alcohol is present but an after-thought that doesn’t impede the enjoyment in any way. Excellent.

Captain Lawrence Sun Block;Elmsford, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;DATE: June 19, 2016... At my second Father’s Day at the Draught House--forty beers on tap and a free dinner! Can’t beat that... drinking from a Miller Lite pint... starts with a frothy, crater-like off-white head that settles to a thin film... clear, golden body--but does NOT look filtered... faint pepper and banana, with some malty biscuit... strong rye suggestions, with aromatic flowery aromas providing some .. the flavor is pepper and biscuit, with lemony hops and Saaz-like pilsener, both of which are softened by the wheat... medium-bodied, with a refreshing, lighthearted passage to the throat, but no staying power here... pairing well with the bourbon pepper steak I ordered, though a bit light for the task... as a kickstarter for my Father’s Day, a winner... a beer that could be sessioned, but not as bright as promised...
Captain Lawrence Sun Block;Elmsford, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Bottled on 04212016. Clear golden with a medium white head. Aroma has hints of Sorachi Ace hops. Flavor has a fair amount of hop flavor left and ends bitter. Well balanced but lacks the fresh hop flavor.
Captain Lawrence Sun Block;Elmsford, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Draft at Bru Craft. Poured a very hazy bright yellow gold with just a touch of white foam that reduced to a tiny ring. No lace. The nondescript hops effortlessly dissappear into the full blonde pale malts. Gently sweet tropical fruit flavors. Pineapple. Papaya. Orange passionfruit. Clementine. Guava. Coconut milk. Plantain. Honeycomb. Stray hints of summer tomato vines and dill. Something nice to sip by the seaside.
Captain Lawrence Sun Block;Elmsford, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;The label says- IPA . And it feels more like an IPA than a wheat ale. Hazy , golden color. Medium-sized , white head. Hoppy , citrus notes dominate in aroma . Hops and some acidity in taste . Decent beer.
Captain Lawrence Sun Block;Elmsford, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;"Six pack from Julio’s. Bottle says ""Sun Block IPA"".

Aroma is of citrus, wheat bready, floral hops, some tropical fruits,and some faint coconut. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma. Has a medium body with a slightly watery mouthfeell and a semi bitter, medium finish. Overall, a decently tasty wheat ale that definitely has a summery vibe to it.

Triple 7 Dunkel Weizenbock;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Triple 7 Brewpub at Main Street Station;Bonus sample. Big head on a very dark brown beer. Strong banana aroma that always seems surprising from a beer this dark. Chocolate scents as well. Great body. Chocolate and banana with some rubbery notes or texture. Some coffee in the finish.
Triple 7 Dunkel Weizenbock;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Triple 7 Brewpub at Main Street Station;On tap at Triple 7, poured a brownish color with burgundy edges, off-colored tannish-light brown head. Lacing was excellent. Aroma was nice bananas and yeast, some clovey spices after some warming. The flavor was caramel, bananas, molasses, gentle roast (some ash aspects with higher temperatures), only light spicing (cloves faint even w/ higher temperature). Weak on phenolic / spice character, otherwise a very nice weizenbock, one that surely exceeded my expectations. Mouthfeel was a little sticky, full, appropriate for the style.

Pour is typical macro: wildly fizzy yellow to straw with a detergent, white head. Pretty good suddy lace. Aroma is air freshener, maize, detergent. Taste is less soapy than Pure Blonde with some attempt at malty fullness. Still a wildy suddy, watery, soapy palate that seems the norm with Australian macro lager. Nothing offensive here.

Fort Garry NuBru Blend;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;341ml bottle. Pours as pale as I’ve seen with a loud soda pop head thats gone in a blink. First beer I’ve had that has a sound to it in addition to everything else. It sounds the same as the sound you hear from inside your mouth after you’ve downed a hand full of pop-rocks. well anywho. Smells awful, tastes like water with puke in it. Stomach acids and everything. Horrible.
Fort Garry NuBru Blend;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Bottle shared with GregClow, Jerc, and Blankboy, Greg’s bottle. Harsh, harsh aroma. Harsh grainy taste. Lighter than piss yellow. Awful. Honestly the worst thing I have had in quite some time and my first 0.5 in a long time. I just couldn’t find one thing here worth a point. Fort Garry, you should be embarrassed.

Pours a clear incredibly light pale yellow with absolutely no head. Aroma’s sweet, grainy, vegetal and bready -- odd and stale smelling.

Finish is (thankfully) abrupt with no aftertaste. This is some nasty shit right here.
Fort Garry NuBru Blend;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Bottle. Pours a pale yellow body with a small and fast fading white head. Bizarre fruity and grainy aroma has unexpected notes of white grapes. Rough astringent grainy flavour, light wacky fruit notes. Average to thin palate. WTF? Did not finish. 2/3/2-3/2/2-3
Fort Garry NuBru Blend;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Bottle courtesy of Piscator34: Poured a super pale yellow color beer with a very small bubbly white head with no retention and lacing. Aroma of very weak malt with some lemony notes which are just plain weird. Taste is reminiscent of a wine spritzer more then a beer with almost no malt or hops distinguishable. Total drain pour and one of the worst beers I have had the chance of trying recently.
Fort Garry NuBru Blend;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;"Very pale yellow in colour with spritzy carbonation. Faint lemon aroma, with nuances of pilsner malt, cookie dough, and the slightest bit of spicy hops. Very watery body, with a dry citric finish. Not much to speak of in the way of flavor; it’s vaguely grainy, with a bit more of that lemon element showing up too. Verging into ""near-beer"" territory with this one. I am not impressed."
Appalachian Tripelocity;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft. Slightly hazy golden yellow. Aroma of lightly prppery straw. Taste us spiced sweet straw. Not bad.
Appalachian Tripelocity;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft notes from Collegeville. Hazy gold pour with off-white head. Notes of malt, yeasty funk, hopcitrus, and spices in the nose. Not terribly complex in the flavor, like a yeasty pale ale.

Full body and medium carbonation.
Appalachian Tripelocity;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draught at Harrisburg location. Hazy, rich gold with healthy white head. Smells of moderate banana and spiciness. Flavor is predominantly phenolic, with banana and slight lemon underneath. Bitterness blends with higher alcohols and phenolics to make one distinct flavor. Yummy, but I would agree with the assessment that it is on the harsh end. I’d like to see more fruitiness from the yeast in here and less of that phenolic flavor. It reminds me of modeling glue.
Appalachian Tripelocity;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draught at the Camp Hill location. Pours orange-gold with small tight white head. The aroma is yeasty with some lemon, pepper, banana, and cookie notes. The flavor is bready with some raw grain notes, a slightly harsh spiciness, plenty of yeast, and a very dry finish. Pretty good, but it lacks the subtlety of a truly well made tripel.
Appalachian Tripelocity;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a tiny white head. Again, very sweet aroma, yeasty, reminiscent of La Fin du Monde. Average tripel body (fyi not a fan of the style, give me a dubbel any day), a light Belgian with an alcoholic kick. Meh.
Appalachian Tripelocity;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);i thought this was really good. nice thick syrupy body. BIt of a sweet candi aroma, has kinda a honey sweet taste a little bit of candi and maybe an element of spice to it. Very nice brew.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;From a bomber, vintage 2007. Pours a cloudy apricot with scant off white head. Malty aroma. Flavors are oxidized hops with plenty of bitterness. Clearly this one has not aged well.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Bomber. Well I shouldn’t set my expectations too high for an 8 year old hoppy beer. Dark copper pour. The second half of the bottle was a brown sewer water. Lots of alcohol smell, thought that would go down. Some caramel. Reminded me of an old ale, but not really a good one. Dumped most of it. At least the bottle is bad ass.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Bootle split with Adnielsen. Pours murky orange with a thin white head. Aroma of citrus and booze with a bit of oxidization. Taste is citrus, big sweet malts, caramel. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Sticky sweet finish.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Bottle offered @ my parent’s basement thanks to RABinCO. Thanks ! Pours a murky orangish brown appearance with a light brown head. Quite a bit of caramel, toasted malts, and caramel with some dull herbal hops. Twangy fruity flavor with some spice, toffee, and cardboard. Surely past it’s prime but kind of fun to try.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;22oz. bottle pours a murky orange with golden hues rounding the edges. Surprisingly, there was a small off-white head that managed to settle as a nice cap. Aromas were quite pleasant with pineapple and mango leading the way into a noticeable grain bill. Very faint wafts of alcohol, but pretty aromatic for it’s age. Taste is similar to the nose. Hints of pineapple juice, guava, mango and a thick caramel molasses sweetness and texture. Carbonation was pretty moderate, but far from flat. Some nice cereal notes along with a slight spice/pine come through in the backend and only a slight hint of alcohol. A very warming finish. Very surprised at how well this beer has held up! My expectations were pretty low heading into this, but was pleasantly surprised at what I found.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Pours a hazy orange with an eggshell head. Taste is semi sweet. Pretty mellow now. Still pretty good.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy dark copper color with amber edges and a one finger off-white head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic streaks and spots of lacing left behind. Slightly herbal and surprisingly hop forward aroma with resinous, grassy pine needle along with leathery malt, sweet booze and dark fruit notes. Slightly earthy with a floral, grassy hop presence followed by leathery malt, caramel, toffee, fig, raisin and alcohol. On the fuller end of medium bodied with a balance of dry, earthy hops, leathery malt and dark fruit. The hop presence is still pretty strong but it’s a bit stale with prominent resinous bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes into a bone dry finish. This is countered mid-palate by earthy, leathery malt and dark fruit sweetness. Hints of plum, raisin and fig followed by some sweet, boozy heat. Slight warmth in the finish but the high ABV is relatively well masked.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"22 oz. bottle from alexsdad06- thanks again, Brad! Pours a mostly clear amber color with a small off-white head. Aroma of caramel malts, pine, honey, brown sugar, and herbs; resinous, almost hints of some hop character after all this time. Flavor of caramel, rye-like spice, pine resin, wood, and mixed tropical fruits. Light-medium bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, resinous mouthfeel. Not bad."
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;22 oz bomber. Cloudy with not much head. A little old, some sweet malts but low hop aroma. Slight sourness (oxidation?) Sweet malts, but really not much hop flavors, and finished with a noticeable bitterness. I don’t think I tried this beer in it’s prime. A shame.
Three Floyds Fantabulous Resplendence (X Anniversary Ale);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;I felt a bit guilty for letting this one sit around for 3 1/2 years after bottling -- but in retrospect, I’m not sure that was such a terrible mistake. It comes off somewhere between a nicely aged American Strong and a divinely aged IIPA. Pineapple, resin instead of aged-hop cheese. Nice brown sugar caramels, extremely drinkable, just hints of the 10.5% that could easily be more like 8.
Three Floyds Remus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;I took the twin taste test at 3 Floyds. Remus vs. Romulus A: Light yellow in color kind of cloudy. There was a medium head that died down to a small lily pad. S: Tons of nice sweet floral hops. Fresh cut grass and grapefruit. T: Nice sweetened grapefruit taste. There is some malt in there as well to balance things out. Wonderful tasting brew. I liked it slightly better than its twin brother. Remus Rules Rome. M: Nice and light. Effervescent brew.
Three Floyds Remus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery: More fruity than the brother Romulus. Some yeast to go along with the fruit. Unfortunately a disappointment when compared to the Alpha King, Dreadnaught, etc.
Three Floyds Remus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap @ 3F for Andrews Bachelor Party. Pours similar to its twin brother, clear gold with an off white head. Carmel grains and cereal in the aroma with a light hop spice, not as pleasant as Romulus. Carmel grapefruit flavors with a lingering light and cloying bitterness. History repeats itself as Romulus kills his brother once again.

Aroma, bready pale malts, some citrusy, grapefruit notes. Flavor, sweet up front, some pale malts, citrus, with some light floral notes as well. I thought it was pretty good.
Three Floyds Remus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;orangish gold pour. Aroma is herbal somewhat fruity from the hop. Light caramel backs it, maybe a touch of bread. Not bad, but fairly boring. Not up to 3F standards, especially for an APA. You can tell they’re different, but I’m not sure how to put it into words. They are very similar.
Three Floyds Remus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"On tap at brewpub; poured a copper/gold color. Large white head.

Three Floyds Remus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at Three Floyds brewpub with Romulus. Orange with small white head, clear. Looks exactly like Romulus, but certainly does not smell. Has nice light citrus hop aroma witj nice sweetness. Pine with major cittus taste, sweet malt and grapefruit. Creamy, med-full body. Very great overall, and less bitter than romulus.
Three Floyds Remus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at FFF, and served in a pint glass. This pale ale poured a slightly hazy golden color with a small head that quickly faded. The aroma was very faint compared to the Romulus. It consisted of some light citrus notes. The flavor was about the same as the aroma. Some very smooth, faint grapefruit and caramel, followed by a lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall, this was a decent brew, but it was overshadowed by it’s brother, Romulus.
Three Floyds Remus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Tap at FFF: Slightly lighter than it’s brother with a smaller head as well, very good lace still. The aroma has notes of grassy and herbal hop, lemongrass, light grapefruit and pear, very bready with a hint of butterscotch. The taste has a strange herbal quality and astringent (not fresh) bitterness with more kaffir lime undertone. Bready pale malt midsection and a dry metallic finish. The mouth feel is twangy and mouth watering but not as bright and clean as it’s twin. I preferred Romulus much more than Remus.
Three Floyds Romulus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;The second of the Roman twin challenge at 3 Floyd’s. A: A little darker than its twin brother. This beer was more golden yellow/orange in color and its also nice and clear. Pours with a nice two finger head that dies down nicely yet remains. S: Nice and floral like its big brother. Tons of citrus with grapefruit peel front and center. Big smelling brew. T: Grapefruit baby. Romulus is a bit more bitter than its sweeter brother Remus. I really like this brew, but the malty sweetness in Remus puts it slightly ahead. I liked Remus a little better making Romulus the heir to the throne. If given the chance Romulus could rule Rome. M: Medium body and Effervescent. Nice brew.

Founders Deca;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);From notes. Enjoyed in the company of Doug, Travis, Chris, Ryan, and Jake as part of an event we finally planned on November 15. 22 oz bottle. Thanks Ryan for this one man. Whoa. The pour is a nice dark ruby brown with a thin bit of light tan head and a couple spots of lace as it falls away. The aroma is pretty good. There is a light spicy chocolate on the front end that moves through a good maltiness and a bit of Belgian yeast. This is surprisingly complex for its age. The breadiness of the malt comes through a little more on the finish with a light oxidation. It’s not big, but it does balance well. The flavor is much of the same. The bready malts and a light spicy chocolate work well with a light yeast and a bit of oxidation. The small cardboard to this seems to balance this out well. I like this one. This is way better than I thought it would be. The mouth feel is a medium bodied and softly carbonated still with a great chocolate, spicy yeast on the finish. This one is something else, that’s for sure. Hot damn. 8 4 8 4 16

The aroma and flavor had sweet malts, caramel, dark fruit and berries, some earthy notes, herbal character, yeast, complex profile with the different yeast strains both showing up, definitely didn’t want to rate this years ago when I had it fresh because I didn’t feel like I had the vocabulary to describe this properly. I would like to try this once again.

Founders Deca;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Pours thick unclear dark ruby amber with a sandy head. Aroma is sweet, a bit fruity, and contains big sweet malty barleywine notes. Flavor brings sweet lemony malty notes typical of a barleywine on a bigger body. It is not totally cutting on the palate, but still pretty big.
Founders Deca;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"Bottle (2007) sampled 10/2013. One of the problems with cellaring American beer is that even if it does improve with aging, it would have to improve enormously to keep up with the pace of brewing and distribution improvement that we’ve enjoyed over the past decade.

This one is probably suffering from the same problem -- it was doubtless quite a special beer in 2007 but in 2013 we’re spoiled with an overabundance of riches. It took me a while to open this one and I may have let it go past its prime but it seemed like a bit of a special occasion beer and there aren’t that many special occasions when I’m looking for a 13% ABV American ale. Tonight’s not a special occasion either, but I thought this would nicely complement last night’s Pike Old Bawdy Wine. Pours orange-brown with gold highlights and little head into my Samichlaus snifter. Straight-ahead aged (American) barleywine nose: toffee, orange, oxidized hops. Pretty hot even after all these years, warming down the back of my throat. I don’t pick up much in the way of the spices; the flavor more or less follows directly from the aroma: quite sweet, lots of toffee, oxidized hops, never really drying out in the close. It’s an In the end it’s a tasty beer but not a particularly special one -- at 13% it better knock my socks off and this one is just enjoyable."
Founders Deca;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle @ home, thanks to arminjewell. Thanks Armin! Pours a deep orangish brown appearance with a thin brown head. Somewhat oxidized, a bit boozy, chewy belgian yeast, raisin/plum, somewhat woody, spicy aroma. Big toffee, chocolate, sweet malty, mild to moderate paper/cardboard, a touch fruity flavor. Lots of malt, somewhat oxidized but overall pretty good. I didn’t really get spices in the flavor. Aged pretty well.
Founders Deca;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Pour out of 750 mL bottle, thanks Markus! Thick dark brown pour with thin white head, aroma brought notes of lots of sherry, dark fruits, lots of caramel, toffee, burnt sugars, hints of oak, slight spice notes. Taste is a nice smooth mix of lots of sherry, brandy notes, some dark fruits, toffee, hints of oak, slight spice, hints of red fruits as well, finishing sweet, dry, and full. Pretty nice at this age.
Founders Deca;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bomber. Poured rich, deeper plumy-brown with a short, dense beige head. The aroma picked up rich, fruity malts, caramel, and molasses with accents of black pepper and oxidation.. a hair over the hill, but solid. The flavor found tangy, slightly metallic notes throughout, with dark fruit and molasses at the core.. tangy fruit skins, oxidation, and peppery notes around.. finished tangy and warm. Medium-bodied and a bit too tangy on the palate.. overall it held up well, but it was probably better a few years ago.
Founders Deca;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle at RBSG. Pours with an orange to brown hued body, with medium-low clarity and a small off-white head. Aromas are sweet, nearly cloying, spicy, medium phenol, earthy. Flavors are sweet, spicy and boozy. Medium strong bitterness, warming, earthy cedar like notes, spruce, brown sugar, cola. Medium carbonation and very warming.
Founders Deca;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);26th February 2011 Cloudy brown beer. Small tan head. Mellow malty nose with some fruit and chocolate. Surprisingly light palate, semi dry. Sweet dried fruits and subtle pineapple cube sweets. Aniseed spice. Subtle and mellow chocolate. Sweet peach and apricot in the finish which is semi dry. Hides the 13.0% very well. Tasty and somewhat exotic beer!

Suishin Shugetsu Junmai Daiginjo Sake;HIROSHIMA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Suishin Yamane Honten Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle thanks to the Sushi Bar! Pours a mostly clear color. A rich aroma of pear, grains, earthy dust, some floral component. Very dry, almost sucks out the water in your mouth. A huge flavor if old dusty pears and apples, some vanilla perhaps. Akin to a well made apple cider. Enjoyable.
Suishin Shugetsu Junmai Daiginjo Sake;HIROSHIMA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Suishin Yamane Honten Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle at home ... HUGE HUGE HUGE thanks to TimE ...

Suishin Shugetsu Junmai Daiginjo Sake;HIROSHIMA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Suishin Yamane Honten Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle @ RBSG 07 Minneapolis: Clear, thick legs, nose of sweet plum and grape, ripe melon and very light alcohol. Subtle peach and no koji or rice notes. Super clean, no butteriness, clean, fresh and explosively tasty. A truly beautiful sake. The favor is semi-sweet, light coconut and a touch of alcohol to remind you you’re still drinking an alcoholic beverage.
Suishin Shugetsu Junmai Daiginjo Sake;HIROSHIMA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Suishin Yamane Honten Shuzo Co., Ltd.;The only o’Sake sampled at the RBSG ’07 Grand Tasting. Supplied by BückDich, this sake pours a clear wine body with no bubbles or particles. VIscosity test (alcohol) has deep legs after spinning hte beverage.

Suishin Shugetsu Junmai Daiginjo Sake;HIROSHIMA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Suishin Yamane Honten Shuzo Co., Ltd.;RBSG 2007 Grand Tasting - Aquafina clear and still. Nose held notes of melon, florals, and honeysuckle. Sweet honey rice flavor with ripe melon and florals form start to finish. ABV is well hidden. Thin, yet slick and smooth. Not a huge sake fan, but I know a good one when I have it. Thanks for sharing Jordan...
Suishin Shugetsu Junmai Daiginjo Sake;HIROSHIMA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Suishin Yamane Honten Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"Bottle... RBSG 07...Crystal clear and colorless. According to previous ratings, it has nice legs, but I have no idea what that means. I couldn’t find it in the RB glossary of terms so someone might want to add that one. As I was saying, it basically looks like water. My nose is pulling tons of fennel from the glass; very pleasant. The flavor is sweet and the body is light with a watery mouthfeel. Despite that sweet, watery nature, this baby totally dries out by the time I’m ready for another sip. That’s a good thing in my book, but in the world of sake? It works for me nonetheless. Overall, I enjoyed it, but not as much as previous raters. It’s fairly highly rated and probably expensive. What else can be said? Kudos to BückDich for supplying the bottle. Although I really don’t know what I just consumed, it surely furthered my experience, knowledge and expectations regarding this ancient style of brew."

Luchs Bier Pils;Weissenstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Michael;"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and it’s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Ins Glas hingegen ergießt sich ein wahres Prachtpils. Hohe, feinporige Krone, und eine kräftig goldgelbe Farbe mit viel CO2. Der Geruch ist primär süßhopfig, minimal herb und etwas muffig. Der Antrunk erfolgt auf jeden Fall mal sehr rezent und spritzig, ein guter Aromahopfen kommt durch. Im Abgang zeigt sich wieder der komisch muffige Beigeschmack vom Geruch., ansonsten zeigt dieser sich leicht malzig. Gelungenes Pils!"

Main Street Brewery El Diablo Rojo;Corona, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);5th March 2019. Part of a four beer flight in Lamp Post Pizza and Main Street brewery, Corona (California). Red, ruby hue to the body, beige head. Malty molasses rule the nose and taste with caramel esters and flavours to the fore. Some light hop action tries to calm the beer down and almost manages too.
Main Street Brewery El Diablo Rojo;Corona, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Amber pour with a khaki head. Sweet caramel malt, tropical fruit, pineapple, and a bit of grapefruit. There’s some pine, a hint of grass, and orange. A bit more bitter than expected on the palate. Sweet caramel, though, a bit of pineapple, and some grapefruit. Piney hop bite on the finish.
Main Street Brewery El Diablo Rojo;Corona, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Hay red with a foamy off white head. Caramel and a big citrus hops aroma and taste with an oddly enough coco nib flavor to the finish.
Main Street Brewery El Diablo Rojo;Corona, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Tap at brewpub. Poured a very nice dark ruby red. Nice hop nose, very well put together. Very well balanced flavor, great hop presance with a good malt backbone, very delicious.
Main Street Brewery El Diablo Rojo;Corona, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Bought a growler of this stuff a while back. Aroma was strong citrus hops. Poured a dark red with a tannish head. Flavor was mostly hop dominated. Strong citrus, some roasty malt that is overpowered by the hop attack. Resiny on the palate. A nice strong ale. Thought I could drink the whole growler in one sitting. Not a good idea.
Brahma Stout;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Stout;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);Light brown. The aroma is mostly sugars, very sweet palate. Dark sugars and not much else. Slight creaminess to the body but no nuance to this beer.
Brahma Stout;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Stout;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);Canned 354ml. -My third beer from Chile. Other two (Cristal Black Lager and Austral Lager) were also cans, but they were 350ml??? Funny. Again, I’m the first European to rate this beer. Black coloured, small to medium pale brown head, strong caramel nose. Disgustingly sweet taste with touch of coffee near the end. Too sweeeeeet!!! Thanks for those 004ml, but no thanks again!!!
Brahma Stout;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Stout;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);Pretty poor. Underattenuated. Nasty sweetness, unpleasant palate. Weird fruitiness. Between a schwarzbier and a stout I would say.
Brahma Stout;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Stout;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);Appearance: dark brown color with reddish tones. Medium head, beige color, few dense but persistent. Aroma: toasty malty, slightly candy and cacao. Berries and figs touches. Slight smoked and hoppy. Flavor: to much sweet, candy and low bitter-toasty for a so-called stout. Artificial flavors. The fruitiness maybe similar to berries, candied fig and black raisin. Aftertaste with slight toasty (like artificial) and smoked. Palate: to much light for the beer style, medium carbonation. Not a stout, extreme sweet and artificial (chemistry), few toasty, totally unbalanced, like a pop-soda. Not advisable
Brahma Stout;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Stout;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);Not really sure if it was a real stout, but it wasn’t that bad. Creamy persistent head. Aroma is malty with notes of coffee beans and bitter chocolate. Flavor was sweet and a little watery... also felt syrupy. I will try with the Porter.
Brahma Stout;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Stout;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);In can, 354 ml. Has a dark brown cor, well opaque. The head is frothy (much), with a quite lasting cord. The aroma is very malty, the best thing of this beer. The flavor is very sweet, is like a burned coffee, with much sugar. This beer is extremely sweet. This is a lager, that is camouflaged with the sugar. It is a good attempt of Ale, but it is not a stout.
Brahma Stout;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Stout;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);Can, 354 ml Pours an opaque reddish brown color. Light brown frothy head with medium retention. Solid lacing. Aroma is malty, roasted with lots of metallic hints (from the can, surely). There are notes of prunes, figs, dates and ther dark fruits. Surprisingly good for a macro. Flavor is VERY sweet, schwarzbier-like. There are notes of dark fruits, blackberries, sweetened coffee, toasted almonds, grains, honey and brown sugar. Well, not too bad but too extremely sweet for a Stout. Medium to big body, thick, syrupy texture. Medium carbonation. The finish is sticky but reveals some adjuncty flavor at last. Very sweet aftertaste. It seems more a Lager than an Ale.
Brahma Stout;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Stout;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);Big creamy head, good lacing. Mahogany colored body with small bubbles. Aroma: mild, malty,smocked, with notes of berries and some saltyness. Flavor: very sweet and watery, some cooked potatos hints at the back of the flavor.
Stonecutters Big Ale;Barre, Vermont, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stonecutters Brewhouse (formerly Granite City Brew Pub);Draft at the brew pub - Poured a cloudy brown in color with a foamy light tan head. Aroma was faint of caramel malt and spicy hops. Flavor was about the same, but was not a strongly flavored beer. Has a kick to it, for sure, but the alcohol was well hidden in this decent brew. Had a couple of them and enjoyed them both...
Shed Big Pig Imperial Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub - Poured a very dark brown/black in color with a medium dark tan head. Some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was intense of darkly roasted malts, espresso with hints of chocolate. Palate was quite smooth and medium thick. Flavor was strong of very dark malts and espresso. Smaller amount of dark fruits and chocolate as it warmed up. Alcohol was not present n the flavor, but you could tell that there was plenty by the time you got near the bottom of the pint. One of the better Vermont-brewed imperial stouts that I have had recently. Worth seeking out if you are close by...
Shed Owen's Double IPA;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;on tap at the shed. Deep amber/brown pour which suprised me considering this is an IIPA, I almost thought I was poured the wrong beer. Aroma was initially of grapefruit and mango, with caramel- with a slight off note. As it warmed, rubbery phenols started to show up as well as nail polish remover. Taste was malty with a decent balance of hop character, but also had the rubbery phenols present. Even without that off character, this would be too sweet for me in terms of a IIPA.
Shed Owen's Double IPA;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;"6 ounce draught sample at the Vermont Brewer’s Fest (July 2007). Bronze-caramel body, fairly clear, light touch of head....lovely spicy, strongly pungent aroma, with strange tomato-oregano notes that actually seem to work with the resinous pine; a bit like the smell of scraped-off pizza from a wood-heated pizza oven, splashed with fresh wood and a hint of acidic citrus.....sharp and spicy body, medium-full, with a bit of tartness at the finish....unspectacular but quite drinkable and without a hint of alcohol."
Shed Owen's Double IPA;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Vermont Brewers Fest ’07. Pale amber with a thick white head. Slightly soapy on the hop front with light pine and grapefruit as well. Comes across a bit soapy and unbalanced. Sweet finish.
Shed Owen's Double IPA;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft at the brewpub - Poured a quite dark amber in color that had an orangish hue if you held it up to the light. Medium whitish head... no lacing. Aroma was strong of citrus and pine hopiness. Flavor was also strongly hopped with the same intense citrus/pine/grapefruit hop character. A small amount of malt was detectable and it provided some scant balance to the overwhelming hoppiness. Hops being my ""thing"", I really liked it, but it really needs better balance before those of the non-hop persuasion will think that it as good as I do. This is one that I would gladly find again on my next visit."
Power House White River Brown Ale;Columbus, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Power House Brewing Company;"Draft to taster. Looks good for the style; a fairly transparent deep brown with lacing somewhere between off-white and light beige. Smells and tastes malty with notes of coffee and chocolate, and a touch of nuttiness as well. Average on the palate. A nice take on the style."
Power House White River Brown Ale;Columbus, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Power House Brewing Company;Draft: Nearly black, rubied, with a small tan head. Chocolate and coffee malt, aroma. Light coffee bitter, chocolate flavours. Creamy. Very nice.
Power House White River Brown Ale;Columbus, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Power House Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub I didn’t get much of this as the kegs was almost empty. My half pour provided a good impression however. While the Columbus Bar isn’t worth a huge detour if you are on the way to or from Indianapolis it might be worth swinging by assuming you have an hour or two to kill. Aroma / Appearance - The rich deep brown base is accented by a vanilla hued head. Half melted candy bars, almonds, and syruppy chocolate milk aren’t strong but do hold together well. Flavor / Palate - Black coffee, creamer, almonds, and then a cool soft finish please the palate. Refreshing for the most part, this is a middle of the road brown ale. Even so it might be worth sampling if you enjoy sessionable local taps.
Power House White River Brown Ale;Columbus, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Power House Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Strong chocolate and coffee malt aroma. Dark brown with large head. Sweet chocolate and coffee malt flavor with a light bitter finish. A great brown ale - excellent malt flavor.
Power House White River Brown Ale;Columbus, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Power House Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Poured a clear dark brown color with a moderate frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Medium toasted malty aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration.
Power House White River Brown Ale;Columbus, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Power House Brewing Company;Pours clear, brown, with a moderate head. Flavor of chocolate malt. Very basic beer with very little hop hit. A bit of a plasticy/chlorine flavor in the finish.
Raccoon Lodge Way Bad Billy Double Blond Bock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Cascade Brewing;From a 22-oz bottle--Poured a bright golden-amber body with a small whitish head. Lots of lacing in glass. Nose of sour lactic and grainy malts. Crisp and sweet. Couldn’t drink too much of this one. Lots of infection. Quite Belgian, but on purpose?
Raccoon Lodge Way Bad Billy Double Blond Bock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Cascade Brewing;Bottle at Raccoon Lodge & Brewpub, Portland, OR. Small white head that mostly diminished, fair amount of lacing, transparent, fast rising carbonation, and a golden hue. Nose was malty, hoppy, sweet, and a hint of caramel. Flavor was hoppy, citrus, malty, and semi-sweet. Tingly mouthfeel and medium body. Nothing outstanding or special was observed during this rating. Not a brew that was exciting to drink as it was rather a ho-hum beer IMO.
Raccoon Lodge Way Bad Billy Double Blond Bock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Cascade Brewing;This bottled brew from the brew pub poured a medium sized head of foamy fine to large sized white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a typically carbonated light yellow-orange colored body. The aroma was malty sweet and mild hop. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a bubbly aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of malt hops and floral. Was hard for us to finish the bottle.
Raccoon Lodge Way Bad Billy Double Blond Bock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Cascade Brewing;Sampled on tap at the brewery during ABA Beer Tour ’07. Pours a clear golden amber brew with a a creamy white head with excellent retention. Aroma of caramel malt, flowery hops and a strong sense of sweet candy sugar. Taste is lightly carbonated, medium bodied, with a good balance of some sweet citrus hop and malt flavors. Finish has a honey smooth sweetness with a slight bitter aftertaste.
Jasper Ridge Belgian Wit;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clean, clear brown-tinged orange-gold. Rim in whitish. Served with an orange slice. Pleasant citrus-tinted spice aroma. A little spring rain climbs through as hops. Flavor is a heavily carbonated, explosive orange-flavored (dammit) mild malt sugar. Minimal Belgian profile backed with a bit of mineral-like hop character, leafy. I like the higher, fresh level of hops in this version. Very juicy and resin-like. The wheat and spice character that I should get in this style, however, suffers. But, a fresh version, nonetheless.
Jasper Ridge Belgian Wit;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Ishpeming MI. Just presented to me as a seasonal Belgian-style wheat so I couldn’t be certain whether that is the full name. Very pale straw colour, slightly hazy, with a lasting white head. Sweet, estery fruit aroma with a perfumed, cosmetic character. Slight tang of citrus on the palate (it was served with an unnecessary slice of orange) but no spice character to speak of. Clean mouthfeel. Not really to style but pleasant enough.
Great Waters Not Quite Dead Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Clear amber body with beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, earthy, caramel, some spice. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, spice/earth, light peach. Light-medium body.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Good for the brown style. Hint of sour in the finish tthat works like a beauty spot. Hopcat tap takeover.good malting. Funky yeast.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Black cap......nice brown pour with a generous head. slight malt and warm aroma. A very nice slight nutty, toffee and slight hop flavor. Very drinkable. Thank good I live in a state where we have some of the best brewers and they could come up with a colaberation like this.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Black cap bottle thanks to jgd0608, thanks man! Pours a deep, muddled amber-brown color with a moderate off-white head that slowly faded to a thick layer and left a little lacing. Aroma of chocolate, some light roast, a hint of nuts, and some light hoppiness layered beneath. Smooth, lightly sweet entry with some hints of chocolate and some caramel, toasted malt, and light toffee that finishes with some soft roast and a faint hint of hops on the finish with some light coffee undertones. Moderate carbonation, smooth on the palate with a little bite. Solid brown ale.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;9/26/2007 and 1/28/2008: Dark Corner Ale (black cap) pours out in a thick stream of dirty, opaque amber-brown liquid. Wow, this stuff is thick! The bubbles are held back by the heavy liquid and then create a delayed mushroom cloud that allow some bubbles to actually break the surface to create a thin, fleeting tan-colored crown! The earthy aroma contains toasted/roasted malt, coffee tending towards chocolate, and finally some hops buried deep down in there. The flavor is like coffee beans (finely ground) along with a deep fruity caramel maltiness followed up by a roasty, black coffee-like finish. There is also a bit of alcohol that seeps out in the finish. The body is medium-full and is mostly smooth, slightly sticky on the palate. My overall impression is that this is a good, solid beer. 12 fl. oz. bottles shared by Tmoney99. Thanks Tom! Rating #55 for this beer.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Bottle black cap Fall 2007. Poured a clear brown color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted sweet malt and hoppy aroma. Medium body. Solid balanced toasted flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good complex brew.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Dark brown pour, much darker than expected, light head. Some sweet malt, nut, slight red fruit in the nose. Flavor very similar, good amount of fine carbonation, a bit light bodied. Very smooth and drinkable. Reminded me of a schwarzbier more than a brown ale. This was the black capped version.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;"12 oz. bottle from the Beer Geek (black cap). Red tinged amber color with almost no head. Interesting aroma that resembles cola, or roasted caramel. Good smell; a bit vinous. Medium body with mild creamy carbonation. Flavor is malt, fruit, treacle, and a hint of coffee? Finish is neither dry nor sweet. The residual is reminiscent of a molasses flavored hard candy, but not all that sugary. Really pretty good drink."
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Lightly hazy amber body with a small beige head. Rich, malty nose with toffee, vanilla, vienna malts and grapes. The flavor is lightly sweet, moderately bitter with nuts, raisins, plums, berry and caramel. Medium/full body is soft with light carbonation and a drying finish.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Bottle - black cap. Picked up at Wacky’s party store next to the brewery. Hazy brown color. Small tan head. No lacing. A bit of a coffee aroma. Tastes of molasses, caramel, and brown sugar. Flavors continue to come out as it warms. Dry finish. Good brown beer mouth feel. Overall enjoyed this, but agree it is thinner then most of the Dark Horse beers. Sin City is the first thing I thought of when I saw the label.
Dark Horse Dark Corner Ale (2007);Marshall, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Tasted 5/10/08. 12oz bottle. Black Cap. Strong nose from a distance. Hazy brown with a slight bone white head. Aromas of dark fruit and toffee. Figgy and caramel nose. Big nose! Full bodied with big malts. Sticky body with a good dose of alcohol. Nutty and dried fruit flavors. Spicy. Warming with a good palate. Malty with fruity estery undertones. Sticky finish with mild slight hops. Maybe a touch resinous to add to the stickiness. Subtle flavors of pepper caramel and toffee. Mild vanilla note. Touch woody note. Ever so slight citrus hits the palate. A lot of flavor profiles but none of them are overt. But they are all blended wonderfully. Tart with a great complexity. Love the labeling to boot.
Matilda Bay Grayston Reserve;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);going old school 750 ML bottle dark brown, bordering on black color. Light tan head. Great retention for the age of the beer. Good spotty lacing. Amazed how well the head held up. nose is slightly tart, slight oxidation but do get chocolate, roasted malt, and soft banana. Same, Impressed the beer has held up pretty well. taste is chocolate, banana, cream, caramel, and touches of sourness again. One it opened up from being slightly dusty it was pretty tasty. Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Expected a train wreck but got something much better. Grade is more on how well it has held up
Matilda Bay Grayston Reserve;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Dirty black head. Burnt charcaol and licorice. A bit unbalanced and random. That said was interesting.
Matilda Bay Grayston Reserve;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Sweet matl hop aroma. Dark red brown colour with good head and lacing. Sweet malt chocolate flavour. Smooth palate.
Matilda Bay Grayston Reserve;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);"Another oddball near-miss from Matilda Bay. Good on them for continuing to experiment with this sort of stuff. Can’t say I’ve been blown away by the results so far, but you have the feeling that one of these ""limited releases"" will be a knockout. This one looked great, dark brown with a bit whipped cream head. The head-scratching began with the aroma, which to my nose combined whipped vanilla cream pudding, natural yoghurt, grout, wheat malts and salt. Especially salt. Great creamy mouthfeel - lovely. The taste evoked lots of sweet flavours, but finished incredibly salty. (As someone smarter than me at the gathering observed, it’s almost savoury.) Sticky caramel and banana cream with a lick of salt for afters. Bizarre. No idea how old the sample is, so the above observations may or not be a feature of bottle age. (Coz’s Ashfield RB get-together 07. Thanks Bridge for this one.)"
Matilda Bay Grayston Reserve;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);On tap at automatic, Melbourne. Pours a very deep copper brown with a fluffy, lacy tan head. Aroma of banana, chocolate, a slight wheaty tartness, toffee and apple (in a good way). Perhaps some vanilla too. The mouthful is just amazing, smooth, full, a touch sweet, roasty and herbal... goes down effortlessly. Lots of cocoa line the flavours, as well as a modest amount of dark fruity ester notes, black forest fruits perhaps. Wheaty sharpness comes through in the finish, with more dusty cocoa, cloves and a peppery hoppiness. This stuff is just great!
Matilda Bay Grayston Reserve;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Deep, dark ruby body with a tight beaded light tan head. Initially the banana notes are noticeable in the aroma followed by a lot of cloves. Cloves at the front in the taste, some cocoa but not too much else. Certainly easy enough to drink just doesn’t do a lot for me
Matilda Bay Grayston Reserve;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);I missed out on the MB21, so here is there next reserve and like Hahn’s Millennium, this could honestly do with some ageing. Served p at just on cool, into a stumpy chalice. Looks solid in the glass. Nice deep, sparkling ruby red body with well-conditioned, minute bubble streaming up a very tight, creamy, beige pad. Laces nicely, the head holds true. Initial waft of mushrooms catches on and lingers. Some dark, gritty malts and Pumpernickel notes join in as some overly ripe bananas and butter (hey, best way to describe - it is no an awful waft by all means, just strange!). Rough, deep cocoa powder in the mouth, a light medicinal note and heaps of cloves. A hint of sherry in back and some buttered bread. This is a very strange brew. Malt driven, that much is evident, but not altogether as yet. Finish is sweet, raw and a good continuation of the palate with an even bigger depth of cloves and a good measure of fresh cracked pepper. Long and lingering, its not alarming at all and actually manages to enter that addictive ’got to drink’ area of strange. The palate is not full and it does reek of green beer, so my guess is my next rating will be much higher. In about a years time!!! (75cL, The Beer Store Morley) A very impressive bottle and label I must say!!!
Gale's Swing Low (Cask);Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask (handpump) at the Doric Arch, Euston on 17 February 2007. Noted at 4.1%. Amber colour with a thin white head. Not much going on in the aroma. Dry on the palate with plenty of sharp and slightly earthy hop presence. Vaguely nutty malts. Decent balance and good drinkability. Not a huge amount to it but clean, firm and not too weedy. Decent session bitter served in excellent condition.

Duckstein Belgian Brown;Perth, Australia;Dubbel;Duckstein Brewery;The commotion involved in the current caretakers moving house from the valley to Margeret river managed to uncover this little beast of a beer. Long lost, a single 50 litre keg sitting in the cool room lagering for many years now was on draught last weekend. It was the last beer brewed in the coppers inside the restaurant’s main sitting area. Into a chalice, served up a little too cold for liking. Produced a hazy, seasoned oak brown adorned by a sloppy, tannish head of cream that held and showed good legs. Sweet, gooey toffee and burnt caramel nose with balancing woody and damp earthy soil notes. Sugary, sweet demerara and sticky date pudding in the mouth. Quite savoury like sultanas and prunes with a good dose of those earthy notes picked up in the aroma. It leans towards a Scotch ale as it heads into the nether. Peaty, big malts in back, woody and sweet mix, again savoury and peaty in the finish with good length shown. Body is hard to judge, the residual sugars feel rough on the tongue and it is a little fizzy upfront. Alcohol doesn’t show but it could aid in balancing it out. Nice as an aperitif, but not your average quaffer. Interesting, I wonder if it will ever be brewed again!?!
E9 Spring Bock;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;E9 Brewing Co.;on cask-pours a thin white head and yellow/gold color. Aroma is medium malt/grain, light/medium fruit-apple cider. Taste is medium malt/grain, light/medium fruit-apple cider, nail polish remover. Minimum carbonation.
E9 Spring Bock;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;E9 Brewing Co.;Enjoyed this one on draught at the brewpub in Tacoma, WA. Pours to a beautiful, bright, golden color, with a nice, white head that fades, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose is very nice, with good pale and sweet malt aroma, paired with some light grassy hops, and peppery alcohol. The palate is firm, with good, crisp, pale malt flavors, on a very clean, round, body. The body is just a touch lean for the style, making this beer dangerously drinkable. This beer finishes with more good pale malt flavors up front, then ends with some good grassy hops, and some peppery alchol that lingers. All and all a nice, domestic example of maibock, from a rock solid Tacoma brewpub. Englne House #9 is well worth a stop if you find yourself in the Tacoma/Seattle, WA area.
East End Kvass;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kvass;East End Brewing Company;Backlog, on draft at Capones 8-9 years ago. Pours a hazy orange color with medium to large foamy head. Notes are rye bread, lemon juice, bubblegum, spices, and malt. Medium carbonation with a dry finish.

T: Delicious... bready malts... sourdough loaf after sourdough loag after sourdough loaf... nice tart character... light citrus.. some bitterness M: Chewy, but light-medium body... lingering aftertaste O: Top notch kvass... I think i liked the dark kvass from EEBC slightly better... a little more subdued and slightly more complex.. but this is a very good representation of the kvass and I can’t think of anyone that does it better than EEBC
East End Kvass;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kvass;East End Brewing Company;Pours hazy amber with a slight fizzy head. Aroma is spicy and very saison-like. A slight metallic hint, too. Flavor is unexpected. Sorty of salty and grainy. Some nice fruity esters and maybe even some licorice. The body is light and refreshing. I’m glad I tried it, but it wasn’t something I would enjoy all the time.
East End Kvass;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kvass;East End Brewing Company;"Poured into my ""WE BE JAZZIN’"" pint glass from New Orleans. In case you were wondering, I be jazzin’ as well. This is my first encounter with the style. 4.0 A: Murky yellowish brown. One finger of frothy white head that dies down rather quickly and leaves no lacing. 4.5 S: Not surprisingly, this is bready, with plenty of rye earthy spiciness coming through. The bread yeast contribution is interesting for sure and comes off as a doughy funkiness. In a lot of ways, this smells like what it is: a beer made from bread. 4.5 T: Dominant flavor is rye bread, which again isn’t surprising. Good balance of bitterness and breadiness stemming from earthy rye. A touch of sourness on the front end, with a ""dirty"" doughiness on the back. 4.0 M: Medium body and slightly chewy. Super smooth throughout. This could use a bit more carbonation, but for all I know it could be perfectly to style. Still, if I made it, I’d give it another 0.5 ppm. 5.0 D: I had a hard time figuring out the scores for this brew. I like it quite a bit, but I have absolutely nothing to compare it too. Based on the other kvasses found on this site and the reviews I’ve read, I’d have to venture that this one is tops for the style. In any case, I might go through this whole growler in one sitting, that’s how smooth and drinkable this is. Serving type: growler Reviewed on: 08-07-2010 20:00:02"
East End Kvass;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kvass;East End Brewing Company;Thanks to MrChopin for the trade for this one. Wow, this is goddamned wierd. I was expected a dark malty bready Kvass, like so many that are imported from Russia today. This guy was in a clear growler, the color of a giant melted creamsicle. The aroma is also completely unexpected. It’s a lot like a Berliner Weiss, sour, wheat, cereal grains, light fruit, lemon. The flavor is more or less the same, sour, wheat, more lemon. The finish is sour, tart lemon, almost no hop bittering, or actually, very little of any kind of bittering. The body is on the thick side of medium. Wierd, but very interesting. I’m a big fan of traditional beers, and I am very glad I got to try this. Thanks, Kevin. Now, I begin my quest to find the Dark Kvass, or Loaf.
East End Kvass;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kvass;East End Brewing Company;Looks like yellow custard and is one of the most unappealing beers I’ve gazed at, also a thin white ring. Thankfully things improve... nose of pepper and lemon, lightly funky grass, then toast and smoke. Flavor is more lemon and dark bread, metal and a bit of coriander. Sticky, lightly bitter finish, grainy flavor lingers with a touch of lemon. Insanely drinkable and flavorful, but not cohesive start-to-finish.
East End Kvass;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kvass;East End Brewing Company;Draft at Capone’s. Pours an incredibly hazy and cloudy orange body with thick white lacing.

Palate is thicker than most blondes, with a fine carbonation and an excellent feel on the tongue. Quite decent with a distinctive hop character.
Fort Street Quatre Seance de Saison;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fort Street Brewery;Hazy-dirty yellow, small head, comes back with a quick swirl. Aroma has tons of fruity esters, sour lemon and tart apple dominate. I picked up alot of floral through the middle and faint pepper near the end. Flavor pretty much on par. Although pepper seems to come through more, could be some rye spiciness as well. I prefer a little more carbonation in saison, so mouthfeel takes a little hit, otherwise very solid, highly sessionable.

Fort Street Much Nothing About Ado;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fort Street Brewery;Dark brown almost black, with mahogany edges, minimal head. Aroma up front is very spicy rye and licorice. Plenty of depth. Dark fruit, roasted grain, faint coffee. Flavor even more complex, huge chocolate up front, fades into fruity esters and roast through the middle, rye and zesty citrus bite in the finish. Although it’s hopped up, it’s such a huge malt bomb, hops mainly play a balancing act, preventing any one character from taking over the beer. Very well done. Seems lately Doug has been brewing for the beer lovers instead of the beer masses. Thank you.

Low malty, slighly citrus aroma. Good hop complexity. Earthy flavor with lots of pine and grapefruit rind. Some malt backing.

Good bitterness - especially for a pale ale. Medium body. Lots of hop flavor.

Falter Export Hell;Regen, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei J. B. Falter;Das Bier hat eine sehr helle Farbe. Beim Geruch fallen blumige Noten auf. Geschmacklich gibt es keine großen Überraschungen. Mild malziger Antrunk, ab dem Mittelteil kommt sehr deutlich der Hopfen, der im Endteil etwas trocken ausläuft und noch lang nachklingt. Trotz reichlich Kohlensäure süffig. Klassisches Export, das auch dem einen oder anderen Pilsliebhaber schmecken dürfte.

New Holland Feverish;Holland, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Poured clear brown color with a moderate white fizzy head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Good complex toasted nutty aroma. Medium body. Well balanced sweet nutty flavor with a moderate smooth sweet finish of moderate duration. Good drinkable brew.
New Holland Feverish;Holland, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Clear dark copper or brown body, thin off-white head. Toasty aroma that developed diacetyl notes as it warmed. At its initial serving temperature, the body was dominated by a rough graininess with heavy toast and an earthy, bitter finish with hints of fruitskin/berries. As it warmed, however, diacetyl exerted itself and dominated the flavor profile. Very thin-bodied. A weird beer, and probably not one I’d drink again, with or without the diacetyl.
New Holland Feverish;Holland, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;"there isnt much to say about this slightly sickly sweet brown ale that is laced with the typical NHBC patented diacetyl; wait a minute, i guess there was something to say about it...please stop brewing beers that suck in general"

Clear medium to dark brown - red amber colour with a small to average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting to diminishing, off-white to light beige head. Aroma is moderate malty, fruity, caramel, dried fruit, alcohol, light chocolate, light raisin, light burnt brown sugar. Flavour is moderate to heavy sweet and light bitter with a long duration, sweet malt, burnt caramel - brown sugar, alcohol. Body is medium, texture is oily and sticky, carbonation is soft, finish feel is light alcoholic. [20130620]
Gülmen Barley Wine;Viedma, Argentina;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cerveza Gülmen;Smells sweet, almost honey sweet with some alcohol and fruit notes. Taste has more alcohol and a little cane water sense. It almost tastes like a Belgian Strong rather than a barley wine. Some floral hops as well. A bottle my sis-in-law brought from Cervelar in B. Aires.
Gülmen Barley Wine;Viedma, Argentina;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cerveza Gülmen;Bottled at Monks Café, Stockholm. Pours out in a clear reddish amber colour with a small bubbly white head. Dense malty sweet aroma of candied oranges, fudge, dried figs, raisins, alcohol and pepper. Full-bodied with notes of raisins, over-riped oranges, butter, pepper and alcohol. Long warming finish of candied apricots, cookies, alcohol, nuts and white pepper. Felt quite rustic and rough but still quite charming.

Flat Earth Angry Planet;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Paul Brewing Company;I did not care for this one...not enough hops....too earthy...bitter and a tad sour...bad bottle?
Flat Earth Angry Planet;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Paul Brewing Company;16 oz can into an Irish pub-style imperial pint glass. No date on the can. Amber color, moderate carbonation, 1 inch light tan head, leaving thick lacing as it receded. Malty aroma, perhaps a bit of pine. medium feel, but little carbonation means it is pretty flat. The malts are the primary component of the taste, initial, middle, and finish, with just a touch of hops flavor. The malts are earthy more than bready. After several sips, a bitterness appears in the finish and lingering aftertaste. The malt taste is good, but I would have preferred more hops presence, both in flavor and bittering. This beer is much different than I was expecting based on the brewer’s description. Overall, disappointing.
Flat Earth Angry Planet;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Paul Brewing Company;I’ve had bombers of these in the past and always liked them but nice to see this in a 16 once can. Pine and citrus on the nose. Starts nice and hoppy with a creamy malt base then ends slightly grapefruit rind bitter. I’ll probably pick up some more.
Flat Earth Angry Planet;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Paul Brewing Company;Tap at New Bohemia in Golden Valley. On happy hour. Coppery almost amber in color. Minimal, feathery head. Aroma draws on citrus, hop characteristics. Taste is hop centric with a little biscuit note. Mouth is dried out from the bitterness. Some malty sweetness at the very back end. Aftertaste is bitter. It’s drinkable and not too harsh.
Flat Earth Angry Planet;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Paul Brewing Company;16iz can shared. Poured a medium orange with white head. The aroma is medium malt base with some citrus hop in the nose. The flavor is where it comes up short. It starts out ok then dies in mid flavor you have the components but it stops about mid tongue. Something just happens here and not good.
Flat Earth Angry Planet;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Paul Brewing Company;Bomber. Clear orange with a tall foamy khaki head. Caramel, light alcohol, dried peaches, and tropical fruit hops. Moderately sweet with a dry bitterness. Body is medium with a sticky feel.
Flat Earth Angry Planet;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Paul Brewing Company;Bomber pours a clear amber/copper color with small off white head and hardly any lacing.

This one seemed like more than 6% ABV. A good but not great APA.
Franklins Batch # 300;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;"Growler from artusory, consumed 7-29-07. Wow looks like I am in the minority on this one. Dark amber, tan head, still very carbonated after roughly 10 days. Huge sticky pine sap/resin up front in aroma. All kinds of tropical fruit esters. Mango/apricot dominate with plenty of bitter grapefruit zest. Flavor has a huge candied fruit character from the start. Grapefruit, apricot, carmelized malt, resinous pine. Big sticky mouthfeel. Very over the top, but well done IMO. Maybe tim ein the growler somehow improved this, or beer tastes better with sand between your toes and some salmon fishing on the horizon, I don’t know? Side note: ""Bitter and offensive"" was the qoute a non-beergeek friend used to describe this, lol...."
Franklins Batch # 300;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Amber/orange body with a small beige head. The aroma is sweet caramels and cotton candy with buckets of citrus hops. The flavor is moderately sweet, quite bitter with caramel, toffee, honey, grapefruit and resinous pine. Full body is sticky and slightly astringent with a palate destroyingly bitter finish.
Franklins Batch # 300;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;"Draft, Franklin’s. Pours a murky, orangish brown color; off-white head with decent lacing. Vegetal aroma, showing citrus and a slightly sour / earthy note. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: very strange mix of flavors in this one; very vegetal, for starters (celery, stalky greenness); decent lingering hops, but seems kind of dissipated at this point, leaving only a sticky and mildly astringent presence in the mouth; there’s also some dry cedar in there as well: woody, earthy, and odd. A messy, messy beer that I couldn’t finish."
Franklins Batch # 300;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Draft. Pours a copper orange, with a slight haze and an off white head. Subtle fruity and piney hop aroma. Flavor reminds me of one of the Choas ales. It has flavors of grapefruit and citrus skin with a bold bitterness. Finishes semi dry with flavors of grape skins and peanut shells. Interesting beer, but I don’t see myself ordering another. Something was very odd about the combination of flavors.
Franklins Batch # 300;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;7/7/07 Quite a bit like their Double IPA offering. Deeper red color with a frothy, foamy white head. Smells of pine and grapefruit, wicked hop aroma. Flavor was all of that. Pine, citrus, soap. Finish was far too astringent for me. Needs more balance to be worthy of celebration. 7/20/07 Had this beer a second time when it was being served on cask and dry hopped. Flavor and finish were far more mellow. Dry hopping didn’t increase the bitterness, it actually mellowed all of the astringent hoppiness out. Maybe 2 weeks of setting helped this beer. Either way, I rated this much higher the second time around.

Carlyle Ale Yeah!;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub on 6/20/07: Pours a slightly hazy copper orange with an airy clingy-lacing light tan head. Aroma of mild fresh piny hops and some lightly toasted malt. Body starts with a touch of toasty sweetness and decent hoppy balance, but thins a lot toward a fairly bland, bittersweet finish. An average APA.
Carlyle Ale Yeah!;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a rich opaque copper-caramel and forms rich, dense off-white head with good staying power. Huge chunks of lace cling to the side of the glass as the beer is consumed. Aroma is disappointingly weak but eventually gives off hints of bitter, citrusy hops and little else. Bitter, resiny hops dominate the flavor as well, accompanied by a deeply caramel-sweet malt that clashes with this particular hop profile, leaving an unpleasant cardboardy aftertaste. Solid mouthfeel with a thick, coating palate. A rare miss amongst the parade of hits that otherwise pours forth from Carlyle’s taps.
Carlyle Ale Yeah!;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub This was towards the end of a sampler flight at Carlyle. If I were to have ordered 10 ounce pours I would have definitely gotten this one after a small sample. It is a classic pale ale with enough flavor to make it worth the effort of ordering. You will certainly get your money’s worth with this one. Aroma / Appearance - The amber red body let through a large amount of light that was only filtered by the thin off white head. Caramel, hops and dusty books are the strongest scents but the background contains stained cherry wood. Overall this is beer that doesn’t pack the whallop of an IPA but does not idly give up either. Flavor / Palate - The hops are the strongest characteristic but the malts do provide a reasonable balance. Tea leaves, caramel and oak wash across the tongue before a finish that reminds me of rust. The mouthfeel is thick for a pale ale and very satisfying. The total impression is mostly woody hops and overall pleasing and balanced.
Carlyle Ale Yeah!;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carlyle Brewing Company;Had this one on draught as part of a sampler flight at the brewpub in Rockford, Illinois. Medium reddish pour with a wispy head, piney hoppiness, sweet and bitter, balanced and mild. Nice strong finsh. Great!
Carlyle Ale Yeah!;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carlyle Brewing Company;Nice sessionable ale, having the aroma and flavor of hops but with only a light bitterness. It’s got a slightly hazy amber body with a solid head that sheets the glass with heavy lace. The aroma is a quiet caramel with a blend of citric scents. In the flavor the cirtus is juicy pink grapefruit, complementing the malty sweetness nicely. The finish is fruity and mildly bitter. Nice. Carlyle Brewing Company, Rockford, IL

Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wit;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;On tap at Grumpy Troll. Hazy, cloudy orange-yellow-tan. Thin white head. Mild toasty aroma. Very citrus forward, but still a quality Wit. Orange coriander all the way. Yeasty and smooth, a pretty decent representation of the style.

Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wit;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Arrived a hazy yellow with a low white head. Aroma had a light banana, light lemon citrus fruitiness to it with a modest coriander spiciness and a solid wheat presence. Flavor started off with a lemon wheat combination first and a light coriander middle with just a touch of banana in the ending (very light). Body was crisp, kinda bubbly but very finely carbonated and a light body as a whole. Overall a very good wit (usually not my favorite style). Coriander isn’t overpowering as is commonly seen and the lemon is perfect to add that crisp feeling finish at the end.

Naylors Pinnacle Pale Ale;Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Naylors Brewery;Cask (GBBF2011, Wed) Very simple malty aroma. Tobacco ad black tea too. Bugger all real hopping. Dull and basically infinitely boring. No flaws, plenty of snores. At least after a while the bitterness does build up so you get some tingle in the finish. But that took too long.

Great Waters Bring Out Your Dead Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;On tap at the brewpub on 6/23/07: Transparent bright copper orange pour has a wispy-lacing white head. Aroma of lightly sweet pale malt with a hint of faintly piny hops. Body starts with a touch of caramel sugar and mild earthy bittering hops toward a watery, bland finish. A pretty average red at best.
Great Waters Bring Out Your Dead Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;On tap at the brewpub: Gorgeous bright cinnamon tinted orange color with a smooth, dense topping of firmly thick off-white foam sitting about a finger high. Lacing sticks in many areas of the glass with lots of broken strings and spots. Aroma is fine and light with a clean snappy firmness of malt sweetness rendering honey, honeydew melon, flower oils, and some chamomile spice. Taste is nearly the same as the aroma would lead one to think how it would taste, which makes this drink a bit of a different take on a Red Ale with its light, softer approach of spice and malt. Soothingly clean, soft, and creamy with a mild broad snappy breath of malt. Honey flavors tend to take the overall mixeing with a bit of melon and pale citrusy tea notions. Faint but adequate hintings to floral spice and chamomile trace the middle and back end. Ends short and creamy with no real finishing qualities other then a wiff of sticky honey and very feathery floral notes. Body is lightish medium with a smooth, quite clean, and gently creamyness to it. Mildly snappy when first served then grows a duller malt sense as it warms allowing a bit more of the subtle spices to pull through. However, as good as it was and drinkable as it was, it was unimpressionable, and left me wanting more out of it n some way. What though, I couldn’t say. I think what the beer is after seems to hit pretty good once taken in, but it just doesn’t have much to say or do to the palate to make a full impression other then the addition of spice to a simple Red Ale recipe. A decent enough drinker for the hotter weather I suppose.

Stewart's Hoppy Trails Red Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;IPA;Stewart's Brewing Company;On Tap @ the Brewpub 6/23- New special brew they had just put on tap: Don’t know why they bothered as it wasn’t much better than anything else I had there. Had a decent hop flavor up front, but nothing excessive considering the Bartender was telling people it was almost like an IIPA. Did have a somewhat floral aroma, had a bit of a grassy taste to it. Drinkable, but not much more & certainly not worth going out of the way for. Short finish, kind of medicinal.
Hereford & Hops English I.P.A.;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;IPA;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the brewpub. The body was hazy dark amber gold.

Hereford & Hops English I.P.A.;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;IPA;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the Trivia Pub. Ubiquitous color, looks like a pale american lager. Barely any carbonation, just a trace. Very little initial aroma but that builds to a slight floral hop towards the end of the session. Perhaps a little less annoying than many IPAs. Taste is all IPA, bitter medicinal and nearly offensive....and that carries over to the finish, which lingers.

Lightly peppery and a bit of smokiness is in there, too. An interesting enough aroma. Moderately opaque dark brown-mahogany colored body with a frothy light tan head and nice lacing present. Starts a bit grainy and cereal-like. Lightly roasted, choco, and burnt flavors are present in the middle. Becomes quite hoppy with plenty of ""C"" hops in the finish.

Wentworth Small Copper;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wentworth;Hand-pulled pint in ’The White hart’ Shifnal on 21 Aug 2013. Golden body with a copper hue, the head snow white and full. Mixed blend of aromas and tastes: some biscuity malts and an undertone of floral hop notes. No great strength to any one flavour, just an easy drinking beer that doesn’t upset or excite your taste buds either way. Was it sweet? No: was it bitter? No, it wasn’t anything really, just a session brew. Not enough oomph for me, but pleasant all the same.
