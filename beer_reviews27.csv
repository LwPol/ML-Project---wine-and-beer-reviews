Church End Cuthberts;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Church End Brewery;Cask at The Black Lion, Bourne End. Light amber with a thick white head and a pleasantly frothy mouthfeel - great condition! Good full jammy summer fruits taste with butter and toffee, then a little chilli and citrus in the moderately bitter finish. This would be a decent bitter if it weren't for the diacetyl.

Can�t tast pumpkin, but pumpkin has no taste! :)
Catawba King Don's Pumpkin Ale;Morganton, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Catawba Brewing Company;Draft at source. Lots of baking spices, clove, nutmeg. Very low sweetness for the style which is a plus for me. Long lingering clove.
Catawba King Don's Pumpkin Ale;Morganton, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Catawba Brewing Company;Pour is a dark reddish with a large white head. Aroma is pretty much a full assault of pie spices. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavor is not as much spice as the aroma let on but this is still a pumpkin beer that relies heavily on pie spice. I�m a sucker for a nice spiced ale and this does not disappoint. Also kudos for being lower in alcohol than most pumpkin beers without sacrificing the flavor.
Catawba King Don's Pumpkin Ale;Morganton, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Catawba Brewing Company;Draft at FS Columbia. Clear bronze-chestnut color with a thin tan head. Fair aroma of perfume, all spice and a hint of pumpkin. Flavor is a little thin with a big spice and ginger profile. A slight miss for me. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Catawba King Don's Pumpkin Ale;Morganton, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Catawba Brewing Company;A good pumpkin, lots of cinnamon. Pour a nice bright orange with a white head. Smells of cinnamon and pumpkin. Cinnamon all over the taste, quite spicy too. Had on tap at the brewery.
Catawba King Don's Pumpkin Ale;Morganton, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Catawba Brewing Company;Poured from can. Pumpkin cinnamon spice aroma. Cream soda appearance. Big cinnamon and dry spice flavor along with the pumpkin. Pretty good.
Catawba King Don's Pumpkin Ale;Morganton, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Catawba Brewing Company;Draft at Catawba - South Slope. Poured a clear orange color with a small white head. Aroma was light vanilla, nutmeg, other pumpkin spices. Flavor was mostly vanilla, light nutmeg, spicy is not too over the top. Nice change from the norm.
Catawba King Don's Pumpkin Ale;Morganton, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Catawba Brewing Company;Draft at Revolution Pizza and Ale House, 1/7/15 It is a darker orange-brown in color. I thought this was a solid, on-style Pumpkin beer. It wasn�t a favorite for me in the style, something fell a little short of that, but it�s decent enough.
R�servoir Bitter;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;R�servoir - Brasseur;On tap @ R�servoir. Dark amber pour with white foam. Smells fairly floral and a touch earthy. Decent amount of bread and some caramel maltiness. A little bit grassy, too. Tastes a lot like tea. Sort of astringent more than anything. Bready and slightly toasty, a bit on the leafy side in terms of the hops. It�s a little watery, too.
R�servoir Bitter;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;R�servoir - Brasseur;Copper body with a little white head. A very weak aroma hop leads the drinker expecting little action for its taste buds. Wrong. The initial typical caramel flavour paves the way to an aggressive and harsh bitterness. The medium finish leaves a peppery and slightly metallic after-taste. Medium carbonation and slightly watery body. Most of the Reservoir beers are on the light side of taste so this one while not being all that pleasant was at least very tasty. The bottom line, did I like it or not? Am I ambivalent? Well, yes and no.
Empyrean Martian M�rzen Oktoberfest;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empyrean Brewing Company;Now named fallfest. Yellow color. Sweet but not malty enough. Not an Oktoberfest beer.
Empyrean Martian M�rzen Oktoberfest;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empyrean Brewing Company;On tap at Lazlos in Lincoln, Nebraska. Again, told this was the first day of the season for this. Lucky me. Poured a nice red color with a medium head that left little lacing. Nose of sweet malts and spices. Nice mouthfeel. Good balance. Even my wife liked this one. Nice.
Empyrean Martian M�rzen Oktoberfest;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empyrean Brewing Company;Tap at South location...this was the second batch of the year, I believe. No head, clear copper to almost amber color. Very little aroma, a big of dough and toast. Quite watery with a slight toasted malt aftertaste. Very thin. Bland. The first batch was better.
Empyrean Martian M�rzen Oktoberfest;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empyrean Brewing Company;Draft at Crescent Moon Alehouse: orange-red with a thin head. At first this is a smooth caramel drinker, but then a tartness with an apple tone breaks through. Good fall beer.
Empyrean Martian M�rzen Oktoberfest;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empyrean Brewing Company;On tap at the Crescent Moon Alehouse. Light amber in color. White head that is short-lived. Good hop aroma. Delicious strong hop alpha to the tongue. Good malt balanced sweetness. This is a fine oktoberfest ale: not too heavy, but enough flavor to enjoy several under the tent.
Empyrean Martian M�rzen Oktoberfest;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empyrean Brewing Company;(Draught) Pours an amber color with an average-sized white head. Mild aroma of sweet malts and spices. Floavor of malt, caramel, and some spices. A bit bitter and somewhat watery.
Empyrean Martian M�rzen Oktoberfest;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empyrean Brewing Company;Had this on draught at Lazlo�s Haymarket. Orange in color with a little white head. Aroma was very generic similar to bud light. Was watery with little spice. The malts were very weak. Not a good example of this style. I won�t drink this again.
Empyrean Martian M�rzen Oktoberfest;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empyrean Brewing Company;Draught: This beer was a very dark golden color. There was a little head, that was off white in color. It didn't linger or lace down the side of the glass. The aroma was fairly muted: not very strong, but there was some spiciness to it. The taste was a bit spicy, with hints of caramel and a hint of smokiness. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Fairly well balanced.
Mission Springs Extra Special;Mission, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mission Springs Brewing Co.;More malt than I expected with toffee and caramel notes, but balanced out with a hoppy finish.
Mission Springs Extra Special;Mission, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mission Springs Brewing Co.;Hazy amber,lasting creamy beige head.Faint malt & light hop nose.Very light malt profile with medium strength lingering hop finish
Deepwater Red;Chelan, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Deepwater Brewing;Reddish amber, light tan head. Great malt nose. Complex blended malt flavor with light hop finish. Full bodied
Copper Canyon Anniversary Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Cream Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);"Yellow, cascading appearance. Huge foamy white head from the nitro pump. Nose was artificial and plasticy. I let this one sit a while because the nitro is so awful for the first few minutes after the beer is served. I can't believe how similar to the canned cream ales, like tetleys, this is in taste and texture. Tinny, I would have guessed this from a widget can. More malty character once it warmed and ""relaxed"". Still maintained that plasticy aftertaste, though."
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;Pours a hazy yellow with a white foam head. Aroma is banana, clove, wheat, and bubblegum. Flavor is similar, sweet. Has some carbonation and a medium body. This is okay, but not a stand out in the style.
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;Had a taste on tap at the brewery. Solid, but nothing special. On the dry side, slightly strange finish.
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;"Tap: cloudy golden color just like a hefe should be, though I�d like a little more haze & a bigger head... only a timid, white ring sits on top. Aroma has typical German hefe yeast notes of banana & clove with a wheat-y body, but it isn�t very strong or robust. Same goes for the flavor... It�s just lacking the ""punch"" that the best hefes all carry. Not bad, don�t get me wrong, just underwhelming in the amount of aroma & flavor... Body, too. Little thin, not chewy or yeasty enough to show authenticity."
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;Got at brewery after Bill�s sold out the day of tapping... mouthfeel creamy, but on the thinner side. Straw yellow. Notes of wheat and banana. Good.
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;draft at the pub... a forgettable wheat beer, not bad but boring not worth having
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;Sample at Dragonmead on 7/23/11. Hazy yellow pour with a medium white head. Aroma of banana, but there are some botanical notes mixed in, so we�ll call it green bananas along with wheat malt. Flavor of banana, chloropyll and a bit of pepperiness on the back end.
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;Golden yellow pour. This is all banana, clove, and grassy hops. Crisp and refreshing.
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at Dragonmead 3-13-09. Poured hazy yellow. Smelled of wheat, banana, and clove. Tasted of wheat, grainy, banana, citrius, mild spices, and butter. Pretty thick body.
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at the Dragonmead Brew Pub. Poured a medium and cloudy yellow color with a small sized white head. Aromas of bananas, cloves and some wheat. Tastes of bananas, cloves, wheat, and citrus. The profile for a Hefe was there if not on the thinner and semi-thin side.
Dragonmead Nagelweiss Wheat Beer;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dragonmead Brewery;Draft at the Stein Haus in Bay City: Sunny yellow pour with a frothy cap that settles into dollops of foam in the middle of the glass. From here, the beer really falls into an average category for the style. It displays a nice wheaty body that is leveled by some honey flavored malt. The yeast does a decent job throwing some banana and clove, but moderate at best. It drinks easy and is refreshing, but lacks that certain complexity that takes an average hefe to the top. A solid made beer that will please the masses.
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Tasted 03/10/2006. 330ml bottle from the brewery. Pour a rich gold with a just off-white head. Head does Houdini-like disappearing act while I�m putting the bottle down. Lightly nutty and toasty on the nose. Toasty and watery in the mouth, a little more nuttiness, and a strangely woody, almost phenolic, note in the hoppy finish. Very retrained in the malt profile, which leaves it quite unbalanced. I detect musty apples as I get into it. Disappointing.
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;A lager with a honey flavour that almost drowns out the hop flavour, hop finish and anything else. Lacks the crispness of a lager, but the hop flavour is enjoyable (POR?).
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Whoa...some positive comments below! Anyway, slightly darker in the glass than one would typically expect for the style. No head, even on pouring. Bland nose with a slightly cardboard like feel, almost musty. The non-event continues in the mouth, truckloads of fizz, some sweetness that can�t possibly be derived from malt. Finish is kinda drying but not at all hoppy. I though this thing was tripple hopped?
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Refreshing enough, aromatic bitter, but I can't get over the Super league-inspired Parra jersey-looking label. Spanner.
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;aussie lager, do i need to say anymore? characterless, poorly hopped, no body, watered down piss.
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Only good thing about this one is that it was the first liquid I had after their stupid chilli beer. Some apple cider with a hint of coola flavoured cordial.
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;nfob03. pretty rancid. my initial reaction when i tasted this was to laugh and i still don't know why. nasty pride of ringwood kick
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Watery, boring poop. Bland aroma, sweetish bland flavour, bland finish. Bland.
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Golden colour with small head. Selt like a merlo wine with lots of tanin (metalic) Bold malty taste but no bitterness.
Sunshine Coast Bitter;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Okay, the guy behind the stall was drinking a Cougar and cola out of a can? WTF? anyway, i guess the crazy guys at the Sunshine Coast brewery were going for a XXXX clone, yeah they succeeded, but they weren't exactly settings their sights very high. Bland, sweet and watery, fizzy, typical Aussie lager.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Surely this is the version (called XXX) that is only available on tap at the brewery in Brisbane? It is a toffee nutty malty light brown ale with a nice gentle hop bitterness to the finish. Medium-light bodied. Not unlike James Squire Amber Ale. Tons better than the other stuff that this brewery spews out.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);(draught at the brewery) I�m rating the XXX version, which is supposedly only available at the brewery - not sure how it differs from the XXXX. Nice copper color with small white head and some lace. Mild malt aroma. Flavor is mild caramel malt.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Looks good, unfortunately the taste doesnt back it up. Nice fluffy white head on top of a rich amber color body. Not enough malt to back up the hops. I�m pretty sure the dreaded pride of ringwood makes an appearance here. It is pretty heavily hopped with these metallic bastards, giving it that nasty, fake, chemically bitter finish.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Compact mainly lasting off-white head on a coppery bronze coloured body. Caramel, nutty, hoppy taste - good but I couldn�t have a session if I was just drinking these.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);This is a surprise, after hearing how truly awful Castlemaine beers are, this turns out to be quite drinkable. The easiest beer to compare this against is the James Squire amber ale (bit of a coincidence that they are both lion nathan beers). There is some nice caramel and malt flavours that are just thick enough not to be watery and not too strong to be sticky sweet. The aroma and bitterness are a tad weak but at $8.50 per 6 pack it is great value.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);not as bad as the gold, but still overdone in the carbonation department. Too many chemicals in this one I think. Its ok if your very drunk!
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I had mine at the Royal Mail in Tewantin as well. The sight of seeing people in a bar ordering stubbies in their polystyrene holders in a pub is always amusing in Queensland. They seem to think that even in an air-conditioned bar that your beer has to be kept icy cold down to the last drop. Anyway, I had a pot of this after a bit of shopping and walking around in the Queensland humidity. Ergo it tasted pretty good. Not a lot more character than any of the others in the stable but still not a bad drop for the time and place.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Yeah not a bad traditional attempt. Had one in caboolture in queensland. I think it is fair but tastes a little dirty and fake.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);nothing special, but a step in the right direction for castlemaine lagers. try it if your looking for something better than xxxx, tooheys new, vb and the like.
Castlemaine XXXX Sparkling Ale;Milton, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);At the Royal Mail in Tewantin. Got sick of XXXX Bitter, had one of these puppies. Not too bad, not too good.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;From a bottle. Pours like a ginger ale, the chilli is initially a bit much, settled down a bit as I finished, could pair well with food.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Bottle from Archive Beer Bar Brisbane (June 2014). Clear mid amber, minimal white head, nothing here except malt extract and chilli heat. Not enjoyable at all. Pass.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Very sour aroma. Light golden colour, clear with poor head ... and a chilli. Light up front with a massive chilli hit. Light body with low carbonation. Burning sensation from the chilli.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Poured a clear amber colour with no head. Moderate to high carbonation. Aroma strongly of chilli, nothing else. Tasted very chilli from lips to tongue. Light body. Long spicy chilli finish. As a beer it isn�t, as a chilli flavoured drink it is. Best to share.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Clear and pale like xxxx, vb tooheys etc. Very little aroma of beer at all. Slight bitterness and a little bit of sweetness. There is chilli heat and taste there after the initial mouthful. Average carbonation and a lingering sting on the lips. Kind of a sting like aftershave. Something unusual but not for my fridge. 10.2.12 This one has the red chilli in the bottle and HOT on the label. Insanely hot taste, chilli seed in the aroma in what i think is a plain lager base. Maybe Silly beer.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;I was really enjoying this breweries new range of beers untill I tried this. I was under the mistaken impression that this beer had under gone a revamp - I was wrong. This beer is little more than junk. It is nothing more than a carrier of heat.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Tasted 15/10/2006. 330ml bottle from the brewery. Looks like the bitter with a hot sensation on the nose and slightly reminiscent of post-aspargus pee. Lightweight but nicely carbonated. Quite hot in the mouth. Lingers. I see the potential in the chilli but this one doesn�t have the body and malt sweetness to pull it off. A little more-ish in the right environment (i.e. when you�re having a laugh) but not all that enjoyable.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Passable. My bottle seemed a little undercarbed. Just a little sweet to begin and light heat in the back of the throat at the finish. Different, not bad but nothing to write home about.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Sweet spicy malt aroma. Clear red amber colour with no head or lacing. Sweet chilli flavour. Flat palate.
Sunshine Coast Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;9 Feb 06 - Sweet spicy malt aroma with some stale notes. Light cloudy amber colour, with poor head and lacing. Big chilli sweet flavour. Tangy spicy back of the throat aftertaste. Overall - A bit harsh, but not badly done for a chilli beer.
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;On tap at Sunshine Coast, pours a hazy blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of fresh ginger and residual sugars. Flavour is light and easy, with fresh ginger and medium sweetness. Easy to drink and pleasant. Decent.
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Bottle from Archive Bar Brisbane (June 2014). Cloudy pale gold, a really nice ginger beer.
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;"Poured a cloudy light golden yellow colour with a very thin white bubble head that did not lace. Aroma strongly of ginger. Taste of ""earthy"" ginger which detracts from the drink. Light body. Long smooth finish with a ginger tingle. Refreshing!"
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;I quite enjoyed this - ginger beer that will get ya drunk (slowly)! Quite sweet with predominant ginger. Would be great on a hot summers day.
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;330ml bottle. Extremely pale and thin looking with a few soapy dishwater bubbles floating on top. Strong aroma of ginger that hides any any aromas. Pleaseant bensough ginger flavour that would be refreshing on a hot day.
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;"Tasted 05/10/2006. 33oml bottle from the brewery. Unbelievably pale, the palest ""beer"" I�ve ever seen. Looks like dirty water. White airy foam disappears quickly. Lots of ginger on the nose, plus a little sugar. Hot ginger flavour with a sugary sweetness that doesn�t quite balance. More of a ginger beer than a beer. No hops or malt profile. As a Ginger Beer it is ok but as a beer I�d like to see some malt, please!"
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;"Tough to call this a beer but I note from the label it was ""brewed"" in the traditional sense. Cloudy dull gold like a wheat beer. Sweet, ginger beer nose, just like the soft version. Again just like a softy in the mouth; sweet, fizzy, tough to pick any alcohol traits. Realistically this is an R2D. Pass."
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Yellow in colouration with light head a little sedimentation in bottle. Smells of pineapple and a little limeyness. Tastes again of pineapple, rancid pineapple. Slight ginger and citrus. Aftertaste of browning pineapple.
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Probably the best alcoholic ginger beer I've had, which is saying so little it's ridiculous. Very pale, no head. Smells pretty decent - like fresh ginger with a bit of funk. Not overly sweet, but still sweet, flavour lacking ginger character and with more yeasty funk. Not terrible but not recommended.
Sunshine Coast Ginger Kegs;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;I like it for no other reason than it's a nice alternative to lager on a summer day and i like ginger beer, regenerative effects are good, but not much better than an alcoholic version of bundy ginger beer.
Oxford Ruby;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Oxford Brewery (Australia);nice floral, hop and sweet fruit aromas. amber red with rose hue colouration. a little wheat character with winey dark fruit and berry flavours dominating.
Oxford Ruby;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Not bad. Almost a milkier lamer version of Rodenbach with a passionfuit callipo dipped in there. A bit lame.
Oxford Ruby;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Oxford Brewery (Australia);i'm a bit insulted that duff can compare this to my homebrew cherry beer but i guess there aren't too many other australian cherry beers to use as a point of reference. deep red colour with some lactic sourness. finish reminds me of cherry yoghurt
Oxford Ruby;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Duff must have read my notes. Cherry cordial nose, good colour. Cherry flavour dominates as it should but the body is too thin. Sweet dry finish. Nothing outstanding but quite ok.
Oxford Ruby;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Reminded me of Motelpogos cherry beer, but perhaps not as good. Tart at first with a dry finish, the cherries are there, but watered down a bit. A bit simple and thin, i tasted some cardboard or something aswell.
Oxford Cloudy;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Cloudy? Yes it is. Very hefe looking and the nose backs it up as well. A great deal of cloves and some dried orange a la the big Hoe. Not as refined or refreshing however.
Oxford Cloudy;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oxford Brewery (Australia);nothing much to add to what everyone else said, nothing special, it's basicly sub homebrew standard.
Oxford Cloudy;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oxford Brewery (Australia);nfob03. it is cloudy and has a decent creamy head. it's a hefeweizen with no subtlety, some curacao thrown in because one of the brewers tried hoegaarden once. and some infection in there preventing it from being an easy swigger
Oxford Cloudy;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Rerate: On tap. Good lingering head, cloudy body. Much more cloves and banans in the nose than last time.Slightly thin body. Not a bad effort compaired to my last tasting. Perhaps the keg at NFOB was old/mistreated.
Oxford Cloudy;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oxford Brewery (Australia);On tap at the Brisbane Festival of Beers. Slight infection in this beer because they forgot to clean their coopers homebrew bucket. Some orange rind thrown in out of obligation to because they read on the internet that some wheat beers got that. I agree with duff... too fizzy...
Oxford Cloudy;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Pretty light in all german wheat departments, lightly tart, lightly clovey, lightly yeasty. Thin texture, with a classic Aussie fizz finish. Needs more body and flavour.
Oxford 152;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);The ABV seems to be around the Queensland standrd for midstrength beers. At east they don�t have as big a market for pussy ligt beers but really there is so little difference. Light in colour, low in nose, big on fizz and.......... let�s describe another Aussie pale lager.
Oxford 152;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);On tap at Oxford pub. Well its a mid strength lager. Nothing exciting but it is drinkable.
Oxford 152;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);nfob03. i was the moron who didn't check the commercial description of this at the beer festival and ended up buying a midstrength lager. reasonably smooth for its type - i didn't hate it that much
Oxford 152;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);"On tap at the Brisbane Festival of Beers. Foul. What the fuck? Like XXXX but not with just a hint of cat piss; this shit takes it to the foreground baby. Bring it."
Oxford 152;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Very bland lager, almost tastes like water, but i guess its kind of innofensive because it does taste like water. Pretty much a typical mid-strength lager. Mid-strengths seem to be popular in Queensland, more so than in Sydney anyway.
Gold Coast Honey Pale Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Gold Coast Brewery;Tawny pale brown body with a little white head. Honey is noticeable in the taste but not the aroma. Creamy taste from the nitro gives it an extra point or two, but I�ll deduct one for the sweetness which I didn�t like.
Gold Coast Honey Pale Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Gold Coast Brewery;amber, with a thick creamy nitro head. dark honey and pineapple in aroma. sweet cloying honey and lightly kilned malt grainyness, bready yeast flavour with some drying bitterness.
Gold Coast Honey Pale Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Gold Coast Brewery;First of all, this beer is much improved over the crap they were selling at NFOB 2003. honey and slight cidery notes. dark cola colour with creamy nitro head. honey and cascade hops dominant in the flavour. smooth, creamy nitro enhanced body, slightly drying. very nice sessional.
Gold Coast Honey Pale Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Gold Coast Brewery;Clover honey aroma, flavour of tap water, nil body. Boring as an old mans anecdote.
Gold Coast Honey Pale Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Gold Coast Brewery;Here it is everyone! The world's worst beer. Some dude forgot to clean his home brew bucket, it got real infected early on, so he threw some dettol in there. The joke's on me for buying it.
Gold Coast Honey Pale Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Gold Coast Brewery;nfobo3. probably the worst beer of our aussie national beer festival. just tasted of generic mat extract and no frills honey. zero aroma. maybe we don't need a hybrid of irish and scottish pale ales. we were chucking our dregs in a cup all night and even though there was some hot chili eer and some dark beers in there, the dregs cup just tasted of the cheap honey in this. still drank it anyway
Gold Coast Honey Pale Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Gold Coast Brewery;This is some seriously screwed up stuff. Sweet, slightly syruppy home brand honey, burnt sugar. Lots of chlorine in there aswell, not good at all.
Gold Coast Queensland Bitter;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;Can. Gold pour. Dry taste of hops with some caramel. Lawnmower beer. No head. Bland
Gold Coast Queensland Bitter;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;Honey gold colour with no head. Crisp dry taste of hops with a touch of caramel. This wasn�t the worst beer there but not far from it.
Gold Coast Queensland Bitter;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;"I was offended. Not as bad as their honey one though so I'm gonna give it 0.6 so I still have somewhere to go. Cleary an infection had been introduced to this ""beer""."
Gold Coast Queensland Bitter;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;i have to agree with duff's review here. had a nagging vomit taste that was magnified by the blandness of the rest of it
Gold Coast Queensland Bitter;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;Outback and Geelong Breweries imediately came to mind when I sipped this crap. Awful pride of ringwood flavour, chlorine, tin, vomit, sooooooo bad. Beer can't get any worse this tripe.
Kellys Lager;Key West, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kellys Caribbean Bar & Grill & Brewery;Had on tap at Kelly's on 9-17-03. This was their new beer. They had just brewed it a day before. Golden body with a decent sweetened/malted nose. The taste was similar but had some interesting fruit notes. Maybe banana or grape. Not sure if these were intended, but it broke up the plainness. Nice smooth finish. Decent beer.
Gold Coast Lifesaver Lager;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;Light copper pale colour with very little head. Thats about all you can notice in this beer, the flavour and aroma are just not there.
Gold Coast Lifesaver Lager;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;fruity, cidery aroma. light golden, dishwater head. light estery, wet blanket bland flowery hop. thin and dry palate. very bland and bad.
Gold Coast Lifesaver Lager;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;terrible pale lager with an old dishwater head, soapy flavour dominating anything that may have been good.
Gold Coast Lifesaver Lager;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;Absolutely nothing. What a stupid nothing beer. This was nothing at all. Don't joke about the saaz buttheads.
Gold Coast Lifesaver Lager;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;nfob03. i'm glad i wasn't the only one who couldn't notice the saaz hops. as with many of the beers at the national festival of beers, the commercial description does read pretty ridiculously. tasted pretty fresh, golden, soggy rather than crisp
Gold Coast Lifesaver Lager;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;"Served ice cold, saaz hops? didn't taste them. Really bland and fizzy crappy stuff. Isn't ""lengthy aging"", as they say above in the description, called lagering? I think they're just trying to make it sound fancy."
Oxford Premium;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Bottled sample from WBC2006. Pours a cleary light amber with a large white head. Light body with medium carbonation. There�s a cardboardy/earthy quality to the nose and the taste.
Oxford Premium;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Alarm bells sound at the mention of that �p� word. We all know that this term is used when the brewrs want to be all grown up and loved like Crown lager. Well, if you asked me I would say that said Crownie lovers would be quite at home with this one. As expected, nothing more.
Oxford Premium;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);On tap at Oxford. I�m seriously starting to avoid beers with the word Premium attached. Some noble hops in the nose, standard lager appearance. Quite thin with a nothing finish. A bit boring.
Oxford Premium;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Never expect much from something labelled premium, because it's always thin, watery, yellow, lagerish crud. In this particular instance it seems to have been hopped with common garden ivy and cardboard.
Oxford Premium;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Yet again a dumb Aussie swigger. How dumb. Not sure what to say. I'm getting the feeling that going through the brisbane beer festival beers is something like describing different shades of off white.
Oxford Premium;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);Pale yellow in colour. Couldn't taste much at all, pretty watery and lame. Nothing too offensive, just overtly bland.
Oxford Premium;Bulimba, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oxford Brewery (Australia);nfob03. we were running out of things to taste by this stage. reasonable as far as bland lagers go, no pride of ringwood to really ruin things
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Brown Ale;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Brown Ale;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Dark brown, almost no head. Sugary, burnt buiscuity aroma with a slight unpleasantness. flavour is roasted buiscuity malt and slightly fruity. Dry and watery mouthfeel
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Brown Ale;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Brown Ale;Sunshine Coast Brewery;OK, I just took a poorly gaurded bottle of this stuff from the stall at the nfob because the dude manning it was too off his face on udl. SOme brown sugar and not enough hops. A bit of a rip off.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Extra Stout;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Stout;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Tasted 05/10/2006. 330ml bottle from the brewery. Near black. Firm lasting light tan head rides all the way down the glass. Very roasty, bordering on burnt, with a hint of coffee and malt sweetness. A little overly roasty in the mouth, leaving it dry and very lightweight. Lingering burnt toast flavour. Would have liked to see the crystal show itself a little more to add a balancing sweetness. Lovely soft carbonation, as do all the beers from this brewery.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Extra Stout;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Stout;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Poured from the bottle, the head was a non event, hardly got a look in. The aroma is roasty, the flavour is a big whack of roasted barley balnced with a slight sweetness and with a hint of chocolate malt. I didn�t find it thin, having more body than a Guiness Foreign Extra stout, but without the mellow complexity of a Coopers Foriegn Extra stout. With a bit of age this would a good stout.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Extra Stout;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Stout;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Maybe i got a dodgy version of this, it was awful. Looks nice enough, stouty, dark with brownish head. Aroma is of burnt biscuits and sugar, unpleasant. Flavour is a Sickly sweet burnt overwhelming flavour. place 20ml of water + 100ml sugar, cook in HOT oven for 13 hours. I will retaste this someday
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Extra Stout;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Stout;Sunshine Coast Brewery;A nice mild stout, had a little banana on the nose, tarry flavour with robust bitterness and a medium palate... nice.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Extra Stout;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Stout;Sunshine Coast Brewery;I want to join motel in saying thanks to duff for getting hold on one of these. Very bitter. A little cough syruppy. Maybe dumb. Almost smooth if not for tonsil problems. SOme dark appeal like strawberries.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Extra Stout;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Stout;Sunshine Coast Brewery;thanks for honestly procuring this one, duff. way better than the other sunshine coast beers. some chocolate and then burnt mandarin bitterness. not a full and chunky stout, instead sweet and roasty with some vegemite in the aroma which i never liked the smell of before
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Extra Stout;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Stout;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Didn't mind this too much. Slightly thin mouthfeel, sweet chocolate at the start black and roasted flavour.Bitter roasty finish, some tarryness in their aswell,a touch vegemitey and some mandarin/citrus at the end. A touch on the thin side, but pretty tasty.
Port Halling Middle Earth Mild;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Mild Ale;Port Halling (now Main St Alehouse);Dark brown, little head. Very creamy taste, with a body a little bigger than Guinness. Certainly a mild in all aspects. Like drinking frothy milk with sugar and a little alcohol. Wierd stuff.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;I was really glad to see, upon arriving at Ratebeer, that my impressions of the beer were not out of line with the general trend. I didn�t expect a beer from Central Waters to be so off. Not a particularly brown among brown ales, and I was struck by the sourness of the beer. There�s a dominant caramel note but it is otherwise quite unidimensional.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Sampled from 12-oz bottle and shared by oetiii in Antigo, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear coppery brown amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind a thin film top and ring. Aroma of lightly roasted dark caramel malt, some skoniness with a touch of roasted hazelnuts and toffee. Taste is a little oxidized with a dry caramel malt and acidic hop flavors with plenty of carbonation. Finish is slightly metallic with a dark roasted malt aftertaste. This bottle was well past its prime and pull date. At least I can say I tried this product.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;12oz bottle-A hazy very light brown with a small ring for a head . Aroma of a little malt but pretty much nothing. Taste of nothing with a little sourness. May be an old bottle but if it is not a very weak brown.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;A one-dimensional brown beer--it�s molasses you know--in the aroma, inthe taste...nicely done for molasses, dominating the taste of the brown. An attempt at appropriate carbonation. There is the brown colour, and good thick foam lace. Thank you JPM30.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Found this one bottled in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Deep reddish brown pour with a light, fluffy white head and a very off nose, I almost thought it was skunky, smelled sour. Tasted fine, though. Pleasantly hoppy with some baked bread, coconut and apple. Finished a bit watery, but not bad. I don�t know if I�d have more of it but it wasn�t terrible.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;clear brownish copperish pour lots of visable carbonation and a full off white head. Not much of an aroma at all. Palate is light and smooth fairly well coated. Flavor is nutty full of almond and carmel and hazlenut. Flavor is decent, but this isn�t much of a beer.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;I haven�t had many brown ales and this was least favorite. No nutty taste. Bit watery and bland. Appeal went down hill as I drank it.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;A carmelish, sweet aroma. Darkish brown appearance. More caramel in the first taste. Somewhat fizzy palate. After the initial taste test, I tended to begin liking the beer a little more, but it didn�t set off any fireworks.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Medium amber with weak, fleeting beige head. Faint hoppy aroma with some malt notes. Weak and watery. Slight malt flavor that doesn�t last past the swallow. A dull, boring beer.
Central Waters Junctown Brown;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Central Waters Brewing Co.;12 oz bottle Bronze transparent body with a tan head. Hints of brown sugar, apple cider, peanut butter and a rainy fall day. Tastes like oaked peanuts, hazelnuts, iced tea and toffee. The iced tea flavor becomes more apparent the longer you drink this. After a while, a sweet sticky flavor begins to linger in the back of the throat. Until then, it was mildly enjoyable and one I might have considered trying again. At that point, it became obvious this was a fairly average beer - better than offerings from the macrobrewers but not on par with offerings from many other microbreweries.
Per�a Carter 3.8 %;Lublin, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;Can. A pretty well made pils, concerning Polish standards - slight bitterness and hops flavour. Seems like it�s a cheaper version of Perla Chmielowa, but it�s an alright brew, especially considering the price.
Konstancin Zdrojowe Specjal;Konstancin - Jeziorna, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Konstancin (Browar Gontyniec);very simple label, 4 kinds of malt it says, niice froth, aroma very malty and natural, quite good feeling on palate, not too oily, not too watery, taste is flat though, some bitterness at finish, seems natural - I mean it,
Konstancin Bardzo Mocny;Konstancin - Jeziorna, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Konstancin (Browar Gontyniec);"Pretty effervescent at first, head lasts in a very little rim. Medium golden in color. Sharp harsh grainy aroma, corn/DMS. A little field-like. Favor is also sharp and full of fusels, with genuine bread elements and even a peppery hop bite. Moderate bitterness. OK for half a bottle; we�ll see how it warms up."
Konstancin Bardzo Mocny;Konstancin - Jeziorna, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Konstancin (Browar Gontyniec);Bottle. Creamy off-white good mostly lasting head. DArk yellow colour. Moderate malty and light hoppy aroma. Moderate bitter flavor. Average moderate bitter finish. Oily palate and a little alcoholic.

Konstancin Bardzo Mocny;Konstancin - Jeziorna, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Konstancin (Browar Gontyniec);Bottled. A nut-brown beer with a huge orangey head. The aroma has notes of caramel, malt, and alcohol as well as lighter notes of smoke. The flavor is sweet wtih notes of alcohol, unfermented sugar, caramel, nuts, and some malt.
Konstancin Bardzo Mocny;Konstancin - Jeziorna, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Konstancin (Browar Gontyniec);(Bottled) Golden color with a small head. Sweetish, sourish aroma. Sweet, sugary and fruity flavor. Medium-bodied, sweet and sugary palate. Quite typical strong annd sweet lager, but not among the worst.
Imielin Piwo Jasne;Imielin, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Imielin;Der Schaum dieses Billig Bieres ist schnell weg. Es riecht kondensmilch-karamellig, beim trinken ist dies nur noch ein Nebengeschmack.Ein paar schlucke kann man trinken, aber das es nach einer Milchs��igkeit schmeckt kann doch nicht normal sein, sp�ter ist es dann garnicht mehr trinkbar. Test vom 30.11.2009, Gebinde: Dose Noten: 6,4,3,2,4,6 - 4,55
Imielin Piwo Jasne;Imielin, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Imielin;Can. Frothy white good mostly lasting head. Pale greenisch yellow colour. Bready ugly aroma and flavor. Light sweet and almost no bitterness. Short unpleasent finish. Watery palate. Really bad.
Imielin Piwo Jasne;Imielin, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Imielin;Can. Medium head with medium duration. Color is pale yellow. Aroma and taste are bready malt and surprisingly watery. Quite a disappointment.
Imielin Piwo Jasne;Imielin, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Imielin;Rated:25.04.2007 Can, 500 ml Pours very bright gold, almost yellow, some corny accents in body colour, head is quite huge initially, body is not prefectly clear. Head quickle decreases to a minimum, body carboantion is weak, as it goes up to create the head. Aroma is very gentle, fresh malt, slightly bitter and rubby hoppiness. Flavour is similar to aroma, light refreshing beer, but taste is somehow not well pronounced but it�s still a premium lager. Finish feel is short.
Imielin Piwo Jasne;Imielin, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Imielin;Clean gold with solid white top . Aroma of freshly mashed malt , light rye bread overlapping notes . Medium bodied with more of malty , bread like accents . Good bitter finish . Interesting beer . Interesting combination .
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;Draft sampler pours black with a tan head. Aroma of chocolate, coffee and grains. Taste is chocolate and grain.
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;"""at the pub on nitro, but it would be good either way. this way left it a little thin-but smooth, and still had enough roasted malt and chocolatey flavor to go around. overall, a solid effort!"""
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. The body was black with a light tan head. The aroma was malty with some coffee and milk chocolate. The taste was strong coffee with some dark chocolate. A lightly bitter roasted finish.
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;Draft sample at Upstream Old Market. Poured clear dark brown color with a large creamy off-white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate roasted coffee and chocolate aroma. Medium body with a dry smooth texture. Medium dark chocolate roasted flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where more than met.
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours black with a creamy tan head. Roasted malt, chocolate and coffee blend together in a pleasant aroma. Light to medium bodied, fairly thin and nitro-slick with a bitter roasted finish. Roasted malt, coffee and a touch of cocoa combine into a decent stout. It�s a bit too thin for my tastes, but it�s a fairly solid stout.
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;Cask: Pours oily black with a nice lacey head. Aroma of java and smokey roast. Flavor is also smokey with some chocolate sweetness and a hint of dark fruit. Finish was nice and long and stout had nice full body. Great beer.. surprised it hasn�t received higher ratings.
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;Enjoyed this beer on cask, and that is a KEY portion to this rating...I will currently rate based almost solely on the cask conditioned version, and when I have a full pint of it on tap, I�ll blend the ratings On Cask: Pours black...very thin tan head. Aroma is very sweet and very well done...chocolate, sweet coffee, caramel malts and a milky feel to it. Flavor is milk chocolate, coffee (though not heavily roasted), milk, light accents of oatmeal, and chewy malts. Palate is damn near incredible, though I can�t give this a perfect score in this category as I have had the beer on tap in the past and it wasn�t as smooth...the cask conditioning just brings out the best in this beer, and the flavor lasts long after the drink is over...Upstream MUST have improved their brewing standards on this stout, as I can�t see how some of the early �sub 2.2� ratings ever happened otherwise!
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;Cask Conditioned Tap @ brewpub: This one is waaay better than the regular Blackstone. It has all of the other elements - choco-coffee aroma and taste, but everything is smoother and softer. Way more seductive. Earlier Rating: 10/10/2007 Total Score: 3.2 Tap @ brewpub: Black with a light brown head. The feel is slick like an oatmeal stout. Choco-coffee aroma with dominant espresso and coffee notes in the flavor. I liked the bitter trailer on the back end.
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;Another random rating I found from well over a year ago. Opaque with a tan head that�s here to stay. Chocolate and coffee nose. Oily. Roasted coffee. Almost nohops to speak of. Sweet malts. chocolate and caramel. Still has a great layer of head. Grainy.
Upstream Blackstone Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upstream Brewing Company;This is a solid stout, good roasted body and flavor. Nice and malty, good bitterness. Served a little too cold, but got better as it warmed up. Minimal head, but overall a decent effort.

Citrus, berry, roaste malt aroma with hints of caramel, nut, light doughy yeast esters. Crsip fruity european hop and nutty malt taste. Mild grapfruit bitterness on finish.

In fact it�s a very bitter nutty finish. That late finish is full of hops. 14 This is a lovely example of a gimick-free bitter. Less sweet mash in the aroma, and it would be fantastic.
RCH Steam Festival;Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Cask@Market Porter, Southwark. Yellowish golden colour, small white head.

RCH Steam Festival;Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Cask-conditioned at the Bag O�Nails, Bristol 9/8/07. Chris O�s comments are spot on. A reasonable if undistinguished bitter with a decent balance of hops and malt but nothing to stand out. Ok.
Phylosophe Premium;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;Clear blond coloured beer with small white head and no carbonation. Bit hoppy sweet aroma. Full bit sparkling palate. Finish is rather dry bitter with an overall sweet touch.

Phylosophe Premium;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;Hazy blond color. Quite plain Belgian Ale, a strange bitterness from the yeast, but low bitterness from the hop. Controversial.
Phylosophe Premium;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;A hazy golden ale with a thick white head. A rather surprising lemon and musk aroma, milkey, with vanilla notes. In mouth, the vanilla comes out much more, with a good malt base, light genever notes, a bit short in mouth. Gift from Kasta (i think), May 2005. BB 2006.
Phylosophe Premium;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;(Bottled) Opaque orange color with a smallish, lasting head. Slightly sweet, mild and fruity aroma with some yeast. Very fruity, slightly sweet-malty flavor with lemon hints. Medium-bodied, smooth-carbonated palate. A quite pleasant, but easily forgettable brew.
Phylosophe Premium;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;Soapy aroma with a hint of grapefruit. Hoppy, but especially creamy flavor with citrus and a touch of vanilla. Good enough, but nothing to get excited about.
Phylosophe Premium;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;Bottled. Purchased at Delirium Cafe. Golden blond. Medium white head. Aroma is nicely hopped and floral with yeast notes and some graininess. taste is hoppy with more flowery parts and grains along with lightly sweetened malt notes. Body is crisp but has a lively carbonation feel to it. Finishes dry with hops, more grains and a hint of fruit.
Phylosophe Premium;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;"Light-golden, very slight haze; good very light-yellow head. Nose: creamy, cocosmilk, spicey, bit of citrus. Buttery taste, creamy, diacetyl, very much less dry than the nose would have me believed. Doesn�t give the impression, but is quite carbonated. In the aftertaste, the, probably aimed at, dryness gradually wins out. I do not care for diacetyl generally speaking; Would it not have been present here, however, virtually nothing would have been... And I wonder why the label states only that Phylosphale firm distributes the beer - rather than brewing it."
Phylosophe Premium;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;Blond beer with a medium somewhat creamy head. Light floral aroma with hints of citrus and yeast. Lively, light bitter taste with a light sour streak. Dry hoppy aftertaste. A nice beer.

Smell is sweet, some pzrfumysweetener i�m not all to familiar with, as well as malts. Bit yeasty as well. Taste is likewise. Mild bitterness, but mostly the sweetness is in the picture. Aromatic, and a showcase of Balance. Aftertaste still has the aromatic sweetness, touch of sugar (barely) and Lovely hops. Bit metallic, but it Fits in perfectly.

Four Peaks Sunbru K�lsch;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Sampled at GTBF 2006 as Dog Days?: Very pale golden, foamy white head. No aroma. Grainy light base, light citric counter. Light body. Forgettable.
Four Peaks Sunbru K�lsch;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft at NY pizza dept. Ice friggen cold in a frosty pint glass. Nearly clear yellow with the faintest haze. Aroma and flavor are so crisp and pure with a hint of malt, yeast, and light bitterness. Certainly swayed by the 109 temp out and the beautiful cold beer in front of me, but I love it.
Four Peaks Sunbru K�lsch;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at Four Peaks in Tempe, pours a clear blonde with a small white head.

Smell: Roasted malt aroma with notes of chocolate, rolled oats, cola, licorice, and cold coffee. Taste: Malty mix of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted barley, and a pipin� hot bowl of morningtime oatmeal. Small splash of root beer. There�s a slight roasty bitterness to balance the sweetness, but no real hop flavors present. Taste of thinned out coffee on the finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Drinkability: Fairly good, certainly quite drinkable Oatmeal Stout.
Copper Creek Oatmeal Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout;Copper Creek Brewing Company;On tap and cask. Poured a nice dark brown, with a big tan head.

Copper Creek Oatmeal Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout;Copper Creek Brewing Company;draught. Pours a rich obvious ruby with the pretty nitrogen-induced show. Smells great: very nutty, oaty, chocolatey with fresh brewed coffee aroma. The mouthfeel is silky and invites the flavor of an almond latte. Some mocha notes are apparent in the finish and toasty oats are obvious throughout. I really enjoyed this stuff. [September 30, 2008] Nitrogen pour. This is a very near black beer with ruby glints. The nitrogen provides for a picturesque glass fill. The aroma is mild with hints of dark chocolate, smoke, toasted oats, and light coffee. Mouthfeel is silky and, along with suggestions of bitter chocolate, heavy bittersweetness, milk, toasted nuts, and smoke (not meat), makes for a very, very drinkable beer.
Copper Creek Oatmeal Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout;Copper Creek Brewing Company;2005 GCBC. Nearly opaque brown pour with a pretty big foamy head. Roasty chcoclate aroma with some amount of coffee as well. Similar flavors - a good dose of roasty chocolate, some coffee, and a small smattering of dark fruit. I was also expecting the body to be a little creamier, but overall a good beer.
Copper Creek Oatmeal Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout;Copper Creek Brewing Company;On tap at the 2005 GCBC: Nearly opaque very dark brown pour has a thick dense creamy tan head. Sweet, toasty and dark chocolatey aroma. Starts with a semi-sweet malty flavor thinning some toward the lightly roasted finish. A nice and drinkable oatmeal stout, but could use some more body.
Copper Creek Oatmeal Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout;Copper Creek Brewing Company;2005 GCBC. Very dark brown with a tan creamy head. Big coffee aroma with chocolate underneath. Roasty flavors but lacking a little compared to the big aroma. Crisp mouthfeel but expected it to be creamy since it was an oatmeal stout. Otherwise another fine job.
Copper Creek Kolsch;Athens, Georgia, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden yellow on tap with fluffy white head that leaves moderate lace.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. The carbonation goes beyond simply being crisp to being just a tad too effervescent.

Copper Creek Kolsch;Athens, Georgia, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Copper Creek Brewing Company;I never really liked this beer. I might be spoiled because Ive been to Koln, Germany, the place where Kolsch was invented. This beer to me smells like egg and dosent taste better. It comes on tap every now and then, hopefully the brewer will get it right one of these days.
Copper Creek Kolsch;Athens, Georgia, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Copper Creek Brewing Company;draught. Pours a copper hue which matches the pennies in the bartop well. Not much aroma on this, just some malt and faint sourness. This is thin, but refreshing: some apple peel and faint woody hops are there. The finish has barely noticable acidity. meh.
Copper Creek Kolsch;Athens, Georgia, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Wasn�t bad by any means, but didn�t seem to compare to the other beers on tap.

Eittinger Lagerbier;Eitting, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Eittinger Fischer Br�u;"Oakes here must have gotten one of the ""bad cases"" of this beer. I know it as one of my absolute favourite ""all-round"" beers; it is fresh, but not too bitter, and it has a hint of sweetness that makes it very easy to drink yet doesn�t take away any of its flexibility. Perfect alone, works well with food."
Eittinger Lagerbier;Eitting, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Eittinger Fischer Br�u;Keg, GBBF2003. Hazy gold, good fluffy white head and low condition. Good sweet malt and hop aroma, slight tangy apple and hop flavours and a delicate hop bitter finish.

Four Peaks Hop Knot IPA;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);"After a few tastes, and deciding on what to say in my review, I was quite surprised this was rated so highly. 16oz can marked as best by 02/20/2020, so it's not terribly old (though, I prefer IPAs that are less than 3 months old). I get very little citrus, mostly piney hops with bitterness that isn't balanced well by the malt. It's OK, but not something I want to try again. Perhaps I'll try if I find a more recent canning. That's why I prefer a ""canned on date"" vs. a ""best by"" date."
Four Peaks Hop Knot IPA;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Taps clear topaz with a nice ivory head that leaves generous lacing. Aroma provides resiny hops, zesty malt and a citrus hint. Flavor has resiny hops, sweet citrus and tropical notes plus more thsn a hint of stone fruit, zesty raw malt. Texture gives firm body and peppy fizz. Hop this knot!
Four Peaks Hop Knot IPA;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft at PHX location. Medium golden, small thin head leaves film across the glass. Lazy carbonation, heavy weight. The rest is pretty much standard IPA, actually kind of mild. Not great, but better than most airport options.
Four Peaks Hop Knot IPA;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draught @ T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas. Smooth, crisp and hoppy with some grass, pine and citrusy notes. Okay, quite generic west coast IPA.
Four Peaks Hop Knot IPA;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Purchase a six pack of bottles from my local liquor store. Thin tan head on top of a hazy golden body. The smell is subtle maybe because of a poor pour? It doesn't seem as happy as other ipas I've had in the past. There is that IPA thing it does on pallet though. Just another average run-of-the-mill IPA at this point. I can't come up with another reason to purchase this again.
Four Peaks Hop Knot IPA;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Hazy, thick head, light tan. Piney, slightly grapefruity hop. Bitter, nice mellow orangey note. Touch of caramel.

Rio Salado Witty Witbier;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rio Salado Brewing Company;This is a pretty standard Wit beer. It is lightly sour and they did the coriander to just the right amount (it was not overdone at all). There is perhaps a hint of orange flavor in the finish. This is a light dry refreshing example.

Wye Valley Reapers Ale;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wye Valley Brewery;A dark orange or light amber beer with a bubbly disappearing head. The aroma is slightly sweet - too light for my liking. The flavor is a funny sweet malty caramel mixed with bitter hops. Which makes it end on a good bitterness. All in all it tastes a little weird - I wonder if it is the Wye Valley yeast that has a role in it?
Mountain Crest Jacks All American Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;355ml can pours a pale straw color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Aroma is grainy and grassy with hints of rotten fruit. Taste is grainy and grassy with a metallic and chemical finish. Just a terrible tasting experience and not worth saying anymore.
Mountain Crest Jacks All American Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Gold brew that has waaaaay to much junk floating around in it, poured a nice thick white crown, little retension, some spotty lacing. Aroma is acceptable, just too sweet - barley, fake sour apple, weak hops. Boring! Taste is not bad until it gets to the back of your tongue. Starts with a crummy bitterness, lame malts. Gets worse the slower you drink it. Now it�s quite sour. Mouthfeel is so-so when quite cold but then the flavours show up and ruin the whole thing - not that anyone could expect a thing from this stuff. Thin, too sour, and by the end there is a horrid after taste that will not go away. Cold, I�d give it a 2.3ish, warmer, I�d give it less than 1.8. I drank most of it on the warmer side. I should spit on this can on principle. I�ll say that when cold it�s above average low quality swill.
Mountain Crest Jacks All American Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;A lawnmowing-style of beer that I had on the appropriate occasion after mowing the lawn for the first time this spring. I think I paid a buck for this single can. It is the poorest investment I have ever made. This beer goes beyond bland and is actually aweful. Very unpleasant wet dishrag wet dog aroma, harsh corny flavour with an odd astringent finish that was just weird. I dumped it after 4 sips. This brewer is absolutely astonishing in its ability to market pure shit-in-a-can north of the border. They must be surviving on price point, because it sure isn�t product quality.
Mountain Crest Jacks All American Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;355ml can. Pale gold, small sized, but lasting white head.

Mountain Crest Jacks All American Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Sickly sweet malt aroma combined with rubbery skunky stench. Piss yellow with thin head. Watery, thin flavour with slight sweet finish. At $1 a beer a tad overpriced.
Mountain Crest Jacks All American Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;341 ml can.

Magic Hat Mother Lager;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);lighter body and hoppy. caustic and chalky. finish is dull and flavor is lacking.
Magic Hat Mother Lager;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Basic Euro trash taste. I'm shocked a American brewery nailed the taste but improved on it(barely). It still sucked. If I'm buying European I'm getting German, Belgian (minus Stella), and English. If I want a Euro lager I'll usually to right to a German brew, or a Polish Zywiecs if I sport it. No reason to get this. American corn lager has better taste than this Euro shite. If you like this style, fine. That's your opinion. But I'd much rather have a Coors or a PBR.
Magic Hat Mother Lager;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);I rather like this stuff. It's mild but fresh tasting. A tinge of citrus gives an American craft take on a cheapo Euro lager. It's good and crisp w/ tons of carbonation and you can drink the hell out of it. There is even a nice touch of cookie dough malt to underpin all of it. I'm into it.
Magic Hat Mother Lager;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Pours like nice lager with a good head. Head stays around awhile. Good bubbly sensations greet the palate. A little bitter, like an apa, but then tits true premium lager feel starts to come thru. Mellows out in the end but there is almost a sharp pilsner hop thing happening as teh session comes to a conclusion. Yes, something between a sharper apa and pilsner. Fihishes much stronger than the 4.8 listed here. Good craft brew.
Magic Hat Mother Lager;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Taste: Crisp yet still malty smooth, bold finish.

Zillertal Pils;Zell am Ziller, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Zillertal;It is not the best pils that I have tried in my life, average but you don't have to expect something crazy. This beer is coming from one supermarket from Innsbruck train station, at october 2018. The body is yellow and clear, average carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste is herbal, some perle hop, dry malt,a bit metalic and rough, wateryat.

Zillertal M�rzen;Zell am Ziller, Austria;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Zillertal;I have drunk this beer, in october 2018, at the zoo, at Innsbruck. The day was really beautiful, before the rain coming the next day. In my point of view, it is a decent lager, all the qualities that you have to expect from this kind of beer. The color is gold and clear, average carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste is malty, grainy and bready, hop for this kind of beer, perfectly refreshing at the draft.
Zillertal M�rzen;Zell am Ziller, Austria;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Zillertal;Bottle at 5.1% ABV. Clear gold. Moderate white head. Aroma: grainy malt, spicy hop, light skunk and paper.

Castlemaine XXXX Off The Wood;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I hate XXXX. But the off the wood, when done correctly is something I am happy to drink. Don�t go looking for wood flavour, that isn�t the what this is about. It is simply old school brewing storage and serving pale lager. Therefore it is less carbonated (so head doesn�t last, but a great mouth feel), unpasteurised (so a darker brown than the usual forex pale) and has a fuller flavour - particularly because it is not served ice cold. Otherwise it has a XXXX flavour, without the metallic / skunked flavour I often associate with most macro beers. It is the way you always hope XXXX will taste, but doesn�t. Bottom line though, it is a pale lager, so don�t go expecting an abby brew. Other plus is that they don�t charge a premium for it.
Castlemaine XXXX Off The Wood;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Fruity sweet nose. Little carbonation. Slightly sweet taste, dry bitter finish. A little biscuit. Being gravity fed means you�re not hammered into submission by bubbles. An interesting aside, nothing more. Try it if you are in Brisbane.
Castlemaine XXXX Off The Wood;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Cask at Breakfast Creek Hotel, Brisbane. Not much difference to the draught version. Perhaps slightly darker and somewhat fresher than the regular being unpasteurised. No wood aroma or flavour.
Castlemaine XXXX Off The Wood;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Lagers are not much in the looks or aroma department, but I was very favourably impressed by a couple of pints off the wood at the Brekky Creek Hotel last week! Excellent palate and great flavour - quite a change after a week of XXXX Gold out of bottles and the tap.
Castlemaine XXXX Off The Wood;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);It�s not aged in the wood, it�s just packaged in a wooden cask rather than a metal one and sent out to the pub. However there are several advantages over the regular keg version. It�s not pasteurised at the brewery so has a slightly fresher flavour, and is served under gravity rather than being forced out by carbon dioxide. So whilst it isn�t a �real ale� in the British sense, it is slightly cleaner and less fizzy than the normal pub version. I like it and often stop in for one at the Brekkie Creek.
Castlemaine XXXX Off The Wood;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I have to disagree with the past raters on this one.... Aroma was far cleaner and less fruity than the standard XXXX, good clarity and a nice tight head which lasted quite well. Flavour was without that common sugar flavour so prevalent in mainstream XXXX. maybe the brew I tried (at the Breakfast Creek) had spent some more tme on the wood... but it was a nice enough brew.
Castlemaine XXXX Off The Wood;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Couldn't taste the wood, couldn't get excited enough about it to get wood either. Didn't know God pioneered the ageing of beer in wood either. Tastes like XXXX, so it gets the same rating as the other one.

Stone Sawyers Triple;Escondido, California, United States;Tripel;Stone Brewing;A: The beer pours a clear golden orange color with a tall white head. S: Reeks of sugar. Cloying as any beer I�ve smelled with over ripe bananas and spices being the only break from the sugar (not that they really help much). Bubblegum and cotton candy only add to the problem. T: This is so sweet, it�s almost got a grainy texture to it. Sugar, sugar, and more sugar with cotton candy, bubblegum, and overly ripe fruits such as bananas and apples. A strong spice character of clove that is also unpleasant. M: Syrupy with medium carbonation. O: Unenjoyable on all fronts. I know it�s sort of a dick move to bash this beer considering its purpose, but it�s just not good.

Corner Pub American Pale Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Had about a 7 oz glass of this a couple of weeks ago at the corner pub.

Has a watered down feel. Good if you like beer flavored water."

Slab City Milkhouse Stout;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Slab City Brewing;Bottle from hopdog...thanks. Opens with a huge hiss. Pours with a full glass of head and the beer still continues to rush out of the bottle. Yep this one had some infection set in and I decided to rate it based on the fact that this seems to be a common thing with this beer and the fact that once it aired out it was a solid beer. Once it settled out a deep brownish/black beer came out that had hints of ruby red when held to the light. Aroma of tart/sour cherries, some dark chocolate, very fruity along with some hints of coffee and roasted malts. Flavor of the same tart/funky cherries, the fruity esters seemed to hide some of the roasted qualities. The infection that set in on this beer gave it some Jolly Pumpkin like qualities. Not sure that is what the brewer was going for but it still made for an enjoyable beer.
Slab City Milkhouse Stout;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Slab City Brewing;12oz bottle- Either a bad bottle or an old one but way too overcarbonated.

The bubbles look like some sort of soda, then they settle to a nice looking foam head. The smell was simple, but not a whole lot there. The taste seems very carbonated up front, with a hint of fruitiness to it. Overall not a bad brew, just a little different.
Slab City Milkhouse Stout;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Slab City Brewing;Pours black with a medium sized tan head. The aroma is stale tobacco smoke, chocolate, molases and prunes. The flavor is tart, some cherry, chocolate, quite bad. The mouthfeel is very thin with a bit of an astringent and sour finish.
Slab City Milkhouse Stout;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Slab City Brewing;Bottle. I did pour this just a bit rougher than I should�ve, but it was intensely heady. I had foam coming up to the top of my glass and out of the top of the bottle with only a couple of ounces sitting in the pint glass. A long while later I�ve got a black beer with some reds discernable in the light and a rocky, creamy brown head on top. The aroma is quite fruity. There�s a definite sour/tartness, plums, light caramel, nectarine in the nose. Upfront in the mouth is a bittersweet, sour fruitiness much like plums that was most unexpected. I don�t know what to think, really. Coffee and chocolate notes here are minimal, and if I were blindfolded I probably couldn�t even discern that this is a stout. The finish is slightly hoppy. This is really strange and not all too appealing to me, even putting aside its off-style taste.
Slab City Milkhouse Stout;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Slab City Brewing;Unique stout / dark ale hybrid. Pleasing distinctive sour lactic note-- that is no easy trick and perhaps achieved by the well-hopped dryness and ample carbonation. Subtle dark and light chocolate notes. This brew is getting low grades from people who have a preconceived expectation / desire for a traditional stout -- free your mind and your taste buds will follow.
Slab City Milkhouse Stout;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Slab City Brewing;Bottle. Plumb, raison and some sweetness to the nose. Black Body with dark tan head. Flavor had a sweet plumb fruit along with some tartness. Dry tart aftertaste that wasn�t all bad sometime it�s like sweet tart for some witch isn�t good.
Slab City Milkhouse Stout;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Slab City Brewing;Black with a nice brown head. Aroma of roasty malts chocolate and alcohol. Flavor is a rich slightly bitter roasty coffee. Rather thin body and bitter finish.
Slab City Milkhouse Stout;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Slab City Brewing;Deep chestnut with a huge frothy tan head. Roasted malt, coffee, pipe bowl, some chocolate. Body too light for a stout and not enough thickness on the palate. Kind of lacking on the flavor. Too sweet for a dry stout and not sweet enough for a sweet stout. Seems a beer in search of an identity.
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;What a disappointment! I really wanted to like this beer. I thought maybe the sourness of the PA Slab City brews would not translate over to this beer, but I was wrong.
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;Hazed and caramel-orangish-brown in color with a hard lining of grey ice for the head. Aroma revels in maple milk chocolate malted fudge balls with a hint of brown sugared cardboard and melting poppycock. Flavor careens with a citric caramel souffl� bouquet, with lacquered hazelnuts sharing copper kettles. Wholesome carbonation couples with cider on apple walnut corn bread avec caramel drizzle for more appearance that flavor would indicate. Maple oats and bleached pancake syrup swirl around each other in the apple brown sugar crumble finish.
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;Bottled. Poured a nice, clear shade of caramel with a tall cap of creamy beige head. Nose clued me in that this would be sour and ugly in the flavor department... some caramel, but mostly just eye-watering sourness. Flavor was sour as can be... deep down there was some floral bitterness and toasted bready malts... on top and all around was a bracing sourness. Ouch.. stay away from this.
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;12oz bottle. This one was a gusher - poured all over my office floor. Settled into a deep and cloudy amber color. Aromas of what. I can stretch it into a little nuttiness and some dough. Tastes of the same with some fruits. Has a sour aftertastes. My 3rd Slab City beer of the night and my 3rd drain pour in a row (2 of the 3 bottles purchased at different stores).
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;Looks nice enough. Truly copper color with a nice coppery head, that rapidly disappeared. Aroma is flowery, doughy with a sharp edge. Taste is insipid. Sour, diacetyl through the roof....these guys maybe should clean their equipment. Yuck - threw away.
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;From a 12 oz. long neck brown bottle with no bottled/freshness date. Made a decent appearance, poured a clear reddish/golden hued amber with a foamy off-white head that quickly settled into a thin lacing, moderate carbonation. Had a lemony fruity and sour malty nose, traces of caramel and honey nuttiness. A crisp, sourish smooth light medium bodied mouth feel, average drinkability. Big honey and malt taste, a subtle caramel with some nuts thrown in, followed by a sour fruitiness and a dry sour fruity and honey finish. Far from the beat altbier I�ve tried, purchased as a single at Woodman�s, I am wondering if I purchased a bad bottle.
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;Copper body. Beige head. Aroma of soap suds, cheap caramel, tangerine, deodorent. Weak and watery. Flavor was funky, unpleasant.
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;Bottle courtesy of Ughsmash. Dark copper in color nice tan head. Aroma is sour apples and oranges. Flavor is very sweet caramel malt, but with the huge sour kick again. I didn�t rate three or four beers from this brewery, previously, because of the sourness, but now it seems it�s par for the course.
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;Dark copper color wtih no head. Caramel-ish aroma. The taste was just bizzare... pear? Some hop bitterness. No malt. What the fudge is going on here?
Slab City Esker Alt;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Slab City Brewing;dark copper colored body with a light yellow head. The aroma has a hint of oranges and some earthy moss. There is also a very light hint of toffee in the background. The taste has a slightly sour character with some toffee and a little bit of bread crust. There is also some earthy brown sugar. A strange combination of the tartness and sweet malts.
Corner Pub Weiss;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;"Lucky me, I got the last glass of the season of this brew. On draught at the brewpub in Reedsburg, Wisconsin as ""Corner Pub Hefeweizen."" Pours a semi-hazy golden blonde brew with a thin white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and white ring. Some spotty lacing on glass side. Aroma of wheat/multi-grain malt, yeast, some banana esters, cloves and even some lemon zest. No slice of lemon needed for this brew. Taste is light to medium bodied, lightly carbonated with flavors of yeasty malt, some citrus and slight banana flavors. Finish is slightly dry, with a faded banana bread aftertaste. It looks like previous posts may have been rating the former brewmaster�s Weiss beer."
Corner Pub Weiss;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Hazy Light Gold Coloring with White Skin. Pretty Carbonated. Bad Wheat Taste.
Corner Pub Weiss;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Slightly hazy gold color with no head. Smells like sour candy mixed with grass. Tates like slightly sour water.
Corner Pub Weiss;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Slightly hazy and very pale yellow with a thin, creamy white head. Souring smell, sweaty gym socks, lemons, apple cider vinegar and canned corn juice. Pils malt flavor, some starch and coriander and, is there such a thing as cloves extract? Stinging lemon acidity and a triumphant return of the corn juice. Absolutely horrendous.
Corner Pub Weiss;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Hazy straw color with a lid of white bubbles. Wheaties and lemon zest aroma (hint of white wine). Floral flavors with light wood, tobacco and slight hint of cloves.
Corner Pub Weiss;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Off aromas. Too sour for a weiss bier. Appearance not dissimilar to the typical German weiss bier. Cloudy, light yellow. My initial impression was that it was better than their APA, but alas the scores are lower. Not great.
Locher Bio Naturplus Selection Manor;Appenzell, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Locher Appenzeller Bier;Blond color. Quite dry taste, not interesting aroma. Too simple and poor.
Ellicott Mills Alt;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Voo Doo Alt-on tap-pours a light tan head and copper color. Aroma is tart, medium malt-some chocolate. Taste is tart, medium malt-some chocolate. Thin mouth feel.
Ellicott Mills Alt;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ellicott Mills Brewing;An average beer which is a little off for an alt. More of a limp brown ale. Damp malt and a bit watery. Yet, still drinkable thanks to their food!
Ellicott Mills Alt;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Dark amber and red, thin white creamy head. Not my favorite aroma with notes of chocolate, earth, dirt, and some toffee. Spicy floral hops do show up to balance out the earthy chocolate flavors. Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, dull sahara dry finish. Definitely not their best effort here....
Ellicott Mills Alt;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Out of a growler from the brewpub courtesy of a homebrewclub friend. Dark red color. good malt flavor, balanced with a good dose of hops. Nice hop/malt aroma. Clean.
Delafield Orange Blossom Wit Bier;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Clear light orange golden. Small creamy white head, partially lasting. Aroma of orange. Coriander. Wheat. As expected. Fuller light body. Crisp and creamy. Smooth all around. Little minerals. Well carbonated. Little lemon tickle. Light farmy dry. pleasant easy drinking. Would have again.
Delafield Orange Blossom Wit Bier;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Decent American Wit, with all of the coriander and white pepper in the nose, medium bodied with a sweet flavor that leads to more spices and orange rind.
Delafield Orange Blossom Wit Bier;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Fading white head, cloudy pale orange body. Aroma is orange peel and corriander, slight lemon, and dry wheat. To the flavor some cloves and a bit of sweetness is added. Not too bad.
Delafield Orange Blossom Wit Bier;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;This beer's appearance wasn't that great, thin white head and a pale orange color. The aroma reminded me of mostly orange peel, and the taste was mostly the same but with an odd addition of an effervescent mint flavor. Weak overall, not very enjoyable.
Delafield Orange Blossom Wit Bier;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Slightly hazy light straw color with a lightly beaten egg white head. Light wheat and pale malt aromas with some odors of corn silage, hay and grass. light honey dryness with flavors of wheaties, and some musty grass. Balance seen off. Perhaps this the the first pour from the line, and may explain some of the off flavors, but I could not get myself to try another to check.
Great Dane Coffee Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Taster on tap at GTMW. Clear red, kind of brown color. Thin ring of khaki off white head. Loose lace. Medium plus body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Light slick finish. Base of the beer drinks like a brown ale, rather than a stout like I was expecting. Not that I mind, coffee brown ales are fun. Nutty malt aroma, some light caramel malt and mild earthy hop, plus a coffee flavor on top of everything. Moderate sweet taste, light bitter. Decent, interesting stuff.
Great Dane Coffee Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;First rake since 2007? Wowe. Anyway, this one pours a cloudy orange color with a small off-white head. Notes of coffee abound, of course, with some toast, tobacco, and brown sugar to balance. Light-medium bodied, with a toasty, lightly roasted mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Good, simple coffee ale.
Great Dane Coffee Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Clear orange brown color. Head was off white with good retention and lacing. Aroma was of coffee and a hint of dark chocolate. Flavor was similar, but I also sensed an occasional rubbery note that detracted somewhat. Body was on the lighter end of the spectrum.
Great Dane Coffee Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber with a 1/2 finger brown head. Aroma of fresh sweet coffee grounds and a bit of smoke. Flavor was fresh sweet coffee again, some Scotch ale qualities (a bit of smoke and light roasty malts), the coffee tends to cover up a lot f the flavors but there was a little ash in there as well. High carbonation, medium bodied. For what it was supposed to be, it was pretty good.
Great Dane Coffee Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;10th Annual Mid*Winter Brewfest. Pours to a light brassy mahogany body with a frothy white head. The aroma is vibrant with fresh brewed coffee. Its nice that its not dominated by roasted malts. The flavor is also standoutish with coffee. Also a delight that its not dominated by roasted dark malts. The palate is silken smooth and quite refreshing. I could drink gallons of this beer. I did go back 2 or 3 times to sample more of this and had well over a pint.
Great Dane Coffee Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;This 2006 version is much richer, walnut-brown in color with a nice off-white head that laces well. Nose is full espresso or maybe Major Dickason�s Blend. Aroma is big on the dark roasted coffee, smoky, woody, but clean with some late bittersweet chocolate. Some late notes of cigarettes round out the experience. The best coffee beer I�ve tried (out of three).
Great Dane Coffee Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Light copper color with a tight off white head. Pure fresh brewed coffee aroma with a light undertone of malt. Although I am not a big coffee brew lover, this has the best aroma of any coffee brew I've ever had. Mild coffee flavor with a light backbone of malt. Decent bitterness developed from the coffee.
Great Dane Oktoberfest;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;A classic oktoberfest. Clear amber color. Sweet aroma of cracker malts with herbal hops. Taste is toasted malts, earthy and herbal hops, some metallic. Crisp and drinkable.
Great Dane Oktoberfest;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;I think this is the best of the okfest that I�ve had (about a dozen ) this year. This has the closest to that toastyle finish that I crave.
Great Dane Oktoberfest;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at Great Dane. Deep amber with dissipating head. Bready. Caramel. Earthy hops. Some fruitiness. Chewy. Quite sweet and very rich. Tasty and satisfying but really it seems too much.
Great Dane Oktoberfest;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;A pretty good and caramel malted Oktoberfest bier. Lots of roastiness on the nose and palate. Pretty drinkable, and a good example of the style.
Great Dane Oktoberfest;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at Great Dane � Wausau. Poured clear copper with a sticky off-white head. The aroma picked up toasted nutty and caramel notes with fresh fruity and leafy accents.. crisp and well-presented. The flavor found nicely-toasted caramel and chewy bread at the core.. fruity hops and a touch of tartness around.. odd, slightly funky fruit on the finish. Light-medium bodied with higher carbonation on the palate.. OK feel and flow. This started out much better than it finished.
Great Dane Oktoberfest;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Brewed to style, and brewed very well to style. Amber color. Big, rich malt flavor with grassy, Germanic hops. Fine. (on tap at brewpub)

Great Dane Oktoberfest;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at brewpub, pours a clear amber with thin white head,m aroma is of sweet malt and the taste is much of the same, boring overall, this is a lot sweeter than I was expecting.
Great Dane Oktoberfest;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at their airport location, pours a dark amber witha a decent white foamy head. Taste is thick andalty, a little corny at the end. I�ll try it again at the brewpub, as I�m always worried that airport glasses are a bit tainted for flavor and aroma.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;Here we have the holy Bos Beer from Poland! It is very smell of wheat and fart meld in chamber! It is look of clear and pee pee. Taste is not a kick in the bean basket, but a feather floating on a springboard. It is open to your projections. Taste of openness, taste of close. 8.1% well hidden. Opens up after eating ice cream first. Good for weird mumbly scat jazz and cuddle butts.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;Yeah...really not impressed with this. Stronger but still a pissy corny generic hot mess. Not quite revolting, but bad.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;Bottle from Capital Market. Medium golden in color with fairly light carbonation. Grainy nose with a touch of malty sweetness. Light and grainy with mild carbonation. Sweet as well. Not horrible, but the brew could use some more bubbles.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;Bottle poured. Pours a clear golden color with no head. Looks like apple juice. Skunky aroma from.a distance. Flavor is really sweet which suprised me. Turns a bit sour, but not really in the good way. Drinkable, but not super enjoyable.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;Macro strong Eastern Euro swill. Slightly skunked corny aroma and flavor. Lightly floral with vegetal flavors and a honey-like sweetness. A bit if fusel burn in the swallow. Nasty, but pretty, pouring clear golden with a small ring of fluffy white head. Somewhat clean finish.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;Bottle pour. Clear light golden with a decent off white head. Hay and yeast aroma. Light somewhat creamy body. Sweet initially with a light alcohol taste and a sour aftertaste.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;Bottle. Pours a clear copper color with a smallish white head on there. Nose has a lot of corn on there and just a slight bit of skunk to it. Taste is also pretty skunky, and doesnt seem very good.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;From a 500ml bottle, pours a dark golden liquid with an incredibly long lasting white small head...literally lasting 30 minutes or more. The aroma was very surprising. I have never had a strong pale lager. The alcohol was slightly noticeable with slight floral, grain, and caramel. Taste was medium sweetness, lightly bitter, with a medium body, creamy texture, and soft carbonation. The finish was slight bitterness and fading to a bit of alcohol warmth and light caramel. Not what I was expecting, but I did enjoy it. Overall, nice mouth-feel, just a bit of sweetness, just the right amount of bitterness, and the finish lingers with the warmth and bitterness dominating at the end.
BOSS Beer 8.1%;Witnica, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Witnica;33 cl bottle. Pours clear and golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma fruity, toasted and light sweet. Bitter and toasted malty. Bitter and dry finish.

Mountain Sun Pinhead Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Draught. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, chocolate, coffee), with a light note of vanilla. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Nitrogen served at the time, which is a damned shame, but even so this still wasn't completely devoid of character. If they served this properly, it could end up topping their Java Porter as their best brew (IMHO).
Mountain Sun Ruckus Wheat;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Drunk at the brewery in Boulder on draft. A really average beer. I liked there other beers better
Mountain Sun Ruckus Wheat;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Did not really care for this one had a clean, but medicinal nose, not a bad thing just from the herbal hops and blend of spices this is brewed with. Just kind of turned me off. even the malt quality has a bit of a spicy texture. This tastes like an experiment gone wrong and needs to go back to the drawing board. Superbly unbalanced.
Mountain Sun Ruckus Wheat;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;"Draught at Southern Sun. 8 oz sample. A nice Wheatie. Beer was hazy, light, oxidized gold color with a small, creamy, white, mostly and quickly diminishing head. The aroma was subtle. Malty with moderate notes of toasted grain and sweet caramel; Hoppy with a light note of herb; Moderate miscellaneous note of honey, gingersnap cookies, light meadish quality. The flavor was moderately-to-heavily sweet with an average-length, wheaty, lightly acidic, lightly sweet finish. The body was medium, the texture was watery-to-velvety and the carbonation was soft."
Mountain Sun Ruckus Wheat;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;A noise or a commotion, never really thought of this is the sense of a fart, as bitter does, but alas...this is a very simple beer. Brewed with lemongrass and chamomile, I think taking a hint from NBB. Hazy, with lots of lemony acidity, some herbal spiciness, with some yeasty bubblegum esthers here and there. Kind of light, but still refreshing.
Mountain Sun Ruckus Wheat;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;my woman tried this one, just cuzz of the name alone. we all know what a ruckus is, a fart. so, shit a beer named after a fart. hmmm? typical simple wheat, slight bubblegum thing but seemed a bit one dimensional after all those big hops and thinner on the palate then most their beers.
Mountain Sun Ruckus Wheat;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Draught at Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery. Pours hazy gold with an edgy white head. Lemon and fruity wheat floral hop aroma. Lemon acidic malt and wheat flavor. Light bodied and refreshing fizzy palate.
Mountain Sun Ruckus Wheat;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;"Evenly hazy and yellow-orange with a thin white head. Somewhat syrupy body with a moderate carbonation. Sweet malts, with notes of cookie and bread; not really cloying. Hops were herbal, grassy and flowery. Not a whole lot of bitterness. Though, bitterness in the finish seemed to dry out the mouth a bit."
Mountain Sun Ruckus Wheat;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Draught. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), with a note of lemon/lime zest. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.

Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Dark with red note and thick beige head. Sourish aroma with notes of bread, peas, kelp and fruit. Coffee flavour with notes of metal, malt and fruit. Roasted and somewhat sweet with long bitterness.
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);This pitch black beer has a huge, silky smooth and lasting nougat head, that leaves nice islands of foam. The aroma has notes of chocolate malt and alcohol. The flavour is very powerful and it has a strong, slightly harsh bitterness from the dark roasted malts. It has notes of roasted malt, smoke. berries soaked in rum, licorice, bitter chocolate, coffee and alcohol. There is an additional note, that I cannot pinpoint, but it disturbs the overall impression for me. I�ll have to taste it again (old rating).
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottle. Very dark brown with a medium to big light brown head. Nice leafy bitter hop tang. Oily mouthfeel. Piney aroma.
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);"Bottle, at Plan B, RBESG pub crawl, August 2005. Black, yes. Dublin, not so sure. There�s certainly plenty of burnt malt, with a light bitterness, but there�s also some underlying sweetness that I wasn�t expecting, especially in a ""dry"" stout. Also touches of cocoa/chocolate. Goes down smooth. Pleasant enough."
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Mildly roasty malts in the simple but pleasant aroma. Opaque black body with fizzy, low, brown head that lasts throughout. Strong roasted malt and chocolate flavour. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Bottle sampled at Plan B in Copenhagen.
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);50cl bottle from my Summer Santa and enjoyed in my Stone RIS snifter: Poured nearly opaque with an initial HUGE frothy tan head which did settle after a while but left only okay lace. The aroma has mostly the standard stuff, smoke, coffee, mocha, earthy and a nice dose of plum/berry. The taste is the strong point with this beer, beside all the charred and chocolate overtones, there is a beautiful layer of currant/blackberry running about and even lingering a bit. The finish is more coffee bitterness and smoke. The feel is lively and moderately oily as expected after the pour, a tad too overcarbonated. In the world of many average dry stouts, this one seems to have more character than the norm. I liked it more than the average ratebeerian as well it seems.
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);(Bottle 50 cl) Almost black with a warm red glow and a nice, creamy light brown head. Weak burned aroma, very weak. Malty flavour - more of roasted than burned malt. Very lively, fizzy head - overly carbonated. 090905
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Dark brown colour with a tan head. Fruity choc aroma. Similar flavour with some roast notes coming through. Medium bodied. Drinkable.
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);(RBESG05, 50cl bottle) Big beige head atop a dark brown body tinged with red. Aroma is medium sweet, roasty, chocolate, light coffee. Taste is medium sweet, roasty, some chocolate, coffee. Effervescent light-medium body.
Slottsk�llans Dublin Black;Uppsala, Sweden;Stout - Dry;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottle (?) at Plan B during RBESG 05 pub crawl. Very dark brown, with a nice, leafy bitter hop tang. Oily mouthfeel + some fizz. Piney aroma. This is quite good really.
Slottsk�llans Uppsala;Uppsala, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);500ml bottle from that Systembolaget on the outskirts of Uppsala. Lager gold with a flat white top. Pleasant honeyed shrub lager with Germanic accents, base biscuit, cherry blossom, floured rubber and lemon cake. Nose rubber, honeyed pine and shrub. Bread and lemon. Decent.
Floris Framboise;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Keg at Euston Tap, London. In fairness, this is actually quite well balanced and not too sweet, although I couldn't drink much of it.
Floris Framboise;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;330ml bottle, drunk overlooking the Sea Garden in Burgas on a perfect July evening. Pours thickly hazy dull rusty brown without much head, lacing or visible rising carbonation. Aromas of sour raspberry, cereal. In the mouth, quite fizzy - despite the flat appearance, dry sourness throughout, sweet especially in the aftertaste, strong raspberry flavour with grains in the background before a short gently sweet-and-sour finish. Softly sour and very fruity if you like that sort of thing.
Floris Framboise;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;One of the more palatable Floris beers, but still nothing to write home about. At least there is some subtlety here.
Floris Framboise;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle, very cold. Dull red with a pink-tinged head. Aroma of sweetened raspberry puree. But it's much less sweet than suggested by the aroma. There's a little nip of lemon and I guess tangy wheat that sets off the fruit OK. One's enough even on a hot evening.

Full bitter hop aroma and decent bitter hop flavour. A very English, not American Pale ale, that�s why its listed as bitter.
Leek Pale Ale;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Bottle Conditioned. This is a hazy gold colour, as mottled as a Monet with a fluffy cloudy sky for a head, and a big dollop of wet yeast. It is a dry, fragrant beer, sharp flavours and challenging, a good IPA with no move towards malty sweetness. I was impressed with the flavour of fresh hop for a bottle, overall pretty good.
Leek Pale Ale;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);I had the bottle conditioned version. Light cloudy gold in colour this has a sweet and pine aroma. Flavours are pine too with a light malt body. The finish is dry with some bitterness. Perfectly reasonable it is a little thin but that is reflected in the low alcohol percentage.
Durango Dark Lager;Durango, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Premium;Durango Brewing Company;On tap at the All Colorado Beer Festival. Pours black, with a small, frothy, khaki head.

Durango Dark Lager;Durango, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Premium;Durango Brewing Company;Pours black/brown with little head. Muted malty aroma. Malty and roasty notes finish with a residual hop bitterness that isn�t quite the lager standard of �crisp�. Lays on your tongue for a bit. Medium body and carbonation and pretty well balanced.

Durango Amber Ale;Durango, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Durango Brewing Company;355ml bottle. I am guessing form a 6 pack that is at least 5 years old.

Jurand Europa Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Deep gold. Nose reasonably present, actual hops there, grassy and a mite bitter. Malts are sweet and bready, bit grainy, but there�s a surpsingly pleasant kick of hops to this one. For a strong lager, it�s not overly sweet and syrupy. Quite decent.
Jurand Europa Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;"Clear dark gold; tall white fluffy, whipped foam tops the body. Good lacing qualities with sticky thick sheeting. Keeps a good skim throughout the session. Aroma is clean and pleasant of fresh cut grass and light corn-like sweetness. Taste is also clean; crisp too, fairly light embodyment of sweetish malt, corn bread, fluffed grain, and dry grass. Very light and leveled with its taste upfront but builds gracefully as it heads into the finish where most of its action takes place. Fades to a finely placed drying in the finish with a small surge of grassy herbs. Feel is moderately carbonated, crisp, clean, with a lightly creamy light/medium body. No off flavors really. There is a moderate amount of malts coming across but doesn�t offer much flavor profile, its more alligned in the body before it does the taste. Just a tad boring but drinkable enough for what it offers as a lager."

Fant�me Sant�-7!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fant�me;Sant� 1-19 vertical. Thanks Brad! Clear yellowish golden body with a thin, white collar. Aromas include musty basement, rain, mineral funk, floral scents. Light tartness with summertime floral notes. A hint of white wine with vegetable / floral aftertaste. Interesting...
Fant�me Sant�-7!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fant�me;33 cl bottle received in a trade. Opened up at Fantomefest 2014. Lighter in color than the previous bottles we�ve opened so far. Hazy yellow in color with a wisp of foam. Nose is sweet and oxidized. Flavor is honey, faint tartness, cardboard, and it finishes bitter. The body is lighter than the previous beers as well but carbonation remains about the same as most. Another Sante I think has seen better days. We wondered how the size of the bottle had affected the amount of oxidation the beer had.
Fant�me Sant�-7!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fant�me;"Sampled August 2013 A soft pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces only a wispy, thin, ring of a head. The beer made only a slight hiss upon opening, and is only lightly carbonated. The beer is a bright amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a fruity tartness to it that is close to strawberries, perhaps a touch of kiwi-fruit, and a bit like apple-cider vinager; there does seem to be an acetic edge to the aroma. Some spicy, warming alcohol in the finish adds a bit to the nose, and there is also a hint of oxidized / aged, toasted malt to the aroma that has taken on caramel like notes with age. As the beer warms up the oxidized malt character becomes more expressive, though it does not become overwhelming. Slightly sweet, definitely with quite a bit of fruit esters (ripe red plums, apple, and perhaps a touch of berry like notes), the beer also has an oxidation character that accentuates the apple cider notes, as well as contributing a hint of moist cardboard, and some stale brown cracker notes. There is a hint of herbal character here, perhaps a touch grassy, not quite lemon like, and there is a rounded earthy spiciness to the finish that provides a touch of bit. The beer is lightly tart, nothing like the nose suggested though, but it does accentuate the fruit notes here; it is too light to say what kind of acidity it might be though. The body is light and quaffable, yet still has a light viscosity to it that is brought out that much more by the very light carbonation. Still quite drinkable, though with the smaller format bottle, and the greater age, this is a Sant� that is on its way downhill. Still enjoyable though, and I am quite happy to be sipping this right now."
Fant�me Sant�-7!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fant�me;Big thanks to Scott on this bottle! Pours a clear gold with a slight amber hue and a white head that starts and remains at the edges. Aroma has a good amount of light spice, sweet grass and a hint of tartness. Flavor has earthy and sweet grains with a bit of light spice and a tartness that comes out in the finish.
Fant�me Sant�-7!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fant�me;In short: A old beer that morphed into a dirty terroir beer How: Bottle 330ml. Shameless rating of a beer that shouldn�t be rated, I mean how old is this shit? I don�t care it�s a Fantome and I�m rating it. Bottle received a few weeks ago from grownfool, thanks a lot Brian. God knows where that beer has been trough over the years The look: Murky muddy body mixing peach color and light brown topped by a medium beige head with medium retention In long: Nose is dirty, old rustic yeast going the leather way, ionized water, stuff. Taste is muddy yeast, rustic stuff, moldy wood, soured light-color ripe fruits, refried beans, ionized water. Ok so my description seems to describe an awful beer, but somehow with this one every thing came together for a surprising cohesiveness to create some kind �terroir� beer, and honestly I kind of like this old thing. Far from a clean and crisp beer, but enjoyable if you like the concept of a �terroir� beer. Surprisingly drinkable, hard to say what it tasted like when fresh. It was a fun tick to drink this old beer, and thankfully drinking pas due-date alcohol is absolutely safe, at least that�s what Garry said, the giant blue talking squirel who walked by when I was drinking the beer.
Fant�me Sant�-7!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fant�me;"330 ml bottle shared by lushawn- thanks, LeShaun! Pours a murky, dull orange-gold with a medium off-white, uneven head comprised of big bubbles. Aroma of fresh garden vegetables, barley malts, overripe fruits, and muddled herbs and spices- strange, complex, and hard-to-pin-down nose, but it works. The flavor, not as much; more watered down and even more muddled. Like Shawon says, seems more like a very old Belgian strong ale. Light-bodied, with low carbonation and a vegetal mouthfeel. Interesting."

Taste is mildly toasty grainy, chocolately malty, minimally nutty, slightly dry hoppy, fruity overtones, hints of red berries, subtle sweetness. Slightly inharmonious, somehow unconnected hop and malt flavours, beyond that cleaned up to an excessive state of conformity that repudiates any sign of provenience and peculiarity (not to mention the word ""idiosyncrasy"")."

I knew this would be a West Coast take on an amber beer and many of Drake�s brews are over hopped for my taste but I liked this. Too dark indoors to see the color but it gave the impression of being on the darker edge of ""amber."" Smooth; malts and hops in relative balance, at least by Northwest standards.

Aroma: Chalk, some hints of alcohol when the beer gets warmer, rubber, diacetyl, poor hops, nice maltyness hiding in the background. Generally not that bad, but the warmer the worse, a bit accidic. Flavour: Dominated by diacetyl and giving a rigor - mortis impression on your tongue violating it, very low extract makes this beer very wattery, some poor, watered barley grains, wattery bitterness manifesting poor quality Pilsener style, but no hints of sugar, practically no hops, a bit metallic, great load of chalk in the aftertaste leaving your tongue parched, metallic, watered accidity. Palate: Texture is wattery, body is light, carbonation is soft, finish feel is chalky with notes of accidity, parched, no flavour practically. All in all I�ve tried this beer first time 3 years ago and was much worse, so it looks as improved a bit.
Polnocny Gold;Suwalki, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Polnocny;Bottled Pale yellow, small white head. Strong butterscotch - diacetyl aroma. Taste has basicly only water and diacetyl. Slight maltyness in the aftertaste, Horrible.
Monteiths Radler Bier;Greymouth, New Zealand;Radler / Shandy;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Not as bad as its rating. It�s supposed to be sweet, and it is. Not great though. Almost more lemonade than beer. Tried with Kelsey and Tim at the brewery in Greymouth in 2019.
Monteiths Radler Bier;Greymouth, New Zealand;Radler / Shandy;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Super thin texture, watery and very sweet. A great soft drink but sure isn't a beer. Think of lemon lime sherbet lollies

Monteiths Radler Bier;Greymouth, New Zealand;Radler / Shandy;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);"Haven�t had one of these for years, but can still taste the lemon/lime syrup that was injected into a bland beer. ""This beer�s not very good, Mr Monteith. Should we tip it down the drain?"" ""No son, try and disguise it with something. This dishwashing liquid should work, plus it will aid the head"""
Monteiths Radler Bier;Greymouth, New Zealand;Radler / Shandy;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Bottle 0,33l. Pours a golden color with a longlasting white head. Fruity citrusy malty grainy aroma. Sweetish malty dry citrus taste. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Monteiths Radler Bier;Greymouth, New Zealand;Radler / Shandy;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);"Barely a beer, a bit of the ""premix"" type sweet drink throughout (think west coast cooler for those familiar). But actually not put that badly together to make it interesting enough"
Monteiths Radler Bier;Greymouth, New Zealand;Radler / Shandy;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);On tap. Pours orange. No nose that I would notice. If there were some malt and hops taste in this I�d say it was balanced, because the lime taste (despite feeling artificial) is well blended into the rest. But like this? No no no.
Monteiths Radler Bier;Greymouth, New Zealand;Radler / Shandy;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Bottle from Ueda. A deep copper gold with a light beige head that has a HUGE ginger ale/citrusy sprite like aroma. Nice enough but kind of overpowering. The body is the on the thin side with a club soda-ish carbonation. The flavor is a ginger ale/7 up with some cardboard, lime and light malts.Overall the flavor isn�t bad but it is more soda than beer like which isn�t so strange or off-style for a radler I guess.
Broken Tooth Klondike Golden;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a soft transparent orange to yellow color with a thin finger�s worth of white foamy head that dissipated immediately. The aroma had some citrus sweetness with some light honey underneath. The flavor yielded to the sweetness all throughout with the same sort of aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation touches the ABV seemingly just right. Overall, for the most part, I don�t mind this one. It�s good for a golden ale, worthy of having again preferably on a Summer�s day.

Harrington's Bees Knees;Christchurch, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330mL bottle from Regional, dipped in butter from my fridge... Stupid fridge layout. Pours very pale golden with a dissipating white head. Not a lot on the nose. Some floral hops, and weak malt. Floral hops translate to the flavour, then bring some �mild honey flavours� as the bottle declares accurately. Sweet. Mild bitterness, weak malt finish. A bit boring, I was expecting something with a bit more honey. A beer with weak aromas always fails to excite me.
Harrington's Bees Knees;Christchurch, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);(Bottle 33 cl) Hazy, pale golden with a small, white head. Very sweet honey aroma. Medium in body, pale malt accents and otherwise sticky and excessively sweet honey notes making it hard to finish especially since there�s no balancing hops. Honey beers don�t have to be like this. 010208
Harrington's Bees Knees;Christchurch, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tasted in New Zealand. Very very sweet. Aroma of mostly honey. Nice color and white head.
Harrington's Bees Knees;Christchurch, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled. Hazy pale amber. Aroma of honey and grainy malt. Sweet with clean, rounded mouthfeel. The honey blends with mangoish hops and the grainy malt, low bitterness. Fairly well made, but I just don�t get the idea with these honey ales.
Harrington's Bees Knees;Christchurch, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Yellowy orange colour with fluffy homebrewish head. Honey and malt flavours are strong and linger slightly with mild bitterness. Little in the way of any complex flavours. Not a bad summer drop, but not outstanding either. Not exactly my style. I could drink one or two of these but wouldn�t drink it all night.
Harrington's Bees Knees;Christchurch, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled, in Sydney. Amber with a fluffy white head.

Harrington's Best Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I liked this. Good example of the classic UK style but carries a touch more alcohol and caramel / toffee malts to create a slightly bolder flavour profile. Nice mild bitter finish.
Harrington's Best Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tasted 17/05/2006. 330ml bottle from Miramar Liquorland. Gorgeous red-gold, bright, with a very light-tan head that collapes, disappears, and laces lightly. Toffee apple, grass and some mineral-like yeast notes on the nose - quite mild. Some nutty almond notes come through later. Dry malt in the mouth, well attenuated, with a strong grassy bitterness, a metallic note in the middle, and a lingering grassy hop finish. Light medium weight with a medium carbonation. Lacks a bit in the malt profile, only slightly more than an extra hoppy kiwi brown.

Medium sweet and medium bodied. Really roasty with pleasant full malt profile, notes of of coffee and low-medium bitterness. It�s obvious that the Nelson winters can�t be that severe, but a pleasant beer anyway.
Harrington's The First of the Winter Warmer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I also sampled this at AIBA 2004 and I thought it was quite ok.

Harrington's The First of the Winter Warmer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Sampled AIBA 2004. Dark orange colour. Taste is of slight malt and something wierd, light aftertaste. Very light on for a ""winter warmer"", which may be part of the problem."
Harrington's The First of the Winter Warmer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);there�s nothing sadder than a pitiful offering from a well-regarded microbrewery, it really makes me wonder if i�m in the wrong game. i probably shouldn�t take it so much to heart, but i felt personally insulted by this beer. incredibly flat with brown sugar aroma and tasting of just brown sugar and cheap vinegar with some dirt mixed in
Harrington's The First of the Winter Warmer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Really crap. Just a bland, really thin toffee sweetness. Boring to the extreme. Havne't had Heineken Oud Bruin eczematic, but i'll take your word on its comparison. Sweet and sticky, and just plain boring.
Harrington's The First of the Winter Warmer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);im with you sully this was a disappointment. i wanted to like this brewery but im afraid they SUck. this was considerably worse than even the crap youngs winter warmer. very clear bright orange with a self-fizzling head. tastes sweet and syruppy and disgusting like heineken oud bruin or something, with a tangy finish. bleugh.
Harrington's The First of the Winter Warmer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Damn, bugger, strewth, darn. I was hoping that the Harrington beers woud be all beautiful, delicious and flavourome beers. This one falls a fair bit too short. There is a good malt presence and reasonable hopping but the standard set by these people have unfortunately led me to expect more. Apologies guys, but it falls short. Psychologically I suppose this should be consumed during the relevant season, but still given that I filled the bath with ice, played winter olympic videos and put on winter pyjamas (even though it is about 35c here) it still didn't work. A good beer, but I hate saying this.

Sunshine Coast Noosa Premium Ale;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Tasted 02/10/2006. Straw gold, bright, with the lovely gentle carbonation that all of this breweries beers have. Tight white head lingers. Nose is very wheaty, a hint sulphurous, with some woody spice. Lolly notes show through as it warms. Tart, dry and watery in the mouth. More sulphur, which really lets the side down. Very short. Light bodied, with a lively yet gentle carbonation.
Sunshine Coast Noosa Premium Ale;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Yeasty, jalapeno aroma that most of this brewery�s beers seem to have.

Dieu du Ciel! Rigor Mortis Ambr�e;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Aroma is sour and somewhat vegetal.

Dieu du Ciel! Rigor Mortis Ambr�e;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;(Bottle) Bright white head and a copper body. Interesting aroma of soya sauce and an over-rippened sweet potato. Bourbon flavour with a strong malt. Beautiful!
Dieu du Ciel! Rigor Mortis Ambr�e;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;3 years bottle: Hazy amber with a respectable white head. It smells boiled vegetables and Martin confirmed my asparagus suspicions. The nose is pretty sour too which was not so much reflected in mouth. The taste was old(in the sense of not fresh) malty, buttery with diacetyl notes as well as cloves. Somehow grainy texture. Mollasses aftertaste and a little astringence. In my opinion this was just too old although I've rarely seen 8% so well hidden.

The nose is sweet with noted chocolate oatmeal. Minimal roastiness and a slight gummy thing are going on. The mouthfeel is pretty solid, creamy but slightly carbonated. The finish hints at oats, but toasty flavors are minimal. It�s fairly sweet, but not excessive in anyway. Pretty decent brew!
Aiken Steeplechase Oatmeal Stout;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Aiken Brewing Company;Color was deep reddish black. Taste was a little thin and subtle, but overall a good tasting beer. I prefer my oatmeal stouts with a little thicker body, this one was a little on the thin watery side.

Trinidad Bon Carbo Stout;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Stout;Trinidad Brewing Company;From Apr 2008 This pours from 22oz bottle a pitch black with a about an inch of tannish foam. Head retention is not good and very little lacing The smell has notes of roasted malt, chocolate, and maybe some dark fruit but there's a pretty strong nose of alcohol that seems to be messing with the fruit, if there is any. The taste is roasted malty in a very big way. It pretty much over powers everything else on the first sip. Second sip in and I get some chocolate and yes, there is some dark fruit here. I'm tasty some black cherry and some plum but there's a noticeable alcohol taste that's trying to mask the more subtle flavours in this RIS and is doing a good job of it. Mores the pity as I think this one would be a very flavourful and quite pleasing example of the style were it not for the intrusive alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium bordering on thick, which is good, the carbonation is lightly done, also good. Man, this has the potential to be far better than what I'm drinking from my glass. The good flavours *are* there. I'm hoping that Trinidad does some tweeking with the recipe and gets rid of the one big fault going on with their RIS. As is, yeah, I'd drink it again but not with as much enthusism as I'm sure Trindad would be hoping for. Cost: $4.99
Trinidad Bon Carbo Stout;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Stout;Trinidad Brewing Company;Draught at brewery. Pours black with a small, fizzy, light brown head, mostly diminishing with fair lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (molasses, chocolate, coffee), average hops (flowers, perfume), average yeast (leather) with notes of tar. Full bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Average duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity and bitterness.
Trinidad Bon Carbo Stout;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Stout;Trinidad Brewing Company;bottle. black pour with thick foamy tan head. roasted malts, figs and raison, hints of coffee in aroma. sour, strong liquorice, fruit. sourness leans toward offensiveness. I�ll give this one another try some time but not very impressive.
Trinidad Bon Carbo Stout;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Stout;Trinidad Brewing Company;Black color with brown edges. Assertive nose of black licorice, heavy roast and dark fruit. Well balanced malt character, with lots of taste. Especially impressed by the finish, which lingers well with hints of mocha, hops and peanut brittle. Front-palate and mid-palate shows lots of roast and coffee. It�s quite a stout.
Trinidad Bon Carbo Stout;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Stout;Trinidad Brewing Company;Bomber poured a translucent black with a lasting brown head. Aromas of coffee, bakers chocolate, vanilla and light licorice. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of dark chocolate, esspresso and fruittiness with a smooth slightly saour lingering roasty finish. Too bad this beer does�nt taste as good as it smells. Back off the Black Patent malt some.
Trinidad Bon Carbo Stout;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Stout;Trinidad Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery, 2007 (just found my notes): Deep brown-black with a weak head. Texture was OK, but on the thin side. Malts were very roasted and toasted, to my surprise. There were even some nice coffee-like notes. Bitterness was complementing.
Trinidad Bon Carbo Stout;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Stout;Trinidad Brewing Company;Aroma is sweet with a light roasted scent. Color is a thick black with no carbonation and no head, it looks like flat cola. Taste is rich, roasted and flat. It starts with a full body it goes down with a sweet sharp feel. Finish comes in roasted with a sweet burnt taste and a bitter bite. After taste is like a cup of strong black coffee, its a burnt and bitter taste. This would be a good Stout if the carbonation was there, it has deep roasted and complex flavor but it all comes out a bit bland with out the carbonation. As it warms and you drink a bit more it seems to release more sweetness and I like it a little more.

Trinity Octoberfest;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trinity Brewhouse;On tap at the brewpub. Slight cottony, dried leaves and earth aroma. Flavors roll out a washed out body and some light bubblegum and other unsavory yeast byproducts. There isn�t a body to hold up to the bitterness, so it comes across unbalanced and bitingly bitter.

Trinity Dark Wheat;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Trinity Brewhouse;Draught -old notes. This was a decent dunkel W but it was not one of the great reps of the style.
Trinity Dark Wheat;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Trinity Brewhouse;Oddly colored for a Dunkel Weizen. Just a tad darker than the Oktoberfest I also had. Very unusual tanginess with banana flavor. Highly drinkable, but not what I am used to for this style.

Light amber-gold, mostly clear, thin ring of head, a bit oily....nose is muted caramel malts, some dry grassy/herbal notes come through with a bit of warmth but there�s never a lot there....on the tongue surprisingly rich malty flavor profile, with fresh toasty grains, like really fresh whole-grain bread, full-bodied and just sweet enough, low carbonation, finishing with just a light acrid smoky edge. Pretty solid overall.
Amherst Lewmeister Oktoberfest;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Amherst Brewing Company;Poured an orange-brown color with an ok initial head and decent lacing. The aroma was toasted malts, some breadiness. A mustiness opened up the flavor with bready malts then coming through, followed by a closing light toastiness. The mouthfeel was moderate, a little stronger than that within style. A nice OFest beer.
Amherst Lewmeister Oktoberfest;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Amherst Brewing Company;Draught @ CT River Brewfest: This one pours a clear, somewhat orangish color. there was not a lot of head on it at all. The aroma was a bit thin and weak, although not unpleasant. There were some notes of spices and caramel malt sweetness. The taste was along the same lines. Definitely a lighter bodied Marzen. Just OK.

Amherst Lewmeister Oktoberfest;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Amherst Brewing Company;Clear orangey-yellow. No head. Looks a bit sad that way. Lightly florwery aroma, gentle cookie-ish malt, just not very aromatic. Somehow caramelic in mouth, very light. Hoppy and spicy bittering out finish, light tartness. Alright, but not their best from my point of view.

Del Mar Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);"Another Corona clone from this behemoth brewery from El Salvador. No real different from their other offerings - methinks they just rotate the labels. The painted bottle is the only thing that saves the appearance from a ""1"" - light, pale with a thin, soapy head. Typical, wet paper bag aroma, saaz-hop induced skunky flavor. Watery - but not very refreshing."
Laziza;Beirut, Lebanon;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);(Bottle). Aroma and taste of malt and grassy hops. Dry bitterness in the aftertaste. OK beer, a bit similar to a Pilsener!
Laziza;Beirut, Lebanon;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);A golden beer with a small but disappearing head. The aroma is a nice malty and hoppy one. The flavor starts out with a lot of aroma hops, then comes the malt sweetness. The sweetness is very simple and grain like. The beer is better than I expected - all in all OK but nothing special.
Laziza;Beirut, Lebanon;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);Sampled at Stockholm Beer Festival 2003. Light golden and a short head. Very fresh, hoppy aroma. A typical mediterranean lager. Fresh hoppiness in the flavour.

Laziza;Beirut, Lebanon;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);Bottled. Sampled at Stockholm Beer Festival. This is, from what I've heard, a Lebanese beer brewed under license by Bavaria. It pours a golden colour and has a malty, slight hoppy flavour and is by far better and more pleasant than most standard lager beers.

Victory K�lsch;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Growler from JC�s, pours clear, light straw yellow with a clinging white head, nose clean and sunny citrus with pleasant light noble hops and a touch of grain. Very soft, lightly crisp medium body, citrus and bread, a bit more on the sharper/tangier side but all the more refreshing. Clean and has some zing, touch grainy-grassy, low bitterness, moderately dry. I could do with a pinch more hops but it�s nice as is.

Really nice fresh hop nose, quite floral and fruity, pineapple and mango, even some guava, light lemon, bready malts. Flavor is lightly bitter, lightly sweet, strong breadliness, hops turn more herbal and grassy, light citrus. Definitely one of the best kolsch beers I have had, American or German.

Alpine Beer Company Alpine Ale;Alpine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Alpine Beer Company (CA);pretty average ale. pale yellow, white head. old school malty pale, some hops, some earth, etc etc
Alpine Beer Company Alpine Ale;Alpine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Alpine Beer Company (CA);January 10th, 2015 - Alpine Beer Company gets a lot of praise in San Diego, but I�ve never had a chance to visit the brewery itself. Stories about aggressively bad customer service experiences have muddied my motivation to get up to Alpine and see what the hype is about, but I was in the area on unrelated business and wanted to end the day with some beer. I ordered a line of tasters (without incident) and started it on the eponymous Alpine Ale, tawny brown in color, with a muted smell, like a blonde ale, but even lighter. The flavor is mild, with a shy malt profile, more like a pilsener. After a few more sips I can see where the balance hangs, delicate and in proportion, with a nice tastiness in the aftertaste to dismount from the cool, clean flavor profile of the brew. So far, this has been a very good start.

Alpine Beer Company Alpine Ale;Alpine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Alpine Beer Company (CA);It does meet all of the check marks of the description of it here on ratebeer. But I don�t really like it. But to be fair that would be a lot of pale ales like it. The malts and earthiness I guess. And shouldn�t have it next to a big juicy double IPA. Draft at uncle mikes. Dank fruit and a little sweet. Fine for the style overall
Alpine Beer Company Alpine Ale;Alpine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Alpine Beer Company (CA);New rating 4/16 - at mad mex atwood. Pale yellow, mild perfumy ipa aroma. Yes, quite mild and fairly sweet fer sure, but not in a cloying way, more like ice cider sweetness. Finally a beer that is not trying to be aan IPA and I like that attitude, just a well amde APA fer sure, nice job alpine. Not sure how the previous version I had at brixton was so different. OLD: Finally got to try this. At brixton. Clear pale yellow. Not much aroma. Does have a medium high bitter content. Builds. Begins to border on ipa. Just plain old American style ale, heheh, with all the typical ale attributes, none are overdone.
Alpine Beer Company Alpine Ale;Alpine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Alpine Beer Company (CA);On Draught! Pours a pale gold color with a good head and good lacing on the glass. The aroma is very mild, but it�s got some pleasant orange and varied citrus aromas, it�s a little bit malty & really quite clean smelling The flavor has a nice citrusy & melon hop thing happening. The beer has a moderate level of bitterness, the malt character is light but works well here for balance as well as complexity. It�s got a medium dry flavor, which is cool. The whole thing is real mild, and that�s perfectly fine.
Alpine Beer Company Alpine Ale;Alpine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Tap at Bier Baron. Pours clear dark gold, lots of head and lots of lacing.

Duneland Belgian;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Duneland Brewhouse;The bartender was nice enough to let me try a sample gratis. It was listed as a brewmaster's special Belgian Ale. Very clear color with a sweet nose. Sugary candy flavors with a type of sour apple. Hopped flavors. Didn't really fit the style at all. Needs a lot of work.
Dodging Duck Duckwheats Honey Honey Wheat;Boerne, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;Tap @ restaurant, and bought a growler to bring home. I really enjoyed this--probably due to the sweetness of the honey which seems perfectly balanced.
Dodging Duck Duckwheats Honey Honey Wheat;Boerne, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;The lightest beer on tap at this Brewpub is what would be expected. Created with the macro beer drinker in mind. Not bad, but I prefer the beers with more complex tastes and body.
Dodging Duck Duckwheats Honey Honey Wheat;Boerne, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;Hay, bread, caramel, honey malt (M). Slightly hazy gold-copper body. Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter, dry finish. Medium body, dry texture, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: I definitely like the honey presence in this beer, but the dryness it imparts takes away from the thirst quenching properties.
Dodging Duck Duckwheats Honey Honey Wheat;Boerne, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;Not a whole lot here, a little honey, a little wheat, refreshing I guess....this may be the brewpub's token light beer that anyone can drink...not bad though.
Dodging Duck Dunkel Duck Ale;Boerne, Texas, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;Strong but not overwhelming peat malt aroma. Caramel, chocolate and coffee also make a showing. Deep brown-black body. Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly bitter finish. Great smoky taste, imminently drinkable. Medium body, creamy texture, average carbonation. The bottom line is: excellent alone or with a plate of sausages.
Dodging Duck Dunkel Duck Ale;Boerne, Texas, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;Excellent! Mahogany in color. Very strong aroma...tobacco, wheat. A very malt heavy flavor, lots of wheat, raisin, tobacco....notes of caramel. Very complex and big for a dunkel. Many beers of this style finish thin and uninventive--this one had a nice peppery spice finish, with subtle hops.
Dodging Duck Gunga Duck India Pale Ale;Boerne, Texas, United States;IPA;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;If you are a hophead like me, you�ll love this beer. The high IBU count really comes through in the aroma, without overwelming the balance of the beer. The flavor of the grains still come through, creating a wonderful beer that can be enjoyed pint after pint. This is my favorite beer at the Dodging Duck.
Dodging Duck Gunga Duck India Pale Ale;Boerne, Texas, United States;IPA;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;"Caramel and butterscotch malt (M); earthy, spicy, piney, grapefruit hops (M). Deep orange-amber color. Moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter flavor becomes a moderately sweet, moderately acidic, heavily bitter finish. Great mid palate butterscotch flavor. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: a great blend of noble and northwest hops."
Dodging Duck Gunga Duck India Pale Ale;Boerne, Texas, United States;IPA;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;A very good IPA. Ray didnt throw yard clippings into his IPA like many micros like to do. It remained true to the English version of the style--even though it had 73 IBU, the mellow malts came through to balance everything out nicely. Very full and rich, notes of alcohol has it warmed. I actually took a growler of this stuff to a football party that evening....yum! Hook em!
Goose Island Ceres Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught: Dangerously light yellow, with a slight musty scent in the air and maybe some wood chips. A beer for those looking for fizzy water, with a the possiblity of alcohol.
Goose Island Ceres Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A blander-styled American Wheat...nobody quite knows what to do with this wide-open-for-interpretation style. Yellow, slightly hazy with a hoppy citric nose. Lightbodies and thin, grainy malt is barely there, but a nice orange-peel hoppy end quenches my thirst! This style as a whole is pretty weak.
Goose Island Ceres Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A hazy lemon-juice yellow with a small head. The aroma is mostly non-existent, but does provide slight glimpses of mediocrity. The flavor does have some malt acting as a backbone. Partially wheat and partially grain, I didn't really get a whole lot from this. The end does have a strong hop finish, reminiscent of the Gumballhead, but it without the depth of character. A Goose Island beer crafted for the masses, if even them.
Goose Island Ceres Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Kind of picking up where Oberon or Sierra Nevada leads in ""American Wheat"". Relatively thin malt profile, with a bit of tanginess from the wheat, covered with a blast of citric hops that seemed ham-fisted to me. But then, I'm not a lover of Oberon either."
Goose Island Ceres Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Wrigleyville: A new wheat beer from the Goose, it's not a hefe but more like an American but still not that either. A British wheat? The beer had a hazy golden hue but no head. The aroma was fruity and lemony but no banana and only slight spice. The hop character seems to be based on fuggles or another British hop. Some grain and honey notes. The taste was clean and crisp with a mild bitterness and slight spice undertone. The wheat is hardly noticeable until the twangy and acidic finish. The mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Okay unfiltered beer, not really sure what Goose Island was attempting here.
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Pours a red amber with a beige head that holds well. Fruity was cascade aroma with some light biscuity malt. Taste is very floral with some and pine, with a light malt backbone. Bready and biscuity. This is pretty much an IPA, without quite enough malt to make it so. One for the hop heads.
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;On tap at the Portland hotel. Very good hoppy APA. Aromas of grass and caramel. Taste is bitter, with good length. Palate is velvety, and medium bodied. Amber, with a frothy head.
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Draught. Very hopsy.. more like an IPA then a APA. Slightyl orange mid-amber color with a decent head and moderate lacing. definate floral hops in the nose and in the taste. Fairly bitter with a bit of citrus to balance. Good brew.
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;...weird, hopped out beer. The flavor is too much, and overpowering, but a couple are alright. Spicy hop start, and finish, slightly dry and malty. I would drink this interesting beer again.
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Portland, Melbourne, Australia - Spring 2007 On tap Lots of flowers in the aroma A hint of caramel
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Drink this if you want to know what Amarillo hops taste like. Big grapfruit like flavours and aromas. Great for a few but I struggle to get past the second pint - pallate fatigue.
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;"I had this at James Squire in Melbourne as part of the ""tasting paddle"" of six beers. The other five -- Amber Ale, Golden Ale, India Pale Ale, Porter and The Criac -- were all very pleasant, but this one really stood out. So I followed the paddle with a pint. The fruitiness as it goes down is delicious and that beautiful hoppy aftertaste stays with you for ages afterwards. A really delightful beer."
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;"Australia�s hoppiest beer? The current batch at the Melbourne Portland Hotel brewhouse may well be. The abv has dropped to 4.9%, but this packs plenty of punch. Why don�t they bottle this, rather than the insipid Hop Thief? This demonstrates that the brewers can produce something special when the suits let them. Better than Little Creatures? I think so, marginally. It has more guts and flavour. That said, a couple of pints was ample - this may be the first beer in Australia where ""hop burn"" might be a hazard after a session. Bravo! It�s a hazy bright orange-gold with a lacing head. The aroma is all grapefruit rind and pineapple juice. In the mouth, it�s tart and resinous - almost sticky in the finish. Thick Amarillo flavours of grapefruit and passionfruit. Not much in the way of malt that I could discern - this is all about the hops. Haven�t seen this at the Sydney brewhouse. Apparently it�s only occasionally available in Melbourne, which seems nuts. Thanks Mullet for introducing me to this tasty treat. (Draught at Portland Hotel brewhouse, Melbourne, with Mullet)"
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Brilliant fruity pale ale. great hoppy aromas and bitterness, the style is similar to most JS beers where the sweet front palate initial taste transfers to a rather hoppy aftertaste. The herbal/hoppy resinous aftertaste is most enjoyable in this one.
James Squire Brewhouse Speculator;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Light caramel, good lacing (again). Slightly cloudy. Citrusy nose with floral notes. Big hop driven palate in the Australian context. Aromatic, green herbal notes, finishes a touch hard in the nicest possible way. Good stuff from a generally over-rated producer.
James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;On tap at the Docklands Brewhouse. Served a light golden color with a fair head that fades to some lacing. Aroma is a faily mild citrus and some malt sweetness with a hint of fruit in the background. Taste of mild citrus and some malt sweetness with a trace of fruit in the background. Mild bitterness and a dry finish.Fairly llight body, quite smooth and not much else. Decent beer that seems pretty generic and doesn�t have a much character.
James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;Glass on tap, nice golden colour. Very smooth hops. Very nice pale ale, perfect for a patio on a warm day
James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;virtually the same as governor king and portland pale, although portland does have a bit more flavour from the hops
James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;Tap. No much better than your usual pale lager. Aromas of apple and cardboard. Flavour is very sweet, with light bitterness. Thin and watery palate. Yellow colour, bubbly, with a thin white head.
James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;Draught at James Squire Brewhouse, Docklands, Melbourne. Pours clear golden with a small white head. Grain, citrus and honey. Low bitterness. It�s crisp in the mouthfeel but a rather forgettable beer.
James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;Draught at the Brewhouse (Pint). Arrived a hazy pale gold with a small, creamy, white head which was average lasting. Aroma was of floral hops (mild) with sweet grainy malts, honey, mandarin, lemon, pineapple and hints of creamy pear. Flavor was a light floral hop bitterness with sweet grain-like malts, lemon rind, honey and suggestions of lychee. Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, dry mouthfeel, watery texture and an average finish. I had this awhile back before my rate beers days, it didn�t impress me then and it has not impressed me this time around, it is pretty much James Squire�s attempt of Coopers pale ale only at $8+ per pint.

James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;From the Melbourne brewhouse. Served very cloudy light golden with a creamy white head. Heaps of diacetyl in the aroma, as well as some flowery hops and sugary sweetness. Mild body, and restrained bitterness. Flavours of butter and malt, some spicy hops are perhaps present too. This is almost bad, but what can you do when they don�t have the speculator on tap.
James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;peachy aroma and front palate lead in to a nice bitter aftertaste. The appearence is quite hazy due to a lack of filtering and is overall quite enjoyable beer to be had with the lads, but at the same time can see why it isn�t bottled.
James Squire Brewhouse Docklands Pale Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;Sweet malt hop aroma. Murky amber colour with good head and lacing. Sweet malt flavour with spice and flowers. Smooth palate.
Poltava Aj-Nikola;Poltava, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Poltavpivo;1.5l plastic bottle. Pours gold with honey aorma and honey flavor, malt dough, not overly sweet.
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);An average Pale considering the Feral wheat and white are tops. Lacks drinkabilty. Well balanced.
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);"This along with the stout was my favourite of the Feral offerings. Strongly reminiscent of Little Creatures, this is a very ""hopped up"" pale ale, with generous floral hops dominating the nose and the palate. I thought it was excellent with loads of hop flavour."
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);We are a bit spoilt in this flavour profile now, specially because this state produces the fine Lttle Creatures. This has a similar promise but it doesn�t come through with the goods. There is a hint of the APA but if it is to be called such a beer the assertiveness should be more prominent.
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Re-rate 08/08/05 - Tasted on draught at my usual watering hole, the historic Guildford Hotel, Guildford, late on a wintry Sunday. Poured a clear pale amber with a short and loose bubbly white head that left a little lace. Light grassy and citric hop aroma, not much there that I could make out as I was surrounded by Sunday revellers. Quite creamy in the mouth, fruity and lightly yeasty across the palate (a lot different from my first tasting!). Mixture of pale soft fruits, melons, peaches and apricots, lightly bitter and grassy in the back before a reasonably long tangy fruit swallow. Medium light in body and carbonation, it had an odd woody malt note that came in towards the end of the pint. Nice balance, refreshing and thirst quenching, it is still a great light quaffer that seems to have evolved for the better. A decent APA.
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);On tap at brewery: This one was considerably better than the pils. Very faintly hazy gold amber with a large off white head. Aroma has lychee passionfruit and floral nectar. Medium bitter floral hop and light biscuity sweet malts flavour mirroring aroma. Clean crisp drying finish. Not bad.
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);light floral aroma. dark amber, small creamy head, high carbonation. floral and lightly fruity hop and sweet chocolate malt flavours. medium body, light drying bitterness.
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Heavy, sweet tropical flavours are a little overpowering for my tastes, however it had a quality malt flavour, pity about all the cascade.
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Englishy hops. A decent swigger. We all seem to like that here at the Brisbane festival of beers. Decent hop bite, fresh pale malt. Almost little creaturesy.
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);nothing out of the ordinary, just a well-made pale ale. plenty of cascade in the aroma and a little lychee. silky texture, lighty rasping finish
Feral Pale Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);An improved version of the creditable Little Creatures. This American style makes a great impression on the first glass. I'm biased towards ales so rate this as Ferals best but know a few who highly rate his wheat.
Poltavpivo Vakula;Poltava, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Poltavpivo;Light bronze color, medium white-to-beige head. Aroma of paper and rusty iron. Bitter (not hoppy bitterness), dusty, unclean palate. It was first and only try...
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);my father was an alcholic and drank this beer. as a ten year old i knew this was a bad, bad beer. glad it is no longer available.
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);NO longer produced. As with most Big breweries who decide to axe a local brand and replace it with a mass market brew, they simply degraded the brew over a few years then discontinued it on the pretext that sales had declined. Of course they had. Self fulfilling prophecy. I drank it in the Early 1980s on tap and it was an excellent beer.
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);M y old home town,and why I drank Caslemaine xxxx, it always tasted green,it was an awful bitter taste had no class,it made me dry reach on a good day.Had a brother called NQ lager or commonly called NQ spew,they were bad.
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Meh... OK off tap, not so from the bottle. It is dissapointing that so many pubs make this their main tap beer...
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);this is easily the worst beer I have ever had that was not dry hoped. This beer tastes like it is made with peanut skin rather than hops.
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Yellowish in colouring with a small white head. Hint of a sweet fruity aroma. Crisp and refreshing ....... at first, until the metallic, watery, putrid, bad, old-decayed bread sort of taste smacks you in the head. Never again on this one.
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Those blokes up in eefencue are bloody proud of themselves. They don't mind a bit of hard yakka and think nothin of helpin their mates. At the end of a day where they have been cuttin cane, chasin rodents from the pile and jest gettin bloody filthy, whadda they want? A bloody beer. Not one of them poofy ones that the southerners drink but. Not for them the pissant Carlton Cold or that new bloody queer drink Empire neither. Nup, there is only one beer for these blokes, and that'a a Cairns Draught. Its gotta be sweet to put back all that sweat that they've pumped out. Its gotta be made of local stuff so they can proudly say that they helped to make this beer taste the bloody way it bloody does. On yer fellas, not only can you not spell beer ya bloody don't drink it either. But who bloody cares, after 16 of these what does it matter what you've been drinkin? The energy to slap the missus around comes from that beaut cane sugar not from some poofy booteeky beer that has them foreign soundin hop names in em.
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);it's great that they're proud of their local sugar, but perhaps they could have put some barley in too. creamy icing sugar head. first gulp is refreshing and each gulp thereafter tastes more and more like dishwashing detergent
Cairns Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Reminded me of Red Stripe a hell of a lot, only with the genral crappy metal and POR flavour of most Aussie crap , i guess similiarity with Red stripe, is due to the fact that they both use cain sugar or something? Sweet, light and thin, finish is watery and non-eventful, lightly crisp, but pretty bad in the end.

Feral White;Baskerville, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);"Poured a hazy pale golden colour with a one-finger white frothy head that retained OK but laced poorly. Carbonation medium to high with medium to coarse bubbles that are a bit fizzy on the tongue; a bit gassy. Aroma of cloves, sweet wheat and hints of yeast. Taste slightly sweet with slight cloves and a hint of citrus. Light body. Smooth, crisp and refreshing with a quite plain finish. Easy to drink."
Feral White;Baskerville, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);330ml bottle as part of a four pack. Poured into a Hoegaarden glass. Nice nose with yeasty earthy tones. Appearance is of a very pale yellow. Taste - out of the four beers I felt I had two nice ones and two that weren�t (had over several days). Can�t say what caused the difference, but two tasted highly carbonated and low on flavour with a metallic/sour aftertaste and the other two had more herb flavours, better mouthfeel and a long nice slightly sweet finish.

Feral White;Baskerville, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Quite offensive. A salty, metallic aftertaste overwrites what few positives this beer possesses.
Feral White;Baskerville, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Taken bottled 33 cl. cold from Liquor Store in Murwillumbah. Appearance: pale yellow, haze and cloudy. White foam disappeared quickly. A hint of sourness and spicy in aroma, confirmed lately in taste. It seems more a saison yeast strain than a witbier/blanche one. Probably fermented at higher temperatures. Citrous and spicy flavour but with some tart that, with overcarbonation, unbalance the palate. Could be better but is drinkable. could work with a pure saison strain.

Karg Dunkles Hefe-Weissbier;Murnau, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Karg;Ein richtig uriges Bier, das ordentlich tr�� ist und das auch einen dementsprechenden Geschmack zu bieten hat: Ordentliche Fruchtaromen und eine leichte Bitterkeit, welche schnell im Malz untergeht.

Karg Dunkles Hefe-Weissbier;Murnau, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Karg;Pours dark brown with a massive beige head. Taste is grain, corn, some sweetness, balanced by a very subtle bitterness and slightly boozy note. Quite drinkable.
Karg Dunkles Hefe-Weissbier;Murnau, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Karg;Bottle opened and resealed an hour before. Brown with a foamy to frothy light tan crown. Aroma is banana, almond, and light chocolate. Taste seems at odds with the smell�sour more than sweet and with hints of acidity at the finish. Body is medium, carbonation is moderate to mild. Decent but an odd one.

Quite citrussy for a dunkeles Weizen: Grapefruit, lime. Floral hoppy notes, minimum banana and clove, a bit malt. Acidic sourness, slightly bitter.

Intense aroma of Ovaltine and banana. I expected it to be sweeter, when in pact there�s a pronounced almost fruity bitterness. Finish is rather short, with chocolate notes in the aftertaste.

Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Very much in the UK bitter style with midly floral hoppy notes, but generally the beer is focused on the malt backbone. Boring.
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;"Tasted 5/3/2014. Draught at ""Wig & Pen"", Canberra. Poured a cloudy light amber with a one-finger white bubbly head that retained very well. Lacing poor to nil. No carbonation (just like an English bitter). Aroma with sweet fruity hops and maybe a hint of malt. Taste of subtle (if lucky) sweet caramels and no real bitterness. Light body with a watery mouthfeel. Smooth, clean with a light finish. Ordinary."
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;"Old notes 11/2/09 Hand pump cask at Brewery, Canberra Attractive looking pale gold beer holding a creamy white head. Mild aroma; subtle earthy hops and light biscuity malt. Somewhat light bodied, lowish carbonation, a bit of creaminess to the texture. Once again, not a whole heap on the body but nice enough; husky toasted cereal malts, earthy, spicy, slightly vanillary hops. Light bitterness to finish. Easy drinking bitter, could be maltier but it�s good to get a hand-pumped beer anywhere in Australia."
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Cask at the brewpub. Didn�t get much of this, as the cask ran out, but what I had gave me an impression. Pours a clear gold, with a creamy head. Aroma was a light citrus. Taste was citrus, nutty, and bready. Quite average, but I would like to try it again properly.
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Hand pump. Pours clear gold with a thick persistent head. Subdued slightly hoppy aroma. Subdued slightly hoppy flavour. Light bodied, soft carbonation with a mild finish.
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;On a recent visit to Canberra, it was a pleasure to consume this hand-pumped cask-conditioned real ale-style beer that is served at the brewpub. It pours pale golden with a moderate white head that laces nicely on your pint glass. The nose and flavour is lightly fruity with a biscuity malt backbone and a light hop bitterness to the finish. Light bodied with a low carbonation and a rather thin texture. It is not the most bitter Bitter you will ever taste but it is still enjoyable and highly sessionable.
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at Wig & Pen, Canberra. Poured hazy but once settled it was golden with a creamy white head. Aroma of bready malt, honey and citrus. The flavour is bread, honey and citrus. Smooth mouthfeel with a lingering bitterness. Very drinkable.
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at the brewhouse Reddy amber body with one finger of a white head. An english style beer that you could have a big session of without it catching up with you. More of a bitter than a golden ale, served on hand pump at room temperature. Enjoyable!
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at the brew house. Arrived a very pale, clear yellow with golden highlights, and a small white head which lasted ok. Aroma was sweetish with honey malts, hints if maple syrup and very light citrus in the back. Taste again was sweet with more honey, light straw, a slight muskyness, and the feared wet cardboard in the back. Light body, dry texture and short finish.
Wig & Pen Bulldog Best Bitter;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;A nice gentle english style ale served at room temp. Quite sweet but attractive till the end. Could benefit further from some hopping up to give it more spice.
Blue Cat Classic Czech Pilsner;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Golden color with very little head. Light tasting with next to no aftertaste. Good Enough for me.
Blue Cat Illinois Common Replicale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Blue Cat Brew Pub;On tap at the brewpub. A very strange beer. I�m not sure what this is supposed to be. It does not appear top match the style at all. Thick creamy head, grapefruit/citrus lingering taste. Tart and sparkly aftertaste. A serious chill haze is going on here as well.
Blue Cat Illinois Common Replicale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Very red looking with a good head and lacing. It didn't really have a smell to speak of. It had a small fruit aftertaste.
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draft at the brew pub. Poured a dark black pour with a brown, medium sized head. Aroma is roasted coffee, caramel notes, bitter chocolate here. Flavor was sweet, roasted malts, caramel notes.
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;this was probably my favorate out of the 6 flight sampler.It was dark rich velvety smooth chocolatey with a balanced sweetness not to dry in finish but clean with a balanced bittering.This one is probably the only worth really having a pint of unless some of their other seasonal/specialtys are better,but the yearlys are pretty average.
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Growler. Very dark black pour, lasting cookie colored head and a nice chocolate aroma. Flavor is rich creamy roasted chocolate, a little smoke, vanilla and finished dry. Really damn good!
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Had on tap at the brewpub awhile back. A bit light for the style, but drinkable, and not too bad.
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Black Color with Milky Chocolate Head. Great Head Retention. Sweet Chocolate and Malted Aroma. Subtle Coffee Roasts... Nice Even Creamy Mouthfeel. Dry Chocolate..Initially Sweet, While Quickly Drying...Dry Unsweet Chocolate Powder Aftertaste. Clean, Smooth and Balanced.

Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;i was at the blue cat for lunch and who can resist an imperial stout on a cold day in february.....no surprises here.....dark rich stout....not over done.......very drinkable for this style of beer
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;My first beer from Blue Cat. On draft at the brew pub. Dark black pour with a pretty dark head as well. Aroma and flavor of roasted coffee, caramel, and overall just very sweet. Not quite an imperial stout IMO, but a solid stout nonetheless.
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draught at the brewery. Very smoky and burnt nose, oily charred wood scents, with campfire wood and malted milk balls. Texture is thinner than most, thinner than expected (7.5%), but that�s okay as long as you can accept this beer as a higher ABV sweet stout, not an imperial stout. Silky texture as well, bubbly, frothy but not fizzy, like chocolate mousse. Has some cheesy notes as well, like chocolate cheesecake. Robust, sweet, chalky, with some cherry chocolate flavors, vinuous at times. The look on this beer is very attractive - dark solid black body with a rich, dark coffee colored head.
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draught at the brew pub. Looked like motor oil as it drained out of the tap and into my glass. On close inspection it was opaque and black with an attractive thick brown head that left plenty of lace on the glass. Looks good. Smells good too with chocolate, anise, and roasted malt aromas accented by a hint of molasses. Tasted of malty dark chocolate, roasted coffee, toffee, and a hint of whiskey. Full bodied with a touch of sweetness and light roasty bitterness on the tongue. Very good beer. One of the best I�ve had at this place.
Blue Cat Bowfish Imperial Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blue Cat Brew Pub;hand bottle from Duane, lots of coffee and toast aroma coming off a deep black body, very little head, but that could be an affect of the time in the bottle that it spent. flavor was real nice and smooth, coffee, toast, hints of chocolate. a great roast flavor and roasty aftertaste, not overwhelming in the coffee department either, which is a moderately welcome change. thanks duane.
Bonfire Dunkelweizen;Northville, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bonfire Bistro and Brewery;Unimpressive color of blackish brown with some earthy tinges. Quite clear. Aroma is slightly sweet, with a bit of peppery spice. Begins moderately malty, low acidity and slight pepper notes. Quickly flattens out and becomes a mix of honey and spicy fruits. A little bit of decent wheat taste present. Still thins out and dries out towards end. Only a medium body at best, but the flavor combo and style was innovative for this brewery. Probably one of the better ones they make (not saying much).
E9 Imperial Pale Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;E9 Brewing Co.;Didn�t strike me as an IIPA, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Nice hoppy aroma, floral notes and grapefruit and prevalent with a soft underlying bready malt notes. Pours light hazy golden with a thin lasting head and great lacing. Mostly hop forward notes of perfume and citrus. Touch of soft malt sweetness. Long lingering dryness, almost very refreshing.
E9 Imperial Pale Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;E9 Brewing Co.;This is a very nice try, but a tremendous failure as far as I am concerned when it comes to this style. I realize the tendency is to reach for the sky and bigger is better, but al so is balance, and this is so over the top when it comes to the hops that it is almost hard to drink, because even though the aroma matches the flavor, that aspect is balanced, but there is such a light balance of malt to back up that resiny hoppiness, it makes the beer so bitter because of the wrong choice in hops varietals for what they were trying to make. So overall that makes this a very imbalanced beer in so many aspects that far outweigh the positives. Next please...
E9 Imperial Pale Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;E9 Brewing Co.;Amber with long lasting beige head.Light hop nose.Light citrus hop profile ,medium strength lasting hop finish. A middle of the road Imperial
E9 Imperial Pale Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;E9 Brewing Co.;Typical amber body with an off-white head. Aroma is hoppy and so is the flavour. However, this hops with little malt balance. Rather bitter throughout.
E9 Imperial Pale Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;E9 Brewing Co.;Before this last year I hadn't had too many annihilatingly bitter beers, but as imperial IPAs and double dry-hopped IPAs are making successful appearances across the U.S. more and more breweries are making their own high IBU beers. This imperial pale ale is one of those that failed miserably, trying not to produce a huge amount of flavor, but rather a huge amount of sensation. In other words, this beer smells of hops, but the fact my tongue is constantly seeking refuge in the back of my skull makes it rather hard to taste them. This Imperial craze needs to end. No America...bigger is not always better.
E9 Tacoma Brew;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E9 Brewing Co.;Gold body with medium white head. Light grass aroma. Tastes hoppier than a European pilsner with a citrus note. Crisp finish
E9 Tacoma Brew;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E9 Brewing Co.;Engine House No. 9, Tacoma. Cloudy pale yellow, stringy foam. Sweet hoppy aroma. Nice flavors, a little bitter and grass, but body is lacking. Clean, ok drinker. But not a standout. Good flavor on finish.
E9 Tacoma Brew;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E9 Brewing Co.;On tap at Engine House # 9 in Tacoma-USA. Cloudy yellow bright pour, white foam adhesive.

E9 Tacoma Brew;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E9 Brewing Co.;Keg at the brewpub, 07/11/14. Clear golden with a moderate off white covering.

So so GB.

E9 Tacoma Brew;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E9 Brewing Co.;Draught@Engine No, 9 brewpub, Tacoma, WA Clear golden color, small white head. Not much aroma, some light maltyness. Light-bodied. Dusty, a bit woody hoppyness. Light lingering Saaz bitterness in the finish. Not the most interesting beer, not much going on.
E9 Saison;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;E9 Brewing Co.;Draft pour at Brouwers. Pours a light cloudy golden color with a quick fading fizzy head. Mild yeast aroma. Sweet candy Belgian yeast flavor up front with a more empty in flavor finish. Light body with a little more sweet than there is spice. Not bad.
E9 Saison;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;E9 Brewing Co.;Dark orange pour fizzy head. Aroma of vinegar, belgium yeast. Tastes like stale toasted yeast and slight apple cider vinegar. Terrible.
E9 Saison;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;E9 Brewing Co.;I actually had this at the Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery in Puyallup WA, which is the sister brewpub to Engine House No. 9. I have never had a saison before so this was a new experience for me. I liked it. The color was golden straw, looking very much like a pint of apple juice with a thin white head that had good staying power. Only a minor amount of lacing. Light bodied with slightly fizzy carbonation. Flavor was sweet and fruity and floral with hints of spices I am finding hard to place. Cloves? Coriander? Cardamom? It also had a slight caramel and nutty character lurking in the background. I had this with the Powerhouse�s Fish Taco, which was a perfect food for the saison. The spiciness of the taco nicely complemented the spices of the ale and pulled them further to the forefront. Intriguing.
E9 Saison;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;E9 Brewing Co.;Other than the gummy Belgian yeast there wasn't a whole lot happening here. There is a trace of malt scraped as thin as can be, but that just may be my generousity speaking. This definitely suffers from some serious Westernization, where it may fit into the category technically but the essence of the beer is off in la-la land. I don't mean to get all Mr.Miagi on E-9, but it's not just a clean palate and a bunch of Belgian Yeast that makes a Saison. The subtleties are absolutely nowhere to be seen, and this is a purely linear beer.
Kraftbrau Malcoms Best Bitter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kraftbrau Brewery;Draugt at Kraftbrau Sept 27th 2003... Slight cloudy yellow. Slight beige head. Weak body. Not the best of the Krafbrau beers that I have had. Still decent though. Cheers to Vale for being a great hostess that night, made my trip to Kalamazoo quite enjoyable.
Broken Tooth Hefeweizen;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy golden orange color with a two finger white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Messy clingy lace. The aroma had some orange pulp, vanilla, and some banana sweetness. Clove, well, that leaves a bit to be desired. The flavor yields to the sweetness of the prior mentioned aromas. Weird aftertaste for a hefeweizen as it seems to engage some of that vanilla and almost have a little bit of pie-like flavor. Super sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a decent sessionable feel about it. Carbonation felt fairly light. ABV felt as projected by the brewer. Overall, if this a German hefeweizen, then I am Mickey Mouse. I usually like Broken Tooth beers, but well, hmmmmmm....I�m left scratching my beard on this one.
Broken Tooth Hefeweizen;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;An average American attempt. I get a bit of banana in the taste no cloves anywhere nose is fruity. Tasted good at the movie theater. A bit fizzy and yellow.
Broken Tooth Hefeweizen;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Hazy to cloudy golden yellow color. Aroma of citrus and banana. Taste is lemony banana.
Broken Tooth Hefeweizen;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Draught at Moose�s Tooth. Pours cloudy orange with a small, frothy white head, short retention with spare lacing. And some douchebag decided my glass needed a fucking lemon slice. Minus a hundred brazilion points for that shitty move. Aroma is earthy wheat malt, lemon (see previous rant), light bananas and cloves. How the fuck am I supposed to adequately decipher this American German Hefeweizen from all others with a lemon slice stuck on the glass? Flavor is tart lemon, earthy wheat malt, light bananas and spicy cloves with a dry, pithy lemon finish (thanks assbag). Light body and medium carbonation. This probably would not be any better without the damn lemon slice so I guess it is fine the junior Beer Advocate hipster put the fucking lemon slice on my glass.
Broken Tooth Hefeweizen;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub. Hazy yellow, minimal head. Aroma of malt and lemon citrus; similar taste. Light body with good carbonation. Decent hefe, fairly refreshing."

Aroma of wheat, banana, and light citrus. Flavor of lemon, banana, wheat, and some clove. Ok not great but it is aka ska and they are known more for their heavier beers. Still good.
Broken Tooth Hefeweizen;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;[Tap] Part of a sampler at the brewpub in early September. Pours a hazy light yellow color. Not much foam on top. Yeasty aroma of banana, mild citrus and distinct vanilla. Sweet and cloying Wheaties cereal background mingles with some bubblegum in the taste. Hints of oxidation. Was looking for more of a robust body here. I really like the style, but not this particular offering.
Broken Tooth Hefeweizen;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Pale neon yellow pour with a little lacing. Whet flavor with a good bite from the carbonation. A good refreshing beer, although it seems to be missing something I can�t quite put my finger on.

Gottberg All American Lager;Columbus, Nebraska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Gottberg Brew Pub;The body was lightly hazy pale gold. The aroma was hay and bread crust. The taste was bread crust with a bell pepper finish. Light and easy to drink, this accomplishes its goal.
Gottberg All American Lager;Columbus, Nebraska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Gottberg Brew Pub;This is a revival of an old, old brand originally made in Columbus Nebraska long, long ago. The bar in this brewery is designed to look like the inside of a Behlen grain storage bin. This is a brewpub version of a standard American Light lager. Not much head, drinks easy, more history here than beer. It fits the pilsener style without the crispness or hop content.
Gottberg All American Lager;Columbus, Nebraska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Gottberg Brew Pub;Draught: The color of this was the first unusual thing about it: it poured a cloudy light brown color. There wasn't much head to it, with no lacing. The aroma had definite hints of a sour fruitiness to it. It almost smelled like an air freshener. The taste wasn't much better. There was some sourness, some bitterness, and not much else. Don't know what they were after here, but they clearly missed.

Oyster Bar Oktoberfest;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;On Tap. The appearance was a large sized tan head that was creamy and smooth with fine sized bubbles that lasted for quite a long time. The body was uncarbonated, clear with a reddish hue. The nose was mostly malty with a hint of fruitiness. The flavor was lightly bitter tasting along with some spice. The palate was smooth and medium bodied. This beer had good lacing to it. All-in-all a pretty decent Oktoberfest/Marzen brewed at one of the two local breweries in my hometown.
Oyster Bar Oktoberfest;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;This brew poured a large head of foamy finely sized off-white colored lonfg lasting bubbles that left behind a good lace and a uncarbonated transparent orange brown colored body. The aroma was mildy malted and the mouthfeel was smooth while being slightly tingly. The flavoe was very nice with notes of malt, hops, and mellow spices. It was a bit thin and a bit doughy, but otherwise a fine brew.
Oyster Bar Oktoberfest;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;Looked like sweet tea on a southern afternoon. Malty nose like freshyly mowed grass, smooth drink with extra sweet finish. Am I on a wrap a around porch? Sure feels like it.
Oyster Bar Oktoberfest;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;One of the better Oktoberfest at the Indiana Brewers Guild Tasting. Toasty and caramelly malts. Medium bodied, long finish hinted of hops.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;Zwart bier met schuim wat snel wegzakt. Smaak is warm en licht bitter zoet met iets van koffie, kersen en bittere chocolade.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;Bottle. Amazing flavour, it really works for me. Aromas of liquorice, and roasted malt. Taste has a sweet start, with bitterness taking over for a long finish. Palate is velvety, with a medium-to-full body. Black colour, with a frothy white head.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;Poured from a 25.4oz bottle into an English pint at 45�. Color is a near black amber with good carbonation and a tall light tan head. Aroma of yeast, sweet fruits and roasted malt. Taste is crisp with a mild sweetness. Starting with a lighter medium body it goes down with a crisp feel. Finish is a mild malt sweetness that gives off flavors of raisin, vanilla and a light toffee taste then an easy bitterness rolls in. After taste is dry and slightly bland. Overall its a tasty brew but leans more on the Belgian flavors then Stout.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;...bottle into pint. Well, another weird beer from the place in the middle of nowhere. Weird burnt things on the nose, with some slight dark malt notes. Black color with a very small brown head that goes away quickly. Not smooth and creamy enough to be a real stout. It wasn�t too bad though considering, I mean it was alright, and drinkable. But I only had one, so I don�t really know. I bet it�s better on tap.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;Bottle. Pours a dark brown body with a tan head. Aroma and flavor is sweet malt. Some burnt malt in both aspects, no etoh. eh.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;Strong sweet malt aroma with candy sweetness. Black colour with cream head and goof lacing. Strong malt sweet flavour. Smooth palate.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;26 Jan 06 - Roasted malt and steely aromas. Black-brown colour, low headbut good suds lacing. Big steely slightly unpleasant flavour with some underlying roasted malt. bitter stout with lingering steely finish and a bit thin.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;Aroma of devon and assorted dodgy smoked small goods, a small amount of roast choc and green pinecones. Nice mouthfeel and presence, with some roasty character but the boiled meat flavour, very wrong tasting, just plain wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! No beer should taste like meat! Piney bitterness is a bit unpleasant on the finish.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;Black in body with light brown head. Soy sauce and harsh malt aromas. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, aniseed, floating particles, even burnt tar, Wheat in there ? Hints of Vegemite and pine, I like stouts but my home brew is probably a lot smoother and bitter.
Buffalo Stout;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Buffalo Brewery;Black colouration, brownish head. Spicy roasted malt aroma, with fruityness, cherry mainly. Toasted barley, very bitter, coffee, some fruit and choc, light yeastyness, but roasted malts are sickly strong.
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;Murky brown colour good head and lacing. Sweet malt bubblegum a. Sweet malt flavour with stale ashtray aftertaste. Smooth palate.
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;On tap at Boorhaman Hotel, pours a cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma and flavour brings out biscuity malt and light fruitiness. Also some weird chemical cleaner notes. Very bad.
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;On tap at the Buffalo Brewpub. Served a hazy copper color with a fair head that fades to some lacing. Aroma of grain with mild malt sweetness. Sort of a funky smell that is not too appealing. Taste is pretty bland with some mild malt sweetness, bit of fruit and grain. No defined bitterness and sort of a sticky finish. Light body. Not a lot going on here. Pretty dull generic beer.
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;Tap at brewery. Interesting and aromatic. Aromas of banana, citrus, bubblegum, and apple. Taste is sweet, with some sourness, and good length. Palate is thin and watery. Orange with a fizzy head.
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;...the best of the group, but still could be vastly improved. I guess it was supposed to be dark, but it was just a weird murly orangish yellow, with a small white head. there was some sediment in there too, but it wasn�t that yeasty. THe flavors were weird citrus notes, and not enough yeast at all, more dry wheat flavors. Not a great finish either. It was drinkable, but not even in the same galaxy as the big boys. Good try considering the location.
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;Murky orange, big white head... doesn�t hang around too long. Aroma is a bit like a saison, lots of funk, citrus and yeast. That funk is infection. Lightish body, leans more towards a lambic in the flavours, well done to them for managing to make an infected beer drinkable... It reminds me of a weaker version of some Jolly Pumpkin I tried yesterday. Oranges and funk hang along a long time after the last sip. Not bad, finished the bottle without too much hassle. Not your average hefe-wiezen, in fact its not a hefe-weizen at all.
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;"I�ve just re-read my old notes and am convinced I was drinking the wrong beer so I�ll have another go. Medium amber in colour, perhaps caramel brown. No head but big thick lacing early, spider web-like. Funny nose; harsh citrus notes with plenty of obvious clove aromas. Kinda ok but heavy handed as well. More hard citrus to taste and no shortage of spice and bitterness. In fact one could throw this in the intense �bucket� such is the bitter, hard citrus kick. Just a tad disjointed to really be enoyable."
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;NFOB 2004 - Golden, fair head. Clovey wheat, light banana, spicy bitterness, tart refreshing, citrus, orange and lemon, I thought it not to be a bad hefe, maybe its better on tap...
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;i guess this is what that woman whose name i forget who was the mistress of one of the kelly gang who may or may not have drunk at this pub at some time would have drunk if she ever came here. no interesting yeast qualities. light orange colour. syrup texture, plenty of wheat but no subtlety and nasty finish
Buffalo Wheat Beer;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buffalo Brewery;"supposedly a ""dark wheat beer"" but looks sort of light orange, cloudy. banana and a bit of dust in what there is of an aroma. taste is bland, watery, slightly grainy, with a rough POR kick as PEAK from Afghanistan might say."
Happy Valley Mission Ale Wit;Somerset, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Happy Valley Brewing Company (CA);Tap @ Small Brewers Festival. A hazy yellow orange color with a white head. A dry, mild, wheaty beer with an orange a light spice.
Happy Valley Mission Ale Wit;Somerset, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Happy Valley Brewing Company (CA);"Medium clear light orange. Not cloudy. Strong coriander, but somewhat sour, or ""off"". Watery, thin, tastes like bad soda or lemonade."
Broken Tooth Fairweather I.P.A.;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Served in a chilled glass (nice touch), nice IPA, as this is my first beer from this brewer. Looking forward to try some more.

Broken Tooth Fairweather I.P.A.;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Draft sample at Humpy�s in Anchorage pour light gold with thin white head. Might be a bad sample, but this one e smells like dirty dish water. No citrus, just watered down Dawn. Taste light citrus, and then watered down. Would like to try this again in the future.
Broken Tooth Fairweather I.P.A.;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;From a 12 oz can. Pours a cloudy copper with an off white head. Aroma of tropical fruits. Flavors of orange and pineapple. Bitter finish.
Broken Tooth Fairweather I.P.A.;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Can thanks to Shaun! Pours a near clear orange with a slight gold hue and a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of citrus with some light spice and some sweet grain backing. Flavor has a nice citrus note with a dry finish and some sweet grains supporting.
Broken Tooth Fairweather I.P.A.;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Draught at Bear Tooth. Pours cloudy orange with a large, frothy off-white head, long retention with good lacing. Aroma is pine, resin, and floral hops, biscuit malt and pear esters.

Broken Tooth Fairweather I.P.A.;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Draft at the theater. Hazy to cloudy golden color, thick white head. Aroma of orange and grapefruit. Taste is nicely balanced bittersweet grapefruit, orange and pineapple.
Broken Tooth Fairweather I.P.A.;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Pale cloudy. Clean, weak citrus nose. Sharp bitter start, fades too spicy pepper, then lingering bitterness. Strong carbonation.
Broken Tooth Fairweather I.P.A.;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Can. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting. Body is medium to dark yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (grain), moderately hoppy (resin, grapefruit/kumquat), with a light note of plastic. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic, lightly to moderately astringent. A pretty sour example, though I would not say this is infected...low pH water maybe. Simple raw hop odor, touch of plastic. Fairly average.
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;On tap at Boorhaman Hotel, pours a hazy dark reddish brown with a medium beige head. Aroma and flavour both have notes of infection, as it almost tasting like brett funk. Absolute trainwreck. Disgusting.
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Served a reddish-brown color with a small tan head that fades quickly to no lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, some chocolate and spice. tatste of roasted malt with a bit of chocolate and spice. Mild bitterness and a dry finish. Fairly light body, a bit smooth but has a few rough edges. Not too bad, but could be a bit more robust.
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;Tap. Good dunkel. Aromas of cola, and roasted malt. Taste is sweet, with a bitter finish, and average duration. Palate is velvety, with a medium body. Brown, with a frothy white head.
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;...bottle into pint. Hmm, on the nose was some weird roasted\bushfire notes. Color was dark murky brown with lots of weird sediment, the head was ok, but fell quickly with not much lacing. Flavors were mainly weird roasted malt notes with some slight spice and citrus hopnotes. Wasn�t too bad, but I guess it�s amazing given the location of the brewery. I went in there and the was actually a kangaroo sitting at the bar.
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;"Big head, fizzy, not dense. Leaves a �floater� formation. Light brown with a touch of ruby red in colour. Spice / lemongrass and citrus from the nose is quite striking, and as per my tasting of the lager would appear better placed on a wheat beer style. Not all good however as there�s a definate soapy touch coming through as well. Early flavours back the aroma observations; piercing citrus and spice (and soap). Sorta ok but nil traces of chocolate, roast etc that one may expect to see in a dark ale. Prefer others."
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;Only medium dark with a beige head. Large particles of yeast in circulation. Aroma has lots of cloves and other spices. Heavily roasted or burned coffee flavour. Slightly soapy aftertaste because I poured the yeast in.
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;Almost dark brown body with a fairly poor light tan head. Caramel on the nose and some burnt characters. Sultana, cocoa, a little licorice and a little salty with a milky body.
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;Er, I guess interesting is one word which may describe this one. Murky reddish brown colour, messy flavour of burnt caramel and smoke. I can�t say I�m a fan!
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;NFOB 2004 Poured a murky/cloudy red/brown with an average sized head. Aroma - mostly nutty chocolate and toasted malt. Light carbonation. Meduim body with a sticky texture. Flavours again nutty and chocolate, maybe a hint of smoke. Pretty good stuff.
Buffalo Dark Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buffalo Brewery;Salty, smoky, sea air whisky-type aroma with some cocoa powder and nail polish. Very roasty, burnt toast flavour, licorice with a salty, not bitter, finish. Very fizzy, poor head retention, opaque black colour.
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;On tap at Boorhaman Hotel, pours a hazy golden orange with a medium white head. Aroma brings out notes of straw and biscuity malt. Flavour is disgusting, with chemical cleaner notes. Tastes filthy and absolutely revolting. Embarrassing to serve this.
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;...bottle into pint from brewery. I don�t know how it happened, but this one came out alright. Like the others, I thought it would be a typical bullshit lager, but this had some weird malt flavors, that were actually pretty good. It�s just hard to explain these beers, it must have alot to do with the low quality water used, and environment. Too many off flavors, and traces of fecal matter take away from the ingredients.
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;"What a surprise packet! Masses of spice and citrus acorss the nose and palate; far more Belgian wit in style the the generic �lager� label gives credit for. Quality orange rinf, spice and ginger as well. Flavours finish a touch hard but this beer is quite good. Maybe they screwed up the labeling?"
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;Boring looking, honey coloured with a poor head. Sweet tasting as Carlton Draught but even more watered down, roundness from the Wheat ? A tickle of grainy bitterness but only faint, maybe too much malt, some grains on the nose 2.2
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;Cloudy amber colour with big white head. Very little aroma but tasted like tropical babanas. (Again thanks to Mullet)
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;"I asked myself ""Why would a microbrewery attempt a lager?"" Isn't that why we drink micros? To get away from the lager taste? This was bad and didn't taste unlike Carlton Draught."
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;Wow - interesting to see how poorly this beer has been rated. I didn't think it was all that great, but it was OK. I was expecting a standard Aussie lager type beer, but this certainly wasn't that. Aroma of chocolate malt (which is odd) and a fair bit of nail polish. Really quite a chunky malt flavour with REALLY rough bitterness. Orange colour with really good head retention. Full body. Very rough but interesting drinking.
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;Chist almighty! This was infected for sure. Horrible astringency and turnips all over the place. Try another beer.
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;disturbing manure aroma but the brewery is right in the middle of a lot of agriculture. tasted of white grape and detergent, limp and funny
Buffalo Lager;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buffalo Brewery;murky yellow. watery, tasteless, apart from weird dirty aftertaste. pretty difficult to get through a glass. beers like this give you a new respect for carlton draught etc.
Buffalo Ginger Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Flavored - Other;Buffalo Brewery;On tap at Boorhaman Hotel, pours a cloudy blonde with a medium white head. Aroma brings out subdued ginger notes and biscuity malt. Flavour is sweet and gingery, with artificial sickly sweet ginger. Nasty stuff.
Buffalo Ginger Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Flavored - Other;Buffalo Brewery;Tap at brewery. Not bad. Aroma of ginger, but also some sulfur. Taste is sweet and tart. Palate is oily, and medium bodied. Yellow, cloudy, with a thin white head.
Buffalo Ginger Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Flavored - Other;Buffalo Brewery;...bottle from the brewery. I could not believe how sweet this was, it just did not taste right at all. My mouth was taken off guard by the first swig. It had some ginger on the nose, and in the flavor, but, it was wayy too thick, sugary, I don�t even know. I wouldn�t have this ever again for any reason. I finished it, but hey, when you�re all the way out there, you have to try one out in the middle of burgerton, or whereever it was. Not good.
Buffalo Ginger Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Flavored - Other;Buffalo Brewery;Bit like Twenty 20 cricket really - hard to take seriously. Very weird head action - heaps of fizz upon pouring that disolves at record pace. Light orange / apricot in colour. Sweet soft drink nose, heapys of sugary notes. Palate is mega sweet and its very hard to pick the alcohol. Masses of sugar sweetness although to be fair there is some well defined ginger flavours. Too sweet to be of much use to anyone.
Buffalo Ginger Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Flavored - Other;Buffalo Brewery;Lemon/orange coloured body with a white head that tried to hang around the edges. Some ginger on the nose along with some off lemon. The sweetest of the 4 ginger beers that I tried together, not really refreshing enough for me, too sugary and too heavy. No I couldn�t really finish it.
Buffalo Ginger Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Flavored - Other;Buffalo Brewery;I didn't know to expect when I tried this. I guess I waslooking for an ale that had a hint of ginger flavour to it. Wrong! It is sickly sweet and I could only have two mouthfuls before pouring the rest down the sink. Awful.
Buffalo Ginger Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Flavored - Other;Buffalo Brewery;A bit wrong. I'm not much of a fan of ginger beers and this was done pretty poorly. It's like something your grandma would give you. Ihad weird leger yeasty-like stuff floating in it too.
Buffalo Ginger Ale;Boorhaman, Victoria, Australia;Flavored - Other;Buffalo Brewery;even by australian ginger beer standards, this is very sweet. lemonade with extra sugar and some ginger lollies. just too sweet to be refreshing

Pizza Port Six Pence Scotch Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pizza Port (San Clemente);A brownish/red hue. Similar to a bock in flavor with the malty/caramel sweetness dominating. A very tasty beer considering its right around 8.5%. The alcohol is hidden extremely well. Sweet but not cloyingly so. A very nice offering.
Pizza Port Six Pence Scotch Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pizza Port (San Clemente);Sampled @ Strong Ale Fest San Diego The beer poured a transparent deep brown color with a modest tan head that was frothy on texture with a relatively decent sheet of lace to conceal the glass. Malt dominated nose, sweet and fresh, hints of caramel, almost fruity in some respects, start was sweet with a nice malt profile, the top a tad thin. Finish had a nice amount of carbonation and the hops forthright in their bite, sweet and dry aftertaste, I must admit to being a bit disappointed in this beer.
Pizza Port Six Pence Scotch Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pizza Port (San Clemente);My first beer from the san clemente branch of one of my favorite breweries. This one had a big alcohol bite to it and had a sick amount of caramel malt in the body. I also noticed some fruits in it. Impressed indeed.
Pizza Port Six Pence Scotch Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pizza Port (San Clemente);A nice caramel color with a cool ruby hue. The head was thin, but persistent, and a creamy off-white color. The aroma was an interesting blend of citrusy hops, creamy caramel, a bit of smoke and nutty/grainy malt. The flavor was basically as predicted with a full malt profile and a bit of a hop kick in the finish to make things interesting. With a nice, smooth mouthfeel, this was a tasty, straight forward Scotch ale that accompanied the pizza rather well.
Craiova Bruna;Craiova, Romania;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Craiova (Heineken Romania);Draught in Chisinau, Moldova. Extremely dark and aromatic beer with strong caramel and coffee aroma. Very flavorful as well: huge quantities of dark malts, sweet caramel and bitter chocolate. Superb.

Broken Tooth Midtown Brown;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Brown Ale;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Poured into a mug, the appearance was a semi-dark brown color with some red hues along the sides. A finger�s worth of white foamy head started and died off at a fairly nice pace. Messy lace. The aroma had some chocolate, sweet and somewhat milky, with a mild bready malt with some dark fruits and a touch of earthy hops. The flavor keeps the same previously mentioned aromas to hit a nice blend into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with fair sessionable sort of smooth milky/creamy feel. Decent carbonation. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, good brown ale worthy of having again.

Pours standard copper with a fluffy white head. Nose is soft bready malts and faint noble hops. Nothing really too stimulating. Some goes for the taste, generic munich notes with a crispness to it that keeps it refreshing. Still, I had a ton of O-fests at GABF and this was one of the least memorable. Okay.

Medium-bodied; Assertive malt in the flavour with some lighter german tasting hops and some subtle sweetness and a more pronounced spiciness. Aftertaste shows some spices, but mainly malty tastes that leave the mouth fairly dry. Overall, a good marzen with a touch of spices and some minor sweetness.

Broken Tooth Arctic Wit;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;On tap. Not sure how this ended up in the fruit beer category. Cloudy yellow with a white head. The coriander is the most notable aroma but hints of wheat, clove and pepper are there too. The flavor is a wheaty malt backbone with a slight yeasty sourness. Fairly light bodied with a thin watery mouth feel. This beer is pretty light but has a decent amount of flavor.
Broken Tooth Arctic Wit;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Looked nothing like a wit (clear amber color), but sure tasted like one. The banana and spices dominated the flavor in the most extreme example I�ve seen. I hardly smelled or tasted the apricot at all, but that was alright as the other showings were so strong and enjoyable. If they put a little more work into this beer they could be top of the style (wit, not fruit).
Broken Tooth Arctic Wit;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;"On draft at the brewpub 7/6/05: Clear golden and moderately active. Smooth and silky and sweet like honey corn flakes. Little to no wheat or yeast tones; a bit off style."
Broken Tooth Arctic Wit;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Slightly hazy medium gold. Served with no head. Big coriander aroma. Soft body. Fleshy fruit flavors (must be the apricot) solid wheat. Great witbier. I thought there was an apricot element before I realized it was brewed with apricots, but the fruit in this is so subtle and balancing the rest of the beer it could have been an aspect of the malt and yeast instead of actual fruit. One of the best witbiers I�ve had in a long time.
Broken Tooth Arctic Wit;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;"(Draft: Moose�s Tooth Brewing Company in Anchorage AK) Very Belgian character in flavor and nose, but still not all that pleasing to drink; The flavor is mostly spicy coriander, minimally sweet, but very subtle apricot; The aroma is mostly spicy, and again, very little apricot; Light bodied, fairly dry on the palate; Pale yellow in color with a slight orange tint and slightly cloudy; Off-white head fades to nothing within a few minutes"
Kraftbrau Cherry Cordial;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kraftbrau Brewery;Draught at Kraftbrau Sept. 27th 2003... Large white frothy head was the first thing I noticed. Cherry and malts in the aroma. Very cherry. Like a cough syrup. Cherry sweet however it does have good body. Natural cherry extract was used. Dispite my high ratings I didn't really enjoy this one. It looked good and had a good look to it but overall not that great for me. Cheers to Vale for being a great hostess and making my visit to Kalamazoo enjoyable.

Castlemaine XXXX Light Bitter;Milton, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"375ml bottle. Pale straw colour and thin and watery to look at with a soft white head of foam. Clear but poorly carbonated. Basic aroma of malt and hops. Label says ""full flavoured"" but doesn�t say full of what. Thin, flavourless and very poor."
Castlemaine XXXX Light Bitter;Milton, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I couldnt get the ratings down to -10. This beer is like very slightly beer flavoured, carbonated water. It is absolute shyte! I cant believe they sell it for the same price as XXXX Gold. Surely there isnt a market for this bottle of cats piss. I cant believe this is being brewed in QLD. If you want a light beer that is very slightly flavoured, go for a cascade light.. do not waste your hard earned on this!
Castlemaine XXXX Light Bitter;Milton, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I couldn�t finish the bottle, this is really bad. Hoppy aroma, thin bodied, bitter throughout. Look after your health and drink bottled soda water instead.
Castlemaine XXXX Light Bitter;Milton, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Recently renamed XXXX Light during a brands �tweaking� exercise by Lion Nathan.

Castlemaine XXXX Light Bitter;Milton, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Aaaaah, now this is what a light beer should be like. Weak, thin and pathetically wanting in a number of important respects. Thanks for keeping the faith Castlemaine Perkins.
Castlemaine XXXX Light Bitter;Milton, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled. Golden body with a fine light white head. Bitter empty cats piss. If your palate can measure flavour at very high frequencies then perhaps you�ll catch the beer sensation at the very start, otherwise its just coloured soda water.
Castlemaine XXXX Light Bitter;Milton, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Oh dear. Think XXXX Bitter, then downgrade to XXXX Gold and XXXX Light Bitter is even fursther down the scale still. If I lived in Queensland and didn't feel like a heavy, I'd go for Gold over this, but neither has any taste.
Castlemaine XXXX Light Bitter;Milton, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);This beer has a light yellow body - hue with a bitter initial flavor and a light body.

Townsville Burdekin Gold;Townsville, Australia;Wheat Ale;Townsville Brewing Company;Clear gold. Smells of jersey caramels, and taste like that and caramel malt. Again a very bland flavour, with little in terms of body. Not terrible, but it just lacks any presence.
Townsville Burdekin Gold;Townsville, Australia;Wheat Ale;Townsville Brewing Company;Tap-National Festival of Beer, Brisbane 03: we were pretty desperate at this stage trying to find new beers to try.

Vormann Sauerl�nder Weizenbier Dunkel;Hagen-Dahl, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Vormann Brauerei;500ml bottle thanks to Kerlshtrinker. Many thanks! Poirs a misty orangey brown, medium off-white head. Aroma has some strange spicy herbal hints, cola, no weiz yeast. Taste presents quite a light body with a character that is more about overly-herbal cola and spice than any real weizenbier notes. Very strange and really did not expect this at all!

Vormann Sauerl�nder Weizenbier Dunkel;Hagen-Dahl, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Vormann Brauerei;500 ml bottle. BB 6/3/14. From my Wuppertaler Secret Santa. Thanks Erzengel! It doesn�t say if it�s Hell or Dunkel in the label but it looks pretty Dunkel... Dark reddish brown colour with a small white head. Wheat, yeast, mild sourness, bready malt, caramel sweetness and mild Christmassy spices... in the aroma. The flavour is wheaty, bready malty, mildly sour... very untraditional Weizen. Not necessarily the best ever. Very fizzy.

Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Just a really middle of the road pils. Almost macro like. Little of the grassy hops on the nose - more grainy than anything. Body is very straight forward, grains and cereal with a low, undistinct bitter finish.
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);"Tap at Local Taphouse: Just labelled ""Pilsner"", as on the website - not sure if it�s the same beer or not. Anyway, it�s great. Quite yeasty and a little rough and ready, but really up my alley. Nice pils malt flavour, but it could stand to come through a touch more. Big bitterness which is slightly coarse, but otherwise the hop character is excellent; tasting very Czech, kinda strong but restrained. Lager yeast flavour, but not sulfury. Reminded me a lot of Modra Hvezda�s beer, or Czech brewpub svetla more generally. Really tasty stuff, wish I could�ve smashed a bunch more."
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Clear golden yellow, no lace, aromas and flavours of of grassy hops and malt with a mildly bitter finish. Very good.
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);OK everyone, we are supposed to be in awe at a beer that is organic. Unfortunately for Feral they have some competition over the ditch from Emersons with their organic pils. Oh well, the Kiwis can�t beat us at cricket but they kill us here. It is good andobviously suitable to the climate here. There is just too much expectation which isn�t countered by the delivery here. Keep it up though gents.
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Tasted on draught at the Guildford Hotel, Guildford. Poured a crystal, pale straw with misshaped �kegged� bubbles, that struggled to keep the white foam on past the first mouthful. Lemon and apple aroma, clean liquor and a touch of freshly mowed grass. The thin body gave little in flavour and it was harshly carbonated. Light hint of malt mid palate with a little spiciness, and a noticeable diacetyl soapiness-feel, throughout, that left a layer on my tongue. May have been the pipes or keg at fault for the bad sample, because this was a sub-standard beer, especially from the good people at Feral.
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);On tap at brewery: A lot of RBeerians seem to like this but the over the top corn flavour just isn�t my thing and I�m not a big fan of pils anyway. Pours a MCG with a small white head. Aroma is stale floral hops. Flavour is corn sweet with a touch of mild hops. I got none of the hop flavour other raters are going on about except at the finish which is a touch acrid.
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Golden lager appearance, high carbonation. Nice, light malty aroma, some honey, flowery, perfumy hops. Light malt, soon to be overwhelmed by a firm drying bitterness, floral saaz hoppiness, quite the standout at NFOB 2003.
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);a little malty with slightly flowery hop aromas, clear light golden appearance, the bitterness stands out the most, good floral hop flavour with high bitterness and some malt flavours.
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);One of the few that stuck out for me at the Brisbane Festival o beers. On Saturday I actually got a jug of the stuff because I couldn't hack much else. It had a decent buttery profile which, of the pils I've had, reminded me most of Emersons. I'd love to have a proper pint of this one day, rather than just out of plastic cups in a Qld barn. Nice drop.
Feral Pilsener;Baskerville, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Had this on two occasions at the Brissy Beer Festival (both on tap), the first time i was really impressed by the bitterness, buttery-sweetish malts and floral saaz character. Second time was still nicely bitter, but didn't grab me as much as the first time. But, this is still a top class pils, well made.

Broken Tooth Pipeline Stout;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Stout;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Roasty-toasty stout with some nice and wholesome flavors. Lots of sweet tar and creamed espresso.

Sandlot Helles of a Play;Denver, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);A high quality helles - light but flavorful - a full malt backbone starts things out, some honey character - dries a but halfway through, allowing some toasted graininess and grassy hops to come through - a touch of sweetness returns on the tail end - clean, refreshing and tasty - go Rockies!

Sandlot Helles of a Play;Denver, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Mild, sweet, herbal hop forward aroma. Golden body is topped by a low white head that recedes to ring. Oddly strong fruitiness in the flavour with some cereal malt character and herbal, grassy hops leading to fair finishing bitterness. Light body with strong carbonation. Sampled on tap at the Sandlot at Coors Field.
Sandlot Helles of a Play;Denver, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Diminishing white head tops a clear golden liquid. Weird nose that offers fruity esters as much as rounded malt flavors. Banana, basil and peppery hops all take the train together, evolving on a rather tart, fruity railway. Light bodied, small bubbled carbonation. Not the most accurate helles, but a pleasant drink.
Sandlot Helles of a Play;Denver, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);At the brewery: another winner from Sandlot. Poured golden yellow with a full white head. Light fruit aroma. Mild yeasty flavor with a touch of fruit. Nice body. A very nice beer. Sandlot makes some nice stuff.
Sandlot Helles of a Play;Denver, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);On draught at the brewpub, 9/30/2005. Pours a very thick looking, deep yellow-brass-golden color. Head is ample and frothy, well-retained. Clarity has somewhat of a chill haze when first served, due to how cold it is served, but becomes quite clear as it warms. Not much lacing, if any, was left behind on the glass. Smells of thick, doughy, sugary, rich malted barley and grainy pale/munic malts. Fresh herbs and grass, with light yellow fruits present in the background. Flavor comes on strong with rich honey and bitter hops, leafy, lightly floral and peppery. Thick, wonderful feeling texture. This is not some watery, overcarbonated mess of a helles. I was surprised by how substantial the malt is and how fresh the hops are. Dough, grains and honey for miles, with well-balanced and most importantly, highly apparent hops. Screams of quality brewing. Just wish I could get a little more yeastiness from it.
Sandlot Helles of a Play;Denver, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Bright golden colour. Slightly crisp hop note but mainly fresh bready malts. Full malt character with a light fruitiness that thankfully doesn�t detract too much from the expressive malts.
Sandlot Helles of a Play;Denver, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);09.30.05 Tap at brewpub. Crystal clear pale straw with tall and lasting white head. Cereal aroma, lightly toasty, lightly floral, hints of pepper and citrus. Super balance. I could drink this all night at a ball game.
Sandlot Helles of a Play;Denver, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Draught at the Sandlot. Clear golden body with mild carbonation and a clear white head. Nice fresh malt aroma with a pineapple citrusy character and hop qualities of dry hay and grass. A pleasant but significantly hoppy helles with grass and pepper notes. Semi-dry with moderate acidity and medium-high bitterness. Comes across mildly astringent, but good overall.

Sandlot Wild Pitch Hefeweizen;Denver, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);At GABF. Cloudy lemon yellow. Aroma of lemon & banana. Palate is smooth, a little thin and a little too sweet. Minimal finish.
Sandlot Wild Pitch Hefeweizen;Denver, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);"Tall, competition swing top bottle labeled ""Wild Pitch Hefeweizen"", lightly roused, then poured to a Czech-pils glass with a hazed, light gold color, plenty of rising, effervescent bubbles, a bubbly, white head of foam that quickly diminished to a small ring and film, and left a modest amount of spots and streaks of lacing. The aroma was light yeast, light grain, ripe banana, and mellowed spice as clove. The flavor added to these a noticeable, but not overbearing sweetness. Lively carbonation and low hop bitterness combined to project a nice crispness. The body was light+, but not watery. Flavorfully sessionable!"
Sandlot Wild Pitch Hefeweizen;Denver, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);"On tap at Sandlot. Pours hazy golden-yellowish-orange with a small white head, basically looking like it should. The aroma is well-done if rather typical, with banana and clove notes, wheat, and fruity esters. The flavor is also standard wheaty banana and clove. A little on the sweeter side. Medium body and average carbonation. Really not bad for the style. If the BMC boys are going to do a ""crafty"" style well, this is probably going to be it I figure."

Sandlot Arbitrator;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Fairly malty aroma has plenty of raisin-like fruity esters. Clear, deep, burnished copper coloured body is topped by a decent and lasting tan head. Raisin-like fruitiness and light, roasty bitterness blend well together but are not altogether exciting. Somewhat thin body is on the watery side with very strong carbonation. Sampled on tap at the Sandlot at Coors Field.
Sandlot Arbitrator;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Clear orange-copper. Smooth, easy-going maltiness rides from honey to nutty, though always bready and bubble gummy. Candied oak influences bring on little fruity suggestions and add a light vinous kick, but it remains a bit too subtle in its flavor deployment. Light-medium bodied, soft cleansing carbonation, very sweet palate. Pleasant.
Sandlot Arbitrator;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);"Chestnut brown; creamy - yellowish head. Nose as from fresh German brown bread, quite yeasty. Taste is predominantly sweet with good bitter, shrublike flavour. Again bread flavour and molasses. Well-bodied, warming. This is a good, tru-to-nature Bock. Not really exciting but more than halfway decent."

Wynkoop XX Dubbel Gersten;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;"(cask) I wonder if they know ""dubbele gersten"" is a long-disappeared Antwerpen style? Cloudy orange-amber colour; slim ring of white foam. Fruity, estery smell - orange marmalade. Very fruity and yeasty, nearly kumquat flavour, maybe less bitter. Well-bodied. Aftertaste is somehow thinner. Strange beer. I wonder what their exact aim was. If it really is the historical dubbele gersten, I'm no judge as it went out when I was about 8..."

Southampton Wit Passion;Southampton, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Southampton Publick House;GABF 2003: Overpowering passion fruit aroma with some cantaloupe and wheat smells as well. Extremely piney, and very sweet, almost unbearable, but enjoyable in small quantaties. Sour sugar and lemon flavors on top of a big passion fruit profile. I admire them for brewing something unique, so overall gets points added.

Rock Bottom Denver JPIPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Denver;Cask in Denver. Cloudy orange color, fresh citrus aroma, full creamy mouthfeel, ends lightly bitter.
Rock Bottom Denver JPIPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Denver;(cask, Denver) Hazy peach, Slim, but dense white head, stable. Nose with slight hops, estery and yeasty. Too sweet for an IPA - even an English cask one, let alone USA. Slight fruity flavour, bit of orange, bit of banana. Palate is hoppier - but again not enough. Just too hoppy for babyfood. Medium-bodied. Wouldn't cut much wood with Camra - or with SFPBFW, I'm afraid.

This one doesn�t look that pretty, an is pretty light on the aroma. Not as dry as I usually prefer, not not too bad. The hop character spurs grow on you a little. Its a tad buttery.

Breckenridge Thunder Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);July 2nd, 2015 - If the thunder stout is named after any meteorological phenomenon, it must be the slow, rolling thunder I used to see out on the Front Range, because this is a soft and slowly assertive brew. This review is for the Nitro at the new brewery location off of Santa. My pour came with a solid two inch head which was a bit of a bummer, but I also secretly like to cut through the foam with my mustache and, in this case, the assistance of a spoon. The aroma is lightly malty with a dusting of chocolate shavings, and have a light palate with a thick creaminess. The aftertaste is also mild with more of that slow-rolling oatiness and maltiness, making this supremely sessionable.

Breckenridge Thunder Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Just ate a deep fried hot dog covered in slop. At Steve�s in the Denver airport B terminal.

Breckenridge Thunder Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Deep dark brown pour with a thick creamy light beige head. Weak aroma of bittersweet dark chocolate.

Breckenridge Thunder Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Nitro tap - pours dark brown with creamy Tan head. Smells of coffee and cooked sugar. Initial taste is off-putting a slight sour astringency. This mellows by mid sip and disappears leaving clean dry finish of nothing but roasted malt.
Breckenridge Thunder Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Aroma: Faint hints of chocolate and coffee, but you almost have to stick your nose in the beer to get them. Appearance: Dark mahogany with rich tan head. Taste: Light sweetness throughout, with a bitter finish at the end. Palate: Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation, dry finish. Overall: Very thin and underdeveloped. Not really a good offering at all.

Evans Extra Stout;Albany, New York, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;A - Pours a very dark black with just a hint of brown and a nice two fingers of tan-brown head. The head has very nice retention and forms a nice layer on top with excellent lacing. S - Aroma is full of deep roasted carmel malts and some coffee mixed in. Not very complex aroma, but also very rich. T - Starts off with a building roasted carmel malt flavor with some subdued coffee flavor in the background and just a touch of smokey flavor. Through the middle the roasted flavor really pops a bit. The finish has the nice sweet carmel malts with a nice blend of roasted flavor and a touch of coffee and sweet milk that lingers nicely. M - Medium-full bodied with just a touch of carbonation. Just a tad watery at the start, but it seems to become more creamy. Very smooth overall. Nice dry finish. D - Very drinkable. Super smooth and clean mouthfeel with some very nice balanced flavors. The finish is especially nice both in the flavors that linger and the dryness.

Has a massive cocoa-brown head; rocky. Some spotty lace. Looks formidable. Roasted malt aroma but sweet dark caramel. Smells rich and balanced; not overly bitter or sweet. Smell is not dominating. More coffee aroma as it warms. Balanced flavor with roasted and bitter coffee qualities. Bitter coffee malt with an alcoholic kick. Has a good mix of both bitter and sweet, though not entirely unique. Feels dry like sandpaper but also buttery smooth. A paradox! It�s an easy-drinker. Balanced and pleasant. A wetter porter style."

Evans Extra Stout;Albany, New York, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;Head (if there was one) faded to wisps of film over a deep black/cola brown body. Coffee roasts dominate aroma. Sharp mouth which could be fuller/thicker. (Somehow it becomes more dense as it warms.) Well-roasted malt flavor, lightly smoked, touching upon Rauchbier persona. I can see similarities drawn to Guinness FES, but that beer has a heightened sweetness and a tad more chocolate. ABV remains well-hidden. Draught pint at Albany Pump Station, Albany, NY 12207
Golden City Raspberry Centurion;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;on tap at the Falling Rock. Another crafty use of ingredients by the king of never throwing a beer away (I mean that in the most endearing way possible). I never would have thought that raspberry and a barleywine should be brought together, but this combo is wonderful. The caramel from the barley wine and the raspberry were blended to almost perfection and aged perfectly. A bit more hops or a bit more raspberry and this beer would have been a train wreck. One of the most wonderful concoctions ever. It should be done again!
Golden City Raspberry Centurion;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;draft at falling rock. 9-06. i wondered why i was asked if i was diabetic by the bartender, then i took a sip. i have a new definition of cloying. caramel apple and raspberry medicinal alcohol notes with a very rich chocolate flavor. the flavors are at odds here. i can�t tell if this is supposed to be kids cough syrup, a raspberry creme filled chocolate, or just an unpleasant beer. i settled on the last on. i love raspberry, this is not good raspberry flavor to me. too damn sweet.
Golden City Raspberry Centurion;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Draught, Falling Rock. Head is off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is dark amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (caramel), with notes of raspberry syrup and alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. Simple and very sweet but ok.
Golden City Raspberry Centurion;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;On tap @ Golden City Brewery[ end of keg] poured a murky coffee with cream color with a small lasting amber head.

Golden City Raspberry Centurion;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Deep Brown. Scents of wood, berries (mainly raspberries), sweet dark malts and caramel. Cloying, sticky raspberry and malty sweetness combine with a major lack of carbonation and a very thin body to achieve complete unbalane in my opinion. Too fruity, too sour and too sweet.
Golden City Raspberry Centurion;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Falling Rock on tap - There is a strong raspberry smell, and a slight odor of hops, similar to an abbey. The taste is initially bitter, with a sweet raspberry middle, and a bitter berry finish... really there's not a whole lot to it.... you can taste the alcohol, its really too sticky.
Golden City Raspberry Centurion;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Falling Rock on tap. The owner gave quite a story about this oak aged barley wine, using something like 1.5 lbs of whole raspberries during the brewing. It is slightly murky, with a deep amber color. Big hoppy sweet berry aroma, but not exactly resembling raspberries. More like starwberries and blueberries. Sticky and cloying, you can taste and feel the high ABV. Overly fruity, very sticky, with burning alcohol on the tongue throughout the drink.
Golden City Raspberry Centurion;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Had this on tap at the Falling Rock in Denver. Smells of wood and berries. Coloration is a deep ransparent ruby. Taste is complicated: sweet up front, smokey in the middle, and a bitter berry bite in the finish. Good mouthfeel and a definite alcohol bite. An interesting twist on the barleywine style.
Tustin Old Town IPA;Tustin, California, United States;IPA;Tustin Brewing Company;(Draught) Pours a clear orange body with a medium white head. Aroma of grass, weed, earth, pine, and grapefruit. Flavor of dank, pine, grass, caramel, and citrus with a dry, bitter finish.

Tustin Old Town IPA;Tustin, California, United States;IPA;Tustin Brewing Company;On the afternoon of Tuesday 17th May 2016 I visited The Tustin Brewery and had one of the most disappointing flights of beer I have ever had. Beer number five and I finally get a beer with some proper flavour. This light amber brew had some piney hops in it�s aroma and taste, after the first four beers I thought my senses of smell and taste had left me, thankfully this just confirmed the other beers had been as poor as my notes suggested.

Hamilton Gregg Pilsner;Hermosa Beach, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hamilton Gregg Brewworks;This is sweet and soapy as well as malty. It's an orange beer.

Cheshire Cat Strong Johns Big Ale;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Old Ale;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;"Dark brown beer; slim, but persistent white head. Overwhelming nutty and oxidised, biscuity nose. Taste is brandy-like, heavy vinous taste, liqueurish, winegrape. Madeirisation in the right way, blending right in with the natural taste of the beer. Lots of esters, of course, lasting through the aftertaste. Unbelievable, heavy alcohol punch & burn in the mouthfeel, full bodied. Thanks to the alcohol, the beer keeps quite well, despite being aged a little bit, and the nose betraying some oxidation. Very vinous in character, like a true good English old ale or Barley Wine."
Shepherd Neame Steinbock Lager;Faversham, Kent, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shepherd Neame;I suppose this is OK if you�re driving and want a refreshing summer lager, but is ridiculously weak and tastes it.

LaConner Red;LaConner, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;LaConner Brewing Company;Thanks again to Skyhand. Drank around 2007ish. All I remember about this was that she was stocked with a CASE of this goodness and we drank a few. Tart and glorious, this one I am proud to tick as a rating!
LaConner Red;LaConner, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;LaConner Brewing Company;Thanks Arlen this is great stuff, pours a reddish orange color, very clear and appetizing, with a small white foamy head. Aroma is very citrusy, I pick up several fruits but none are easy to pin point. Taste is predominently of raspberry, and some cranberry presence as well. Very tart on the pallet as well as sour with very strong carbonation. Nice dry finish.
LaConner Red;LaConner, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;LaConner Brewing Company;Thanks a ton to Gromit and Arlen for bringing this amazing brew over. Pours a interesting red/orange/amber color with a small white head. This brew had an amazing raspberry taste, very tart and sour, with a carbonation/fizzy quality that allowed the sourness to really lift the tastebuds. This brew first strikes with a hit of sweetness that fools your tastebuds into putting their guard down, then smacks them upside the head with an amazing puckering sourness. Great brew with a nice dry finish.
LaConner Red;LaConner, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;LaConner Brewing Company;Wow! I was expecting something along the lines of a Cinder Cone Red, but boy was I wrong. Pours a redish-amber with very little head or lacing. Aroma is cranberries and cherries? Very tart smelling. There is nothing subtle about the flavor of this. Man is it tart. There seems to be a mixture of cranberry, raspberry and cherry. (that make this a Lambic?) Palate is, well, very tart. Even a few minutes after a sip my mouth is still puckering. Overall this is really good. I don't think I could have more than one at a sitting, though. This is well worth seeking out. Oh, I got this 12oz bottle direct from the brewer and there's no label on it, so I don't know its availability.
LaConner Red;LaConner, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;LaConner Brewing Company;"Batch #1 (draught) Very hazy, dull orange; no head. Woody nose, vinous, fruit (strawberry, raspberry and cherry). Very tart taste and mouthfeel. Woodiness comes out in power. Sourness is very high, even some acetic acid. Fruit in abundance. Acidburn, outspoken dry-out effect, tannines. I cannot but like it - good one. Was: 7/3/7/3/15 Batch #2 Medium yellow-brown head over ruby-shot dark brown beer. Overwhelming fruity-lactic acid nose, wood & tannines. Fruit is definitely dark red fruit, but not identifyable. Much more woody, and way less fruity than the draught batch #1 version in Denver. Tannins, fruity chocolate. There�s a flavor as from the tasty burnt bits from a dripping roast. Lots of milky lactic acid and hints at acetic. Berries - I even get cranberry. Sharp flavours & acids thinning seriously the MF, without becoming watery (God forbid). There�s a malty slickness in the finish. This second batch is completely Flemish Oud Bruin with added fruit.

Milton Constantine;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Milton Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Saint Albans Beer Festival, 2003. This beer was up amongst the superstars of the festival (on the top stage) yet it was a little bit temperamental. They�d been having some trouble with the beer settling but I needed to try it. Blond murky ale. Sharp acidic aroma and fruit all over the place. Possibly needs revisiting but if you going to up on stage you best be ready to be drunk.

Broken Tooth Prince Williams Porter;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Porter;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Pretty black brown, almost opaque, thin brown head fades to a ring. Smells like dark fruit and ever so slightly of wet dog, or fresh snow. Taste is nice roasty, lightly sweet brown sugar and roasted malt, fades to bitter roasted malt finish. Such great balance. A little heavy on carbonation, but not bad, and bubbles are very fine, slightly sharp, body is not heavy, but not thin, again great balance between smooth and rich yet drinkable. This is my idea of a great porter.

Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;From a bottle. I really like chilli but this way too hot to really enjoy, the chilli in the bottle neck is cool.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;330ml bottle. Dark copper incolour with a fluffy white foam head that is densly compacted.Mild aroma with some spice notes coming through. A great big zing in the mouth when it hits the taste buds it livens up the mouth. One of the better chilli beers I have tried.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Tasted 07/10/2206. 330ml bottle from the brewery. Potential but not pulled off. Basically agree with Mullet. Not with Mutant. As per the chilli beer but with a chilli in the bottle. I wonder if any fool eats it?
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Fortunately not the hottest chilli beer I have tried though it comes close. Dull orange coloured body with hardly any head. Obvious chilli aroma along with some dryness. Some oiliness in the taste, some sweetness and then comes the chilli, hot and strong. Just another bloody lager with chilli thrown in, what is the point!
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Standard lager colour with no head. Aroma is well... of chili. There is a deliberately deceptive sweetish start to the taste but then the chilli hits hard and badly, no subtlety at all. Tastes really awful. I would like to meet the man who first thought of putting chilli in beer.... so I could smash his face in.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;"Pale gold, very clear with little head. Smells like slightly stale Serrano peppers, particularly ""seedy"" and pretty vegetal. Initially tastes very sweet then there�s a Jalapeno, seedy flavour with a very late, big spiciness. Easily the hottest chilli beer I�ve had - it made me sweat, in a good way. Not a great beer but it definitely does the chilli thing well - just needs a base beer with a big more guts (I�m thinking something like bottled Bass.) Didn�t suck."
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Chilli aroma, nasty chili flavour and bite contaminates what would otherwise have been a very bad light lager.
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Stupid chilli hotness ontop of a lame arse lager. I think chilli beer is becoming a fad. What's the point?
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;actually was pretty hot and made me very thirsty. some strange kidney bean fatness with a little salsa sweetness taking the edge off the chilli. pretty damn hot
Sunshine Coast Robinsons Hot Chilli Beer;Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Sunshine Coast Brewery;Actually pretty hot, chilli-wise. The finish was very hot, peppery and dry. Obviously a crappy lager base, very thin mouthfeel. Althought its a bit more intersting that a crappy macro lager, i just don't get the point of chilli beers. Gimicky.

Bluegrass Mephistopheles Metamorphosis;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Tripel;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Bottle at the Funky 8, Brooklyn, NYC. Like so many tripels, this one is too sweet. The alcohol is not integrated effectively. Fine yeasty character. Not bad overall, but certainly lacks subtlety.

Love this brewer, but this one tastes like a first try - a good effort but ultimately somewhat clumsy and a do-over. Might improve with age?
Bluegrass Mephistopheles Metamorphosis;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Tripel;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Bottle c/o Chaney. Thanks Brandon! A: Hazy yellow with a big head that leaves ample lacing. S: Citrus, spices, yeast. Easily identifiable as a tripel. T: I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer, as the quality definitely exceeded my expectations. The flavor is bold and full, without the cloying sweetness that often accompanies American versions of this style. A big citrus component beautifully merged with a subtle spice aspect make for a tasty beverage. M: 10.7%?!? I didn�t realize this until I was halfway through my glass. Alcohol content hidden masterfully. This is full bodied and rich. D: I would absolutely drink this again. I liked it a lot. It�s nice to see a brewery from the U.S. create a great Belgian-style tripel.

Bristol Belgian Saison;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Bristol Brewing Company;"(draught) Dull orange; good white-yellowish head. Herbal, spicy, bit grassy, touch of flowers. I can taste the rosehips it is made with, plus a peppery (grains de paradis) flavour. This beer has a great balance, including a hint of sourness which suggests the oxide acidity of authentic Saison. Light to medium bodied - exactly right for Saison. Well dammit! This is the closest to real Saison I've encountered so far in the USA. And it isn't even in the database! It might have been a lucky hit, but it certainly isn't any less meriting for it."

Boon Kriekenlambik;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;The �flat� cherry lambic from the keg (Frank Boon seemed to prefer metal kegs over wooden barrels for flavour stability, not sure if this is still the case today). No foam as expected in a pure cherry lambic, deep cherry red colour with vaguely purplish hue. �Malse� (mellow) lambic with lots of lactic acid, horseblanket, hay, not too much citric acid, woodiness from the cherry stones all drenched in a fresh, acid, very lively cherry aroma and taste. Boon clearly masters this very well - but then, what does he not master when it comes to authentic lambic beers...

Fair white head dissipates at a moderate pace and leaves little lacing. Highly malted in aroma. A touch of plum, caramel/sugar. Definitely a maltier beer.

Elliot Glacier Red Hill Scottish;Parkdale, Oregon, United States;Scottish Ale;Elliot Glacier Public House;"(Draft: Elliot Glacier Public House in Parkdale, OR) Sweet, fruity, strongly caramely and alcoholic in the nose. The flavor is also sweet and very caramely, lightly bitter, and mildly alcoholic. The carbonation seems low again with this beer, so the palate is a bit flat, but the body is medium ""plus"". Dark amber color. Light tan head fades to a small ring, and only leaves a few dots of lace on the glass. Decent, but it�s failing to excite me."

Whitish head leaves moderate lacing behind. Citrus and earthy hop aroma with a decent toasty malt balance. Medium bodied with a pleasant mild carbonation. Earth and citrus hop flavors interact well and play nicely with a biscuity, toasty malt background. An interesting blend of Noble and ""C"" hops."
Elliot Glacier Gnarl Ridge India Pale Ale;Parkdale, Oregon, United States;IPA;Elliot Glacier Public House;(Draft: Elliot Glacier Public House in Parkdale, OR) Sweet and fruity nose is very light on the hops for an IPA. Light gold color, slightly hazy. Light tan head is supplied by dozens of steady, mesmorizing carbonation bubble trails that creep slowly along the edge of the glass. Moderately bitter hops is the principle component of the flavor, but a moderate fruitiness and a sweet, lightly grainy maltiness makes for a nice base. A thin layer of head is retained throughout the session, and leaves a single large patch of white lace on the glass -- is that Elliot Glacier? Very pleasant, and the best of the four on tap at the brewery today.

Church Brew Dalbhach Dunkel Weizen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Church Brew Works;A- Body is a somewhat cloudy, very carbonated cola color. Served with an approximately 2 finger beige head. Head fades to a thick collar and very little lacing is left. S- The nose is subtle-but in line for the style. Banana is the main character but sourdough bread has almost equal strength as the backbone. T- The initial flavor is heavy on banana with a substantial bready yeast background. The finish is consistent with the initial flavor but the sourdough bread impression grows a little bit. Nothing lingers on the palate. P- Medium carbonation and light to medium weight body. Fairly smooth. O- This is a decent dunkel...but nothing special. It fits the bill pretty well for the style. It�s pretty heavy on banana and could use a little bit of spice. Definitely worth a try. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 03-06-2009 16:10:31
Church Brew Dalbhach Dunkel Weizen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Church Brew Works;A flavorful and aromatic dunkelweizen. Aroma was near perfect. Strong banana and clove with yeast and little else interfereing. Pour was a nice cloudy dark brown with a one finger near tan head. Taste was strong and wheaty. Heavy on the banana and clove with just touches of roasted malt and a hint of caramel after it warmed. Not as much carbonation as I would like in a dunkelweizen, but most of CBW beers lack that. All in all, solid but middle of the road.
Church Brew Dalbhach Dunkel Weizen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Church Brew Works;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a pale brown, orange-tinted with a thin rim in white. Aroma throws a nice crisp classic Weizen yeast aroma. Banana-heavy. Flavor is right in line, with a wonderful combination of freshly slice fall MacIntosh apple, banana puree, and caramelized pear. Very nuanced, juicy and bright. Great flavor profile from the yeast, tinged in a Bananas Foster way with brown sugar and rum. Balanced and crisp. Excellent!
Church Brew Dalbhach Dunkel Weizen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Church Brew Works;a little sweet. The bannana was apparent. It seemed like it was trying to hide it though. Like this beer was embarassed of tasting like bannana. Many of these tuff guy beers that have a little fruity flavor need to come out of the closet me thinks. being fruity is nothing to be ashamed of.

Hawkes Bay Mates Draught;Napier, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hawkes Bay Independent Brewery;The brewer makes heavy play of the fact his Pure Draught has no added sugars, which makes me wonder what�s in this. It�s sweetish but pretty bland. Copper coloured with a fair head. The brewer sure isn�t big on aroma hops - it was a struggle to find much to sniff here. Bit sour, bit uric, very basic. Probable adjuncts. Soft palate. Faint caramalt and adjuncts in an underdone brew. There seems to be a market in New Zealand for watery, lightly-flavoured lagers, and this fits the bill. Metallic tasting with little or no finish. Pretty crap. (Draught at brewpub)

Deep chestnut with an airy light tan head. Coffee and green plum on the nose. Chocolate and crystal malts prevail in the mouth with a little more of that fruity yeast note. A bit sharp in the roasty malt astringency and those green fruity esters, otherwise it�s pretty decent.

Roosters Brew House Haymaker;Hastings, New Zealand;Pilsener - Imperial;Roosters Brew House (NZ);Draught at Regionals Wines, Wellington. Pours orange with small white head. Grain and grassy aroma. The flavour is grain and alcohol...actually the alcohol is quite evident and detracts from the overall balance of the beer. Not very pleasant.
Roosters Brew House Haymaker;Hastings, New Zealand;Pilsener - Imperial;Roosters Brew House (NZ);(On tap) Clear, deep golden with a creamy, beige head leaving some laces. Aroma of malts and flowers.

Roosters Brew House Haymaker;Hastings, New Zealand;Pilsener - Imperial;Roosters Brew House (NZ);Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden, brief head. Dryish with some light fruitiness. Like in all Roosters beers the hop rate is low, but here some mangoish notes reveals the use of small amounts of classic Kiwi hops. The body is more full than in their other beers and the mouthfeel is pleasantly soft. When it warms it reveals notes of butter and toffee, as well as fair amounts of alcohol. Rooster�s itself is nice looking roadside place, where the locals gather for an after work beer. Their range of non assaulting beers seem to work well with the crowd. Just don�t come heer to expect some fancy, out-there styles...
Roosters Brew House Haymaker;Hastings, New Zealand;Pilsener - Imperial;Roosters Brew House (NZ);Tasted 31/07/2005. From a flagon at Neil Miller�s Cellar-Vate tasting - sans Neil. Golden orange, bright, white head that disappears relatively quickly. Tropical fruits (pineapple, passionfruit and banana), spices and a good dose of malt sweetness all mingle in the nose - | hints of bubblegum too. Very wheat beer-like. Sweet fruity flavour, a little winey, with little bitterness but some, unfortunate, hints of cleaning products. Pretty smooth level of carbonation, tending towards the flat end of the scale. Worth another taste, as the flagon may not have been fresh, but it comes across a little unrefined. Re-evaluated 03/04/2006. 2L flagon, from the brewery, courtesy of Popsta. Paler than I remember - more yellow gold. Hints of corn on the nose, corn chips and refried beans in the finish. Less fruit from hops and more phenolics. Dropped from 2.8 to 2.3. Drink well chilled for best results.

Bristol Skull & Bones Special Strong Dark;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Bristol Brewing Company;"Draught at Bristol. Pours opaque black with a tall tan creamy head that only diminishes slightly. Sour berry yeast (barrel aged) and dark roasted malt aroma with an oak nose. Sour berry and dark roasted malt flavor with yeast and oak notes; slight acidic hop notes and faint dark chocolate. Dark bodied and fizzy, lively carbonated palate."
Bristol Skull & Bones Special Strong Dark;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Bristol Brewing Company;Dark Brown. Aroma of burning leather, sour, dripping dark fruits and mellow milk chocolate. Flavor begins with a huge dose of acidity and sourness that levels down a bit throughout the mid-palate and finish but maintains throughout the profile. On the mid-palate, a touch of roastiness is evident along with notes of chocolate, plum skin and dark fruits, especially berries. The finish possesses a touch of leather and then the acidity comes back into play, grasps my tastes buds and doesn�t let go. Exploding, gripping and bubbly feel on the palate. A unique beer that was worth the three hour drive.
Bristol Skull & Bones Special Strong Dark;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Bristol Brewing Company;Draught:FoBAB 2004: a ton of oak-laden overtones, beautiful cloudy umber color.

Oaken, dark red grape aroma with an interesting metallic sourness. Initially peppery on the tip of the tongue and melds into a bitter, piney treat with a dry, somewhat earthy component. Roasted cherry skins, tanned leather and bitter hops, amid a long sourness -> right up my alley, what a treat!"
Bristol Skull & Bones Special Strong Dark;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Bristol Brewing Company;FOBAB�04: Dark red clay color, nose is tart and complex, with hints of alloy and medicine, lime and cherry. taste was complex, as well, with spicy, tart cherry and sweet oaky vanilla tones.

Bristol Skull & Bones Special Strong Dark;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Bristol Brewing Company;Dark, murky brown with a small, light brown head. The aroma of sweet cherries, chocolate, barnyard, tobacco, hay, plums, and light yeasty esters is quite enticing. The body is soft with a nice roundness from delightful levels of carbonation. A nice tart fruitiness shows through in the flavor with layered malts, sharp acidity and a refreshing, crisp dry finish. A highlight of the festival, to be sure, and something I�d drink with regularity if given the opporunity.
Bristol Skull & Bones Special Strong Dark;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Bristol Brewing Company;Draft: Mucky brick. Thick, densely packed foam. Alluring aroma with notes of bandage, sour cherries, and husky malt. Whispers of oak, phenols, iron, and flower petals. Quite vinous and tangy. Feathery soft carbonation with tiny needly pricks. Starts meaty and chocolaty with lighter notes of husky pale malt latching onto the back of the throat. Sizeable medicinal flavor highlights the well-rounded iron tartness. Pervasive mustiness couples with understated tannins, which tingle the tongue. Chocolate, tobacco, and nuts lurk beneath the chewy malt pillar. Well-masked alcohol. Much more lactic and rounded/tart, than it is astringently bretty. Sour cherries and firm acidity give way to a musty oak finish packed with an abundance of leather and harsh minerals. Here�s another Belgian-inspired American lambic that�s assertively tart and funky...not to mention the sturdy malt frame, which deepens the flavor and absorbs some of the acidity. If this is an indicator of what their upcoming lambic-style S&B series will have to offer: Oh my! This is a remarkable, highly commendable accomplishment in the world of beer.
Bristol Skull & Bones Special Strong Dark;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Bristol Brewing Company;"Very dark brown in color. Nice and clean mouthfeel; not too heavy, not too light. Roasty and woodsy with some sour cherry notes. Phenolic addition - in some peculiar way - was actually quite nice. Nicely balanced and fresh-tasting. Dryish finish. Good stuff!"
Bristol Skull & Bones Special Strong Dark;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Bristol Brewing Company;Draught. Body is murky dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, roasted grain, chocolate), moderately yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket, cobwebs), with notes of cask wood, cherry, and bandage. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Surprisingly fabulous...whereas I was kind of left feeling ambiguous about Fantome BBB Dark, this one is along those lines (like a light stout mixed with Flemish sour ale), yet more enjoyable/drinkable. I ended up drinking virtually an entire pint of this stuff at once by using all of my remaining tickets (Boulder Strong Ale fest) to persuade the server to give me about five or six 2oz samples in one glass. And right to the end of that pint, I was smiling ear to ear. Thought it was better than Cuvee de Tomme at this fest (may re-review that one later in bottle form). Hope they end up bottling this.

Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at the B-Sides - pours a light orange with hardly any head, perhaps a bit of a white around the edges. Aroma is sour with notes of kid�s vitamins. Flavor has the same sourness and the flavor reminds me somewhat of Sweet Tarts - but in a good way. Pick up some band aid notes as well. Alcohol is slighlty evident but adds to the esence of this one. Mouthfeel is slightly sour, bit not distracting.
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;(gabf 2003) First off, I have to state that Gueuze is not my favorite style of lambic ales. This version was very sour but balanced by flavors of almonds/walnuts. Very complex. It had a funky aftertaste as it warmed - like the sour smell of a tape bandage. Maybe that�s a good thing though.
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Well this beer is on draught again...oh darn! It is a golden color. The aroma blasts you with sourness and funk. This version is not quite as sweet....great job of blending. The flavor is very well balanced and stands up to many of the lambics we had at the Spontaneous Fermentation Festival in May �04 in Buggenhout, Belgium.
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Re-rate: Had this tonight at B-Sides. This time around there is an interesting plasticity in the nose that isn't alarming or offputting just interesting. Man Tim Scharz gives me agiant boner. This guy brews beer like it was no big deal. Last week they had a peach lambic on tap, this week a gueze. Holy Crap!!! Poured into a snifter. Deep yellow with a hint of a head that slowly dies off. Nose: Notes of vinegar, hay, and a lovingly cloying sweetness that makes me want to take a bath in this stuff. On the tongue it is delightful. Less sweet than the nose. Much sharper than the peach Lambic. Notes of Red wine vineagr, raspberries, swiss cheese and other fungus things. If you are in Austin, this place is a must for you. Grat
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Those of us in Austin who enjoy lambic style beer(or any other beer for that matter) are very lucky to have the Bitter End. Every time Tim brings out this beer it gets better. And more dry. Gold in color it almost looks like wine with fizz. But when you bring it too your nose you get sour horse blanket aroma with a taste to match! I hope this batch will last another year.
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Thin, whispy head atop a misty orange colored beer. I agree with fly in that this one was super easy to drink for the style. I deduct points for that, I like a lambic that is somewhat challenging with each sip. This one was slightly sour with a candy sugar finish.....finish was probably too sweet. Not at all a bad beer, or a beer that I didnt enjoy, just not what I look for.
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap. Orange, clear, small head. Sour, but a bittersweet, tart kind of finish. I'm not the most experienced gueze drinker, but it didn't quite jibe with what I've had so far. I disliked it at first but it kind of grew on me as it warmed. BE's flavored lambics are better.
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Hunnah Hunnah Hunnah - this is TOO damn easy to drink. Geueze-like but not the face twisting variety. Is that good? Is that geueze? I realy don't give a rats ass at this point because I'm RWD. Figgered it out yet? Error 404
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;GABF '03 I'm always interested in trying American made lambics*.This one was very musty,cider-like.Soured with a bit of sweetness.
Bitter End Just B Gueuze;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"(draught - !) Delicate pink-tainted orange-amber; no head. Nose of wood and Brettanomyces, citrus and just a touch of sulphur. Instead of 'horseblanket', taste of what I'd call wet socks and blue cheese. Not bad (by far) but weird. Very cheesy finish, lots of acids but not too harsh. Slight slick, oily feel, refreshing enough. Sourness keeps around but aftertaste has both cheese and sugars. Not, of course it isn't gueuze as I know it. But it's worth seeking out, even for Belgians."

The flavor is pretty thin, very last, but there is a very slight spice flavor. The palate is very thin, presumably the goal considering the beer�s name.

Boscos la Biere de Tonduese/ Lawnmower Ale;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Wheat Ale;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);"(draught - brewery calls it 'English Summer Ale', and I've kept all the silly spelling mistakes when introducing it here) Pale orange, slight haze; little white rim. Nose of pale or light coloured malts (crystal), cookies. Grassy, leafy flavours, making it Pilsner-like, but with a bitter, crisp finish. Rather well-bodied, good counterbalance by the hops. Nice, light beer, fresh - OK! Just can't dig a wheat character."

Fernandes Double Six;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Fernandes Brewery (Ossett);Dark beer, looks similar to a stout. Very little aroma with a nice smoked flavour. Overall quite a basic strong beer.
Fernandes Double Six;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Fernandes Brewery (Ossett);Chappel Beer fest, Gravity. Is it a stout or is it a mild? If it's a mild it's very strong in flavour and strength. If it's a stout it's very light in body. After consultation with some drinkers around me we settle on mild. Lot's of licorice flavours and some mild roasty bits. A very delightful ale.

Nottingham Legend;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nottingham Brewery;Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys Bishopsgate as �Nottingham Legend�, 4%. Love the old pump clip. Dark amber orange, still, translucent, bubbly beige head. Aroma is bread crusts, apple, straw, honeyish malt. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is bread crusts with salted butter, light dried flowers, dusty bitterness, almost salty in the finish. A classic full flavoured bitter. Not modern flavours, but floats my boat.
Nottingham Legend;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nottingham Brewery;2nd Sep 2016: gravity poured half-pint in The Wrekin Inn, Wellington Shropshire. Good amber colour, thin off-white head. Caramel lead to the nose and taste, mild hop balance but malty molasses rule the brew from start to finish.
Nottingham Legend;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nottingham Brewery;Cask. Earthy hoppy aroma. Pours copper with thin lace top. No great taste, although the water has had malt and hops added. You could have a session of this if you were determined enough and were drinking to forget. Given the quality of other Nottingham ales this one is a puzzle.

Just a back hint of acids. Dull peach flavour, agressed by hops. The twain won't mix. Rather well-bodied, sticky sugar mouthfeel, entirely consistent with the nose and retronasal impressions. 'We are not impressed'."
Sawbridgeworth Stout;Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, England;Stout;Sawbridgeworth;Very dark brown colour. The initial aroma hit is sulphur with some sweaty old socks in the background. Thankfully, that soon fades to reveal licorice and coffee, which carries through onto the palate. Dry finish. I thought this a little thin for a stout but, otherwise, quite respectable. Cask (gravity dispense), Bedford Beer Festival 2004.

Smells of chocolate malt, weak coffee and some dusty berry notes. Sweet chocolatey taste at first, but this ushers in a fruity hoppy bitter which clings on to the long finish.

Bartrams Stingo;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;Bottle in a mixed case that was kindly picked up for me by Vale Brewery Nov 08. Pours hazy yellow with just a few white bubbles showing that swiftly depart. Some strung out citrus and honey flavours stick for a while and just about cancel out the bitterness. This beer is fine but once again like the AH 64 it suffers a little from the bottle conditioning and is as flat as a witches tit. A6 A3 F6 P3 OV13 3.1
Bartrams Stingo;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;A little stout for my particular taste, also a tad on the bitter side of the spectrum, worth a try to give our pallette a full range of experience
Bartrams Stingo;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;Bottle. Very lively, golden brown with a large head. Aromas are sweet malts with citrus and yeast. Flavours are dry and spicy with mellow citrus fruit and yeast. Dry and bitter on the finish. Pretty good.
Bartrams Stingo;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;Bottle conditioned, from Beer Cellar in Lincoln. Hazy orange gold, thin but lasting white head and low condition. Gentle sweet flowery honey and citrus hop notes in the nose. Quite yeasty and bitter in the mouth, despite careful pouring. Gently hoppy with little trace of the honey that was apparent in the nose. Fruity yeast in the finish. Walks a very thin line between an English real ale and a Franconian Ungespundet Kellerbier, although I guess that is not the intention.

Bartrams Stingo;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;See Beer Elsie Bub for some general comments on Bartrams beers. According to the label, this is a honey beer, but this is quite subtle. Amber colour. A well-balanced brew. Another good bottled ale from Bartrams. Bottle conditioned, October 2003. UPDATE re: Silk Tork's comments about stingo (perhaps I should have noticed the picture of the bee on the label when I tasted the first bottle). So what they are really getting at is a pun along the lines of sting-o (ho ho ho). Otherwise no great change, or cause to amend the marking. Bottle. Jan 2005.
Bartrams Stingo;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;Chappel beer Fest, Gravity. Stingo is actually an Old Ale or at least a strong ale - this is clearly a bitter. Amber coloured ale with a few mixed bubbles clinging desperately for survival at the side of the glass. A distinct buttered toast flavour as it goes down the throat. Lovely buttery, creamy aroma. A yummy brew. Last of the festival. Tempting to carry on, but the ability to taste straight is suffering. However - this is a wonderful bitter. But, after last weekend's car crash, and then the tyre shredding as I hurled myself toward this festival, I think it best not to chance my luck!
Fredericksburg Honigbrau;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;GABF '03. Nice gold color with thin head that dissapeared quickly. Floral aromas with hop bite. Boring, yet surprisingly, unimpressive, hmmm.
Fredericksburg Honigbrau;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;"(draught) Golden, like a rich honey indeed; little head. Very little nose - if anything a grain of malt? Malty taste, and sweet-perfumed, like a honey substitute. Crisp finish. creamy, definitely. At least something. Why did I even bother?"
Back Road Autumn Ale 2003 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;22 oz bottle. Cloudy copper color with a small head.

Back Road Autumn Ale 2003 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;Bottle. Deep copper, minimal head. Sweet overall with some hop balance. Fairly alcoholic. As it says, a fair autumn warmer...maybe too alcoholic.

Pours a deep muddy amber body with a very minimal head. Aroma and flavor are rich with malt, fruits & vegetables, plums, prunes, spiced Autumn apple cider, possibly even some butter nut squash. The palate is medium with a dry tart finish; I find many earthy notes such as that of cranberry sauce, yeah that�s right cranberry sauce is earthy!"
Back Road Autumn Ale 2003 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;Cloudy with thick head. Alcohol nose and taste--which I like in the creamier tripple. Hoppy finish with aftertaste of toast. Maybe it should have warmed a bit.
Back Road Autumn Ale 2003 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;I found this to be quite muddy and unrefined. Cloudy brown body with an off-white ring of foam clinging to the glass. Earthy aroma, with some alcohol in evidence. Flavor was hard to grasp- musty, murky bread, fairly dry, and with a bitter aftertaste. Medium-bodied. I had a hard time picking out individual flavors. My gestalt may detect less than the separate parts themselves!
Back Road Autumn Ale 2003 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;First time brewed in three years. The nice copper hue as almost no head except ring around top which did produce some lace. Fruity, wheaty, grainy, and malty aroma. The taste starts malty sweet but a surprising hop grapefruit element shows to add a bitter and acadic balance to the brew. Crisp feel to the finish. The tastes never seemed to meld completely but aging may do this beer some good.
Back Road Autumn Ale 2003 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;Pretty much as described. Light mouthfeel, bubbly carbonation, bright red in color. Some fruity pale malt hints, but mostly a faint caramel flavor. Dry grassy finish. Decent.

Nottingham Dreadnought;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nottingham Brewery;Not quite as hoped for given the name. Smells a little of grass and some malt. Taste is quite malty with a hop lurking in the background, slightly sticky. Dreadnought is smooth and sessiony, but if you're looking for a drink packed with flavour this isn't it. However there are certainly worse beers than this snatching your coin.
Nottingham Dreadnought;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nottingham Brewery;Half pint (4.5%) by hand-pump on 30 May 2019: fruity, malty aroma, golden amber, thin off-white head, irregular pattern of fine sparse lacing, fruity, caramel, cereal, biscuit malt flavour, creamy, smooth, good carbonation.

Aroma of bready malts, grain and some spicy hops. Taste of bready malts, grain, slight fruit and some spicy hops. Light to medium bodied and soft carbonation.

Nottingham Dreadnought;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nottingham Brewery;Cask at Bridge Street Ale House, Newcastle under Lyme. Pours golden amber. A decent spicy malt led bitter with a sharp hop finish. A raspy bitter in good order.
Nottingham Dreadnought;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nottingham Brewery;Draught (Drapers Arms, Peterborough) Light orange, small loose head. Simple grainy aroma, light estery fruity component. Very bready grainy taste, wholemeal loaf. Some husky hopping leaves a bitter finish. Sounds good, but actually it�s a bit dull. Certainly adequate though.

Rock Bottom Chicago Oatmeal Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Warrenville. Totally clear and opulent bronze with a lovely, solid, thick 1/8"" creamy off-white head. Nice thick lacing wrungs as well. Aroma of coriander, musk and white chocolate. Medium bodied and somewhat watering, and then something strange happens - like white chocolate covered black licorice, akin to Mike & Ikes before the candy casing falls to saliva intervention. Unique, to say the least, and points for the vanilla hints, but that�s as far as I�ll go."
Rock Bottom Chicago Oatmeal Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draught - This poured an orange/gold color with a thick white head that coated the glass as I drank. It�s got a nice mild citric (mainly orange) hopping in the aroma. It�s a nice smooth drink, well balanced with light caramel malt and citric and pine hoppings. Clean crisp finish. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL
Rock Bottom Chicago Oatmeal Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Chicago;Clear, golden amber body with a frothy white head. The aroma is quite hoppy with leans toward the citrus fruit. Orange, a bit of lemon, some caramel and grain and also a bit of pine. The body is quite smooth but not quite as full as I might like. There is a light malt sweetness at the front before the more dominate hops take over. I would have prefered a little more malt ot handle the high IBUs. Good, but not great.
Rock Bottom Chicago Oatmeal Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draught, November 2004: white, rocky cream; clear red amber. Modestly hoppy nose: sticky caramel coated pine. The oatmeal does seem to smooth out the palate, but perhaps mine came from a nitro draught as well�I didn�t see them pour it? The flavours are good, but in no way unique or complex�solid pineyness and a sticky, sappy finish. Not a head turner, but I could see myself drinking several these in a sitting�"
Rock Bottom Chicago Oatmeal Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Nitro Draft, 11/19/04. Different brew from last year, tapped last night for RB�s ""Miracle on State Street"" auction, but I�m guessing it�s the same recipe. Light amber body, fizzy dissipative head. A good pale ale smell, but somehow had a ""dusty"" component. Definitely an American Pale Ale hop profile, orangey and piney, toasty malts, and yes, a sort of oatmeal component, creamy and gummy at the same time. This time, the board lists it as havinf 80 IBU�s and I believe it. Nitro tap, Chicago. 10/3/03 Very interesting combo of styles. The bartender did an expert, Guiness-type two-part pour, which imparted a 2-color head (the head proper and a disappearing layer of fizz beneath). Just sipping the head is both bitter and creamy, and it doesn�t just lace, it coats the glass. Orange-amber body with a toasted pale malt taste. No bubbles, but a nice prickly mouthfeel, bubblier than a pub pull, and redolent of bitterness (29 IBU, it says). Great IPA bitterness melded to a creamy oatmeal body. Good effort on Pete�s part."

Max Oktoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Max Lager's;Bronzy-amber in color, topped by a whisper of beige foam. Bakery aromas of biscuity malt, along with earthy hops. Flavors of breadcrust, wood, walnuts, perhaps cookie dough? Absolutely no fruitiness. Pleasantly full-bodied, for the style. Finish is rich yet dry, with breadcrust, woody, and herbal hop aftertastes. Bring on the bratwurst!

Big River Grille Oktoberfest;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Very malty and boring.

Old Swan Brewery Bitter;Perth, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;The Old Brewery (Australia);Bugger, another ho-humbeer. This is not a bitter or if it is I don�t know what they are using for hops. Thin and poorly assertive. Not any good at all I�m sorry.
Old Swan Brewery Bitter;Perth, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;The Old Brewery (Australia);Amber in colour with a long lasting medium sized off-white head. A Fruity, biscuit, doughy type of aroma. Grainy, malty, crisp and bitter taste. Surprisingly smooth and very drinkable.

As it warms the aroma becomes a faint candy malt and sourdough. Smooth light body. Medium yeasty sourdough bready grainy malty start. Surprising hints of english pub ale character. Mild bitter middle. Soft dry finish. Unusual."
Old Swan Brewery Bitter;Perth, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;The Old Brewery (Australia);Slightly hazy amber, with a short lasted small off white head. Not much aroma, bit of fruit + biscuit. Thin mouthfeel, smooth though. Nice malty start, with a bitter mid and crisp bitter finish. Very similar to the pale ale, but without the citrusy hop flavour. Very drinkable, and not bad considering the low ABV. Not as good as a Rogers though IMO.
Old Swan Brewery Bitter;Perth, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;The Old Brewery (Australia);Tastes like a half decent lager, initial taste of bitter followed by smooth malt flavours at mid palate, not too sweet but I think it could do with a tad more alcohol.
Old Swan Brewery Brown Porter;Perth, Australia;Porter;The Old Brewery (Australia);Great porter. Great malty smooth flavour. Has well balanced sweetness and stands above pembertons rich porter. Wish i could get this in bottle.
Old Swan Brewery Brown Porter;Perth, Australia;Porter;The Old Brewery (Australia);Wow, what a place! Fresh micro brewed, unadulterated beer served on the beautiful Swan River with a service team that can only match the brewers excellence! The Porter was the standout drop for us, with such a smooth taste, and by the looks beautiful natural carbonation, I can only wish this beer was bottled.
Old Swan Brewery Brown Porter;Perth, Australia;Porter;The Old Brewery (Australia);"The last beer to try from this lovely micro-brewery/ restaurant (excellent service, excellent food and million dollar views; with a fresh brewed beer in hand you couldn�t possibly want anything else!!!). Served chilled, I let it sit until it warmed before trying. Clear, dark cola brown body with a short, soapy tannish head that lasted and left some legs. Dry, dusty cocoa and mocha coffee nose with a hint of smoky grain. Quite dry and malty in the mouth, smooth medium-light bodied with very soft �spritzy� carbonation that tickled the front of my tongue. Pronounced espresso coffee bean and dry smoky malt flavours with hints of cocoa powder upfront, and lightly bitter roasted malts in the back before a dry, roasted grain finish that was honestly refreshing. Aside from the brewer�s choice, this was the best of this brewers stables (I think most people suffer from dark beer biases, I included). A nice, simple, easy drinking porter."
Old Swan Brewery Brown Porter;Perth, Australia;Porter;The Old Brewery (Australia);"This was a great afternoon. The Old Swan Brewery has a brewery, a museum, a pub/cafe, and a fine dining restaurant all on premises. In the pub part you can do a ""tasting session"" where they bring you 5 brews on a cricket paddle for about $10. The porter was my favourite of the bunch, with the stout a close second. Both are solid contributions to the styles they represent, and were very enjoyable."
Old Swan Brewery Brown Porter;Perth, Australia;Porter;The Old Brewery (Australia);It looks like that the brewer is able to have more success with a forgiving darker beer. This has some reasonable mocha notes and good malty aroma. The bitterness comes from the chocolate malt I feel rather than hops. Good colour and all that but still not a stellar beer.
Old Swan Brewery Brown Porter;Perth, Australia;Porter;The Old Brewery (Australia);Brown colouring with a tannish medium sized head. Milky Bar (White Chocolate), hint of cookie-coffee and malty aroma.

Old Swan Brewery Brown Porter;Perth, Australia;Porter;The Old Brewery (Australia);Tried the range of beers produced at the brewery and this one is listed as the brewer�s choice which means it wont be a regular starter. It was the only one that kept any sort of head. Brown colour with an off white head, had an aroma of white milk chocolate and a mild coffee flavour with a creamy chalky texture.

Slightly bitter in the finish. ABV very well masked.
Old Swan Brewery Stout;Perth, Australia;Stout;The Old Brewery (Australia);"Draught; looks like 95% 0f all other stouts except perhaps the head is a lot smaller than most. Served shockingly cold. As it warms aroma is light coffee and malt with small amount of alcohol. Medium coarsish body. Simple mild roasted malts with faint sweetness and bready sour dough yeasty flavours. Alcohol is well masked."

The aroma has notes of roasted malt and so has the flavour. It has a nice, light bitterness, notes of caramel and a nice, light hint of citrus in the finish. A nice dunkel. 1835
Ring O Bells Sozzled Swine;Launceston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ring O Bells;Cask Stillage at the Bhurtpore Inn, Aston 10/07/2003 Mid brown coloured with a fruity aroma. Some alcohol in a full malt finish.
Ring O Bells Sozzled Swine;Launceston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ring O Bells;Cask at Babington Arms (JDW) Derby. With the deep amber body, wet mouthfeel and thin fruits it reminded me of the rather iffy Dreckly by the same brewer. A few mouthfulls down the line it warms to a malty chewiness but still feels like it�s been left in the back of a hot van for a few days.
Ring O Bells Sozzled Swine;Launceston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ring O Bells;Mid brown colour. Obviously aiming for a winter warmer style but sadly misses the mark, mainly I suspect through poor conditioning. The aroma has butterscotch, raw malt and bubblegum. Dull mouthfeel, a bit fruity, but marred by vinegary notes. Re-rate if the opportunity arises. Cask (gravity dispense), White Cliffs Beer Festival, February 2005.
Ring O Bells Sozzled Swine;Launceston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ring O Bells;"Gravity @ Medway Beer Fest. A malty and tangy bitter of decent depth and quality; though with some soapy notes."
Ring O Bells Sozzled Swine;Launceston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ring O Bells;Cask Conditioned at The Plough, Bodicote. A deep amber beer with little head. Acidic, astringent flavour almost chemical, forced hop with some sourness. A musty finish.
Warwickshire Thunderbolt;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Tasting notes from 2003 Harbury beer festival. Amber-brown with thin head. Sweet malt, sour fruit, and smoke (according to wife) notes. Carmel malts, sweet fruit flavours. Too sweet for my liking. Bitter finish.
Warwickshire Thunderbolt;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Orange brown in colour. Aromas are sweet brandy. Flavours are smooth caramel with alcohol vapours on the finish. Quite a warming brew for the winter.
Warwickshire Thunderbolt;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Looking at the festival programme, I thought that this looked as if it might be a �proper� IPA i.e one with a lot of alcohol, balanced by a massive dry hop rush. What a disappointment. The alcohol is certainly there, but the only other noticeable characteristic is a sickly, sticky sweetness. Tastes as if the sugar has not been fermented out, or it has been put into a molasses barrel that was still half full. Was it meant to be like this? I can�t think so. Horrible. Only the fact that I managed to finish it (just) saves it from a lower mark. Cask, Pigs Ear Beer Fest, East London, December 2003.
Warwickshire Thunderbolt;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Gravity fresh @ Pig's Ear Festival, East London. A slight aroma of sickly vomit. Amber autumn colour. Revolting. Sugar! Grainy. Nasty foul bitterness clashing with sweetness. Dreadful.
Warwickshire Thunderbolt;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Cask Conditioned at The Plough, Bodicote. Golden brown beer with a thin head. Rich malt flavour with apricot notes. Rich hoppy sweet flavour comes through.
Buffalo Tap Room Unfiltered Rye;Tonawanda, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;On tap at the brewpub. Really, really disappointed with this, especially because I�ve liked Custom Brewcrafters� stuff lately. Very dull pale yellow, not much taste, very thin, a little bit of malt but a bit skunky. Really wasn�t good, and I like rye beers. I won�t be having this again.
Buffalo Tap Room Unfiltered Rye;Tonawanda, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;2010 Autumn Festival of Ales. Pours to a clear golden color with an off-white head. Not much aroma from this beer, only a slight rye scent. Tastes pretty bland with a small amount of sweetness and rye. Did not notice the hops.
Buffalo Tap Room Unfiltered Rye;Tonawanda, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;Draft at Buffalo Tap Room. Pours gold with a white head. Malty aroma with a light spicy rye note. The flavor has rye and sweet malts, as well as a hint of buttered popcorn. Not awful.

Buffalo Tap Room Unfiltered Rye;Tonawanda, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;A pretty refreshing brew. Cloudy golden color with a lasting white head and good lacing. It is somewhat sweet with just a bit of tartness in the finish and very low bitterness. Good summer brew.
Buffalo Tap Room Unfiltered Rye;Tonawanda, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;Filtered or not to be filtered that is the question. Hoppiness and rye predominate with sweetness.
Buffalo Tap Room Unfiltered Rye;Tonawanda, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;Tap: Had this a few weeks ago at Custom Brewcrafters (they change 2-3 beers every week or so there). As others have mentioned, this beer doesn�t really appear to be unfiltered. Pours to a clear golden color with an off-white head. Not much aroma from this beer, only a slight grains/rye scent. Tastes pretty bland with a small amount of sweetness and rye on the tongue. Couldn�t detect any hops in this one. While this would be very easy to drink in quantity on a hot day, this is not a beer to pick for flavor.
Buffalo Tap Room Unfiltered Rye;Tonawanda, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;draft beer...looks like they may have read Oakes' and IPFreely's ratings since this now looks like an unfiltered beer. Hazy blonde pour with medium head. Not much for taste, minimal aroma, mostly malt. Only taste is grainy maltiness, pretty unimpressive. poorly done.

Fegley's Brew Works Berliner Weisse;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Berliner Weisse;Fegley's Brew Works;GABF 2014. Yellow of course. Well carbonated, with lots of bubbles on the tongue. Moderately sour for the style with some wheat. Sold effort.

Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;Darker brown with a light head. Aroma is sweet and a bit smoky. Flavor has some smoke, molasses, and dark sugar. Decent for the style.
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;Lightly roasty, lightly smoky notes to the sweet chocolate and caramel aroma with some herbal notes apparent. Hazy burnished copper coloured body is topped by a generous off white head that recedes slowly to cover and coats the glass. A little bit lighter in colour than I�d expect for a wee heavy. Caramel and toffee malt character with some dried fruit and earthy notes in the very short flavour profile. Medium light body feels somewhat thin with moderate carbonation. Sampled on the PA trip 2005.
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;Orangey brown pour, showing off with a large creamy beige head. Watered down coffee contrasts with quality moka-ish caramel in the nose whereas more hops than you�d expect come up lemony and obviously too citric, perhaps not the best family pick here, ultimately procuring a slight astringency and rather lactic sour feel that really gives the impression of thinner malts than what there is. Mineral laden light-medium body, heavily carbonated, propulsing interesting vanilla and roasted notes, but it�s already too late for glory.
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;The Lure: Fragile malt roastiness within cordial caramel sweetness. Thick foam clings onto the sides of the glass, a pleasant prediction of wealth. The Festivities: Sanative fruity sweetness sticks to the regenerative citrusy, wooden hop finish. Impetuous carbonation mars the voluptuous malt feel. Then appears a dry earth design, as malt flavors resign. I would have liked more flavor development from the malt, not just a bigger mouthfeel. Transcendence: Raking leaves is nice for the eyes, but...
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;Poured a hazy brown color with a small, light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate, peat smoke, caramel malt and roast as well. Taste of nuts, caramel, roasted malts, some smoke and a touch of hoppiness as well. Alcohol was no where to be found.
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap at the BBW. Poured a dark amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, roasted malts and very light smoke. Tastes of toffee, some peat, and a little bready. Light alcohol in the finish. Sweet. Beer menu had this listed @ 6.2% (�as the Hammer Shop Wee Heavy�).
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;Stronger version of their Bagpiper. Good beer. Powerful. Alcohol is present but pleasant. Very good beer.
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;Initially very little aroma. Practically no head, which was light tan. Color was on the ruby side of deep brown. First sip had bracing alcohol belt, but finished smooth and sweet with a slight roasted malt after-taste. Aroma became malty as the beer warmed up (was served too cold for the style)
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;Strong scottish ale. Bought a growler from the tap. A dark fruitiness (raisans?) with a very full body. Reminds me of a old ale in character and flavor.
Bethlehem Brew Works Wee Heavy;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;Excellent scottish ale, dark reddish-brown color, nice bubbly tanish head, very full in body, nicely balanced, the alcohol is masked pretty well, semi-dry finish, very good scotch ale
Burtonwood Top Hat;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);First tasted this in Gabriels, Paisley in June 1998. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale garnet in colour with a thin white head. Slight hint of berry fruit in the short malty aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives digestive biscuit in the robust malt base with a fruity tang of blackcurrant also present. Bitter hop resins impart a dry bitter aftertaste which compliments the woody malt well. Finish is dry but bitter sweet with woody notes ever present. A robust ESB style ale which is full of flavour and an ideal session ale.
Burtonwood Top Hat;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Darkish bitter with a decent head that lasts through the pint. Malty taste, without lots of character but decent enough beer.

Burtonwood Top Hat;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Did someone say Premium? ESB? Not even Average. Looked thin, tasted instantly forgettable. Smells of something most brewers would throw away at an early stage.
Burtonwood Top Hat;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Cask Conditioned at a Wetherspoons. A light brown beer with rich head. A heady floral bitter, sweet and refreshing. My pint tasted a little old, but I was in a Macpub. Heavy bitter hoppy finish, shame about the quality of the pub dispense as I'm sure this could be a great beer.

Amicas Rolfs Porter;Salida, Colorado, United States;Porter;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;8 oz draft at the brewpub: Thick standing head on a dark brown beer. Nice coffee-bitterness. Bit light in body, but a nice roastiness makes up for it!
Amicas Rolfs Porter;Salida, Colorado, United States;Porter;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;Couldnt find specific on this beer on any search page, but I did find that it exists... GABF 2003 - A nice aroma of roasted malts, dark brown and translucent in coloration with a thin head. There is a strong flavor of roasted malts, combined with a bitter woody note. There are also chocolate characteristics. Overall the beer is a bit thin.
Copper Canyon Oktoberfest;Southfield, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);burnt orange color, lightly malty with some butterscotchy (maybe diacetyl) aromas. nutty, toasty, buttery flavors. walnut, and some european hops, perhaps too much hops but still a smooth, easy drinking oktoberfest. pretty good, really.
Copper Canyon Oktoberfest;Southfield, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Not the best impresson of this style. A fairly decent malt note in the aroma. A little too hoppy for a good Octoberfest.
Copper Canyon Oktoberfest;Southfield, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Deep red amber with some dark chestnut brown hues. Little to no head, quite clear. Aroma has some sour hops smell, grainy wheat flavors and maybe a touch of alcohol. Begins mildly bitter, has a decent hops bite to it and a moderately grainy mouthfeel. Some astringency and sourness problems, and the alcohol asserts itself too much because, once again, there is little to no malt presence. Carbonation level is ok. Tons of soapiness on the finish, one thing I absolutely hate. (well Im sure no one likes soapy beers).
Copper Canyon Oktoberfest;Southfield, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Nice head and lacing. Great color that catches the light well. I grabbed a couple of bottles of it for a party and everyone was pleased with it.

Brew Moon North Star Lager;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;Tap. Sweet buttery malt aroma. Golden yellow color with moderate head. Butter malt flavor. Another with high diacetyls - described as a German style lager - this was closest to a Helles or a Maerzen but hard to put a finger on due to the diacetyls.
Brew Moon North Star Lager;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;On tap, Brewpub. Admittedly, I tried this a bit too deep into a drinking night to give this a proper rating. Nevertheless, there were some memorable qualities to it. First of all, it pours a quite palid yellow color. Aroma is light, with some grass and citrus. Flavor is grassy, but maintains a semi-interesting citrus hop character that I didn�t expect. Finish is pleasantly off-sweet. From my memory, this is definitely drinkable, just a bit boring.

Mighty Oak Poor Yorick;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Dark brown with a beige head. Smooth easy drinking beer. Soft and complex, the beer drinks like session ale for the first half. In fact your searching for flavour when its there. Just be patient. Auburn, almost red with speckled beige head. Chocolate, mocha aroma. Flavour that dances around on the palate. First its immediate, then its comes later on the palate. Regardless of where it arrives on your palate its always support by solid bitter structure. Cedar and sweet wood notes as well.
Copper Tank Amarillo by Morning IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Some head and lacing. Strongest flavors of any of their offerings, but not the type I care for, with the strong hops.
Urthel Bravoer Boneur Tripel;Ruiselede, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Urthel (Swinkels Family Brewers);Blonde colored beer with a little frothy head. The aroma is malty with citrus fruits.

Urthel Bravoer Boneur Tripel;Ruiselede, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Urthel (Swinkels Family Brewers);Keg, In De Wildemann Oct2003. Gold, moderate head and condition. Spicy malt with low hop notes in the nose, quite thin with an apple tartness and yeast in the mouth. Apple notes linger into the finish. Did little to change my ambivalence towards tripels.

Urthel Bravoer Boneur Tripel;Ruiselede, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Urthel (Swinkels Family Brewers);Tap, caf� De Engel Oldenzaal. Blonde pilsener color. Slight frothy head that lasts. The aroma is largely blown away by the wind on the terrace (some malt and citrus) but the flavor is smooth, citric and just a bit hoppy. Peach apple and a hint of cherry. Thin to medium bodied, fairly alcoholic. A pretty well balanced beer that looks a bit like a Duvel, but is fruitier and less assertive. Re-rate after almost two months on tap. Some yoghurt. Intense pineapple fruit. Fine Saaz hops. Becoming honeyish.

Olde Auburn Full Monty Stout;Auburn, Alabama, United States;Stout;Olde Auburn Ale House (AL);Black ... poured beautifully, with a nice waterfall building into a solid head. Despite the watery texture, this is a decent smoky coffee-flavored brew ... maybe a tad too sweet at the finish.
Olde Auburn Full Monty Stout;Auburn, Alabama, United States;Stout;Olde Auburn Ale House (AL);Blackened ruby and a tan head that doesn�t fade. Big coffee-roasty, definitely dry, but the finish kind of falls away. Definitely different from the Montgomery stout by the same brewer, which is sweet and has more chocolate in the profile. This would be much better if the initial flavor burst would linger a bit longer.

Outback Stout;Woodpark, NSW, Australia;Stout;Outback Brewery;Worst stout in history. Thin bodied and sweet. Then the rank POR and rusted metal flavours kick in, some roasted malt in there, but not enought to cover up the shittyness of this beer. I can't believe how bad this is, normally stouts are at least drinkable, even if its a pretty bad one, but this one totally wipes that theory away. not quite the my least favourite beer, but it comes mighty close, i also chose to pour half of it down the sink. May you never ever come in contact with this beer.
Outback Stout;Woodpark, NSW, Australia;Stout;Outback Brewery;the first time i can remember ever pouring a beer down the drain because it was that bad. normally with offensive tasting beers like het kanon i just try and down them quickly so i don't notice how bad they are but it just didn't work with this. tasted like a homebrew stout i put on before i went away for a week and when i got back was rancid after a heatwave. three flavours - brown sugar, licorice and dirt. vomit aftertaste stuck with me a long time. just thinking about it makes me feel nauseous

Little lacing on the first glass but consecutive glasses leave no lace. Aroma is slightly roasty with some salty/metallic notes which are actually pleasing. Taste is sweet yet balanced by the slight salinity from the oysters. Mouthfeel is what makes this beer awesome. This is soo smooth and drinkable coming from the calcium in the oyster shells. I even let my mom try this beer and she really liked it (and she only drinks miller lite!). So good- I�m going to try to make a homebrew batch in the near future.

The aroma hints of coffee, chocolate, burnt caramel malts, floral and grassy hops, and dusty yeast esters. The taste starts bittersweet and slightly fruity. Undertones of smoke, chalk, and seaweed. The finish is muddy coffee and displays some nutty character. The mouthfeel is dry, chalky, and a tad thin. A very well done dry stout which appears to be suited for drinking with shellfish.

Vale Special;Brill, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Vale Brewery;Pint: hand-pulled on 6th Oct 2012 in the Wolverhampton Wetherspoons.

Southampton Oyster Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout;Southampton Publick House;Growler shared by Hopdog. Not really sure what to say about this one. This was one of the strangest beers I have had. I really did not enjoy this and I need to remember to possibly try it again if it comes around again or make sure I stay away from it. Not sure which one yet.
Southampton Oyster Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout;Southampton Publick House;Sample from a growler. Rich cloudy chocolate black body. Dry bakers chocolate and salty toast throughout, from the somewhat parched and stale (in a good way) nose, to the creamy but dry (opposite of sweet) oily texture on the back. Very good.

Southampton Oyster Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout;Southampton Publick House;Growler shared by kp at the Brick Store. Pours dark, dark brown with a tan head that lingers for a little while but leaves no lacing. The aroma is dominated by roasted malts and chocolate with the sweetness coming out even more as it warmed. The taste is heavier on the roasted malt side of things with a little chocolate and coffee in the there as well. The mouthfeel is very smooth with good carbonation. I enjoyed this one and it�s a very good sessionable stout. Thanks again to kp for sharing this one.
Southampton Oyster Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout;Southampton Publick House;On tap at SPH. Arrived at the table black with a moderate brown head that faded to a ring after the first quarter of the glass and left a partial coating of lace with each sip. Very pleasant aroma of mocha and roasted malt with the mocha being more dominant. The flavor is more heavily influenced by the roasted malt, with barely a hint of the mocha that is so noticeable in the aroma. There is also a bit of cardboard in the flavor as well. Mild-moderate bitterness at the finish. A very solid stout.
Southampton Oyster Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout;Southampton Publick House;Tap @ SPH. Pours a dark brown with a barely-there tan head that was quickly not there at all. Aroma is roasted malt, slight smoke, and slight slight hops. Flavor is complex, with roasted malt coming to the fore in the beginning, dissolving into chocolate and coffee notes with a barely detectable salt characteristic. These guys make better stouts than this (cough, Russian Imperial, cough), but this one is not bad at all.
Southampton Oyster Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout;Southampton Publick House;On tap at SPH. Pours a dark brown with no real head. Aroma of roast, roasted meats, and smoke. Flavor is surprisingly rich: rich sweet roasted malt. Some smoked meats too. Quite delicious, nice smooth palate. Very good.
Southampton Oyster Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout;Southampton Publick House;On tap at the brewpub. Aroma of roast and some smoke. Flavor continues to be roasty and feature smoked meats, then some sweetness comes in and battles to a draw with the roast. Pretty rich in the mouth, but still finishes clean during the battle of bitter roast and sweet creaminess. Tasty.
Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Transparent golden pour w/ no head or lacing. Very nice Belgian scented aroma. Taste is complex & fairly smooth at nearly 10%. I�m a fan!
Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;A decent approximation of a Belgian tripel. Served in a tulip glass, it lacked the towering head of a true tripel, and the flavor notes were much more subdued. On the right ttrack, but nowhere near the original
Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Note: I am not a big fan of Tripels. Weak nose -- maybe a little bit of sweet malt. The appearance is a medium yellow with a hint of orange and a golden glow. Good head. Taste was pretty nondescript for me. A little bread, a little malt. Not something I�ll order.
Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Draft. Bright clear yellow, thin white head, scant lacing. Aroma of white pepper, straw. Taste is bitter hay. Very plain, not much maltiness.
Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Tap. Pours clear gold with a small, fizzy white head, short retention with light/spare lacing.

Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Draft @ brewpub. Pours gold with thin white head. Aroma is spice, yeast, and light malt.

Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub. Pours a clear honey gold with a two finger white head that reduces to a ring. The aroma is spicy, with candi sugar, honey and a touch of alcohol. Taste is a candy sweetness, vanilla cream, light caramel, citrus, tropical fruit, peppery hops and Belgian yeast. Light and creamy with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable with little noticeable alcohol.
Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Location: On tap at the Brew Pub, 8/12/09 Aroma: Big fruit nose, pretty complex, spice, sugar, banana, citrus, apple Appearance: Clear orange-gold color Flavor: Sweet and malty, nice fruity malts and spice, balanced and complex Palate: Nice mouthfeel, mild alcohol burn, medium body Overall Impression: I found this to be a really nice example of this style. Well made with quite a bit of interesting fruity complexity to it. This was a sure winner for me, really tasty. I wasn�t surprised at all when the bartender mentioned its popularity amongst the regulars, a very nice brew!
Stewart's Stumblin Monk Abbey Tripel;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;BCTWC 09. Pours a hazy deep golden and a thin white head. Aroma of cardamon and phenolicy yeasty belgian spice- some fruity banana esters as well and hints of apple juice. More clove and cardamon flavor, doughy yeastiness and good fresh bready malts for the backbone- and a thinning sweet palate - candi sugar and more earthy dry spiciness in the end.

Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;On tap at Yards. Aroma of smoke, charcoal, coffee and pine hop. Pours light black (if that�s a thing) with a small biege head. Taste is wonderfully roasty with smoke forward and a roast coffee finish. Perfect amount of malt present. Kind of thin in the mouth but effectively roasty and well carbonated. Great smoked porter.
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;Firkin at Real Ale. Pours a deep brown with tan head. Nose of smoked meats. Overwhelming smoke. Not something I like.
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;Smokey aroma, but not overpowering. Taste is similar to a deep amber ale with a smokiness. Personally, I still can�t do more than one smoked beer in a sitting.
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;"Looked great, but smelled of bacon bits.. or maybe beef jerky. Tasted just as awful, if not worse. Severely overrated. Stewart�s cannot make a beer with ""smoke"" in the title that�s enjoyable."
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;Tap at MASHOUT 2009. Pours a deep dark woody brown with a nice lasting head- some lace. Aroma is sharp smoked wood- I can kinda get the beechwood, but seems a bit harsh- burnt brown toasted malts- over baked burnt cookies, some chocolate malts, and sweet tootsie roll. Flavor is cookie dough, chocolate malts, light roast, ok smoke, green minty herbal hops, and a mostly smooth finish. Good.
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;Location: On tap at the Brew Pub, 8/12/09 Aroma: Woody and smokey, coffee, actually has a pretty similar nose to the stout Appearance: Dark brown with a light brown head, coating lace Flavor: Similar to the nose, but it is a little thinner, and lacking some in flavor, smokey, mild bitterness Palate: A bit light in body, thin, decent mouthfeel Overall Impression: This was a pretty decent beer, but it was so much better in the nose then in the drink that I was a bit disappointed once I tasted it. Still pretty solid, but not spectacular by any means.
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub. Poured deep brown color with a one finger head that did leave some lacing. Roasted malts, light coffee, and some hops in the aroma. The flavor was solid with the dark roasted malts and hops. Thin mouthfeel with a bit of dryness.
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;On draft at stewarts. Black in color, good head and good lacing. Nice aroma of coffee and roasted malt. Taste was a very well balanced porter. Coffee, roasted malt, a little spiceyness from the smoke. Similar to their old perculator... Good texture and carbonation. I enjoyed this beer. Overall good brew!
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;Draft pint at the brewpub. Pitch black with a whisper of an off-white foam. The aroma isn�t too different than a chimney, but not in an overpowering way. It drinks with a bit of an ashy smokiness. There�s a bit of nice bitter finish, making this quite a drinker. (#3179, 11/8/2007)
Stewart's Smoked Porter;Bear, Delaware, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stewart's Brewing Company;GABF 2007: Poured a clear deep brown color with a tan head. The aroma was smoke and chcolate with a little fruit. Smokey flavor over sweet dark malt. Decent smoke in the aroma and flavor.
Museum Ale;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);Sampled cask conditioned at Akkurat, Stockholm. Amber coloured. Caramelly aroma. Dusty and ashy. Medium bodied, medium sweet. Rounded but hard mouthfeel. Sharp lingering bitter finish.
Bilbos Wizard Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bilbo's;The appearance was a light orange/slight yellow color with a light foamy head that fell off immediately. No lace. The aroma had some sweet wheat combining with some light citrusy hops, light sweet with a faint bitterness. The flavor yielded to the sweetness of the blend of it all. Mild sweet wheaty aftertaste without the bite and finding it�s way into the finish. The feel was between a light and medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine. Overall, do-able as a wheat ale, but don�t think this one is one of those hoppier ones like Gumballhead or Lil Sumpin Sumpin. This is way sweeter than those.
Bilbos Wizard Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bilbo's;Tap. Nice gold with full head. Solid lacing. Aroma of Wrigley�s chewing gum that is slightly stale. This dominate impression carries into taste. Medium to light body. There is yeast. More chewing gum. One dimensional.
Bilbos Wizard Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bilbo's;"Draft to mug at Bilbo�s (from notes). Looks fine; light-orange with some white head. Smells at tastes like a mild wheat beer. Average on the palate. Not much going on here, but then again, I�m not a huge fan of wheat beers anymore either."
Bilbos Wizard Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bilbo's;Pours a dark orange, bubbles cling to the side with a thin tan head and larger bubbles. The nose is faint and grainy, barely any yeast with some strong phenol and a faint lemony hop. The taste has more phenol, off putting, fair amount of lemon and strong grain in back. Lighter body, strong carbonation and a bit of an empty finish.
Bilbos Wizard Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bilbo's;Draft sample at brewpub. Poured cloudy yellow color with an average fizzy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate wheat citrus aroma. Medium body with a smooth thin texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met with an average drinkable beer.
Bilbos Wizard Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bilbo's;"Had this beer after stopping in at Bell�s, I will be kind and not down it to much. However, it lacked just about every character an American Wheat style beer should have. Poor aroma.............color way to dark............flavor not even close. Zero drinkability/enjoyment factor. I would say that maybe it was an ""off"" night but my two friends tried two other Bilbo products and arrived at the same conclusions. Great price on the beers at $2.75 for a 28 oz. mug but we ended up pouring all three out in the parking lot from the patio and ordering Sierra Nevada Pale ale. Pizza is awsome, skip the beer!"
Bilbos Wizard Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bilbo's;one of the best bilbos beer. It�s a shame that they don�t bottle the stuff, but going to bilbos is always a treat. Also, recommended is their Dragon Red and Duff beer (YES, a total rip off of the Simpsons but both tasty).
Bilbos Wizard Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bilbo's;This is a very nice American Style Wheat beer and found in a place that makes great pizza as well. Perfect compliment. Whereas many microbreweries overhops their beer this is very nice. Smooth and a little bitter. Great compliment to the food. Must try.
Bilbos Raspberry Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bilbo's;"Draft to pint (from notes). Looks fine; light and transparent. Smells like raspberries and wheat. Tastes the same with an average mouthfeel. Better than Wizard Wheat IMO, and not bad for a raspberry wheat."
Bilbos Raspberry Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bilbo's;Not necessarily a fruit beer but flavored perfectly with raspberry. The flavor is quite nice. The raspberry isn't overpowering at all and the beer itself is smooth with a nice berry finish. No harsh aftertaste. Awesome.
Ohio Brewing Verich Gold;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Ohio Brewing Company;Sampled at great taste. Almost vlear gold. Earthy and grainy. A little fruit and sulfur. Clean but still authentic.
Ohio Brewing Verich Gold;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Ohio Brewing Company;Draft pour. Clear yellow with a white heqd of foam. The aroma has bread and grass and straw. Sweet and bready taste. Refreshing and approachable beer. Light body and medium carbonation.

Ohio Brewing Verich Gold;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Ohio Brewing Company;12oz bottle into Le Listermann (no clue how old this beer is, considering the brewery is out of business) - nose is fresh grass. Lemon peel or plain lemon to the face. Sweaty lemon.
Ohio Brewing Verich Gold;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Ohio Brewing Company;"its probably not fair for me to even be rating this as the one I tried was certainly skunked: light gold color with a huge white head; the one I tried was seriously overcarbonated; must have been skunked - it had a nasty vinegar taste and was undrinkable"
Ohio Brewing Verich Gold;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Ohio Brewing Company;Yellow-gold with a small head. Aroma is barley malt. Flavour of malt, grain. Euro-lager-ish.... mediocre at best.

Ohio Brewing Verich Gold;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Ohio Brewing Company;On tap at Cincinnati Winter Beer Fest (CWBF) 2013. Clear golden color. Minimal white khaki head. No nose. Kind of a lagery, basic flavor. Minimal grassy hops. Bready malts. Nothing basic, just boring. Little loose lace. Light to medium body. Dry texture. Sweet taste.

Tugboat Thunderbolt Pale ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;On tap at tugboat Portland. Pours out a hazy gold topped with a small head. Nose is earthy hops some floral and a lemon note. Taste is more of the hop hit and a earthy malt note.
Tugboat Thunderbolt Pale ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Pours a light cloudy golden color with no head. Not much aroma and taste is of light malt with a bitter aftertaste.
Tugboat Thunderbolt Pale ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Earthy, cheesy aroma of english hops. A strawberry blond color with frothy white head. Lemon-acidic to start, followed by a funky, cheesy flavor. Fades into a slightly sour citrus character. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Overall, a beer that tasted a bit more like some sort of fruit sour.
Tugboat Thunderbolt Pale ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Draft at Tugboat. Wow, too bad about this one. Bright orangey medium amber, headless, laceless. Plenty of rising carb. Looks kinda like a pop. Weirdly aluminum-esque candied orange hops. Fizzy, watery body. Aluminum, candied oranges, and aspartame on the mid-palate. Tastes like a two day hangover.
Tugboat Thunderbolt Pale ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Pours a clouded yellow. Smells of the same hops as other tugboat beers. Tastes of nothing but the hops that are in all the other tugboat beers but not as strongly as in some. Week tepid aftertaste. A dissapointment.
Tugboat Thunderbolt Pale ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;"Had this as just ""Pale Ale"" at the brewery, July 2005. Had a bit of a funky smell to it (don�t they all?) - with some old cheese and leafy hops, some spoiled fruit such as orange, pineapple and apricots. Just plain weird."
Tugboat Thunderbolt Pale ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;on tap at tugboat. pretty decent apa. grapefruit and lemon aroma with a fair amount of bitterness and frozen yoghurt in the finish
Tugboat Thunderbolt Pale ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Tap@Tugboat. Pretty bitter and dry, a cross between an English and American style pale ale. Has the aromatic NW hops, with a salty, bitter dryness in English beers. OK by me.

Australian Pizza Kitchen Ginger Beer;Canberra City, Australia;Flavored - Other;Australian Pizza Kitchen Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Pale yellow. Non-surprising ginger aroma. Sweet with a marmeladey orange/ginger flavour. The mouthfeel is soft but sticky, and there is no malt flavour nor trace of hop bitterness. instead there is a burning ginger finish. The flavour is, sweetness aside, actually pretty good, but it�s very one-dimensional, and a glass gets tough to finish.
Australian Pizza Kitchen Ginger Beer;Canberra City, Australia;Flavored - Other;Australian Pizza Kitchen Brewery;LIke the pale ale and the pizzas at this Canberra restaurant/brewery, this ginger beer seems to have too much of everything. It has a huge ginger kick and the sugar content is off the scale. It arrived at the table a clear pale gold but fairly flat and uninviting - looked like a flat macro lager. Mild sugary aroma with some candied ginger. Syrupy palate that became cloying - not at all refreshing. As with the pale ale, less could be more here. (Draught at the pizza restaurant/brewery with omhper)
Australian Pizza Kitchen Ginger Beer;Canberra City, Australia;Flavored - Other;Australian Pizza Kitchen Brewery;Served with ice(??) and lemon. Really good, fresh ginger aroma which got my hopes up. Flavour starts off slightly gingery and then becomes overpoweringly SWEET. It was nice in a way, but I don't find anything that sweet refreshing. Should have ordered a pot instead of a pint.
Australian Pizza Kitchen Ginger Beer;Canberra City, Australia;Flavored - Other;Australian Pizza Kitchen Brewery;refreshing enough in a lemonade kind of way. very light yellow with a fair sized head. not bad as far as sweet ginger beers go
Wizard Sorcerer;Illfracombe, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wizard;Tasting notes from Norman Knight (2004). Reddish-brown with white head. Mild hop and malt roast aromas. Surprised by the level of maltiness for a bitter, with lite hop notes. Not a ton of flavour, but drinkable.
Wizard Sorcerer;Illfracombe, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wizard;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Chestnut colour with white head. Good best bitter, plenty of flavour with deeper roasted malt and fresh hoppy notes. I got a hint of mango on the flavour. Decent hoppy finish. Enjoyable.
Wizard Sorcerer;Illfracombe, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wizard;Cask Conditioned, at the Saint Albans Beer Festival, 2003. Murky, mahogany colour with raspberry tint. Stagnant flavour to when there is any. Wizard didn�t have the best of sessions at this fare.

Liebus Br�u Dunkel Weisse;Poing (M�nich), Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Liebharts Br�uhaus Poing;Yeasty vanilla nose, roasted nutty notes as well.

Liebus Br�u Dunkel Weisse;Poing (M�nich), Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Liebharts Br�uhaus Poing;Beautiful deep amber color. Peculiar aroma: caramel and wood.

Freisinger Schwarzbier;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Freisinger Gasthaus Brauerei;Another beautiful beer from this brewery, settling in with a deep translucent cherry brown color and a super cafe frappe / mocha khaki head and a lacing tract that could throw off snow dogs. Crushed mocha beans and granular coffee are aromatically sidelined by distant, cleanly caramel and rubber chocolate nuts. Mild milk chocolate and heath bars waft psychometrically all around. A lighter fairing flavor with pinions of caramel, light toffee and copper kettle accents. Loose, light slips hint at an easy going format of hazelnut coffee while Score bars gain a tally mark for sweetening. Whole wheat hard rolls meet a light cocoa-bran combo, sweetened with caramel and toffee. Serving temperature and carbonation are perfect, as is the balance. Heath toffee crunch characteristics hang around in the finish with liquefied maple brown sugar and pure cocoa bean crushings, along with those hazelnut dashings for support.
Freisinger Schwarzbier;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Freisinger Gasthaus Brauerei;Slight nutty and yeasty aroma. Chestnut coloring, whipped cream head. Fullbodied, chocolate and nutty notes, topped of with aromatic hops. Bitterhop exit. Very nice schwarzbier.

Sockeye Crooked Trail Harvest Ale;Boise, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sockeye Brewing;APPEARANCE: Poured from tap into a pint glass, it showed a terrific copper color with a thick tall cream-colored head which left nice lacing as it slowly dissipated. AROMA: Great malt and hops blend. Caramel and roasted smells with an earthy hop aroma mixed in. FLAVOR: I like drinking this one when I go to Sockeye Brewery. It has the right balance of malt sweetness, roasted flavors up front, and hops flavor and bitterness in the finish. Definately not a lop-sided beer. PALATE: This is no weakling. I like the fuller texture this beer portrays, not watery or thin. OVERALL IMPRESSION: The sweet roast up front and slight bitterness in the end, coupled with a full texture make this one good all the way through to last drop. I cant have just one. Serving type: on-tap

Portsmouth Abbey Style Dubbel Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Dubbel;Portsmouth Brewery;"Reviewed from notes. The appearance was an amber/copper color with a finger�s worth of white foamy head that quickly dissipated. Lace wants to be somewhat sticky, but it slides. The aroma had some cherries, the sweet fleshy side with some milk chocolate. Some candied sugary Belgian notes. Super light bready/Belgian yeastiness. The flavor leaned towards the sweet side and delves into the cherries fairly nice with the Belgian sugars and milk chocolate somewhat into the aftertaste. Odd sort of super sweet finish with some apples in there, somewhat like red delicious. The feel had a light to medium body with a fair sessionability about it. Pretty mobile along my tongue. Overall, there seems to be a slight lack of ""Belgian spice"" in this one. And I had this several times as well, but I�ll just tack it up as ""trial and error,"" though this wasn�t entirely an error, just enjoyable as is."
Portsmouth Abbey Style Dubbel Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Dubbel;Portsmouth Brewery;Amber/copper pour with very little head.

Portsmouth Abbey Style Dubbel Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Dubbel;Portsmouth Brewery;2004 draught @ the brewery. Copper-amber as boto describes, which makes me think of a trippel. Rapidly fizzling white head and a stiff aroma of clove, alcohol, yeast and perhaps some bitter hops. Flavor starts out very strong and sharp of yeast, alcohol, spicy tettnangs or saaz hops. Mild sweetness with some light banana esters, clove and a bit of orange blossom-like honeyed malt. A body that would be medium-full if not interupted by the amount of alcohol sharpness. Some notes of light toffee, some citrus (perhaps some american hops) and a lightly spritzy, mostly smooth mouthfeel. Warming, high alcohol and quite flavorful, but this seems like it needs to be cold condtioned right after being brewed to halt the strong estery, alcohol assault.
Last Drop Brewhouse Pilsener;Canning Vale, Australia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Last Drop Brewery;On tap at Petition, Perth. Crystal clear amber beer with bubbly white head.

Last Drop Brewhouse Pilsener;Canning Vale, Australia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Last Drop Brewery;The first beer I got to try from their new Brewery/restaurant in Canningvale. An impressive set up indeed where the wort is brought from Bedfordale for fermentation and is served fresh from the conical fermenters behind the bar. Hazy orange gold body with a fairly dense white crown that stuck around for the length. Overly subtle lemon and grain aroma, and nothing much else I could detect. Light bodied, crisp and quite fresh in flavour. Dry, pasty yeast and grain across the tongue, lemons and grassy hops in the back and a citric orange flavour to balance, that became more pronounced once it warmed. Finish is short and crisp with only a little bitterness. Overly subtle and served a little too cold, it did get better warm and remained quite refreshing all the way down. A little light on but dangerously easy to drink.

Last Drop Brewhouse Pilsener;Canning Vale, Australia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Last Drop Brewery;Pale golden colour, mild bitterness, no head and some lacing. This pilsener slipped down easily enough but it didn't really have much going for it.
Last Drop Brewhouse Dark;Canning Vale, Australia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Last Drop Brewery;Out of the mini keg at Mitch�s house. Surprisingly pretty good. A very malt driven beer. Works well with great balance. Nothing overly complex but a damn good quaffer of a dark beer. Enjoyable and drinks very easily
Last Drop Brewhouse Dark;Canning Vale, Australia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Last Drop Brewery;The second beer I tried at their new Canningvale Brewery/restaurant and the better of the two. Served up alongside some Turkish bread, dips and pumpkin soup, and it did compliment the food well. 100% for presentation. Thick as whipped cream tannish head, lasting and left rings down the glass. Deep brownish black with a little ruby in the lights and completely opaque. Sadly there was almost no noticeable aroma apart from some husky dark malt, due to the very low carbonation. Dry and husky in the mouth, and almost still, with flavours of coffee grains, toasted malt and dusty cocoa powder. Had a lot of grassy hops present in the back and blended with the malt to give a nice bitter finish and a husky roasted grain aftertaste. Not a fan off nitrogenated beers but this had a decent amount of flavour and body that stopped it from becoming lifeless. Nice easy sipper, and served up in the surrounds of one of the most impressive brewpubs in Perth made it even better. Quite nice.
Last Drop Brewhouse Dark;Canning Vale, Australia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Last Drop Brewery;nfob03. had to agree with duff that this had a real ruberiness in the aroma. also was quite nutty with some brown sugar sweetness. just a bit flat - it was non-nitrogenated and really didn't have a lot of body
Last Drop Brewhouse Dark;Canning Vale, Australia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Last Drop Brewery;Black in colour with a small but lasting light brown head.This was the better of the two that I tried but maybe I am partial to dark beers now.Toasted and chocolate flavours with hints of liquorice.Cheers!
Last Drop Brewhouse Dark;Canning Vale, Australia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Last Drop Brewery;Sweetish, chocolatey start, with some roast and rubber in the finish, didn't like the rubber taste too much, but the rest was OK, medium bitterness on the finish. Dry-ish finish. Felt a bit thin in the end however, light to medium bodied. Not bad in the end, drinkable.
Bootleg Stout;Margaret River, Australia;Stout;Bootleg Brewery;330ml bottle. Looks strong and sturdy and is midnight black in colour with a creamy tan head. Aroma of licorice with a hint of coffee. Nice sweet burnt coffee flavours dominate with a long finish.
Bootleg Stout;Margaret River, Australia;Stout;Bootleg Brewery;5.5% LIimited Release. Black body with a short but lasting light tan head. Notice the star anise straight up in the aroma but I was looking for it. The star anise is also noticeable in the taste but fortunately not as dominant, mouthfeel was good with the body not too full, some cocoa, coffee and burnt notes as well.
Bootleg Stout;Margaret River, Australia;Stout;Bootleg Brewery;Pours deep black with medium lasting tan head. Aroma of liquorice, smoke and roasted coffee. Smooth thin-medium mouthfeel. Sweet malty caramel start with a dry roast bitter finish. A little dissapointing in my opinion.
Bootleg Stout;Margaret River, Australia;Stout;Bootleg Brewery;Dark colouring with a thick off-white head. Roasty, smokey type of aroma. Roasty, coffee and bitter taste. OK brew.
Bootleg Stout;Margaret River, Australia;Stout;Bootleg Brewery;Inoffensive but not something I�d want to sit down and nurse with loving care either. Good coffee undertones and a roasty, malty aftertaste, but give me a Cascade Special Stout anyday.
Bootleg Stout;Margaret River, Australia;Stout;Bootleg Brewery;Coffee: International Roast with old people ashing their winnie blues in there. Milkless. I remember this coffee taste from Taverners. Good stuff though, some freshness. One of the better Australian stouts I've had.
Bootleg Stout;Margaret River, Australia;Stout;Bootleg Brewery;nfob03. good full-bodied stout. burnt asphalt aroma, some espresso and burnt lychee taste and quite a bitter finish
Bootleg Stout;Margaret River, Australia;Stout;Bootleg Brewery;Tap- Brissy Beer Festival .Pretty nice. Nicely rich and chocolatey, but of course never over the top, which would be very un-Australian. Nice roasted bitterness on the finish, not too much wrong with it, a pretty enjoyable stout. Surprsingly quite nice.
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Mega caramel and nutty aroma. Flavor has a surprising hop flavor that gets washed away by caramel malt. Not too bad.
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;On draught at the brewpub. Arrived at the table a lightly hazed reddish brown with a thin-moderate off-white head that lasted through the first two sips and left light lace. Pleasant aroma of malt and not much else. The flavor is malt followed by some mild hops bitterness. Light-medium bodied. Straightforward beer, no problems.
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;This was tasted at the brewery ion Charleston. It had soured and was not very good. Deep amber color, no lacing but a vinegar like tatse.
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft at brewer. A deep ruby red pour with a thin off white head. Scent of brown sugar and citrus. Taste is sweet with citrus notes.
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Not exactly what I had expected, but still a decent ale with good malt flavor.
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Red-amber in color. Medium aromas of liqueur like a cheap cherry brandy. Palate confirms. Medium-bodied with a weird saccharin sweetness/candied palate and a medium finish.
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;No head and only a couple spots of lace. The beer has a cherry color and is nearly clear. The nose and taste tips to the malt side--some nuttiness nearly no hop (except in the swallow and aftertaste, but even there, it is muted.) The body is spot on with a below average carbonation, which makes it seem very smooth. Overall, an easy beer to quaff, but it won�t bring home any medals.
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Tasted at the Southend Brewery & Smokehouse - another disappointing beer. This one was the best of the bunch though. They still call it the Scarlet Ale at the Brewery. Poured a reddish color with little head. Faint aroma of caramel, malt with a taste of mild hops, malt and molasses?
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Good clear red amber color, sweet malt nose and slight hop aroma. very smooth with plantey of malt flavor and a slight bitterness from hops and may be from the dark malt. Good clean finish
Southend Riverside Red Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Utterly disappointed with every beer this place had. Got on tap on a sampler paddle. No nose, no taste, looked nice. Maybe it�s better poured in the eyes than the mouth.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;A step up from the Brown Ale, but still a watery, thin stout. The malts never show much roasted flavor or stout goodness, just a slight chocolate sweetness that joins a smooth but bland finish. Not bad, just underachieving. (9/08)
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft at brewer. Dark black with a thin tan head. Scent is coffee bomb. Taste is bitter black coffee with a hint of chocolate. Very fizzy and thin feel not to my liking.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;The best of the 5 beers I was able to try here. A roasted chocolate and coffee taste with medium bitterness.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Black-brown with very sticky lacing. Toasted chestnut and smoke on nose. Great mouth feel--full flavored without being too full-bodied and filling. Oatmeal and toasted nuts on palate with solid, malty finish.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;On tap at Southend Brewpub in Charleston S.C. Dark brown in color with a thin beige head. Aroma has the usual malts and some chocolate. The flavor contains some chocolate and a slight burnt coffee taste. The oatmeal is in there too somewhere. Nothing spectacular but still pretty good.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Tasted at Southend Brewery & Smokehouse in Charleston SC. This brew poured a dark brown with a very thin head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted coffee and some malt. Taste was what you would expect following the smell. Pretty thin mouthfeel though - kind of watery.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;A dark brown, almost black pour. Holding tan head. Roasted malt flavor. Smooth mouthfeel. A little sweet. Woody fruit taste. Heavy malt aftertaste.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;This is actually milder than the Chocolate Porter, but that�s a good thing. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, which supports the moderate roasts in the flavor nicely. Drinkable stout.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft @ Southend: Dark black pour with a creamy, sticky head that sticks to the glass all the way down. Nice creamy body, and average roastiness with a moderate mouthfeel. Hints of roasted coffee, and finishes dry thanks to the added oats. Decent.
Southend ORyans Oatmeal Stout;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;On tap at the Southend Brewery. Arrived at the table black with a thin, creamy head that lasted until mid-glass and left a coating of foam with each sip. Mild aroma of roasted malt. The flavor is roasted malt, unsweetened chocolate, and a bit of cardboard. Lingering mild bitterness at the finish. A bit lightbodied.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;Pours a nice medium amber. Aromas of malt/pepper/smoke. Flavor is bitter smoke/roast malt with a nice peppery bite finish and aftertaste.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;One of the most distinctive beers I�ve had. Loved it. Had it right at the brew-pub in West Yellowstone on a snowboarding trip. Goes down smooth and leaves you a smoky after taste to enjoy. Great session beer. Cheers!
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;On tap at the 2007 GABF: Pours a transparent copper amber with a nicely-lacing light tan head. Good, rich, smoky nose has some toasted pale maltiness and peaty complexity. Body starts with good viscosity and sweet caramel malt with big smoky balance. Very true to style and well-made.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;On draught at the brewery tap room. Marked 6.0%, pours a dense dark brown with a lasting lace and early smokey aroma. A creamy mouthfeel with a medium body and subtle smokey character. An even dry/sweet malty flavor balance with a late dark malt emphasis and dry finish.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;@Mountain Beerfest-on tap-pours a disappearing white head with bubbles and dark copper color. Aroma is mild smoky, medium/dark malt-caramel. Taste is wood/smoky, medium/dark malt-caramel. Occasional. OK/mild carbonation.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;Not rated under optimum circumstances (a three-day-old growler) but I liked it so much I felt compelled to sing its praises. Light reddish-brown in color, with a pale cream-colored head. The aroma was of sweetly smokey malts (mesquite, maybe?) and pleasantly subdued. The flavor revealed a bit more of the wood smoke and sweet malts. Medium- bodied. Nicely balanced, not overdone.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;Straight copper pour covered by irregular off-white head. Sweet nutty malts accompany a bold meatiness making up a both impressive and aggressive nose, certainly on the salty side of the spectrum. In mouth, the cereal sweetness is totally in place, opening the gate for more bloody, boney mealish flavours over which you can only hear the whisper of supporting leafy hops. All that at 5%, gotta love smoked beers.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;Dull amber colour. Light but clean smoke aroma. Beautiful toasty, caramel malts with a smooth but firm smokiness overlapping. Excellent balance. Finishes slightly sweet. A seamless, stylish example.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;Clear amber with a light head. Lightly smokey, hoppy and fruity. The flavor brings out more smoke, but it is mostly fruity and bitter. Not smokey enough for a rauchbier.
Wolf Pack Smokejumper Rauchbier;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;09.29.05 GABF Copper-brown, hazed. Checked this bad boy out only because I�d never had any Wolf Pack beers. Aroma is huge wood smoke and light cracker, some mineral is revealed, salt. Nice full body, sweet and malty but lighter malts, toasty cracker. The smoke is sweet like wood-smoked meats. Surprising alcohol presence is how I�d imagine a Heller Trum beer stripped of its yeastiness. But if it�s not yeasty, where is this spice coming from...fennel jerk rub. Another reason to move back to Bozeman. Looking at the older ratings, this must have been a great batch.
Robinsons Brown Ale;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Brown Ale;Robinsons Family Brewery;275ml bottle from Shropshire. Vintage 1994. Bottle opened with a hiss and poured with a small head and very dark brown/red appearance - almost black. Aroma of cardboard, dried dog poo and stale chocolate. Slight carbonation in the body. Clean tasting with dark chocolate notes, caramel, faint cardboard. Very pleasant and easy drinking. The slight carbonation makes this tastes quite fresh, and the flavours are very attractive, with the chocolate dominating. Faint sweetness. A very nice beer.
Klosterbr�u Ebelsbach Kloster-Hell;Zeil am Main, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei G�ller;Little skunky and light hop perfume aroma. Little hazy, yellow color, nice head, good lace. Light, starts light hoppy, perfume but soon all flavors gone. Bit watery and a little dry finish.
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;served top cold but has a weird extract like finish. It's appropriately malty, but that strange undercurrent that hangs around on finish kinda ruins things.
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Thanks altonbrownd for the bottle! Poured into a snifter showing dark caramel brown and sparse foam. Well filtered. The nose is very sweetish-malt forward with hints of tea and biscuits. The palate is light bodied and moderately carbonated. Flavors of straight bready malts with a very light sweetness. No bitterness on the finish. Light zestiness
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Light malt/bready aroma. Minimal head orange/copper color. Medium malt flavor with a pervading sweetness. Hops are present throughout and are well balanced against the malt. Medium body and texture with light carbonation. Fairly clean finish.
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Bottle from Chevy Chase Wine and Liquors. Toffee brown body with thin, white head. Nose is sweet, marshmellows, malts. Taste is butterscotch, and hops and fruit notes. Sweet in the finish. Not my favorite.
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Aromas of clay, toast, cocoa. Clear, deep orange-red, the head is off-white, small but mostly lasting. Malty, grapey, some milk chocolate, light earthy hops, very nicely balanced. Medium bodied, very clean, very smooth.
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Bottle. Smells of toasted bread and caramel malts. Taste is nutty caramel. Toast. Nice. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Bottle - Real nice amber brown color. Malty flavor but no sweetness to it. No real hops bit either but not uncommon for this style of beer.
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Very dark amber copper pour with small faint ring of clearish head. Not as agressively hopped as the bluemountain, and not as vegetal either. Sweet caramel malty nose and flavor. Hint of marshmallows and candicorns in the background. Toffee. Ever so slight noble hop bitterness on the finish. Pretty decent american attempt at the style.
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Appearance: The body has a deep copper color with a light haze. It�s head is creamy long lasting and makes some nice lacing on the glass. Smell: The aroma has a sweet toasted bread character with some dried leafy hops. Taste / Palate: It has a mild malty sweetness with a dark bready character through out. I also get some mild cooed vegetable notes in the background. The finish has very mild hop bitterness and dry leafy flavor notes. The carbonation and palate smooth and creamy.
Legend Oktoberfest Amber Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Legend Brewing Company;Bottled. Pours a nice transparent brown, off white head. Caramel malts Some mild hops to finish. A pretty decent marzen, tilted more to the dark side.
Mishawaka Oktoberfest;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Alright, fairly normal - similar to the Sam Adams version. There isn�t much to say about this one, typical dark amber colour, strong malts, subtley hopped.. good seasonal.
Mishawaka Oktoberfest;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Mishawaka Brewing Company;2005 version and major change over the past: Coppery hue with a small fading head and some lace. The aroma has notes of caramel and toasty malts, hints of plum and apple, honey, and a bit of grassy hops. The taste is surprisingly fruitier than expected, lots of caramel apple at the forefront. Grassy and earthy notes as well. Not really coming off as a tradtional marzen even has it is malty. The feel is quite average and a bit watery, the bump of ABV to 6% still does not show. An okay brew and I finished the growler with ease.
Mishawaka Oktoberfest;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Nose is all malt, caramel and slightly roasty. Surprisingly thin bodied. Malts are raosty but faint. Taste just sort of lingers. No evidence of the hops, really watery.
Mill City Octoberfest;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Mill City Brewing/Lowell Brewing;CLoudy amber color with no head. Sweet malty cloying aroma and taste. Way too sweet and old tasting.
Mill City Octoberfest;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Mill City Brewing/Lowell Brewing;On tap at the art of beer festival Stammtisch. Meidum brown color, small head. Malty/nut aroma. Somewhat light malty/nut taste, noticeable alcohol presence, finishes somewhat hoppy and bitter.
Phylosophe Auburn;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;�Autumn-like� beer formerly made by Phylosophale in Luingne. Cream white, coarse, stable head over a brownish amber beer, cloudy. Malty and yeasty aroma, walnuts, plums, orange, nutmeg, toasted bread, dried leaves, liquorice, bitter chocolate, cloves, straw. Malty taste, quiet palate, deep �nuttiness� and restrained, dried fruitiness, powdery mouthfeel, chocolatey malts and late, roasted and peppery hoppy bitterness. Different for an amber beer, quite enjoyable.
Phylosophe Auburn;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;Darker brown coloured with average carbonation and a short off-white head. Malty and fruity hinted aroma. Full light creamy palate. Finish is light bitter with a smouth fruity malty hinted ending. Medium.

Phylosophe Auburn;Luingne-Mouscron, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Phylosophale;Bottled. Purchased at Delirium Cafe. Amber body with a small tanned head. nose is flowery with spices and is filled with an underlying sweetened maltiness. Taste is grains, light spice, yeast and light hop charcter. Sort of a nice crispness to this. Body has some carbonated sharpness to it with a very lively notes on the tongue. Some spicy tingling to it as well. Finish is unripened fruit, more grains, and a nice kick at the end.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;I believe this must have been retired by now? Anyway, as of 2005, was acceptable, but over-metallic and acidic. A good strong beer for those who woul like to feel the effects, though. Drinkable in quantity.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Keg Handpump at the Boot Inn, Chester 17/04/2004 Clear golden coloured and hoppy with some sour fruit flavour. Dry lasting finish.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;The best darn lager in the world - sadly being phased out by Sam Smiths. 5 pints of it has the effect of 8 pints of Stella, with an acid tab dropped in the first pint. Have loved it for approximately 12 years. Amazing birthday drink. Will be missed.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Draught at Earl of Lonsdale, London. Golden coloured. A rather good fresh and fruity pilsener.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Light dusty lager nose, straw color, low tight head. Clean crisp malt with a hint of citrus. Round corners. An average German-style pils that holds its own. Still, nothing special here.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Decent enough pale gold colour and relatively strong for a British brewed lager, but that�s where the complements end. There�s a hint of malt in the aroma but, otherwise it all comes over as artificial, chemical and metallic. Dull mouthfeel. Drinkable, but not good. Not the worst I�ve had either. Keg at the Brewery Tap (the old Courage brewery tap, now run by Sam Smiths), Southwark.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Metallic aroma. Gold with white head. Bland sweet flavour. Thin bodied. Blergh.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;"Keg at the ""World�s Funniest Pub"", The Anchor Tap, Tower Bridge, London.. Odd attempt at a lager, not at all authentic. Flat & barely malty. Sampled on the Ratebeer London Meetup & Pub Crawl, December 2004. With Silktork, Chris_o, & Kook."
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;A pale lager with little carbonation. The taste is sweet and the smell is off-putting after a while. Not a pleasant experience even on a hot day and in need of a cold drink.
Ayingerbrau D. Pils Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Had this in London a very long while ago. Really pale yellow in appearance, sweet malty, with little else to it. Not really German in flavour, but then again, it is brewed in England.
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Like the D. Pils, but sharper and less alcoholic. Slightly lower in quality but still better than the big-brewery lagers of this world. Retired I think?
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;A Mes rate: If I hadn�t had this purchased for me and therefore not wanting to appear ungrateful, it would have remained unfinished. No different to all the other pale Ayingers I have tried. A cheap option next to Stella for the city gents who don�t know any better.
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;A little bit stronger than the normal lager beer, but it has a fruit aroma and a sweet flavor too, althought lower.
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;The next substandard Sam Smiths product on the concluding leg of the RB London Christmas pub crawl. A Germanic name does not make a good lager, and this is certainly not a good lager. As the ABV is not given on the pump, it�s not clear how this differs in strength from the Ayingerbrau D Pils Strong Lager, but it�s marginally worse. Malty aroma, with a nasty sulphuric edge. Dry, malty flavour devoid of interest. Pretty poor. Keg at the Brewery Tap (that is, the old Courage Brewery tap, not Sam Smiths brewery tap).
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Gold with a white lasting head. No aroma. Sweet bland flavour. Slightly metallic. Crap.
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;"Keg at the ""World�s Funniest Pub"", The Anchor Tap, Tower Bridge, London.. Much like the other Sam Smiths � German Style� beers, poor quality lager. Like the others it benefits from being rather bland, because what little flavour there is is unpleasent, some sharpness. Sampled on the Ratebeer London Meetup & Pub Crawl, December 2004. With Silktork, Chris_o, & Kook."
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;[Draught] Golden coloured. A nice brew with some hops and apples in the aroma. Hoppy flavour with a bitter finish. A rather well crafted lager.
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Draught at the Cittie of York, London. Golden yellow with thin head. Light hop flavor and even less malt. Not very good beer.
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Draught, at the Cittie of Yorke, London. Golden body with a light, very thin head. Apple aroma (SilkTork) with decent dryness and bitterness. With imagination it reminds me of Asahi Super Dry, just not as clear or crisp.
Ayingerbrau Prinz Strong Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Thin, sweet and totally fogettable, some apples in there, with a shot of alcohol at the end, crappy stuff.
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Keg @ Duke of Argyll, Soho in mid-2000�s. Sweet tasting lager that is deceptively strong, although has a giveaway sign of a strong body.
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Keg Handpump at the Boot Inn, Chester 17/04/2004 Golden coloured and crisp with some sour fruit flavour. Slightly dry lasting malt hop finish.
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;On tap at The Champion, London Xmas Pub Crawl. Pale gold with thin white head. No aroma to speak of, dead malts in the mouth and a bit of zing on the end. Instantly forgettable
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Sour, dirty sock nose, yellowy gold with a persistant head. Sharp and citrussy flavour ending with a flowery hoppiness that ultimately turns swet. Not too bad.
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;Really lager, but it has a nice fruit flavor at the back, it�s a little thick, and sweet.
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;"As we continue to plumb the depths of the Sam Smiths lager portfolio at the end of the RB London Christmas pub crawl, we move on to the ""standard"" Ayingerbrau. Much like any other mass produced UK keg lager really, but it does have more alcohol than the likes of Carling. There is virtually no aroma whatsoever which, in this context, is an improvement on the other Sam Smiths lagers. There�s even a touch of grassy hop in the flavour, but that�s soon enveloped by a metallic tang, which persists long after the swallow. Poor, thin, stuff. Keg at the Brewery Tap (that is, the old Courage Brewery tap, not Sam Smiths brewery tap)."
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;MCG with white head. Sweet bland though slightly malty flavour. Medium bitter. Medium-thin in body. Crap but drinkable lager.
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;"Keg at the ""World�s Funniest Pub"", The Anchor Tap, Tower Bridge, London.. This one made my laugh, it�s so malty and pissy. It�s best feature is that it�s bland, most of the other Sam Smiths beers are really unpleasent. Sampled on the Ratebeer London Meetup & Pub Crawl, December 2004. With Silktork, Chris_o, & Kook."
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;A difficult one to rate, this. I find it tastes lemony and slightly soapy - but dont let that put you off! It is a nice, full mouthfull of a lager that slides down easily. Unlike the majority of high volume lagers, it has no harsh aftertaste and does not appear to contain half a childs chemistry kit. i would recommend this if you see it on draught and want a good, solid pint to drink! Avoid the more expensive and stronger ABV Prinz though - it really is very wrong.
Ayingerbrau Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Samuel Smith;On tap at Cittie of Yorke, Holborn, London. Standard lager colour, with no aroma. Warm, fruity taste, with some honey. No change or development in the mouth whilst drinking. Also no aftertaste. It's alright I suppose.

Klein Duimpje Hilleghemse Dubbel;Hillegom, Netherlands;Dubbel;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;Bottle 0,33 at Klein Duimpje, Hillegom: Dark brown colored brew with nicely dry bitter taste with hints of roasted malts and some caramel.
Klein Duimpje Hilleghemse Dubbel;Hillegom, Netherlands;Dubbel;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;Average one with some yeast and hoppy moments. Maybe a bit vanilla and a bit too much carbo. Drinkable, classic piwo.
Klein Duimpje Hilleghemse Dubbel;Hillegom, Netherlands;Dubbel;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;Pours out of the bottle (thanks to Douberd!) in a deep brown colour with low head and medium body. Aroma of Belgian yeast and straw. Taste of hops, malt, Belgian yeast, caramel, torf and brown sugar. Easy drinkable but just nothing that special. Solid and good beer nevertheless.
Klein Duimpje Hilleghemse Dubbel;Hillegom, Netherlands;Dubbel;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;330 ml FUCKING GUSHER of a bottle, into a tulip glass. ABV 7,5%. Nice red brown colour on the body,hazy,with a tall beige head, froathy unfortunately with low retention and no lacing on the glass. Aroma of dark fruits, caramel, ripe pears. Taste is sweet with lots of dark fruits, caramel, light spices� notes, banana. Alcohol notable, nutty finish and a mild bitterness on the aftertaste. Medium thin body low carbonation, probably because it used it all to create a fountain while I was opening it. A very good dubbel, but until they learn to make beers that don�t gush, the overall score will reflect that.

Klein Duimpje Hilleghemse Dubbel;Hillegom, Netherlands;Dubbel;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;Interesting in that it is a very nice beer, but that the taste is probably the least interesting thing about.

Aroma is nice ... Rich toffee malt, sugar covered dates, and light pine hops. Flavor took me by surprise, very smooth. Pine hops do well to balance out the sweet dark fruits and caramel/toffee malts.

Michigan Brewing Sebewaing Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Cream Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Yellow color that holds a thin sheen as a head. Aroma is sweet malted grain with just a hint of corn. Taste is malt juice and although not sickeningly sweet, too sweet for my palate. The thickness almost immediately washes away the carbonation that�s trying to sneak through. The flavors here aren�t very good though.

Michigan Brewing Sebewaing Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Cream Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;"Draft, at the brewery taproom. MBC brewed this special edition re-creation of the Sebewaing brand (1880-1965) for Sebewaing Township's 150th anniversary. Bartender told me this was an ale, but perhaps more of a lager-like ""cream ale"" like Genesee, which probably was the style in those days. Taste is crisp and light like a lager, but without lager yeast bite. This was available in ""historic label"" cans, especially their flagship pheasant label at Sebewaing stores this past summer, so I'm surprised no one has found it and rated it here. I also found Sebewaing has its own ""Old Style."" Wonder what the story was with that one."

Grunn Oerpilsner Goudhaantje;Groningen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Groningse Bierbrouwerij;Bottle 300 ml, through a trade with ShivanDragon, thanks! Into a footed pilsner glass,ABV 5% Golden yellow colour on the body, with a tall and very thick soapy head sitting on top and sitting there for quite long too! Lots of activity in the glass, countless little bubbles finding their way to the top. Heavy lacing left on the glass after the foam finally collapsed (but then, not entirely). Aroma of malts, with some hay in it. Pretty standard. Taste is of stale bread, hay and a metallic flavour that during the first sips seems to overpower everything but after a while it retreats. Thin body, good carbonation, maybe a little bit low but seems suitable. An okay pilsener with a rather impressive appearance to amke up for its small flaws.

Broad Ripple Oktoberfest;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;"Draft to pint at the brewpub. This year�s batch is 5.5% and 24 IBUs. Looks good for the style; a fairly transparent amberish brown with off-white head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells Of a nice balance of malt and lager yeast with some caramel woven in. Tastes like it smells with a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Maybe they tweaked the recipe, because it�s a good example of the style IMO (and it hasn�t been made since 2011)."
Broad Ripple Oktoberfest;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;Deal sealer: too light for an Octoberfest. Cloudy medium amber, persistent head, no lacing. Barely enough caramel malt and pumpkin spices, with a short but distinct hop finish.

Broad Ripple Oktoberfest;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;Sample draft at the brewpub. Pours a golden caramel color served with little head. The nose is straight bready malt and little more. Light, thin and soft with a clean finish. The flavor is of bready malt with a light, sweet, caramel backing and a dryish, rough finish. Starts off well enough but finishes a bit rough.
Broad Ripple Oktoberfest;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;This draft brew from a festival poured a small sized head of foamy fine to medium sized off-white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent uncarbonated light orange brown colored body and a very good lacing. The mild aroma was malty and sweet. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a biting hoppy aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of malt mild hops and sweet. A decent one that I would consider buying again.

Wieninger Guidobald Dunkel;Teisendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Privatbrauerei MC Wieninger;"500 ml bottle bought at Great Food Hall in Pacific Place, Admiralty. Clear deep copper brown colour; One and a half finger head and crumpet ylight beige foam which last for about 2 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing and fizzy carbonation; Sweet aroma of dark malt, with light roastyness, rich cream, milk powder, strong sticky toffee, sweet caramel, sugar, coffee, light mustiness, light lemon and grass; Mid to light sweet taste of dark malt, with fairly strong rostyness, nuts, fairly strong caramel, strong molasses notes, light musty, very light coffee, lemon, moderate bitter hops and grass; Close to medium body, quite slick and thick palate; Mouth feel is finely roasted and quite rich dark malt, with lots of cashew-like nutty taste. Strong caramel and surprisingly low sweet unlike most Dunkels. Very little cream unlike the nose. Quite crisp without much biscuit taste. Good!... Hoppiness is light lemon and grass I nose and taste. Bitterness is moderate to low for an abrupt, grassy fairly low bitter finish; Fairly dry after taste. Easy and slightly bitter to mouth. Comments: Its aroma is deceivingly creamy sweet and nice, and the taste, while it�s less sweet and less musty, is still pretty much a blue-collar Dunkel without being very standout. Solid all-round I have to say, and I wish they can build up a creamier and perhaps slightly hoppier palate to match the nose and looks. Still very enjoyable for my evening."

Sweet and slightly savoury aroma of fresh brownies and roasted almonds, some tree bark and honey pops. Really shines in taste: rustic bread crust with delicious milk chocolate (artisanal Nutella), cream and cocoa powder, coffee powder spice. Great balance and clear expression of clear, rustic flavours rarely to be had this side of bottom-fermented traditions, or any bottled Dunkel. If more regional Dunkels were like this and made more widely available, imported porter/stouts (recipes) would be given more of a run for their money. // Rerate full 50cl bottle bb11/2015, Maruhn as ""Guidobald Export Dunkel"" this time - Export how? Truly excellent, full and fruity chocolate and chestnut flavours abound in this unpasteurised piece of modest splendour."

Holgate Brewhouse Summer Wheat;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Wheat Ale;Holgate Brewhouse;I just couldn't find the detergent in this one. rather i think that the carbonation comes from the inclusion of a small cake of diswasher tablets. Soapy citrus and a poor fizzy flaccidness. More colgate than holgate.

God looking Oktoberfest brown, medium white head. Clean, malty smell. Taste is malty and caramelly, but there�s an initial impression of saccharine. Then some German hop bitterness becomes known.

Mighty Oak Goods Shed Stout;Maldon, Essex, England;Stout;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Jet black with a think dark brown scum for a head. Dense aroma that makes its presence felt in the room. Rich and opulent flavour, like nothing has been spared in creating this beer. Its balanced, dense and in no doubt that it�s a stout. Medium to long palate that is outerly delicious. Fresh on this morning (it wasn�t on last night) its drinking a treat.
Town Hall Chocolate Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark creamy brown pour with no head. On tap at Town Hall. Aroma is sweet milk chocolate and lactose. Flavor is much the same with the lactose coming through a bit more. Reminds me of chocolate milk from elementary school lunch. Has a slight bitter cocoa finish to it. This really was a chocolate bomb.
Town Hall Chocolate Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Latest in the single-hop series, second after the Columbus, which was more of an IPA than a regular pale. No caramel malts were used in this, to keep the color light golden and let the hops shine through, and doing so prove that a light-colored beer can be full-flavored. True, the mates at the bar all marvelled how much it's appearance could be mistaken for a pint of Miller, but not when you taste it, oh, no! Appearance: as already mentioned, perfectly clear, bright golden, sparkling yellow, with a nice, white head above. Aroma: hop-hop-hoppy, with pine, citrus, peach, apricot, and more bursting forth, fruit forward, as they say in wine-land. Very appealing and inviting, sweet and tasty. So, taste! Hops dance and sing on the palate, neatly buzzing the tastebuds, then softly fading, until the next sip, which isn't taking it's time in coming around..this is lovely stuff, and it likes being in the mouth! Light in body, with a long, fruity finish, good hoppy texture, very easily consumed, with a persistent, zingy, hoppy flavor. And there's just enough malt, too, where there's no worry of this pleasant creature turning into a hop monster. Quite high on the drinkability factor! Another top notch effort from Town Hall!
Town Hall Chocolate Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Color is a deep dark browny black with a light tannish head about a finger high that fades slowly to a skim always present and good stringy lace. Smell has a light chocolate milk aroma with some mild roasted malts and milder coffee notes. Taste is quite nice, essensially smooth, lightly creamy, starts very milding and soothing, some lighter chocolate and cocoa tones float around in front and builds slowly to a nice chocolatey drying coffeeish finish with a bit of crispness and a touch of drying hops. Swell finish that builds and lingers. Feel is pretty soild medium creamyness and dotted in texture with a nice drying finish lending milk chocolate overlays and slight coffee beans. A very drinkable and easy goin' porter. Quite respectable and quaffable.
Town Hall Chocolate Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Aroma of malt and coffee. Black. Flavors of bitter chocolate, tobacco, and fruit. Rich and heavy.
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Beautiful floral aroma, ah the Cascades--so typical, but so classic. Quite a load of malts, too, and the net effect dampens the bitter edge that might have appeared to its misfortune. I wouldn�t say vegetal, but steak perhaps? Crazy...there�s something escaping my recognition here. Clear amber, swirls a head up nicely. Overall, drinkable and smooth. (on tap at brewpub)
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Clear sparkling amber, creamy white head. Nose was real nice with grapefruit and orange zest leading the charge, but with warming came additional pine and nutty caramel tones. A bitter hop assault flavor ensues and basically follows through to the end. Somewhat one dimensional, but damn tasty and refreshing none the less. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, bitter hop juice finish. Bills M does hops right. Too bad he�s outta there now...
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;a very sweet apa. Stil had all the expected APA characteristics. I liked this beer enough that i got a pint after I finished the sampler.
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;An excellent example of what an APA should be. Nice aroma and taste from a blend of flowery and almost sweet hops. Somewhat complex.
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Draft... Hazy, orange ale with a small, fizzy, white head and weeping lacework. The nose is of citrus fruit and perfume. The flavor is wonderfully bitter and citrusy with a hint of toffee. Full-bodied and creamy with medium carbonation. Lengthy, numbingly bitter finish. Nice.
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;This beers taste did not match the aroma. I found little aroma present and a quite bitter flavor. Odd given the fact that typically, it seems, an overhopped beer has a very strong aroma.
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Fine aroma, but the flavor lets one down. A bit too much hops for bitterness, which drown out a lot of the flavor components.
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;I thought this was a pretty good rendition of an APA. Ginger colour, with lots of hops in the aroma and flavour. Clean and fresh flavour, with citric hop to the fore, soft fruit and a touch of bitterness. However, it�s by no means sharp and the mouthfeel is smooth. Easy drinking and, although it�s not the most complex of beers, it�s a solid and pleasant brew. On tap at the Founders, Alexandria.
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Draft at Founders in Alexandria before the DC/MD/VA/WV/PA gathering. rusty orange body with a small tan head. Nose is wet hops, light bitterness and a mild malt aroma. Taste is light fruitiness blended with a mild hop bitterness. Light orange notes along with light malt as well. Body is medium with light bitterness to it. Finishes with more bitter notes and fruity but adds a little more of the malt.
Founders Harpers American Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;"GABF 2004 and later at the brewpub. ""Founders Captain Harper�s American Pale Ale."" Tight, uniform, fading white head and copper body. Dark for an APA. Moderate diacetyl plus some blending caramel notes and fresh peachy and woody hops. Also has a distinct and interesting note suggesting strawberries. Diacetyl is evident in the flavor, but not overpowering. Woody hop flavor with medium bitterness. A solid, balanced pale ale."

Medium to Full-bodied; Strong pungent flavour with alcohol warmth the strongest and showing quite a bit of malt, a lot of brown sugars, some light hops, all finishing with a good pit fruit flavour that is deep but perhaps a bit too bitter. Overall, a nice doppelbock that is loaded with alcohol, but when drunk slowly, makes for a nice warming beer with some good flavours. I sampled this pint (snifter) on draught at the brewpub in Washington on 23-December-2013."
District ChopHouse The Senator Doppelbock;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);"On tap at The Brickskeller on December 9, 2010. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head and a slightly-lopsided collar. The nose rings some sweet chocolate and slight roast. A bit of booze, but nothing overwhelming. Mild notes of slightly-sweet malt in there as well. The taste is a whole different story, as while there are some notes of caramel and chocolate, the overwhelming presence is alcohol. Fusel alcohol, to be specific. Something went quite wrong with this one, as when you move away from the alcohol in the taste and into the finish, not only is there a burn but also a cit of astringent penny-like character. Finishes very dry. To quote another, ""this beer tastes like wet dog and pennies."" Really not a good offering and I couldn�t finish mine. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 12-10-2010"

District ChopHouse The Senator Doppelbock;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);Watery brown color with a small rim of bubbles and no lacing. Faint aroma of caramel, but not much else. Flavor starts a bit sweet, with milk chocolate, then progresses to a subtle dark cocoa, then to a bitter almond finish. A bit lighter than I would expect from a doppelbock. Has decent complexity, interesting enough to give it a try, but nothing o write home about.
District ChopHouse The Senator Doppelbock;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);On tap at the District Chophouse. Pours a lightly murky brown with a thin beige head. Roast, chocolate malt, and almost a bit of lambic funk, but I�m not sure where that�s coming from, as it�s not backed up in the flavor, and is quite out of place. Roast, dark fruit, little bit of dark chocolate. Large plum and warming alcohol on the finish. Really boozy. Listed on tap at 10%, so I�m not sure if this is a new version or not.

Barley Creek Harvest Moon Oktoberfest;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;I think I actually used to like barley creek a long time ago when they used big bombers to bottle their beers. This o-fest was pretty weak overall. Pours a light amber with a thin white head. Aroma is DMS which is not what I would want or at least expect in an ofest. Hardly any toasted or caramel malts, just light artificial sweetness and a bit of steemed vegetables and hard metallicy grain. Flavor is pretty bland overall, and I dont think warming it up would have helped. Metallicy bitter finish- pretty bad.

Flavor is chalky and muddy but laced with so much diacetyl... my god! I couldn�t finish even a 6oz glass. I�d like to try this one again on tap.

Aroma is deep sharp caramel malts and toffee with some brown sugar- light herbal hops. Flavor is also deep stewed caramel malts, perhaps lots of dark munich malts, but that rich bready toastiness doesnt come out like Ramstein or Triumph. Ok mouthfeela dn smooth finish. This was right about on par with SA o-fest. Average.

Rohrbach Sam Patch Porter;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Sort of a stout light - seemingly contradictory - but I enjoyed it. Nice chocolate scent and roasted taste. Watery mouthfeel makes it more session friendly than other porters.
Rohrbach Sam Patch Porter;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Deep clear brown with a thin off-white head. Barely any aroma. Light chocolate and malt in mouth, more like a schwarzbier. where is the roastiness announced? They also has a cask version, which was much darker and opaque, but still lacking in aroma.

Max Hefe Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Max Lager's;Best beer of the night. Which means I didn�t have to chew my own vomit to finish it. It actually wasn�t as bad as I�m amiking it sound. It was below average at best. Look like a hefe should, dont they all? The flavor was certainly bland, but had a lot of bananas and a fiar amount of vanilla. Mouthfeel was a bit creamy.
Max Hefe Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Max Lager's;Draught. Golden color, hazy, nice white head. Very yeasty in aroma, bananas. Flavor is similar with some clove. Typical hefe, with something bitter in aftertaste.
Max Hefe Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Max Lager's;On tap at the brewpub. This one has 4.5% abv according to the bartender. very yeasty. good lace on side of glass. pale daisy hazy yellow. very much scent of banana and clove. I felt the banana and clove flavors were overpowering because they were not backed with a good palate and body. if the other two parts had been there, it could have handled the strong (overpowering in this case) flavor.
Max Hefe Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Max Lager's;Draft, hazy yellow. Light fruity and estery aroma, with some wheat malt notes. Similar flavors, although it may have been just a touch to clovy in balance. Decent enough hefe imo.
Max Hefe Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Max Lager's;Hazy lemon body with a clean soapy white head. Floral, rose petal esters in the nose plus some wheat and light citrus notes. Fresh wheaty flavor with light nuttiness and a touch of banana and lemon. Smooth, medium body. Decent hefeweizen with no off notes or flaccid qualities like many wheat beers.
Max Hefe Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Max Lager's;well, its a hefe, is there really much more i can say, it doesn tstand out from any other american made hefe, maybe a little flatter and lighter, blah.

Max Hefe Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Max Lager's;Tap, downtown Atlanta. Hazy peach-yellow hue / white, creamy head. Banana baby food, spicey hops...wtf? Brown sugar? Okay? Anyway. Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter finish. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: nice, but heavy on the bananas at the sacrafice of pretty much everything else.

Max Pumpkin Dunkel Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Max Lager's;On draught at Max Lager�s on P-Tree. Slightly hazy and dark orange in colour. About two fingers worth of crown with an aroma rich in nutmeg, cloves, and a hint of cinnamon. Medium body, verging towards the lighter side. Extremely sweet, much like drinking sugar water enhanced with herbs. A little spicy like black pepper and a light experience of pumpkin. Other spice notes are greater in the aroma than in the palate. Too sweet for me.
Max Pumpkin Dunkel Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Max Lager's;A light, somewhat non-descript aroma, though it suggested brown sugar at times. Cloudy, tea orange-brown. A very unusual flavor - vegetable, perhaps black pepper, perhaps cactus, faint twinges of lemon or something. Medium tangy, not very sweet. Medium light body. Pointless and craftless.
Max Pumpkin Dunkel Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Max Lager's;Slightly hazed orange body with virtually no head. Aroma is medium sweet, nutmeg, clove cinnamon, pumpkin. Taste is medium sweet, pumpkin, clove, nutmeg, finishing with hint of earthy/floral bitterness. Light/medium body.
Max Pumpkin Dunkel Weizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Max Lager's;This was about the same color as their Oktoberfest. Both were a medium dark stained-wood-like brown. The only difference was the the P.D.W. was lightly cloudy (cloudier than hazy, but not full-on opaque). The head was good but it could have been better. I had a full pint of this followed by a few sips off of my wife's sample glass and then the last third of her pint. The first time around I hardly noticed any pumpkin or spice at all. The last times I started picking up more spice and a little of the pumpkin. This is definitely a reserved pumpkin beer. I'd actually say it was a Dunkel Weizen first (it was nicely wheaty, with a good bit of clove as the main components of the flavor and aroma) with the pumpkin and spice just there as a subtle balanced addition to the beer. Very interesting and pretty tasty.

Brugs Beertje 20;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;[ZBF 2004] A dark orange beer with fine though collapsing off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of yeast. The flavor sweet malty too with alcohol running over the tongue and notes of yeast and flowers.
Brugs Beertje 20;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;"Amber colour, cold haze; white head, reduced to rim in seconds, good lace. Refreshing, tart nose, like with rosehips or sloeberry (NOT used!). Surprisingly light sweet-sour taste, undefinable fruity-flowery flavour. Slight diacetyl. Mouthfeel is light, and, well, fruity. Surprising - I had been expecting something with a lot more punch - exactly the opposite. Flowers for a 20-year old damsel (but not in distress)."
Taylor Velina Pale Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - English;Taylor Brewing Company;Weak rusty orange colour with a thin head. Weak, hoppy, citrusy nose with a kind of fruity hoppy taste. Good amount of carbonation in the palate.
Kemphaan Iterfestbok;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;Bottle, sold as Kemphaan Herfstbock. The ABV fits so this must me the right beer. Dark brown color, cloudy with a big frothy head. Only slight malty and roasty aroma. Thin. Flavor has roasted malt, some coffee and licorice. Dry mouthfeel, hoppy licorice aftertaste. Full of nice flavors but lacks balance.
Kemphaan Iterfestbok;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;One of the worst at PINT Bokbierfestival in Amsterdam. Sojasauce aroma.

Kemphaan Iterfestbok;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;PINT bokbier-festival 2003. Very watery, practically undetectable additional flavours. Dry finish. Not the best.
Kemphaan Iterfestbok;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;PINT-bokbier 2003: The Herfstbok from de Kemphaan was a definite drain pour. Taste is light malty, caramelly and hoppy, but this is more the product of a weak amateur.
Kemphaan Iterfestbok;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;On tap @ Gollem in Amsterdam - 9-27-2003 Deep copper red in color with a slight head that dissipates quickly. Medium to light body - some good malt flavors. Also mildly smoked in flavor - adds a nice touch. Dangerously quaffable.
Batemans Dark Lord (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Batemans;"02-Jun-13 (500-ml bottle: Purchased 27-Jan-11 for $4.79 from Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) Not quite the same as the ""other"" Dark Lord, but this is a nice beer in its own right. It's dark-brown in color with a deep ruby translucence when held to the light, and it pours half an inch of tan head that settles fairly quickly to a wide ring and patchy sheet. Aromas of cola, molasses, leather, and buttered toast lead to similar flavors of cooked meat, toast, cola, earth, smoky wood, leather, and molasses, with a touch of butteriness. The beer is lightly roasty, minimally bitter, and light-medium in sweetness, maintaining this balance into the finish. On the palate, the beer is medium in weight, reasonably dry in the finish, and medium in carbonation, though the large bubbles are a bit prickly on the tongue. Overall, this is a very pleasant beer to drink, easy to down, balanced."

Batemans Dark Lord (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Batemans;Bottle. Dark ruby colour. Malty (roasty and caramelly). Sour fruity (berries and citrus). Spicy peppery hops. Thin bodied. Unfortunately, an unremittingly bitter roast taste, which leads to a dry finish. Not for me. (2008)
Batemans Dark Lord (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Batemans;Bottle from Co-op in Sutton Bridge. Dark brown with a smidge of black purple. Very little off white head. Chocolate malt aroma with slight grassy hop. Sweet malty taste with bittering hop sneaking in for the finish. Chocolate fudge in the aftertaste. Nice full body. Simple but effective.

Anderson Valley Port Barrel Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Brown sugar, lactic acid, plum, the acidity strips all of the stout character, hint of chocolate
Anderson Valley Port Barrel Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Draft. Pours deep brown with a beige head. Big port barrel/vinous/dark fruity/woody notes, with lighter roasted malts and milk chocolate. A too much time in the barrel.
Anderson Valley Port Barrel Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;tap at Barcade: this beer really picked up the port barrel. rich vineous notes and oaky.

Anderson Valley Port Barrel Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;I do not know how THE LOCAl beer bar in Eureka, CA got some of this but I am glad they did. On draft, it came in the glass a black with a tan head. The nose is the aroma of campfire doused with water, with smoke, and some sour notes. Very full in body with a rich creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is potent, with port, burnt malts, and again that ash. The finish is sour and a great sour it is. If this really sat in a barrel for 7 years it was worth the wait. A very remarkable ale and one of the best barrel aged beers I have ever seen. I loved it.
Anderson Valley Port Barrel Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;On tap at Apex with mcberko, pours a solid black with a red tint and no head. Aroma of vanilla ice cream, port, oatmeal, dark fruits and candied sugar. Favour of lots of port and hints of sour fruits to start, followed by oatmeal and candied sugar, then turns lightly smokey and woody, but maintains the sweetness throughout. Unusually flavoured. Unsure if it works or not. Palate goes on an interesting journey.
Anderson Valley Port Barrel Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;"Draft at DBGB in NYC. The menu called it ""Anderson Valley Port Barrel Aged Oatmeal Stout"". A small, grayish-khaki swirly of foam sits atop a deep cola to mahogany brown body. There�s a nice dark cherry sheen to the edge. A light soapy wash completely rejoins the body below. The aroma shows loads of chocolate covered cherries and darkly toasted oats, burnt caramel, and dry cocoa. A soft, vinous, cherry-grape character is tannic and oaky, with a slightly tart twang to it. Smells nice. Flavors show more silky cocoa dusted cherries and soft malty roast, followed by that drying, vinous, cherry skin tannic finish. Oats are distinct, lending a creamy, slightly chalky taste and feel. The palate is medium bodied, silky, and lightly carbonated, with that aforementioned drying finish. Overall, a very solid and unique beer."
Anderson Valley Port Barrel Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;On tap at Apex in Portland, split with Matts_Property, pours a red-tinged black with minimal head. Aroma of port, sweet liqueurs and vanilla. Flavour brings out incredibly sour port barrels with a vinous quality. The sourness is not pleasing, hinting at something gone wrong. Barely drinkable.

The appearance is a medium amber hue with a micro whitish head. The aromas are light with sweet malts and light caramel. The flavors are the same with light malts, light kisses of hops. The mouth is a touch still but not as bad as the IPA and Pale Ale.
Big Bear Mountain Red Ant Hill Red Ale;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;A: The pour is amber in color with a thing off-white head. S: The nose is sweet caramel and oranges, both the flesh and the peel. There�s a slightly nutty aroma too which seems a bit out of place with the rest of the nose. T: There is a nutty flavor to this as well with a bit of toffee and toasted malt. Strangely, the oranges I picked up in the nose are missing, and instead there is a hint of coffee... M: The body is a bit on the thin side with a low carbonation that doesn�t do much to help the beer out. D: Nothing really special, I wouldn�t really be interested in having any more of this, but it�s wet.
Big Bear Mountain Red Ant Hill Red Ale;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Draft. Copper colored beer with a light cream colored head.

Big Bear Mountain Red Ant Hill Red Ale;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Aroma is mostly sweet caramel malts. A little toffee and a little bit of roast, but very faint. Pours red. No shit. Flavor is a nice sweet caramell/toffee malt flavor with a little bit of crisp hops. Definitley more sweet than hoppy. The finish is a little tinny though which detracts from the pleasant beginning.

Brandywine Oktoberfest;Greenville, Delaware, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brandywine Brewing Company;On tap. Poured copper color with no head. Sweet floral aroma. Tasted of spiced sweet malts. BBC beers were never brewed very consistently, so one batch would be good and another bad.
Brandywine Oktoberfest;Greenville, Delaware, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brandywine Brewing Company;A little beer with your spice? It looked good and it smelled good...but I don�t want everything that smells pretty in my beer. Maybe I just don�t like spiced beers, but this is way over the top. One of only 3 beers I�ve had in my life that I just couldn�t finish (and believe me, I tried). I can�t really describe the spices used (I�m not that good to distinguish), but there were a lot of them. On the upside, it cleared my sinuses right up. Just not my thing.

Great Western Premium Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Single can purchased from a mom&pop store in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on 06/01/2012. Colour: medium yellow, minimal white head. Nose: Strongly acidic malt and yeast...almost some urine. Taste: Medium sweet, light bitter, medium-light sour. A wine-like taste among the malt and yeast. Some late grains but really quite unenjoyable.

Great Western Premium Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);355ml can pours straw in color with a fast dissipating white head that leaves very little lacing behind.

Great Western Premium Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);341mL. Pours a clear yellow with no head formation. Nose is pretty absent. Taste is bland and watery, characterless, with cardboard and carbon paper. Pretty much void in all departments. Not recommended.
Great Western Premium Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Bottle. Pours amber-golden with an average white head. Aromas of barley, hops and malts. Taste is crisp, a combination of roasted barley and sweet malts, a subtle hop finish blends the sweet/bitter together to make a solid lager.
Great Western Premium Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Pours golden yellow, Foamy white head.Sweet malty aroma, Very crisp fresh flavour. Slight hoppy note. Not bad as pale lagergoes.
Great Western Premium Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);It smells nice enough, especially for a lager. Basic malt. Clear and yellow, same old. It tastes surprisingly crisp, a strong malt flavour and smooth enough finish. This is pretty good compared to the competitors, too bad I had to bring it back from Saskatchewan.
Great Western Premium Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);A Mes rate: can forced upon me by Tom at The Rake. Mid gold with a thin white head. Lots of tropical fruit in the aroma makes it pretty tolerable if it wasn�t for the corn and cereal. The flavour is similar but corn comes right to the front and the tropical fruit falls away to be replaced with diacetyl. I think you get the idea...
Great Western Premium Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Dumped into stolen glass. Just a bit lighter than the standard gold Canadain lager, this stuff still has lots of bubbs appearing but only leaves a skim around the edges. Crown was rocky, white, on the small size and didn�t last. You can see some stuff floating around the glass...that always annoys me. Smell is a little weak, but not bad. Sweet aromas dominate but grain and apples are there to be found. Taste is pleasant but remains more on the sweet side than a grainy side, slight lemon and a bit of hops too. Mouthfeel is what you would expect - a bit rough on the swish, tons of carbonation, fading grain tastes, malts and light bitterness share the aftertaste. Quite gassy if consumed at the rate this should be downed at - fast and in large quantities while doing something meaningless like slo-pitch or de-nutting cattle. Pretty much standard. Nice boring blue labels on the bottle make this a favorite for farmer�s kids to launch out of the windows of their dads tricked out 45 year old hog hauling rusted Fords. Bottles tend to migrate in the summer to ditches on Saskatchewan highways near community halls.

Lagarto;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);When you think you have a Cuban beer, it turn out to be a cheap Dutch brew. OK with the weather contributing to the score, it�s still doable. (Cuba 201701)
Lagarto;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);"330ml Can from El Fenix shop in Trinidad, Cuba (1 CUC): A very basic & quite a cheap lager on the whole, I can see why the Dutch ship this one straight to Cuba rather than palm it off on the local population. The beer was boring & unexciting, I struggled to detect much of anything at times other than some basic adjuncts & a cheap, almost metallic taste that was coupled with a background bitterness. There wasn�t too much that was terrible about it really, but then there wasn�t anything good either & it�s definitely not one I�d have again; if pushed I�d go for water over another of these."

Andrew's Summer Golden Ale;Lincolnville, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Andrew's Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking golden yellow color with streams of carbonation seen rising to fill a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. The lacing was light and sliding into the beer. The smell had a constrained sweet corn to sweet citrusy coated piney hops. As it warmed, a decent caramel sweetness came out. The taste was mildly sweet as a fairly nice balanced piney bitterness came out. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there - nice and safe as it rolled over my tongue in a slight spritzy sort of way. Overall, I almost want to say: was this an effort towards a hybrid of a blonde with an IPA? I liked it and would have it again.
Andrew's Summer Golden Ale;Lincolnville, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Andrew's Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: Generous honeyed cereals pleasantly lift leafy hops in this chewy and well-balanced Golden Ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the hazy dark golden. -The relaxed bubbling and well-rounded body make for a pleasant mouthfeel. -The finishing hop bitterness is also earthy. -The end result is clean and very drinkable, which was its main aim, I imagine. Bottle.
Andrew's Summer Golden Ale;Lincolnville, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Andrew's Brewing Company;12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a slightly hazy straw-yellow body with a very thin film of off-white head that doesn�t stay long. Smells malty sweet and fruity, reminiscent of honey with a slight grassy hops. Tastes malty biscuity sweet at first, with a fair bit of fruitiness and a strong leafy-grassy hop presence toward the finish. The hops seem to add a grassy astringency to the beer, to a small extent, hurting the drinkability slightly. Otherwise a flavorful drinkable blonde, among the best I�ve had of the style and probably my favorite offering from this brewery.

Andrew's Summer Golden Ale;Lincolnville, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Andrew's Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy bfeld.

Via Maria Harvest Moon Wheat;Holland, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Lightly hazy golden color. Very little light white head. Lightly fruity nose with a bit of yeast and light citric hops. Chocolate notes at the front, nice citrusy hops. A bit drying in the end but carries a little bitterness through.
Via Maria Harvest Moon Wheat;Holland, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Hazy chilled appearance. Had a strong glue-backed stamp rubber orange peel nose. No real wheat characteristics. Some bitterness and citric flavors, but middle of the road.
Sierra Blanca IPA;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Sierra Blanca Pale Ale is a clear, copper colored beer, with an active internal state. Topping it off is a medium sized cream colored head, which trails a nice amount of lacing as the beer descends.
Sierra Blanca IPA;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Draft at ABQ Brew Pub. Orange in the glass with an off-white head that settled to a ring and left good lacing. Subdue aromas of caramel and hints of pine. The flavor found grapefruit rind, caramel, and a slight hint of pepper. Medium body with a medium bitterness.

Mild Earthy aroma of EKG with just a little bit of piney grapefruit from cascades. Body is rather full for the style. Finnish is bitter with a big smack of diacetyl. A rather dirty tasting IPA. Nothing I�ll order again.
Sierra Blanca IPA;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;tap-pub 48/taproom-hmm, couldnt pinpoint much here other than a fairly malty/hoppy flavor-good balance, but the hops are not strong enough.
Sierra Blanca Buckwheat;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Yellow with a bit of haze and little head. Mild grain aroma. Clean, flowery flavor. Undercarbonated and watery but the flavor is not bad for the style.
Sierra Blanca Buckwheat;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;tap-brewpub-definately the most disapointing brew of the bunch-its filtered, so the apperance was bad-nice carbonation though!! flavor was bland and palate was thin(due to filtering) not good! apparently, the brewery just started not flitering this brew, so i will have to rerate that version
Sierra Blanca Imperial Stout;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. Just a little amber hue under this black beer. A lighter tan head leaves only a little lacing. Aroma and flavor are milk chocolate and roast. Beginning of the sip is the chocolate and the finish is roast. There is also a good bit of alcohol noted. The coffee sometimes is more like chicory. I also get plenty of earth and orange rind. Ron�s wife Melanie points out licorice. Towards the end of the pour it begins to taste like bourbon and the alcohol adds to that.
Sierra Blanca Imperial Stout;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Shared with Strykzone on Facebook Chat. Poured black with a tan head. Nose of milk chocolate and coffee. Full body. Smooth mouth feel. Alcohol tasted. Flavor is rich roasted malts with lots of chocolate. Finishes coffee bitter. Licorice appears. Quite good.

Sierra Blanca Imperial Stout;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;12oz bottle. 7.2% Imperial Stout huh. With the weak art on the label and my previous experiences with Sierra Blanca beer, I�m not expecting much. Chalky chocolate aroma, dry, unimpressive. Sugary, syrupy, malt extract type feel. Drinkable enough with the low ABV. Watery body, thin.
Sierra Blanca Imperial Stout;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Alien Stout - $3 single. Easily their best but worth what the cheaper ones go for, not double. light in color and body for an imperial. notes of coffee and chared roast nose and flavor. light hops. some complimentary chocolate. ok.

Sierra Blanca Imperial Stout;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;An average imperial ipa. Vanilla yeasty on tongue and on nose. Otherwise an average imperial stout. Nothing special. Cool art and bottle cap ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Sierra Blanca Imperial Stout;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Pours a clear dark brown with a light brown head that leaves some soapy lace on the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, light coffee, light plums and dates detected with a small floral hop aroma. Taste is roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, bitter cocoa and some sweet dried fruits on the finish. The sweet fruits give it a porter character but there is definitely enough roast and chocolate to tell this is a stout...on the lighter side of most imperials today however this is still well balanced with it being a touch on the sweet side however it has a range of flavors that make it complex and delicious.
Socorro Springs Pick Axe IPA (pre 2010);Socorro, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Socorro Springs Brewing (no longer brewing - see Eddyline);Shared from a growler with FlacoAlto. Aromas were mostly fruit, apricot, mango, grapefruit. Flavors were very fruity up front with a decent greener bitterness on the finish. Not bad.
Socorro Springs Pick Axe IPA (pre 2010);Socorro, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Socorro Springs Brewing (no longer brewing - see Eddyline);Pours from the growler an amber tinged, rich copper color with only a wisp of a head. The aroma is a touch soapy, though predominantly of fruity, citrus and tropical fruit like notes. The hops seem perhaps a bit muted in the aroma compared to a vibrantly fresh IPA. This has a nice punchy hop character to it in the flavor. Quite fruity up front but it gets significantly herbal with a nice bitterness to it in the finish. Hop-fruit flavors of lychee, peach, tangelo and candied grapefruit zest are offset in the finish by notes of chives, pine and a significant, somewhat astringent herbal note that lingers on the tongue along with a biting bitterness. This is a nice IPA, perhaps a touch week in the aroma, but the flavor brings an interesting balance between the up front, expressive fruitiness and the sharp, biting hop notes in the finish.
Socorro Springs Pick Axe IPA (pre 2010);Socorro, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Socorro Springs Brewing (no longer brewing - see Eddyline);Telluride Blues & Brews Fest Sep 06. Very earthy orange, like they mixed dirt into it. Big and chewy hoppy beer with a lot of bitterness, but not much body or backing.
Socorro Springs Pick Axe IPA (pre 2010);Socorro, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Socorro Springs Brewing (no longer brewing - see Eddyline);Pours copper/red with a full head and good lacing. Very little hop aroma but a descent caramel nose. Overyl balanced hoppiness in the flavor w/ a huge smack of diacetyl. Like dirty LSD if you know what I mean. Nicely bitter finnish but nothing profound. Served at like 33F. Inexcusible!
Socorro Springs Pick Axe IPA (pre 2010);Socorro, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Socorro Springs Brewing (no longer brewing - see Eddyline);"Amber body. Pronounced ""earthy hop aroma"" as Mark very accurately stated. Woody and malty too. No hackneyed citrus and pine in this IPA which is refreshing. Quite dry. Good balance and decent overall but the hop quality just doesn�t seem as fresh as it could be."
Socorro Springs Pick Axe IPA (pre 2010);Socorro, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Socorro Springs Brewing (no longer brewing - see Eddyline);Poured amber with a thin head. Served way too cold and at this temperature, there is no aroma. As it warmed, the earthy hop aroma came through. Moderately hopped with earthiness in the flavor. Bitter finish. A decent beer.
Socorro Springs Pick Axe IPA (pre 2010);Socorro, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Socorro Springs Brewing (no longer brewing - see Eddyline);ReRate-tap at brewpub- pours a deep copper hue, much darker than most ipa's Great citrus aroma with some grainy notes also. very nice balance between the hops and malts, almost to Hop Devil levels! A fantastic brew! tap-brewpub-nice balance overall with the aroma, hops, malts and appearance. Not an overpowring ipa, but very balanced. the cascades and centennials come through not to harshly. a solid brew
Alvinne Blond;Moen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Alvinne;"This was the first ever beer commercialized by Alvinne and my first encounter with this brewery.

Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at Fitger's. Pours a very cloudy honeycomb golden with yellow-white head. Scent is sweet tree fruit and licorice notes. Taste is bubblegum sweet, strong initially with a somewhat watery finish. Refreshing but an average Hefeweizen overall.
Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;[Growler] Pours very, very cloudy, orange-brown, with a white head. The final pour looked like a milkshake. Aroma has some banana, but also some tropical fruit and lots of yeast. Taste is less banana and sweetness (although banana is there), and more of a showcase of the wheat. Very clean and enjoyable. Average mouthfeel, good length finish. Overall, a very nice hefe.
Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;Sampled draught at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis, October 7 2006. Hazy, yeasty-thick dark gold with very little in the way of retained head, just wisps....fairly dry, spicy aroma with decent soft banana presence, a bit of sour lactic quality....body is much sweeter than the nose would indicate, quite thick and juicy, lots of mashed bananas and sourdough, but too sweet and thick overall and nearly cloying....a bit underfermented I think, though the quality ingredients are there.
Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;On Tap in a Weizen. Scent is of yeast and wheat malt. Cloudy bannana yellow in colour with a nice creamy white head with moderate lacing. Flavour is citrus, bannana, autumnal spices and wheat malt... Very interesting. Smooth character and lots of complexity... An exceptional hefe-weizen.
Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;ABR 2006. Banana and citrus aroma. Sweet wheat flavor and substantial wheat body.. Cloudy yellow. This is simple and there is nothing fancy, so not much to say. But it is a solid hefeweizen.
Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;Hazy yellow color with a small head. Very strong orange and banana aroma. The wheat dominates the taste like a wheat smoothie. Dashes of lemon and orange too, but it�s hard to get much past the wheat.
Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;Gitchee Gumee Brewfest: Solid Illuminated Yellow Coloring with Small Sandy Head. Strong Citrus and Banana Aroma with Light Spices Coming Out. Flavor Pretty Much the Same. Srong Yeast and Coriander Presence. A Bit Watery Overall with a Dry Aftertaste. Drinkable Hefe.
Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;Gitchee Gumee Brewfest 2005. Number 100!!!!!!!!!!!!! I�m glad it was a Fitger�s Beer, since that�s the home turf, but I wish it had been one of my favorite styles. None the less, rock on! Strong banana aroma, backed with coriander, cinnamon and clove, but all pretty light. Murky, hazy even yellow color. Too watered. Banana, yeast, and wheat flavors. A fairly even wheat. This isn�t my style, so I�m not blown away. Continues with that fresh lemon finish and smooth palate, if it weren�t so weak.
Fitgers Lester River Hefeweizen;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fitgers Brewhouse;Solid cloud of pale yellow with a large creamy starch white head that fades slowly down to a thin haze and lace is in thin foamy sheets. Smell has a nice soft banana ester aroma, some dull lemon in between with light spicy clove. Soft and pleasant nose. Taste is nice and soft, lighter carbonation then most, kinda fluffy and light with some banana, mild lemon thats dulled with slight clove hints. Mellow, easy, and lightly flavored. Feel is partailly creamy at first then a bit of carbonation grab peeks some interest, but overall short lived in every aspect. finishes with a light textured bite and lingering spice. A pretty desent hefe, has a few things going for it. Needs som elonger lasting qualities and a bit of a boost as well. A bit milder then most, enjoyable but lacking.
Fitgers Petroglyph Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at Fitgers, dark cola pour with a thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee. Taste is very toasty, nice malt and bitter
Fitgers Petroglyph Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;Solid lookinb dark and deep brown, some deeper red shows around the edges with a thin off-white head that lays a thin haze for ahile then disappears, lace in minimal spots. Smell is a solid roastyness, rich, lush, a nice touch of chocolate and coffee mixed in over the top. Taste is more of the same with a nice deep dark roasted malt flavor with a nice light mix of some chocolate and coffee, notes of nuttyness and roasted tangyness that lingers. Too bad its short lived in its flavor and hold, could be held a longer with a bit more body. Feel is close to medium, lightly creamy, and has a fairly nice finish of tang and mild bitterness that sticks for a smidgen longer then the actual taste. A pretty good porter, a longer lasting flavor and some more heft in the body and feel and this would be a keeper for sure. With that said, I did have another, it was the better of the bunch that I had during my visit.
Fitgers Ore Dock Triple Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fitgers Brewhouse;"Dense looking brown/ amber with a compact tan head; tofee and caramel aromas, with light fusel and some cherry ester. Smooth on the palate, but fairly dry and thin, with a tofee flavor hardly a hint of the high alcohol. Nice aftertaste, but it takes a while to acumulate. Could have some more malt complexity, but a pretty nice beer, I also tried an oak aged(new oak, 3rd or 4th time used) version that took very well to the treatment, the added vanilla and tannic backbone really fleshed out this beer, it was a very nice neutral strong lager for barrel ageing."
Fitgers Ore Dock Triple Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fitgers Brewhouse;"What's this? A triple bock in a MN brewpub? Well lets see...color is a caramel brown with a bit of a chill haze and goldish highlights. Small, fluffy, but densly thick bone white head; the lace in hefty sticking thin sheets that don't budge. Smell is very light of toffee and caramel some dried fruit sweetness and a bit of alcohol comes out when swirled. Taste is incredibly mellow and creamy smooth with good alcoholic brandy-like warmth that comes through right away. Malts are light with soft caramel and toffee, notes of hazelnuts linger along with a bit of peppery spice. Feel is substantially thin for a T bock, quite light, smooth for sure, close to getting medium at the midway point with nice warmth and a pleasing mellow finish. Took no time to finish this off due to its lack of complexity and boldness. Sure goes goes down easy, way to easy, the 10% takes hold quickly as it was consumed by yours truly within about 3 minutes. Even though it was a cinch to drink, for a triple bock, its missing by a good portion of complextity and malt heft compared to most other dubblebocks or even some great bocks."
John Harvards Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);12oz bottle, drank it on the ferry from Martha�s Vineyard. Soapy head, bright white head, copper color, plenty carbonated. Beer taste is just okay for an amber. Not very bready, the hoppiness is not distinct, it�s kind of confused, long aftertaste, long. Just ok, barely.
John Harvards Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap in Framingham. This beer surprised me. It was much better than I was expecting. It had a great malt flavor, was very smooth and drinkable with the right amount of hops. Perhaps the best Amber I have ever had.
John Harvards Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Surprisingly sweet and malty. Decent. One of their better brews. I would look for this if you are stranded at one of their pubs.
John Harvards Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Draft at the Wayne location. Clear red amber body with thin head and light lacing. Sweet malty aroma, very pleasing and got me ready for the taste. Flavor was nice and sweet. Malty backbone and good caarbonation. Well balanced with a little kick to it. Great Amber, and I�m not a fan of Amber�s.
John Harvards Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sample at the Pittsburgh location. This brew is a reddish-amber color with a thin off-white head that lingers for awhile. Thin, spotty lacing. The aroma is mostly malty with a touch of hops. Medium-bodied with a rich malty flavor throughout. Light hops and fruit show up as well. The finish is on the sweet side but has enough hops to keep the tongue interested. Pretty solid overall.
John Harvards Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Fruity, red aroma. Malty, medium bittering. Some west coast hopping. Tangy, lightly sweet, woody, �Red� flavored. Session weight. Clean, but not very entertaining.
John Harvards Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Amber/orange color with medium head and medium body. Good malty flavor. Smooth finish. VEry good amber.
John Harvards Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On-tap at Framingham. This beer dispelled any ideas in my mind that a chain brewer can't brew a great beer. Rich and malty throughout. Nice subtle hop finish. Just wonderful!
Rock Green Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Sampled from a bottle this beer poured a pale yellow color with a medium sized foamy yellow-white head that faded quickly and left no lacing. The aroma was tangy, a bit skunky and corny. The flavor was tangy, bitter and sour with notes of corn and skunk, perfume and windex. Long finish. Light body.
Rock Green Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I think I drank this watery shit a decade ago. My rating is that it was watery shit...
Rock Green Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This is really an ultra-light. That said it does have a bit of body - a skunky, thin, grassy body. The carbonation is high and the color and hop level low. A bad beer but sadly more drinkable than the Rolling Rock that A-B churns out.
Rock Green Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Well, uh...okay, here�s a copy of the other review. I�ve had this in a pint glass. The appearance was a super light clear yellow color with fast carbonation trying to fill a rapidly dieing less than a one finger white foamy head. Lacing, what lacing, there wasn�t any. The smell, what smell, there was barely anything there. Perhaps, some light cooked corn, wow, if you can even actually pick that up, you�re better than me. The taste was semi-sweet and super watery through the aftertaste and finish. The palate, well, uh...its light and sessionable. Overall, okay, well, if anything, it fits the style. Is it good for me? Hell no. Used to like this stuff after a hockey game, but nowadays, I�ll look for other stuff.
Rock Green Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle -etched glass- backlog. Pours gold with white head. Nose/taste of grain, sweet corn and light grass. Light bodied. Nothing going on.

Rock Green Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);No body, no aroma, no taste. Might as well drink a bottled water which is not a bad alternative.
Rock Green Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Sampled directly from bottle, thanks to a friend on an Atkins diet. Typical weak, mildly offensive aromas and flavors of an adjunct light lager. Even less color, aroma, flavor, body and alcohol than regular Rolling Rock, which is hard to believe would be possible. Barely beer.
Rock Green Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This is similar to the regular Rolling Rock. The only difference between the two is that this is a little more watered down and carbonated. Besides that, I don�t even need to describe the flavors and aromas. Just read my regular review on it.

Salopian Ironbridge Stout;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Stout;Salopian Brewery;Cask handpull at Flower Pot Maidstone. Very dark brown near black beer with lasting beige head. In good condition. Quite a hoppy aroma. Some dark malts and dark juicy fruits in mouth. Almost more of a black American pale ale than a stout. On the whole I am not a fan of stouts and not hugely fond of hoppy stouts. Decent though

Long roasty bitter finish. Yummy!

Caulier Passe Partout;P�ruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Caulier;"Vintage bottle of 7 years old. Still produces a very thick, firm, rocky, yellowish white head (caught after gushing!); orangey amber colour, clear with dark dots (dead yeast), misty with deposit. Very fruity aroma not unlike freshly made orange juice, lemon peel, pineapple, caramel candy, butter, white candi sugar, cognac, old �jenever�, white pepper, bark, parsley and the expected oxidation. Sweetish fruity taste, orange and peach with sharpish, tingling carbonation, very soft caramel malt base, light peppery hints, smooth, floral hops in the finish with light bitterness, though insufficiently so to balance out the initial sweetness; some brandy-like alcohol too. In all, nice sweet ale which has aged pretty well."

Wino beer indeed, lacing is surprisingly existant to some extant, for such a stinky water, corny-pilsener? interesting or iritating?, stinks with poor quality and thin grains, sensations close to gutter.

Thirsty Pagan Derailed Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Tap at Thirsty Pagan on Nov. 17, 2011. Hazy dirty yellow pour with a clingy white head. Aroma and taste of grain, grapefruit, and some caramel malts. Good stuff.
Thirsty Pagan Derailed Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;I probably drank this in October or November 2008. Went with my roommate to the brew pub and saw the band Fractals perform in the bar. Got some good pizza too.
Thirsty Pagan Derailed Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;They called this the IPA when i was at the pub. Light hop aspect going on, with little in the aroma. Lightly bitter, needs more hops! All the brews here were all decent, just nothing that amazing.
Thirsty Pagan Derailed Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Cloudy golden with white frothy head. Citrus, mild caramel and pine aroma. Citrus, caramel, and grapefruit flavours. Syrupy, balanced, with medium bitter finish.
Thirsty Pagan Derailed Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Sampled on draught at the brewpub in Superior, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-hazy golden light amber brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves behind a white ring and film top with some spotty lacing. Aroma of light caramel multi-grain malt, citrus peel, and a touch of pine. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated and has a distinct sweet grapefruity flavor with some multi-grain malt and pine. Finish is mildy bitter with a dry malt aftertaste. Pretty nice brew for TP�s flagship product.
Thirsty Pagan Derailed Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Looking at the beer in the clear glass growler, it is a hazy amber orange - from the appearance alone, you might think it to be a tripel. A fine layer of settled yeast sits at the bottom of the jug. It pours pretty much the same color, but now with the yeast stirred up, it is a shade darker and a little bit murky. There is a thin layer of nearly white foam covering the glass. It leaves behind some spidery lacing. The aroma is awesome - piney, grassy, spicey, and very fresh. It smells to me much like some freshly-picked Nugget hops from my back yard vines, but they aren�t my hops, of course. Whatever they are, I approve whole heartedly. The initial flavor is peppery and piney hop bitterness, followed by very light malt, and then a mild citrus hop flavor with a mild bite from the carbonation. The finish is dry with a hoppy aftertaste. The rather light body and mild malt flavor seems designed to be a showcase for an exceptional hop complexity. I really enjoy the hops - from the fresh and potent aromatics through the variety of flavors and then on to a delicious lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Good, interesting beer. Bump up the malt flavor and body, and this would be an exceptional beer.
Twin Ports Colonial Bitter;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;On cask- light gold, with just a touch of white foam. Bread like aroma with a hint of mint, very pleasat softness on the palate with medium body and godd citric, resinous hop flavor and bitterness, not strong but nicely apetite arousing, also it tastes like there might be some wheat in it, a nice cereal-like whole grain flavor. Excellent cask bitter.
Grizzly Peak Whirled Peas Pilsener;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;On tap at the pub. I wasnt impressed by the name or the beer. Lightly sour saaz hops taste with some sweeter malt notes in the light body. Had a pale appearance with some white head, little aroma, some hops. Has a strange alcohol flavor that mixes with a somewhat watery texture on the finish.
Estrella Levante Sin;Espinardo, Murcia, Spain;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Estrella de Levante (Damm);From Eroski. In Roquetas de Mar. In shaker glass. At lunch, with russian salad + solomillo. Another typical unpleasant macro low alcohol brew with the usual disgusting taste and, in thid case, a smooth, low carbonated feel
Estrella Levante Sin;Espinardo, Murcia, Spain;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Estrella de Levante (Damm);33cl can from Consum, Albir. Pours clear, golden with a rather small, white head. Mild aroma of grain with notes of cooked vegetables and hints of sour, green apples. Sweet and grainy with some lighty sour notes. Hardly drinkable.

Estrella Levante Sin;Espinardo, Murcia, Spain;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Estrella de Levante (Damm);Canned. 0.0%. Golden colour with diminishing head. Aroma from sweet-sour maize and suggested honey notes. Low on Co2 with very light body and pretty dry, which makes the maize come through thoroughly. Like chewing on a straw of grass. No bitterness. Not awful but really empty and lifeless.
Estrella Levante Sin;Espinardo, Murcia, Spain;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Estrella de Levante (Damm);33 cl can, in La Manga, Spain. Clear golden color, white head. Aroma is boiled malt. There is no flavor. Extremely thin, and very bad.
Malt River Oktoberfest;Latham, New York, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Malt River Brewing;This beer starts out OK. Aroma has a sligh sourness, but otherwise clean. The problem is that as you drink it, it gets more and more sour. Very malty brew and would be a very good brew if it wasn't for what I believe is a Lacto Bacillus infection. Tasted just like my last doppelbock that I made (what a disaster!). Very unfortunate from what I was told was a very good brewery.
Cottage Jackos Thriller;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Fresh, Rose's, Woolwich. Another in the Whippet Series. A traditional bitter. A soft, easy drinking pint. The caramel notes blend nicely with the gentle hops, lifting this above the average.
Klein Duimpje De Blauwe Tram;Hillegom, Netherlands;Tripel;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;Bottle @ home. Looks amber and slightly opaque with almost no head. Smell gives mostly hops, citrus fruits and a little bit of grass. Taste gives the same hops and citrus fruit with a slight bitterness at the end. Overall, an okay beer that's pretty refreshing and maybe more suited for the spring or summer.

Klein Duimpje De Blauwe Tram;Hillegom, Netherlands;Tripel;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;"Tripel by one of the pioneers of the Dutch craft beer revolution, thanks Craftmember for sharing. Eggshell-white, mousy, stable and closed head, lacing in dots over a hazy warm golden beer with pale orangey tinge. Aroma of ripe melon, bread crust, pineapple, some vague liquorish, coriander seed, orange peel, even fresh tangerine, honey, white bread. Sweetish onset, fruity notes of pineapple, melon and peach, medium carbonated with slick, smooth mouthfeel. Supple sweetbready malt body, a tad biscuity at its edges, with orange peel and coriander spicy notes before a mild, floral hop bitterness sets in; the honeyish and remarkably melon-like sweetness, however, prevails, even when a calvados-tinged alcohol effect rounds things off and warms the throat a bit without burning. Citric aromas linger in the background. Very elegant, indeed sweet but also refinedly aromatic tripel, quite different from the average Belgian tripel, which is often more earthy and robust than this. I quite liked this Blauwe Tram, to be honest."

Klein Duimpje De Blauwe Tram;Hillegom, Netherlands;Tripel;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;"Slightly hazy golden pour, with a white head; falling down but retaining just enough... Aroma is rather faint malty , with an even fainter sweet fruityness. Taste is light spicy (the coriander), medium sweet (going towards honey), and soft to moderate bitter. It's OK, but not very special, and for a tripel a bit light; can imagine that some people feel a weizen character in it. Taste is better than the nose, especially with the bitter twist that surprises."

Ledebergse Tripel;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"At only 6% ABV, this is not a tripel but just another Belgian blonde - and likely an alias, a practice often conducted by Van Steenberge, though I fail to find of which mother beer, and therefore grant it the benefit of the doubt. Sticky, off-white head, hazy peach blonde colour; floral hops in the nose, soap, red apple, grass, peaches; soft fruity taste, rounded, yeasty, sweet honeyish accent, malty, supple and fluffy mouthfeel, grassy hop bitterishness in the finish. Quite decent, actually."

Blackfoot River Single Malt IPA;Helena, Montana, United States;IPA;Blackfoot River Brewing;On tap at Brewhouse Bar & Grille, Helena, MT. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a semi-hazy orange color with a bar pour�s kind of slim white head. Stringy smooth lacing stuck and then slid adequately into the beer. The smell had a huge burst of grapefruit up front with a light caramel underneath but balanced out as it warmed. The taste copied the smell and lead to a sweet to bitter grapefruit aftertaste and a semi-dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there and somewhat sharp but nothing overbearing. Good. Overall, I say this was a pretty good APA that I would have again.

Detroit Beer Co. Steam Tunnel Stout;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Detroit Beer Company;Rich muddy brownish/black. Good sized dark brown head. DBC�s good beers are only slightly filtered. This one has a very even, round moderately dry roasted barley flavor. Some light, mildly sweet coffee sticks on the palate as well.

Their beers arent the definition of complexity, but they are well balanced, not watery, and very flavorful. Decent roasted coffee aroma for the style.
Detroit Beer Co. Detroit Red;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Detroit Beer Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice hazy golden orange to yellow but also having a light brown flowing through and all around in the color. The head was about a half finger�s worth and trickled in its lacing. The smell had a roasty caramel malt and slight nuttiness try to invade but maintain a healthy background. The taste was mainly sweet and roasty adding a light element of nuttiness separate of the sweet and roasty flavorings. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat smooth but also had a decent sharpness about it as well. Overall, good beer for the most part that I would have again.

Detroit Beer Co. Local 1529 IPA;Detroit, Michigan, United States;IPA;Detroit Beer Company;DBC's Local IPA delivers everything you would want and expect from a West Coast style IPA. Orange and partially hazy body with eggshell foam. Citrusy, herbal, and tree-like aromatics. Flavors of grapefruit, orange peel, pine, resin with just a bit of caramel malt.

Detroit Beer Co. Local 1529 IPA;Detroit, Michigan, United States;IPA;Detroit Beer Company;On tap, poured into a sampler glass. Orange and pie crust aromas emanate from this beer with lots of citrus zest and some light toffee. It pours a slightly hazy, amber color with a white head. A medium - light ring is retained with an island of film on the surface. a sparse, micro bubble lace is left down the glass. It�s taste is medium high bitter and medium sweetness. There�s a light, soft carbonation to this slick textured beer, and it has a full citrus body. It�s quite reminiscent of Stone�s IPA, but it�s not as overwhelming in the citrus bitter / astringent category. Tons of bitter grapefruit are present in the gritty finish as well as a mellow, caramel candy character. The aftertaste is relatively short with notes of caramel and biscuit.

Detroit Beer Co. Schizoweizen;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Detroit Beer Company;Hazy golded-yellow. Good thick white head that is actually creamy. Aroma of lemon, lots of bubblegum, some clove and banana. This has the best bubble gum ester flavor of any hefe I�ve had. It is subtle and comes out strong on the very end of the finish. Not sweet, just good. Clove adds just the right amount of spice, while the beer is medium bodied at the least. Fluffy, big mouthfeel, some complexity of citrus, hops, bubblegum and some herbal notes goin on. Very solid beer. No wateriness. More dry than sweet, which is my preference on these. Could use a touch more sweetness though.

It smells very lightly of malt. It tastes very lightly of malt and is quite watery. All I can ask is... why? At least it lacks the adjunct tastes of some macro light beers, but it�s still treading the same boring, watery lager ground of so many big breweries. Overrated.

Detroit Beer Co. Oktoberfest;Detroit, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Detroit Beer Company;I had many Oktoberfests during my time in Michigan. While Detroit Beer Co's was my least favorite, it still delivered a better-than-average fest experience, so kudos to you, Michigan. Detroit's brew has a copper shade. It has the standard grainy feel and caramel-driven taste. Its body is lighter than many beers in this style, but that's easy to forgive on account of how cleanly this finishes. In the end, I'm not sure it's great example of an Oktoberfest, but it's a good Lager.
Detroit Beer Co. Oktoberfest;Detroit, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Detroit Beer Company;Taps clear topaz with a fair eggshell head. Aroma presents a weak malty tone and a hint of apple. Flavor delivers more, fortunately - zesty hops, a little apple, and more than a hint of hops. Mouthfeel features fair body and lively fizz. Prost!

It�s a transparent amber with a small white head and some good webbing for lacing. The flavor starts with light caramel and fruit. The finish has light ginger and a touch of grass. It�s light-medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall, it�s decent but the ginger in the finish is definitely out of place...but a nice touch.
Detroit Beer Co. Oktoberfest;Detroit, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Detroit Beer Company;Orange with some light rusty brown hues. Small white head, some sediment. Aroma is slightly spicy and yet again, would be better if this wasnt ice cold. Opens up lightly malty at first with some yeast and hops adding a small punch. Gains a mildly bitter, medium sweet malt flavor as the medium to medium-light body progresses. Finishes rather clean and unspectacular. A well balanced offering, not horribly complex, but certainly nothing bad here. Good carbonation level, alcohol wonderfully masked. Didnt detect any metallic problems. Mouthfeel is a bit watery.

Detroit Beer Co. Rippers ESB;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Detroit Beer Company;Bitter in name, APA in reality. And a dry APA at that. Pours a medium dark yellow, little bit of red tinges. Small fizzling wheat colored head. Aroma of slight hops, maybe some peppery wheat flavor. . . Begins sharp and spicy, with lots of dry clean light hops flavor. I emphasize light. More of a barley/wheat taste and even then, somewhat light. Not much really goin on here until the finish. The hops come out slightly, with a mild mix of something cascade-like. But the body is light and there is that good old american metallic bitter taste. They served it so damned cold that I didnt really let it warm. Improved slightly though towards end, maybe some malt coming out? Had sediment in it and for that I was impressed. I'll have to get it again when I'm less rushed and see if it improves upon warming to a better bitters temperature.
Cwmbran Pink Panther;Cwmbran, Wales;Flavored - Fruit;Cwmbran;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Bright amber orange. Looks a bit like a mass produced cider. Fruity aroma. Intensely sweet fruity taste: nectarine, peach, redcurrant. No bitterness. Presumably appealing to the female market? Quite palatable.
Cwmbran Pink Panther;Cwmbran, Wales;Flavored - Fruit;Cwmbran;Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham. I can only echo what�s been said about this beer previously - it is rather odd. To me it tasted like a fairly fruity bitter, with a sugar-puff quality to it. Berries in the mouth, with some bitterness, which then melts away to be replaced by a sugary cereal flavour - perhaps like sweet tea. Nice aroma, and reasonably drinkable, but not one I will rush back for.
Cwmbran Pink Panther;Cwmbran, Wales;Flavored - Fruit;Cwmbran;Cask conditioned - Gravity - Derby BF. Bizarre beer with an orange-rose colour obviously due to the raspberry. The aroma is mildly fruity but the taste is more reminiscent of a rose wine. Odd but not unpleasant.
Cwmbran Pink Panther;Cwmbran, Wales;Flavored - Fruit;Cwmbran;Oxford Beer Fest. Gravity. Odd beer from this South Wales micro which opened for business in 1999. It claims to be a wheat beer, though behaves like a bitter. There is raspberry juice dumped in the mix to add interest. This was a feature of this festival - beers with some additive. The beer is a light orange colour with a raspberry tinge. It's clean and refreshing with a nice tannic suggestion of raspberries. Though thin bodied, it does firm up in the swallow. Kind of goes chalky in the finish, then flavour turns to melted cardboard. Very dry. Good start, poor finish.

Portsmouth British Mild Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Mild Ale;Portsmouth Brewery;"(22 oz. bottle from the brewpub (although bottle is labelled ""Seasonal - Mild"" my receipt says ""Dark Light"" - at the time of purchase Portsmouth had a beer on tap called ""Dark Light"" - I�m assuming here ""Dark Light"" is just a different name for British Mild) This beer is quite interesting and I think the flavor is anything but mild...Pours slightly murky ruddy brown with three fingers of creamy biscuit head. Aroma of I�m not sure what - it is sweet and I�ll call it a combo of licorice, caramel and brown sugar. Mouthfeel quite soft and pretty smooth, seems only lightly carbonated. Some thick sloppy lacing. Flavor takes off in alot of directions - peat, licorice, wood, tar, smoke, caramel, earthy funk, Fishermen�s Friend cough drops. Light-medium bitterness overlays and carries through finish. Light bitter and light malty sweet aftertaste. I kind of liked it but think the flavor�s a bit much for a ""session"" beer."
Portsmouth British Mild Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Mild Ale;Portsmouth Brewery;Dark brown in color with ruby highlights and a small off-white head.

Portsmouth British Mild Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Mild Ale;Portsmouth Brewery;2004 draught. Lovely dark brown, with some hints of auburn and dark yellow. Godd beige head. Smells of light caramel/toffee and hints of molasses. Flavor is lightly bitter, but mostly caramel and honey-cream sweet, with a good earthy malt on the finish (slightly dusty/musty). No hops apparent, as they shouldnt be. Loose, light body, but enough flavor not to be a problem. Soft, mild carbonation. Quite lovely.
Portsmouth British Mild Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Mild Ale;Portsmouth Brewery;Draught: This was a dark golden color. It was also slightly hazy. There was some head, which died quickly. There was very little carbonation. Some, but not much lacing. Hint of hops and sweetness to the nose. It is a nice rendition of the style, even if you have to let it warm up a bit to the right temperature.

Bricktown Octoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bricktown Brewery;Pours a deep orange color with a thing white head. Lacks the citrusy taste that most of the other Bricktown beers have, probably due to the use of lager yeast. Taste is slightly sweet and has a nice caramel malt taste.
Bricktown Octoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bricktown Brewery;Virtually aromaless, orange-red beer ... gristy and almost sweet with a citric-acidic aftertaste. Not a very good effort here.

Aroma of sweet dark caramel sugars and earthy malt with a good German lager yeast profile. Body starts full and sweet with a mild hint of tartness toward the rich dark caramel finish.

Pizza Port Z U Later Doppelbock;Carlsbad, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"This was on tap at Pizza Port in Carlsbad and was listed as ""C U Later Doppelbock"". The beer poured a brownish red color w/ orange highlights and very slight head w/ thin lacing. The nose was malty w/ slight roastiness, coffee, & slight flowers. The flavor was roasty and sweet w/ hints of citrus, flowers and coffee. The mouthfeel was creamy and full w/ medium body and a hint of bitterness."
Pizza Port Z U Later Doppelbock;Carlsbad, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Lightly clouded reddish brown appearance. Malty, nutty aroma. Strong port like flavor, nutty dryness but fairly sweet and fruity, bready lingering aftertaste.
Pizza Port Z U Later Doppelbock;Carlsbad, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Dark brown color. Lots of nice chocalate malt flavors going on. Fairly sweet with a touch of bitterness. Not as complex as the best doppelbocks. This beer has no roasty or caramel flavors for me. Nice and smooth.
Pizza Port Z U Later Doppelbock;Carlsbad, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);A dissapointing dopplebock from one of my favorite brewers. Flavor is a little sour for my palate and the horrible taste lingers.

Pizza Port Z U Later Doppelbock;Carlsbad, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);(Draft: Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA) Sweet and very malty with a bit of chocolate going on. Minimally hoppy and mildly bitter in the finish, so the malt clearly is the dominant flavor here. Lightly carbonated and very smooth on the palate, sticky, substantial, with no bite whatsoever. Sweet and malty nose mirrors the flavor, but it also has a slight alcohol aroma as well. Deep mahogany color. Creamy, light tan head fades quickly and leaves no lacing. One of my favorites at Pizza Port, but I�m a doppelbock nut, so go figure.
Pizza Port Z U Later Doppelbock;Carlsbad, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);This place has got a great atmosphere. The beer pours a deep brown, bordering on black with almost no head. The smell is of figs and fruits with a very apparent smell of alcohol. The first sip is very smooth, almost too smooth. While the beer warmed it became more madeira like and less tame. I would have liked a little more hop in the balance. Even though it's a doppelbock it still needs some hop spice. Can I gety an Amen from all my Hop-head brotheren.
Pizza Port Z U Later Doppelbock;Carlsbad, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);This dopplebock pours with a deep, deep amber brown/mohagony body topped by a thin head wtih little lacing. The aroma is sweet, fruity and malty with a fair amount of hoppiness. The flavo ris sweet, fruity and malty with a surprising bitter hoppiness. Full bodied and smooth.
Hobdens Hedgerow Heavy;Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wessex Brewery;Oxford Beer Fest. Gravity. Slightly hazy (from the green hopping). Very much a Barley Wine. Sweet. Heavy. Alcohol in aroma and alcohol in the flavour. Burns in a nice spicy manner. Rotting fruit flavours. Not impressed.

Nashoba Valley Bolt 117 Lager;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;This is a nice tasting well carbonated lager but it had a few faults when compared to something like DAB. First it's a bit hazy not brilliantly clear as a German lager should be. It has a thin quickly disappearing head (may be my glass). And a bit too grainy in the aroma with a slight hint of Pilsner/DMS. But a nice drinking beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Finish was smooth.
Nashoba Valley Bolt 117 Lager;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;Another sample at the winery- Poured a slight hazy gold with decent white foam head. The hop note was odd in this, like spicy mustard which carried into the flavor-odd but really the only way to describe it.
Nashoba Valley Bolt 117 Lager;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;Apple skin and yeast aroma. Malt flavor tastes like crackers. A bit of bitter hops on the finish.

Poured a medium and cloudy yellow color with an averaged sized white head Aromas of grain, lemons, and I�m getting a light spiciness. Tastes of lightly tart and puckering lemons, light grass, and grains. I don�t thinkthey were going for that tart and puckering effect.

Nashoba Valley Heron Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;Sour, unripe fruit, stinky aroma. Mostly clear darkish amber.

Nashoba Valley Heron Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;A copper body with a thin white head.

Nashoba Valley Heron Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;Bottled. Poured hazy amber with a short cap of off-white head.. some fine lacing followed it down. The aroma picked up candy-like sweetness with honey and caramel leading.. fresh floral and fruity hops around.. not bad, but too sweet. The flavor was sweet as well, with honey and redder fruits at the core.. earth and floral bitterness surrounded.. finished rather sharp and bitter (but still with lots of residual sugars). Medium-bodied and sweet as mentioned on the palate.. the transition to the bitter edges was not that good.. aiight brew.

Nashoba Valley Heron Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;So I have to think that a brewer like this thinks they can sell product based on labels, like wine does. Well they better get their shit together cause this stuff is really crappy. It tastes like stale, old, bad pale lager. But I will admit the labels are nice and thay name sold me despite my knowledge of the low ratings. Why am I a walking contradiction.
Nashoba Valley Heron Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;Nice pale ale, but could use a big more aroma and body. It�s a bit thin in both areas. I tasted it out of the bottle, but I�ve had it on tap several times and it doesn�t seem to have that problem there.
Nashoba Valley Heron Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;sampled on tap at the brewery. clear golden in color.

Town Hall Blue Label Barrel Aged Blend;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap on 10/28/2005 (rating from notes). Muddy light brown color with an off-white to yellow head. Smooth caramel, light apple, hop and clove flavors. A light barley wine like flavor.
Town Hall Blue Label Barrel Aged Blend;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;The release on Friday, October 28th, of their 8th Anniversary celebration, it was an amber, clear beer with a moderate head. The aroma was subtle, and in most respect this was a very simple beer. I understood that it was aged in whisky barrels that were previously used for aging their imperial stout. That might have been interesting, but the beer they put in was a single malt beer to begin with--their Single Malt Ale. The caramel malts didn�t produce the layers of flavor that could have been there, and it was a little too attenuated: some alcohol, a little nuttiness, etc. The aging comes out best in the aroma, with the alcohol driving it aromatically. Moderate palate. Overall, kudos for trying, but I don�t think this is worth repeating. I wonder if similar attempts to age with re-used casks have shown less and less barrel influence with each iteration. (tap at brewpub)
Town Hall Blue Label Barrel Aged Blend;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Town Hall 8th Anniversary, Friday release: Dark copper color with a bountiful dishsoap head. Strong barley aroma with a bit of oak rounding it out. The flavor is definitely malt based, but there is a large pile of dry and earthy hops that runs over the beer. Finish is woody. Not what I expected at all, but a fine beer.
Town Hall Blue Label Barrel Aged Blend;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Enjoyed at the Town Hall 6th Anniversary Party, 10-18-2003 An incredible concoction...color, a cloudy bronze, with a tight white ring of foam...aroma is smooth, airy, with light, mellow fruit notes, no strong herald appears of what lies in wait...once we let it drip down the lips, this Big, Bad-Boy asserts itself fully, as full-on hops charge the mouth...lip-smacking, delicious texture...this ale is thoroughly playful, turns the senses into it's own romper room...it takes us over, and we surrender easily, and can only grasp at hints and whispers to crack through the complexities of this brew...resounding, ringing, eternally at work on the tastebuds, bold and bouyant...now, finally the oak-barrell character comes forth, creeping into the flavor, but really stays on the sidelines, merely peppering the profile, not dominating it...but it's a monster altogether...halfway in, my favorite adjective is ""juicy, juicy, juicy"" ...abundant flavor, sturdy and potent, though mouthfeel tends to be thinnish at the end... Full and robust, with a sharp, whiskey-ish taste...damn, this is good!...throw your drams in the bin, boys, let this be your sin, if you're lucky enough to taste it...juicy, tingling, tantalizing...but I have to pull back on the drinkability thing, for I could only fit 2 1/2 serving past my lips. Oh, I had probably 5 more pints later that night, but couldn't deal with another taste of this dangerous, but delectable ale."
Town Hall Blue Label Barrel Aged Blend;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;I acquired a growler of this at the Town Hall release party back in September. After asking the brewer and a few other people about keeping the beer, I decided to try cellaring it for a while. I covered the neck in wax, and kept in my cellar. Am just now going to open and see how it has held up. Malty, sweet aroma, slightly subdued. Hazy, copper color. Light carbonation, but there is some still there after all this time! Head forms, but fades quickly. But this was a lightly carbonated beer to begin with. Taste and mouthfeel are big and bold. Lots of malt. As the beer warms and comes to room temperature, the malt sweetness increases, as does some stone fruit notes. The woody notes have subsided a bit, but still somewhat noticeable. I can see where JK may have thought of this as a dubbel, it has that sweet fruitiness about it. This is a very good beer, that has held up quite well aging in a growler.
Town Hall Blue Label Barrel Aged Blend;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"I had this at a limited release for the Autumn Beer Review, and only recently was able to find out what kind of beer it was. There is a heavy aroma of port and aged fruit. Also wood in the flavor, clearly a result of ageing. Sweet fruit flavor. Heavy on the palate. I originally thought it was an abbey dubbel. This is supposed to be an aged and limited release; try it while you can."

Big Rock Chop House Oktoberfest;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Some head and lacing. Good color, a sort of cola. Very dissappointing in the flavor department. Nothing special at all. No strong hops, no strong malts. The poorest Oktoberfest I've had this season and this is number six.
The Rock Rock Steady Red;Sumner, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;This beer is a good solid red. While not an incredibly bitter hoppy flavor, it finished up with a clear crisp finish.

Similar to most macro brewed red ales, like Rickard�s Red.
The Rock Rock Steady Red;Sumner, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;January 29th, 2013 - Two beers into The Rock�s sampler paddle and I�m already flagging. I�ve lost the will for decorous, ornate beer reviews, so the rest of these are going to be simple, cursory, and underwhelming. Here, again, the beer�s aroma is too weak to put up a fight against the air�s atmospheric pressure, so I catch little to no aroma. The flavor is not as offensively bad as the other Rock beers so far. Malty with some sweet caramel, and a hefeweizen style note of mashed banana and clove. Not bad, but not great. A glimmer of hope in the taster line up?
The Rock Rock Steady Red;Sumner, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;Aroma is light roasty malts with caramel notes. Taste is a rich maltiness that finishes with a bland bitterness. Body is a clear light amber with a poorly retained head.

Aroma is grassy and grainy with some floral notes. Taste is a mild spicy and grassy hop bitterness with a light malty sweetness. Light bodied with average carbonation. Nothing really good here, more like a typical macro lager.
The Rock Suicide Blonde;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;January 29th, 2013 - Odorless, flavorless, but not quite colorless. For all intents and purposes. the Suicide Blonde is fizzy, fermented water, with a light palate, the faintest hint of light grains in the taste, and as typical and unexciting as a lighter beer can get. Also, why is it called a blonde when it�s a pils?
The Rock Suicide Blonde;Sumner, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Rock Wood Fired Pizza;Aroma is quite poor. Some very pale bitterness and mostly carbonation. Taste is quite poor, malt character almost suggests soured grain. Bitterness has little character and does little to save the effort. Body is a light clear gold with a head that retains poorly.

Mad Anthony ESB;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;tap at the brewpub - Amber pour, small off-white head. This beer doesn�t kind of smell of caramel. It has a big caramel aroma. Think taking a whiff of a caramel candy. The flavor is of caramel malt with mild hops bitterness. It�s light to medium bodied and while maybe a touch watery, is quite good. Earlier Rating: 1/14/2006 Total Score: 2.1 draft - Light, hoppy aroma, thin head. It�s smooth and has some light hoppy bitterness, but I really expected more. The body was too thin and the taste too watery. It�s okay, but I know a bitter can be better.
Mad Anthony ESB;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On Tap at Brewery. Pours a cloudy, brownish amber with slight off white head. Aroma was a light fruit and light roast malt, slight hop bitterness. Taste was light fruit esters, roast malt and only a slight hop bitter. A nice old English Style Ale.

Mad Anthony ESB;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On draft as Brewpub in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The pour was an attractive caramel red with a small pink tinged head and light lacing. Nose of caramel malts and light pine and floral hops. Fairly light mouthfeel. Flavor was of malts pine, and the finish was ever so slightly bitter.
Mad Anthony ESB;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. I ordered the English Bitter and this is what she brought. Jewel like deep ruby color with a foamy off-white head that coated the glass with sheets of lace. Sweet grain nose. Sweet beer with a ripe pit fruitiness. Burnt grains with a faint grassy hop finish. This did not seem either English or Bitter to me. Earlier Rating: 10/20/2003 Total Score: 3 Off of the hand pull at the brew pub. Dark copper in color with little nose and a small, off white head with nice lacing. Very smooth down the throat like you would expect from the hand pull, but maybe a little thin. Not very bitter with very little finish. Chuggable but not very interesting.
Mad Anthony ESB;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This draft brew from the brewery in my home town poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that left behind a transparent very soft carbonated weak yellow orange colored body and a good lacing. The aroma had a mild bitter malt hop note to it. The mouth feel was mildly tingly at the start and faded in the finish. The flavor was mild with a mild bitter note that was weak and thin. I think it was not 4.8% ABV, but thats what the brewer said it was. It seemed more like 3% to me. It was though true to the English style. Earlier Rating: 10/19/2003 Total Score: 2.7 Fort Wayne event. The fifth brew of the evening. We moved to Mad Anthonys at 7PM. Here I was plesantly suprised to find 1 brew that I had not yet rated. Cool! This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized off-white colored bubbles that left behind a softly carbonated transparent brown colored body. The aroma was faint with barely noticeable notes of malt and hops. The mouthfeel was smooth and somewhat thin with a much less than expected bitter finish. The flavor was malty and had a mild hoppiness to it.

Mad Anthony ESB;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Not too many notes on the ESB. Poured a copper color, with a thin white head. Aroma of light malts and earthy hops. Nice flavor though- toasty malts, wood, and slightly bitter, earthy hops dominated the palate. I would drink this again.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Dark;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Porter;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Nice Darkish not really dark but has a chocolate flavour to it so its not to bad moorilla taking over the brewing of it should be good for the beer
Wineglass Bay Hazards Dark;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Porter;Wineglass Bay Brewing;I have to agree with the two head analogy, this beer is so over carbonated that even with a careful pour a 330 ml bottle overfilled a pint glass with head. As a consequence the aroma was mainly CO2 with some choc-caramel carried on it. The flavour was a very mild chocolate with some tinny hop bitterness and a rather thin palate, due to the over carbonation.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Dark;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Porter;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Clear, medium brown colour with a huge loose head and great lace. Wierd aromawhich is trying to be hoppy but is moderately medicinal. The taste is mild but again indistinct. I will be charitable and say that it might be chocolate. Pretty darn ordinary and at $4.99 a bottle, rediculously expensive. Totally Tasmania? Maybe it's meant to have two heads?
Wineglass Bay Hazards Dark;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Porter;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Well first of all this really ain't dark. I've had darker bitters but it's probably more a brown ale. It still has a lot of the chocolatey, if not roasty flavours of a Porter, however. Actually I think it is remarkably similar to Jamieson Brown Ale. Pours with a massive, pillowy head and the yeast sticks to the bottom of the bottle. Aroma mostly powdery cocoa, with a touch of tropical fruitiness. Flavour starts lightly malty, then gets sweetly fruity, alcoholic (!?!) followed by a harshish bitterness and slight sourness. Not outstanding, but OK.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Dark;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Porter;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Not a bad ale, wouldnt call it dark though, smells ok, tastes a little better, a bit of sediment. A tad coffee or chocolate, goes down the throat pretty easily. cheers
Wineglass Bay Hazards Dark;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Porter;Wineglass Bay Brewing;almost coffee aroma, grainy, not quite rich enough in colour. Goes down easily, hints or chocolate, coffee. Not bad but heavily overpriced for a locally brewed ale.
Brewery Creek Pointer Pale Ale;Mineral Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brewery Creek Brewing (WI);Generic amber colored pale ale. It isn�t bad though, not too hoppy but enough to be interesting.
Brewery Creek Pointer Pale Ale;Mineral Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brewery Creek Brewing (WI);Draft at Brewery Creek. Hazy orange-brown color. Thin off white head. Buttery aroma..uh oh. Off flavors dominate, Ill bet this is how 17th century beer tasted sometimes. Embarrassingly buttery and infected. Minimal soapy hop tones cant hope to balance the offness. Quite bad.
Brewery Creek Pointer Pale Ale;Mineral Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brewery Creek Brewing (WI);"A tasty pale ale with lots of c-hops. Good balance of f;avor and bittering hops."
Brewery Creek Pointer Pale Ale;Mineral Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brewery Creek Brewing (WI);Right from the tap at the Brewery in Mineral Point. I think the proprieters think this is the goods. When poured from tap it had a minimal head, a fruity coppery smell, first taste had an acidic taste and unpleasent aftertaste.

Lions Den Conciliation Ale;Stockton-on-Tees., Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lions Den (prev Marsdens);Fresh, Tiger's Head, London.

Railway Tavern Crab n Winkle Mild;Colchester, Essex, England;Mild Ale;Railway Tavern Brewing;Cask (gravity dispense), London Drinker Beer Festival, March 2006. This beer had been eluding me for a long time. Its only regularly available at the one pub in Essex and it always seemed to be not ready, or already gone, when its been listed at festivals I�ve been to. The wait was worth it. Making a mild your main product is not a usual move for a brewpub and demonstrates a real devotion to the product. Very dark colour - almost black, but with a hint of red when held up to the light. Quite rich, with lots of burnt, smoky malt and a fair amount of coffee. A touch of bitterness too. Being a low ABV mild, its all fairly restrained of course. If there�s any downside, the mouthfeel is just a touch ashy. A top class mild.
Railway Tavern Crab n Winkle Mild;Colchester, Essex, England;Mild Ale;Railway Tavern Brewing;Cambridge Beer Festival. A headless stout-lookalike when gravity poured! Apparently, this is a hard-to-find beer. Scent of chocolate and coffee. General aromas are smoked, burnt chocolate. Smooth on the palate, almost like a good whiskey in the taste. A little thin, but the biggest problem is that the aromas are so powerful that I�m not convinced anyone could have much more than a pint of this: I can still taste in an hour later!
Railway Tavern Crab n Winkle Mild;Colchester, Essex, England;Mild Ale;Railway Tavern Brewing;Cask@London Drinker. Smokey bacon characters. Like a malty bitter, with an ashy/roasty quality, sweetish, with some lactic sourness in the finish.

Beartown Ginger Bear;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beartown Brewery;Cask at The Fountain, Leek. A clear golden colour with a medium white head. Aroma of ginger, some sage & onion stuffing and subtle spicy hops. Taste of ginger, subtle sage, a little straw and subtle toasted malts. Light bodied and soft carbonation. A gingery bitterness in the finish. I don�t mind the ginger in this but it�s ever present and only subtle malt coming through...plus the weird stuffing quality. My half was enjoyable but not anymore.
Beartown Ginger Bear;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beartown Brewery;On cask at Reginald Mitchell (JDW), Hanley. Pours amber with off white head.

Bullfrog Trois Pain Tripel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Bullfrog Brewery;Very fruity and yeasty attempt at a Belgian tripel. Very banana taste and aroma masks the high alcohol. Not to my liking because of the overwhelming banana dominance but a good effort
Bullfrog Trois Pain Tripel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Bullfrog Brewery;This beer has been retooled into the Trois Pain Trippel. Farmy, almost saison-y smell. Delicate hops and corriander? Tastes sweet, then wheaty, but finishes strongly alcoholic (apparently, they didn't retool that part). Would score higher if not for the ethanol finish.
Bullfrog Trois Pain Tripel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Bullfrog Brewery;Clear gold appearance, strong flavors & taste, sweet flavors, the alcohol level wasn't masked too well in this beer as the aftertaste had some huge notes of the alcohol
Town Hall Six Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"...or as I like to call it, 6PA...6 hops, 6 malts, 6 hop additions, for Town Hall's 6th Anniversary, a pattern they plan to continue, year after year, for who knows how long...Perhaps at the 25th Anniversary, it'l be a trifle too much. Lovely, hazy orange color, with a fluffy white head atop..and considerable spider-webby lace-leaving....the aroma, a thing of wonder!!! 6 hops, I didn't ask which ones, they didn't tell, but it's a buzzing hornet's hive of hoppiness up in here, with no order, none taking turns or keeping in a single file line...no, it's a mess of hops and malt, each proclaiming their voice at whatever interval they see fit... a beer cacophany, but one brimming with flavor, body, and exuberance! I had one last night at the anniversary party, and one just tonight. It's amazing stuff. Said tavenjef, ""Would you give it a 5 or 4.5 for taste?"" Honest, I hadn't thought about it...""either one,"" I said, but now that I've had another, and have had time to reflect, gee, can a pale ale be any more vibrant and exciting than this one? If it were bottled, it would cause a regular sensation, I assure you! Pine, grapefruit, and more in the nose..softly and assuredly complex on the palate, aside from the onslaught of hoppiness...spongy texture, earthy, gritty, grabby...there's several dozen things happening at once, or so it feels...the malt & hops leap out. joust, parry, dodge, then lays down and luxuriates on the palate...hops jump up and poke about the roof of the mouth, stick their sensations all around the palate...Jeezum X. Crow, this is a humdinger if there ever was one!!! I described this to someone afterwards, and he was non-plussed...""If it's so good, why would they only make it once?"", he asked...because, little man, just..because...."
Town Hall Six Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Very west coast. Light brown, heavily hopped. Crisp and refreshing. Medium bodied. By far the best American pale ale I have had. Became better as it warmed.
Town Hall Six Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;A specially brewed pale for the 6 year anniversary with six varieties of hops and malts - Color is a nice darker amber clearish syrup hue with a small bone white head that fades to a ring and spotty lace. Smell has a nice hoppy blast of pine, grapefruit, and fresh floral hop cone aroma. Highly sweet but softly tingling piney nose which is really nice and some hints of toasty malts. Taste is all hops with bouncing flavors all over the place. Lots of bitterness and sweetness playing back and forth on the palette but the pineyness is high with a nice floral character. Smooth malt backing thats toasty and adding to the heft of bittering sweetness but keeping balance enough as not to overwhelm. Feel is quite full and loaded with incrediable hoppyness. This was a damn good pale but took forever to finish due to the overly hopped character. A pure pleasure to engagingly sip, very yummy and complex. Quite a monster pale if I ever met one. Can't wait til next year where they promise seven varieties of hops and malts. Wow!

I dig it and solid coffee stout indeed.
Rocky River Black Magic Coffee Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);"Aroma, what aroma? I guess a slight sugar aroma and maybe a little vanilla and/or cream? Smells like a Krispe Kreme. No �rich creamy head,� no head at all really. Dark brown, but not at dark as Curly's Irish Stout. Looks good. Flavor was a bit unbalanced. It was too strong on the alcohol flavor, though there were some chocolate notes, and a slight sweetness. Palate was fair. Not a bad beer to drink. Overall, not as good as Curly's Irish Stout. Was unbalanced; too much sweet + alcohol."
Rocky River Black Magic Coffee Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Initially smells like most of their ales, which is really yeasty. Just a little bit of smoke mixed in. But after you let it open up, it oozes with awesome coffee aromas. Huge roasty coffee blends with soft semisweet chocolate flavors. Big chocolate presence here. Finishes up with a smoke+chocolate combo. Not much hop assertion till the end, where it just finishes a bit bitter from the hops and the astringent coffee. Delicious. �03 GABF silver medal. Best coffee infused stout I�ve had, including Founders Breakfast Stout and Alesmith Speedway.

RCH Steam Fair;Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Cask at Akkurat, Stockholm. Dark amber. Some grass and raisin. Bold mouthfeel.

Molson Carling Draft;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated September 2005. Comes in a 12 ot 24 pack only. Pours a rich golden colour with a creamy-foam head. The retention is medium and some good thick lacing sticks to the glass. Carbonation is light and mouthfeel is thin. The aroma is of sweet malt, but mild. Taste is pretty mild too, with a quick bite at the beginning, comes then clean and sweet to end in a mixture of malt and sweetness. Can�t believe this one is more expensive then the Carling Lager (by 4-5 dollars). The lager kicks its ass.
Molson Carling Draft;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);only reason i have it a tenth of a point was cause it actually had some body to it. it wasnt just like water, but the taste, dear god..........yuck.
Molson Carling Draft;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ony the second taste from Molson�s Carling, but it was ore then the others and therefore more was expected, needless to say I was let down, there is no reason to make this, why? You could get better cheaper.
Molson Carling Draft;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This beer was amazing. The taste was good, and the bottle was nice itself. But the aroma was amazing. It was cheap, and it had a nice zing to it.
Molson Carling Draft;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Swillfest �04: Not sure what they mean by draft, as I�ve only seen it in bottles.

Great Dane Tri Pepper Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Don�t think that I could have made it through a full pint, so the sampler was more than enough. On tap at GD downtown�s pool room bar displaying a bright and clear golden color, white bubbles & cream head, and ribbons & spots of lacing. Spice and the promise of a peppery punch was offered in the nose. Pils malt was minimal or masked. The flavor was the fullfillment of the aroma, full pepper domination, yet somewhat under control. Intrigued, but not my preference as a Pils adjunct.
Great Dane Honey Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On draught at the Great Dane Hillsdale location.

Great Dane Honey Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at Great Dane � Hilldale. Poured clear, brighter orange with a tall, fluffy off-white head. The aroma picked up sweeter honey and bready notes with a low dose of floral hoppage.. soft and very pleasant. The flavor found semi-sweet honey and bread with spicy floral and pine bitterness.. dry, very quick finish. Dry on the palate with low carbonation.. building bitterness toward the back.. decently balanced. Tasty.
Great Dane Honey Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at downtown location I shared this one with my wife since she wanted something light. I was more curious to see how the Great Dane could do with a style that is tricky to pull off well. As it turns out they did a decent job. I might not order this again in the future but it was not an appaling release. In fact, I found it slightly more enjoyable the Extra Pale Ale I�d just finished. Aroma / Appearance - A pale yellow transparent body represents the typical pils look. An off white one finger head floated on top like a layer of icing - solid with only a hint of bubbling. Honey, wheat and a bit of hops were evident in the simple but capable nose. Flavor / Palate - Hoeny wheat cheerios ground down and liquified wash across the palate. A grainy muted hop taste then reveals itself before everything fades away. There�s not much else to say about this one other than it was enjoyable and well made. I might not order it again but it is a perfectly sessionable summer pils.
Great Dane Honey Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub (downtown location). Poured a clear golden color. Head was thin, white, and left some decent lace behind. Aroma was of subdued noble hops and a touch of honey. Flavor was similar and overall uninspiring.

Great Dane Honey Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;[GABF 2006 � Denver, Co] A very fine light yellow color with a thin head. This had a great aroma of honey and spices and was very light to drink. I liked the German malts used and the finish was very refreshing a great summer beer.
Great Dane Honey Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Transparent and paling caramel brass in color with an etched grayish white wrung and minute saliva sheaf serving as the head. Biscuit styled honeyed wheat registers in the nose first. Subtle fluorination moves pollen into the comb, and some noble hop fury aromatically resides under sugar combed sourdough. There�s even a mild juniper utterance hiding there. Pungent pils flavor from the get-go. Nectary aspects grip wheat and come running with grainy home cookin�. Mild hallertrau bite gives an earthiness alongside a buttered sourdough heel that sweetly hugs the tongue. Clover meets corn flakes for wholesome beady memoirs. Light fairing mouth feel with buttery cake cone flavors speak of more innocent and dessert-esque cream connotations. Searing, separatist movement happens amongst the honey creates a discrepancy between the sweetness and grainy traits in the end.
Great Dane Honey Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;A nice golden beer with a thin white head. Full malty nose and aroma. Not a lot of body or depth but very well made and would�ve been rated higher except the glassware was poorly rinsed and I tasted a lot of Clorox.
Great Dane Honey Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Interesting I�d say. Very, very pale malt flavor. Supposedly honey is in this but I really didn�t taste it that much. Some bitterness in the end. Light texture.

Medium balanced smoke flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration.
Bluegrass Old Smokey (Black Silk);Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draught during my Great Lakes region brew tour. Black/red pour with a quaint tan head. The aroma is of coffee and caramel and doesn�t lean toward any one robust note. The smoke comes out in the flavor which mixes very well with the coffee taste. Some meaty notes are hidden far beneath the smoky-porter aspects. The sweetness is very appropriate here.
Bluegrass Old Smokey (Black Silk);Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Liquorice, smoked malts and grape notes to the aroma. Opaque dark brown/black body topped by a decent tan head that recedes to thick ring with nice lacing. Smokey malts with liquorice notes in the flavour. Clean and well brewed but perhaps not altogether exciting. Medium light body with fair carbonation. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Bluegrass Old Smokey (Black Silk);Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bluegrass Brewing Company;GABF 05. Pours a jet black. Aroma is sweet chocolate with a whiff of smoke. Flavor is smokey with an offset of chocolate and hops-- it�s actually very hoppy. Palate is dissappointingly watery. Overall, a good beer.
Bluegrass Old Smokey (Black Silk);Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Huge creamy and frothy head lasts forever over the deepest brown body. Typical porter chocolate and cerealic malt nose, gentle nutty and plumy to add elegance.The smoke remains a factor, but under control from the beginning to the end. Focused flavour balance, not really attempting to be complex. Simply a very good base porter with an stylish smoke character. Far-fetched medium creamy mouthfeel has this light carbonation that evolves into a comfortable foam and make it all perfect. Fantastic beer for my smokehead.
Bluegrass Old Smokey (Black Silk);Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bluegrass Brewing Company;On draft at BBC Shelbyville. Pours black. Aroma of roasted malts. Very similiar to the Dark Star Porter, but sweeter with less robust roastiness. This beer wasn�t bad, but the smoke flavor tasted artificial. I haven�t had a bad beer at BBC, but this one was disappointing. Didn�t get as much out of this as some of the other reviewers. The lack of hop character was disappointing. Perhaps they�ve changed the recipe.
Bluegrass Old Smokey (Black Silk);Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Cask at the brewery - malty and only lightly smoked in the nose. Very nice appearance - dark brown and opaque with as creamy a head as I believe I�ve seen without nitrogen. Of course, that leads to a creamy mouthfeel - very soft. This is as nice a beer as I�ve had from this brewery!

Prescott Raven Maniac Stout;Prescott, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Prescott Brewing Company;Quite nice. Malty but some coffee like bitterness underneath. A little thin for the style but the finish, somewhat acidic, makes up for it. I get some chocolate, espresso, roasted, toasted malts. Not a lot of aroma, maybe a little more as it warms.

White Marsh Murs Backdraught Porter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Porter;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Had this almost a year ago, so I�m going from handwritten notes.

White Marsh Murs Backdraught Porter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Porter;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Pours menacingly black. Only when help up to the Sun did I get a view of this beer's true, sparkling clear, ruby hue. The large, frothy, light-brown head is not quite fully lasting, but diminishes into a small, 1/2 finger-width, creamy head with staying power. The aroma is a blend of licorice, cinnamon, pepper and allspice. Kind of weird... appealingly weird. Nice, spicy flavor. Bitter cocoa and espresso. Sassafras/root beer and buttermilk notes. Very astringent and well-hopped. Medium-bodied with a dry, astringent mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Short, very dry, bitter finish.

Thorbr�u Portator;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Thorbr�u Augsburg;Goldene Farbe, Schaumkrone f�r einen Bock mittelm��ig. Sehr malzig s�� dazu etwas Alkoholisch, aber in einer mischung die daf�r sorgt das er nicht so lecker ist wie er vielleicht ohne diese intensivit�t sein k�nnte.

Aspall Medium Suffolk Cyder;Stowmarket, Suffolk, England;Apple Cider;Aspall Cyder (Molson Coors);I�m drinking the demi-sec 500ml-1 pint 0.9 fl oz bottled version of this draft cider. Pours nicely, bubbly with little to no head in a nice light golden color. A sweet, dry and lightly tart apple cider that doesn�t leave a heavy feeling in your stomach. However, I found it to be a little too much for just a casual drink, maybe save for a special occasion to share with a loved one. Not a bad drink, just not for me.
Aspall Medium Suffolk Cyder;Stowmarket, Suffolk, England;Apple Cider;Aspall Cyder (Molson Coors);better than average cider, but not quite worth the premium coin. more sweet than tart with hints of yeast. semi-dry and adequately refreshing. Better than the organic head to head.

Mickey Finns Katarina Wit Beer;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;On tap at the Great Lakes Brewfest 2009. Hazy witbier yellow with a medium white crown. Aroma of standard witbier fare � fruit peel, mild coriander and light yeast mixed with something a bit off. Taste of coriander, orange peel and spice, very light tasting.
Mickey Finns Katarina Wit Beer;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;From the tap with the new name of Katarina Wit (Clever - How long ago since the last time she skated?) - This was pretty thin as wits go. It�s got a slightly hazy, pale straw body with a foamy head that evaporates quickly. The aroma is a slightly tart wheat with yeast and the suggestion of spices. Even fewer spices in the taste, just a yeasty wheat ale. Mickey Finn�s Brewery, Libertyville, IL
Mickey Finns Katarina Wit Beer;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;"Draught under the moniker ""Katarina Wit"" during my Great Lakes region brew tour. Pours cloudy white with a foamy head. Yeah, this is the whitest beer I�ve ever seen, it almost looks like spoiled heavy cream. There�s some skunky yeasty aromas and a far-off fruit sweetness. Bananas are much more apparent in the mouth along with a wheaty, cereal finish with cloves. This is like a slightly sour banana popsicle melted into a glass."
Mickey Finns Katarina Wit Beer;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Now called Katarina Wit (boo!): White pale yellow with a lasting frothy head. The aroma has notes of orange peel, lemon zest, clove, bubblegum, and wheat. The taste is a puckery citric flavor with muted spices in addition to pale malts an wheat. The feel is fizzy and watery, average for the genre. An okay summer beer.
Mickey Finns Katarina Wit Beer;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;This looked great in the tulip glass they served it in. A hazy orange tinged gold with a large lasting creamy white head. A spicy( corander, mace) orange aroma. Taste was more subdued than the aroma, perhaps because they served this one so cold it took awhile to warm up, yeast, oranges and spices. Slightly sweet very enjoyable beer, was surprised to see it at this time of year.

Mit Sicherheit das betse Leichtebier, dass ich bis jetzt verkostet habe! Von einem typischen Leichtbiergeschmack bleibt nur eine sehr leichte s�uerliche Note im Antrunk. Im Rest wie ein normales (!)

Gamla Stans Ale;Stockholm, Sweden;Pale Ale - English;Gamla Stans Bryggeri;Sampled draught at Ardbeg Room, Stockholm. Sadly this is the last beer from Stockholms only brewpub. It is now closed due to lack of interest from the mega-rich owners. Equipment and skilled brewers are rumoured to be going up north. The beers is clear ruby with firm head. It has a light flowery aroma, and is sweet, clean and rounded. There's some caramel, but not much else going on. The finish is drier with only a hint of bitterness. Having released a wonderful pils and a weizen earlier this years, this was disappointingly tame. I will refrain from paying a single penny to any company in the MTG group in the future, you greedy bastards.

Olde Peninsula Downtown Brown Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown color with a thin white to off white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Adequate foamy lacing clung for a little bit and then slid. The smell had a mild nutty/caramel aroma that when it warmed it seemed like there was a brown sugar thing going on. The taste followed the nose but the brown sugar thing was there before it warmed as it seemed more combined. On the palate, this one sat kinda light and came across fairly sessionable. Overall, decent brown ale, I�m not sure if that brown sugar that was meant to be there or not and honestly I�m not sure if I really liked it in the beer or not. I might come back to it if I ever saw it again.

Newport Storm 03;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Newport Craft Brewing;750mL bottle. Poured murky deep brown with just a few light bubbles for head. The aroma picked up sour notes and broken-down hops.. some sweet and nutty notes came on the second wave.. not terribly hot, but it was falling apart. The flavor opened sour and a touch metallic, with aged caramel, nutty notes, and vanilla following.. finished long, warm and tangy with broken-down malts and peppery character.

Swinkels Traditional Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Swinkels moet zich schamen,de prijs is bijna het dubbele van de gewone Bavaria pils.

Malty, pilsener and quite toasted malts. Very malty taste, but with a nice bitterish lining, setting off the toasted malts very well. Finish is dull-sweet, however, the carbonation making up for most of the flavour. Light to medium bodied, empty palate. Unassuming Pilsener, in its megalager emporium far from the worst."
Swinkels Traditional Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours golden with a small head. Aroma of corn and grains. Taste of the same. A cheap import that did the job back in college and tasted pretty darn good.

Swinkels Traditional Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Swinkels was a beer recommended by the bartender to try for once. Well I tried it for once, and it will be the last time. It�s not because I didn�t like the beer, it was because it�s not an interesting beer. If you serve it into a random pilsner glass, like Heineken or Bavaria, you will not notice the difference. Same colour, almost no aroma. The taste disappears quickly leaving you feeling like you�re missing out on something. Quite disappointing unfortunately
Swinkels Traditional Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);I remember the first time I had this brew some 20 years ago. It was at Paddy�s Pub in Madison, WI. We all thought it was called Swinkels because it had flakes of protein, or other stuff, floating about in it. My Brother-in-law and I still refer to these flakes in any beer as swinkels. Enough of the history. Light golden color with a moderate white head. Light floral and noble hops aroma with a small backdrop of pale malt. Start is lightly floral sweet with a later hops bite that keep so me of this sweetness in check. Fairly run of the mill.
Damburger Royal Pils;Galati, Romania;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Martens S.A.;***review from Sep 13, 2007*** My bottle has a big �DR� on it and the months for expiration are in roman numerals. Cracked the bottle in half like an egg and dumped it into my glass. The smell is bad right off the top as I can smell it from a foot away...a tendril of stink slithered into my nostril. Unfiltered stuff, large white rocky head that sticks around just above a skim that leaves minor chunky lacing. Odd coloured gold. Skunks live in my bottle. Now that they have left, I�m left with oversweet stuff and I guess what is supposed to be malts. At least the sweat aroma disappeared. Taste isn�t tasty. Sweet (kinda like a paperbag beer), cardboard, ick alcohol and unimpressive hops. Posibally chemicals too. Maybe lemon...that�s a big maybe. Mouthfeel is pretty rough with excessive carbonation and sour bitter finish. Comes across too thick to enjoy. Crap. Thanks Brad for the tick mark for Romania.
Damburger Royal Pils;Galati, Romania;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Martens S.A.;"""Wholly crap I think the family of skunks that lived in Beercronics bottle moved in to mine after he finished his. Massive skunk explosion when bottle was first opened I feel my condo will stink like this for a very long time. Beer pours a yellowy brown with mild haze a half inch cap was built up during the pour but quickly vanish into something that looked like a small piece of plastic floating on my beer. This beer looks like crap!!!! The stink of this beer is amazing tons of skunk, sour corn, and a wide variety of chemicals. What the hell this beer looks completely flat but is so overly carbonated it burns to drink and that in combination with its soft thin feel makes for a nasty drinking experience and I�m not even at the flavor yet. Vey sweet, fackly sweet in fact, it has a corn flavor but it�s a fake corn flavor. Malts taste dusty and there is a very out of place citrus flavor in the finish. This is just plain horrid its getting the dump into the sink. Bye bye crap!!!!! """

Damburger Royal Pils;Galati, Romania;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Martens S.A.;bottle - Pours pale yellow and fizzy with a one finger head. The aroma is cereal malt and a little hops.

I had no idea that it had only two ratings and that it's from a new country for me! Golden, typical looking pils with a big foamy head. Typical pilsner smell with a hint of grain that follows throughout. Seems a little off-balance; gimmee more hops! I only finished because I had already paid for it."

Triumph Pumpkin Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;Location: Draft at the Brewpub, Princeton, 11/17/13 Aroma: The nose is a touch dull, with pumpkin spices, malts, bread, and some mild fruit Appearance: It pours a clear darker orange color with a head and some good lacework Flavor: The spice comes out more in the flavor, but the components are pretty similar to the nose Palate: The body is medium, it drinks easily, and has a mild dryness to the finish Overall Impression: This is an alright example of a pumpkin spice beer, but it just feels a touch on the dull side, especially in the nose. Overall though, it is very drinkable.

Everards Equinox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask at The Roebuck, Leek (Titanic) A clear straw colour with a medium white head. Aroma of soapy lemon, grain, some biscuit, slight caramel and floral hops. Taste is similar of grain, lemon, subtle grass and floral hops. Light bodied and a soft carbonation. A clean, biscuity malt finish. A boring golden ale with slight grainy, biscuity overtones.

Everards Equinox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;On cask, poured into a nonic. The aroma is a mild apple juice / cider (due to a light spice character) with some light caramel notes. The beer is oily pale with a light, but dense white foam that has very light retention and lace. The taste is a blend of medium light bitter and sweet (perhaps more bitter than sweet). The watery texture has a mostly flat carbonation with a light body. Bread crust, pear, and light spice are the noticeable flavors on the palate with a late caramel note. The finish has an apple pie spice and bitter herb. It�s mostly clean with an aftertaste that�s kinda like an apple tart combined with pungent clove spice.
Everards Equinox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask Somers Town Coffee House. Pale yellow, slight haze, small ring of white head. Aroma is malt, card.

Everards Equinox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask at The Vaults, Knowle, Solihull. Clear light yellow pour with a broken thin white head and sticky lacing. Not much in the aroma, but a quite unusual slightly sour slightly bitter apple-like flavour, but without the acidity. Some bitterness sits on the palate for a short while, which encourages you to take another sip. A very refreshing ale that might benefit from being served a touch colder than mine was. I enjoyed it. My pint didn�t last long so I guess that�s a decent recommendation!
Everards Equinox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask at the Habberley social club, Kidderminster at 4.2%. Pours light gold with a small head. Aroma is grainy, light egg and a touch of lemon. Taste is grainy and straw, with a medium bitter finish.

Everards Equinox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Hand pulled at the Queen Victoria, Syston, Leicester. Pale coloured bitter, with a large and resistent white head. Slightly underwhelming flavour. It�s a standard sandy Bitter, with grainy malt, salty biscuit and some arrowroot biscuit. It�s OK. Very drinkable, but I don�t get much �Autumn� from it.
Altes Tramdepot Trappistenbier;Bern, Switzerland;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Altes Tramdepot;Whow ! we now have a trappist brewery in Switzerland :-) - reddish in colour with few foam but a nice lacing, candy sugar in the nose, flowery with some hints of metal, astringeant, sweet, soda-like impression, the finish is moderately malty with an unpleasant rancid touch - another unmatured and bad-made beer from this brewery.
Redruth 1793 Bitter;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Redruth;Canned crap. Colour is nice - autumnal red. The rest is appalling. Redruth is one hell of a pathetic brewery. They claim to be the 3rd oldest brewery in the UK with over 200 years of English brewing tradition. This beer tastes like it's been in the can that long. Mouthpuckeringly dreadful.

It does the trick, its dark and lightly opaque, lightly hoppy and lightly roasty sweet, with a German lager yeast behind. If you go to the Eagle's Nest you will probably try this.

Clear dark copper in the glass with a big foamy light beige head. Strange metallic sourness on the nose with malt in the background. Taste starts more malty, low roasted. Caramell and some sweetness.

Sonoran Double Trouble I2PA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Sampled at Strong beer fest.Mesa, AZ. Good dose of citrus hops on the nose. Glod body with white head. Dry citrus grapefruit peel flavor and some dry bitterness. Good double ipa. Will have to rerate this one sometime with full pint.
Sonoran Double Trouble I2PA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Sampled at the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild 2008 Strong Beer Fest, on February 17, at the Mesa Amphitheatre.
Sonoran Double Trouble I2PA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Mostly translucent, some yeasties, with oily webs cast over the top. Greased nose of tangerines and simcoe trademarks jump out of the gates. Some butter comb and toasted grain combinations provide a golden aromatic backbone for the beer. Hints of strawberry spruce intercede with welcomed interruption. Dry, bitter cotton edges with some peachy flavorings to provide a sweetness. Kiwi strawberry comes out more as it calms in the glass and in the mouth, especially as the tongue presses to the roof of the mouth and refuses to let the last of the sip drip down the back. Some butter and grease come through with the bitter patters is the finish, taking us through the multifaceted flavor approach that was a pleasurable palate adaptation throughout.
Sonoran Double Trouble I2PA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Bomber. Thanks Chris. The beer pours to a nice glowing golden body with a really creamy white head and nice lacing. The aroma is really good. Pineapple, mango, light spicy onions, citrus. The flavor is extremely hoppy up front and has a nice toasty back end. Grassy and piney hops, fruity, spruce. The palate is bitter and medium bodied.
Sonoran Double Trouble I2PA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Brew pours an iridescent gold color w/ a medium, semi creamy froth. Residual lacing is thin w/ a full canopy. Aroma is thick and creamy w/ dense caramel hops. Nice! Full nectar w/ creamy, residual effers. Big hops, big caramel malts, perfect balance. Very little grapefruit, mostly rind. I drink this brew in hopes of it never ending. It�s so lucious. It has everything in the right place in the right amounts. The finish is long and perfectly bittered by the citrus rind element. I just savor this brew. This is in my top two list. I actually want to say so much more about this brew. Like how it reminds me a certain part of a womans anatomy. But I have this overwhelming felling I�m being watched. I highly recommend this brew. I can�t wait til in on the retail market.
Sonoran Double Trouble I2PA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;"22oz bottle - version ""randled"" with simcoe before bottling. Pours slightly hazy medium yellow color with medium sized off white head that dissapates rather quickly. Aroma has a fair amount of citrusy, slightly piney hops, hint of apricot and honey. Flavor has a fair amount of malt presence, along with a significant amount of citrusy, grapefruity hops, slightly soapy. FInish is solidly bitter, a bit thin. A nice dIPA overall, though based on the earlier ratings, I don�t think this holds up to being bottled quite as well as it does on draft, especially the randle part of it. I mean, is there much point to using a randle on beer that you are going to bottle? Still good, but not amazing."
Sonoran Double Trouble I2PA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;draught at the Sonora restaurant. I�m surprised that I�m only the second one to rate this. floral, citrusy aroma...wow, that�s a lot of hops! Hazy orange colour. There is a slew of hops in this beer but it is in fact quite well balanced. very smooth. long lingering bitter finish. This is a truly awesome brew.
Sonoran Double Trouble I2PA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;"Cask @ Papago While at my favorite �watering hole�, Papago Brewing for the Chimay Promo, I noticed a new beer on Cask, Sonora Breweries �Double Trouble I2PA�, and I just knew it was going to be a great night for �Beer� sampling. As it was pulled from the cask, and into my waiting �Monks Mug�, it poured a deep pellucid amber, the head a creamy crown of white and as it ever so slowly diminished, the lace created was a silky fine sheet to conceal the glass. Oh my God that aroma of hops, wham right their at the front all flowery and sweet, lemon like in their crispness, with the malt to assist in letting you know that you�re about to sample a great beer. The start is rich in malt, sweet and a bit tart, the top also rich in its feel to the palate, then you get the full blunt force of hops that shock your taste buds from their quiescent state, to full alert in a split second, majestic, powerful, sensational, geez I just can�t find the right words to express the pleasing power of an �Imperial IPA.�. Finish is quite dry with never a hint of the 8.4 percent ABV, an amazing beer, from a long time favorite brewery, and for now only on cask and tap, I sure hope there�s a little more left when I go back on Saturday for �Papago�s Oktoberfest celebration. I guess a word of warning, this is a true ""Hop Head"" or ""Hop Lovers"" delight, and meant for those of us that crave the massive hop spiciness only found in imperial IPA�s."

Kazbegi Topadze Originaluri;Rustavi, Georgia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kazbegi;The aroma is not bad it�s just very sweet with toffee and a syrup element that seems stronger than the malt. The appearance is amber with a small short lived head. The flavor is like the aroma with a cardboard finish. The palate is thick. Overall I don�t really find it enjoyable or for that matter even a Pilsener.
Kazbegi Topadze Originaluri;Rustavi, Georgia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kazbegi;Bottle. Pours a deep goldenred body with thin head. Aroma is slightly fruity, light grain and yeast. Flavor is a light bitter, green pear, granny smith apple, yeasty taste. Light mouthfeel. Heavy bitter finish.
Kazbegi Topadze Originaluri;Rustavi, Georgia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kazbegi;This bottled brew from Tampa, FL poured a small sized head of foamy fine to medium sized off-white colored bubbles that left behind a very hazy dark yellow orange brown colored body and a fair lacing. The aroma was malty bready and slightly dirty sock. The mouth feel was tingly from start to finish. The flavor was malty hoppy and thick with the flavors. It was not like any Pilsener I had ever seen. It was more like an amber ale.
Kazbegi Topadze Originaluri;Rustavi, Georgia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kazbegi;Warm straw color with medium carbonation and some visible suspended floaties. Aroma of corn, buttery nuts, and light oxidation. Little hop character. Slick and sweet with abundant honey and corn syrup qualities. Mildly bitter with vague cedar notes. Bleh.
Kazbegi Topadze Originaluri;Rustavi, Georgia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kazbegi;Bottle. Off-white small head that quickly dissipated with no lacing, yeasty, murky, and a somewhat of a dark orange hue. Aroma was malty and toasty. Flavor was somewhat lightly bitter and uninviting. Smooth palate. Definitely unimpressed with this one.
Kazbegi Topadze Originaluri;Rustavi, Georgia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kazbegi;This is a beefed up version the regular Kazbegi. Same toast aroma/taste, but with somewhat oversweet malts and a bigger body. Touches of alcohol too. Rather have the regular Kazbegi.

Kazbegi Porter;Rustavi, Georgia;Porter;Kazbegi;Bottle. Will start by saying as loudly as possible that this is NOT a Porter. Closer to a dunkel. Pours dark brown with a pale tan head. malty aroma, kvas-like, brown bread. Flavours very bready too, with notes of toast. Rather good body for a lager beer, with decent oily texture. The only two Georgian beers I've tried so far are pretty decent!
Kazbegi Porter;Rustavi, Georgia;Porter;Kazbegi;500ml bottle. Pours dark brown colour. Moderate beige head. Malts, slight sourness, hints of burnt caramel, smell of kvass in the aroma. Notes of burnt caramel and roasted malts in the taste. Watery finish. Malts, bitterness and notes of burnt caramel in the aftertaste. Very light, kvass-like dark beer.

Kazbegi Porter;Rustavi, Georgia;Porter;Kazbegi;50cl bottle (5,5%) from Market Google, Stepansminda enjoyed at Hotel Kazbegi. Pours clear dark brown, almost chestnut colour, with a fair, off-white to beige head. Mild malty aroma with some lightly roasty notes, dark fruits and hints of caramel. Medium sweet with fairly low flavour intensity and not much bitterness to speak of. Fairly mediocre and watery porter, but still drinkable.
Kazbegi Porter;Rustavi, Georgia;Porter;Kazbegi;I like it. Kind of watery and pretty sweet for a porter. Is it really a porter? Mouthfeel of a thick Coke. If you gave it to a child they probably wouldn�t recoil the way they would if it were a pint of bitter, I haven�t tried this of course. In Georgia this is definitely one of the best beers, I�ve tried a lot, and although this is pipped from the top spot by Shavi Lomi White, and possibly the microbrews of Burgio, it could be a contender for second or third place. Cheap too. Nice unfashionable label. I�d like to drink it on draught but haven�t seen it available in the city where the where the macro-German brews are gonna be ubiquitous in 10 years time. Also, the head lasts, we all like a long head.
Kazbegi Porter;Rustavi, Georgia;Porter;Kazbegi;500ml bottle from Smart in Tbilisi. 5.5%. Pours hazy dark brown with a large beige head. Aroma is caramel, chocolate, very light roasted malt. Taste is syrup sweetness, caramel and cocoa.
Kazbegi Porter;Rustavi, Georgia;Porter;Kazbegi;Bottle. Medium body, caramel, honeyish oxidised. Subtle sweetness, notes of liquorice. Not bad, particularly the oxidisation turned out rather well.
Kazbegi Traditsiuli (Traditional);Rustavi, Georgia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kazbegi;11.2 oz bottle, Killearn Liquors, Tallahassee, Fl. Pours a light to medium orange with a decent sized white spritzy head. Aroma is slighlty spicy with some bready notes. Flavor has some muted cinammon, some yeasty notes and a of biscuity maltiness. Finish is slighlty off - turns a bit metallic and cardboard like. Mouthfeel is a tad on the stinging side. Had better from the breakaway republics.
Kazbegi Traditsiuli (Traditional);Rustavi, Georgia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kazbegi;Hazy cinnamon brown, white head, bad label. Malty grain aroma. Sweetish dark lager, lightly tinny, very little hops, toasted malt flavor. Quick, slightly stale grain finish with no residual bittering. Very flat. Hell of a trek, half way around the world, for a mediocre beer.
Kazbegi Hunter;Rustavi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kazbegi;With lots of Georgian food, it was clean and crisp and went well with stew. On its own suspect it would fade quickly, but it stood up well to a meal. Quite dry, not much aroma, a bit thin. Oj.
Kazbegi Hunter;Rustavi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kazbegi;I will say this. It was better than I thought it would be. Once I saw the green bottle, I was like oh great here comes more crap. What I did like about this beer, was the notes of caramel malt and hop and roast. It did have some good qualities to it.
Kazbegi Hunter;Rustavi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kazbegi;Not often you get to have a Georgian brew, so this was a surprise. I enjoyed it even though it was a lager. It had a subdued aroma. The appearnce was a nice golden amber. Flavor was a bit caramel, nutty, sweet and spicy. It was pretty smooth. I would recommend it if you can actually find it. Again it�s a lager so keep that in mind.
Kazbegi Hunter;Rustavi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kazbegi;Bottled (4.8%) Clear deep golden, brief flocky head. Quite neutral with vague notes of caramel, apple and butter.

Poured a medium a and slightly hazy amber color with virtually no head. Bottle labeled 28 01 04 (best before or bottled on date?). Aromas of light fruits and citrus. Tastes of fruits, lemons and caramel. Medium sweet with a thinner body. Better than I expected for a Pale Lager.
Kazbegi Hunter;Rustavi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kazbegi;Thanks to tomdecapolis for this... Appears a light orange gold with virtually no head and no lacing left behind. Smell is fruity with a bit of a adjunct lager smell. Overall pleasant with some fruit salad and citrus aromas dominating. Taste is of the same aromas with a mellow taste with the same dominance dominating. Mouthfeel is decent. A bit of a corn syrup feel hanging around but not bad. Drinkability is pretty good. I would drink this again, no problem.
Kazbegi Hunter;Rustavi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kazbegi;Poured an amber color with a thin off white head that left no lacing.

Kazbegi Hunter;Rustavi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kazbegi;Smells pretty bad, looks pretty bad, too. Tastes a little better than it looks and smells, but not too much better.
Kazbegi Hunter;Rustavi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kazbegi;I found it sweet and with a slight biterness. It reminds me of an ESB. Not bad but not good either.
Chumleys Pumpkin Ale;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Chumleys;New for Fall, 2003. Contract brewed by Chelsea Brewing Co., but oddly this beer isn't served AT the Chelsea Brewing Co. or at Greenwich Brewing. Very spicy and reeks of pumpkin. Tastes quite spicy, too, with tons of flavor. Absolutely fantastic and by far the best (and most flavorful) pumpkin ale I've ever had. No skimping on ingredients here.
Bell's Batch 6000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bell's Brewery;Still hanging on...oxidation actually added complexity. Classic aged barley wine flavor with fading hops and fruity, tangy malt. A touch of toast in the finish.
Bell's Batch 6000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bell's Brewery;Bottle. Nothing like a 13 year old barley wine! Aroma is only slightly oxidized. Huge caramel, brown sugar and dark fruit. Tastes a little more stale and papery. Moderately sweet with loads of dark fruit. I bet I would�ve loved this fresh. Still pretty good considering the age.
Bell's Batch 6000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bell's Brewery;12 oz bottle shared with Jason and Brian. The pour is a dark amber brown with a light tan head that falls down quickly with a couple spots of lace. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy. There is a good malt present but the hops are surprisingly strong. Good cherry and fruits. The flavor is excellent. There is a nice hoppiness and a strong fruit character. There is a light booze and and strong malt and caramel. The mouth feel is a little thin but well carbonated. There is a slick finish and it's quick fading. Good barley wine for sure ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bell's Batch 6000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bell's Brewery;12 oz. bottle, sent from Glouglouburp (thanks a lot, Dany), pours a deep dark mahogany with a small beige / tan head. Nose brings out rich notes of caramel, dark fruits and some light oxidation - which is no surprise given the age of this thing. Flavour is rich and deep, with loads of caramel, dark dried fruits, brown sugar, and alcohol. Extremely well-balanced, without any cloying sweetness. This is very bold and decadent. Not really any oxidation on this at all - very surprising, given this is 10+ years old! This sure has stood the test of time. Wonderful stuff.
Bell's Batch 6000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bell's Brewery;Bottle kindly shared by gunnar. Hazy deep ruby orange body with a light brown rim.

Columbus Brewing 15th Anniversary IPA;Columbus, Ohio, United States;IPA;Columbus Brewing Company;Took this home from the brewpub in a growler. Nose of pine, perfume and citrus. The brew pours a cloudy walnut with caramel highlights. The firm tan head is creamy, fully lasting and has good lacing. The flavor is one dimensional. I didn't get any caramel sweetness as the commercial description would advertise. Mostly spicy hops bitterness. The medium body is soft and dry. The finish feels very astringent. More than decent, but I was expecting more. I am curious as to the gravity, because this one hit me pretty hard.
Columbus Brewing 15th Anniversary IPA;Columbus, Ohio, United States;IPA;Columbus Brewing Company;Winter seasonal beer is a clear, medium amber colored I.P.A. Thin white head with mild floral hop aroma. Slight caramel, but not really a factor. Good carbonation with a medium body tastes spicy with yeast character. Hops come out in the end with a dry, moderately bitter finish.
Columbus Brewing 15th Anniversary IPA;Columbus, Ohio, United States;IPA;Columbus Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub. This brew is a dark amber color with a thin light beige head. Thin and slow lacing. The aroma is mostly tart hops with a little malt and caramel. Medium-bodied and tangy with a decent hops presence throughout. The flavor has a light floral character as well. The finish is on the dry side with a strong hops flavor along with a little malt sneaking in here and there. This is one of CBC's stronger offerings and I hope they bring it back sometime.
Sly Fox Oktoberfest;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sly Fox Brewing Company;This is my second favorite Octoberfest beer (Samuel Adams is number one). Good taste and good color.

The flavor is lovely - sweet, malty with notes of straws, caramel, roasted bread, and yeast - very complex. It ends on a malty dryness, but has almost no bitterness. A very good beer.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Draft - Light toasted roast. Rich white head and a clear deep brown head. Toasted notes and light malt sweetness. Not quite a Black and Tan, but a nice shwarzbier.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Draught at the brewpub. Pours a clear deep orange-amber with a spare creamy off-white head. Very mild aroma (like all their beers) of pale malt. Watery flavour of pale malt, fruit, light hops and a touch of sourness. Average bodied. Just O.K.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Draught. At the brewpub. Slightly hazy walnut colour with a solid white creamy head, even left some nice lace draping behind. Dry roast caramel aroma with slight dry herbal bitterness. Slightly acidic green fruit taste, roasty, but rather thin, not much bitterness, but so thin it�s not sweet either. Watery, slightly astringent and still mouthfeel, with a little dry acidity in the linger. Ehhh.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;At the brewpub. Dark copper, creamy white head. Mild malt aroma. Taste is decent - lots of malt over a light tingly body. Not a classic black and tan but with no stout present, this is not a bad option from this lager-dominated brewpub.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Dark copper color. Decent white cap and good lacing. malty fruity atoma light grassy hops. Smooth mellow character, malty-toasty some hop bite and a light roast taste in the finish. A good sessioner.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;on tap at the brewpub. served amber with a little tan head. at first there were no aromas from this one. some breadiness came through after some warming. a little dark sweetness in the flavour. thin with some good lager malt meets roasted brown caramel flavour. not my fav of the night but not a bad pint for #3.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;On tap at the brew pub. Decent ruby brown colour with a small off-white head. Aroma is of wort and barley, mild roast and caramel. Not really your typical brown ale. Flavour is very similar to every other beer at this brew pub, it has that bready/worty house character that they all share (including the Gold Crown beers brewed on premise), which is quite a tasty and nice smelling character, it�s just weird that all their beers seem so very similar. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but it seemed more like a Dunkel or an American Dark Lager than anything else, although I guess using ale yeast makes it roughly a brown ale. I�d order another glass of this again, it is pretty tasty.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Draught at the hotel- Pours a ruby/brownish body.Head is just off white and sticks around a while. Brown bread, rye, some smoke in the nose, with roasted malts appearing as it warms. Semi sweet nutty flavour profile is backed with some soft hops bitterness, caramel malts, bread, and a bit of a spice. A touch thin on the finish, but that is a minor complaint. Good.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;[359-20070623] Tap @ Lion Restaurant (Waterloo, ON). Lightly smoked yeast aroma. Clear, dark brown red body with a long-lasting creamy white head and some lacing. Flavour continues lightly smoked yeast with light generic vegetables. Medium body. Drinkably smooth for a brown ale but has more interesting brothers.
Lion Brewery Black & Tan;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Watery as heck, and odd bitterness and balance to it. Not bad per se but a bit off kilter, it feels like an awkward first dance at prom. Not unpleasant but a bit hard to wrap your head around.
Kingston Magic Dragon Hemp Ale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Kingston Brewing Co.;Tasted rather tangy and fruity which I thought, hmm, helluva yeast strain going on there, if a bit strange. The bartend said they ADD fruit to this, I forget what but I notice fruit acidity and esters overtop a basically english ale style. Okay but no refills.
Kingston Magic Dragon Hemp Ale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Kingston Brewing Co.;Dark amber body with golden highlights, small off white head. Aroma has moderate hop presence, light fruity notes with an intertwined character that I presume to be the hemp influence. Pleasant flavour with moderate bitterness and muted fruit notes. Pleasantly quaffable but the increased alcohol and astringent bitterness as it warms take away from it a bit. Perhaps it did not pair well with my burger that came mid glass? Average palate.
Kingston Magic Dragon Hemp Ale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Kingston Brewing Co.;Golden ale with a light white head. Sweet honey aroma, with a rather sweet malt taste with fruity esters, almost solvent like. No bitterness. Pineapple notes. Medium bodied with oily mouthfeel.

Aroma has notes of caramel, grain, slight floral/earthy, and a bit of creamy sweetness. Taste is balanced with notes of sweet caramel, slightly toasted grains, spicy/earthy, and a short, creamy ending. Medium body and carbonation. Clean in the mouth with a soft, creamyness. Overall a nice, easy drinking, everyday beer. Would be good on a warm, summer day. The can smells like a brewery when you mash in. Yum!
Yukon Chilkoot;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yukon Brewing;From a 12 oz bottle. Pours a clear gold with an off white head. Bready nose. Flavors of toast. Smooth clean finish.
Yukon Chilkoot;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yukon Brewing;Rather typical lager with okay hints of malt in the flavour profile. Smooth and not cloying, looks okay. Nothing too exciting but a reliable lager and rather nice, easily drinkable in large quantities.
Yukon Chilkoot;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yukon Brewing;Can into pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden straw colour with a small white head. Aroma is malt and a little corn. Taste is malt with just enough bitterness to balance the sweetness. It�s an ok lager.

Yukon Chilkoot;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yukon Brewing;Pretty unremarkable. This looks and smells like a generic lager. Tastes about the same but there�s a bit of surprising sweetness and I feel like this was made with really nice water. Other than that pretty meh

Il Vicino Panama Joe's Coffee Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);"Sampled August 2014 Arrives from the tap with a thin, light brown tinged head. The beer is a dark, almost black color. The aroma has a huge, roasted, smooth, coffee note to it that leans towards roasted nuts, just a touch of dark cocoa, burnt caramelized notes, and just a big, expressive coffee character. Somewhat light bodied, but the beer has a definite sweetness to it, as well as a bit of viscous, palate coating character; the beer is dangerously drinkable for its strength. The coffee character is the dominant note here with a lingering, roasted nutty note, lots of up front roasted coffee character, an almost Kahlua like flavor richness, touches of dark cocoa, a burnt caramelized malt richness. The base beer is not overly noticeable, but instead plays a supporting, necessary, balancing role to the dominant coffee character. This is a nice example of a coffee beer, the coffee is definitely the dominant note here, but it is not overwhelming, despite dominating the character of this beer."
Il Vicino Panama Joe's Coffee Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);(bottle) black colour with a frothy deep beige head. aroma of toasted malts and ash, slightly cardboardy, with a hint of pepper, some light herbal hops and dark chocolate. flavour is more of the same, toasted malts, ash and a hint of fudge, with some more dark chocolate and a light-bitter finish. medium-bodied with average carbonation.

Il Vicino Panama Joe's Coffee Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Beer #19 of NM 100. A solid coffee stout. A little bit vegetal. Nicely roasty. Nice chocolate in the finish.
Il Vicino Panama Joe's Coffee Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);This 2013 GABF Gold Winner presents a beautiful yet subtle aroma of toasted almonds, cocoa powder, vanilla and freshly cut leather. The appearance is jet black and opaque with a tan head of velvety, tightly packed foam. The beer has a roasted, malty, bitter sweet chocolate flavor profile. Only a hint of hops are apparent as is appropriate. This beer is a complex, finely crafted example of the style. It�s no wonder it just took down Silver at the 2014 World Beer Cup.
Il Vicino Panama Joe's Coffee Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Pours french roast coffee black, huge aroma - fresh-ground coffee and melted dark chocolate - balanced carbonation to carry all the flavors through to the unsweetened chocolate finish. This won a Gold at the GABF in 2013 and is well deserved.
Il Vicino Panama Joe's Coffee Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);On tap at the Il Vicino Brewery Canteen (formerly the Tap Room). Pours a dark brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of light coffee, peanut butter, and roasted malt. Flavor of peanut butter/nutty coffee, smooth milky palate. More of a nutty/roasty coffee beer vs. a coffee grounds beer. Perhaps not the ultimate coffee beer but I love anytime a local brewpub makes one! Awesome stuff! 8/4/8/4/15 [3.9/5]
Il Vicino Panama Joe's Coffee Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);tap at albuquerque location-pours about 90% black, more like a porter. small off-white head along glass edge. faint roasty aroma with some slight expresso notes. flavors are mostly coffee, smoke and roasted with some dark chocolate notes. Slightly over-carbonated and slightly sour. needs some work
Il Vicino Panama Joe's Coffee Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Dark but translucent burgundy. Head looks like steamed milk. Does not look like a stout at all. Fresh and interesting aroma of fruit and light coffee. Tastes like a mocha-raspberry chocolate bar. Totally fails to achieve its purported style, but enjoyable and tasty anyway. Much closer to a porter, in fact I've had many fuller bodied porters.
River Horse Belgian Freeze Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;River Horse Brewing Company;Something in the taste of this beer was not right. You could taste the underlying Belgian yeast flavor but for some reason there was a strong flavor that did not sit right with me. Maybe just a bad bottle of beer. Who knows. Too bad!
River Horse Belgian Freeze Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;River Horse Brewing Company;Draft at The Bards. Deep foggy amber pour with off-white foam. Slightly medicinal aroma. Big medium caramel malts with some spice. Bread crusts. Figs. Chestnuts. Dates. Prunes. Raisins. Tangelos. Cinnamon. Nutmeg. Molasses. Dense and heavy. Broad palate but I have tasted much better in this style.
River Horse Belgian Freeze Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;River Horse Brewing Company;I poured it from the bottle into a glass. It pours reddish brown with a beige head. The aroma is dark fruit, cherries, spice, bread, and alcohol. The taste is the same with the Belgian yeast taste. The alcohol is noticeable. It drinks even heavier than it really is. This is a decent beer. You can do better with this style though.

Aroma of Christmas spices, pipe tobacco and faint citrusy notes. The mouthfeel is just a bit thin - my only complaint.

Coronado Mocha Joes Imperial Stout;Coronado, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coronado Brewing Company;(Draft: O�Brien�s in San Diego, CA) I like stouts and porters brewed with coffee, but I think there comes a point where it can become too much of a good thing. This beer is just massive coffee and roast, but it�s very dry, and so the prominent bitterness in the finish is a bit out of balance. And the strong notes of green pepper just aren�t terribly enjoyable. The nose is also straight black coffee, with some spice and green pepper. Medium to full bodied, so it could use a bit more viscosity. Very dark brown color and fully opaque except at the edges. Light brown head fades away to nothing very quickly. Not a bad brew, but below average for Imperial Stouts.
Coronado Mocha Joes Imperial Stout;Coronado, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coronado Brewing Company;Pours a deep brown/black hue with a halo of a tan head. Aromas of coffee, vanilla. Very light . Flavors of soap, light floral, a little of the typical coffee, chocolate.

Coronado Mocha Joes Imperial Stout;Coronado, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coronado Brewing Company;This beer was had on tap at Obriens brewpub in San Diego. This beer pours a brownish color with hints of blackness to it, a thin tanned head whcih dissipated rather quickly, and a small sheath of lacing. The aroma is coffee, mocha, chocolate and other roasty hints. The flavor likewise, is full-bodied, thick and dry. Grainy chocolates, vanilla, cocoa, and mocha make up the flavor...sweet dominated, but trust me this isnt a bad thing! Very coffee-ish and trust me, I love coffee. Almost caffienated to some extent. My only knock is the excessively dry finish and the fact that mocha stouts are hard to finish...they get monotonous after the first 8-10 ounces. Overall though very nice.
Coronado Mocha Joes Imperial Stout;Coronado, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coronado Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Coffee-like aroma. Thin for this style. Black in color. Roasted flavor, but just not thick enough for this style. I�m a little concerned that the server mixed this one up with the porter.
Coronado Mocha Joes Imperial Stout;Coronado, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coronado Brewing Company;Black with a solid brown head on it. Has a candyish chocolate feel to the aroma. Has kind of a plastic chocolate vebe to it and possibly some hops which seem sort of out of place. Regardless, this is a solid imperial stout, nice work.
Coronado Mocha Joes Imperial Stout;Coronado, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coronado Brewing Company;dark colored with a dark tan head...dark chocolate, raisin, salt and a tad coffee in the aroma...deep dark chocolate fudge flavors with tangy coffee bean and hazelnut..its got a deep darkness to it..which is impressive for a brewpub, oh yes...a tad oxidized in the finish..but no biggie..still quite impressive Yo!
Coronado Mocha Joes Imperial Stout;Coronado, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coronado Brewing Company;"Visited the Coronado Brewpub for the first time and had the beer sampler. The ""special"" beer was their Imperial Stout. The waiter said it was a new brew. The color is black as night with a wonderful milk chocolate colored head and good lacing. Aroma is roasted, coffee, and chocolate. The flavor is coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt in excellent proportions. Nice medium dry and bitter finish. A very good Imperial Stout. Took home a growler."

Coronado Oktoberfest;Coronado, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Coronado Brewing Company;On-tap at the brewpub.

Coronado Oktoberfest;Coronado, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Coronado Brewing Company;(Draft: Coronado Brewing Co. in Coronado, CA) This is one of the darkest Oktoberfest beers I�ve ever seen. It pours a medium to dark brown, but is barely translucent, and is topped by a light tan head which fades quickly to nothing. It smells sugary and lightly malty, but isn�t very inviting. Flavorwise, this is an American style Oktoberfest all the way, being sweet, lightly roasty, moderately hoppy, but with a fairly soapy finish. Medium in body with a very carbonated mouthfeel. Burps are extremely soapy and make my eyes water from all the carbonation. I�d rate this O-fest well below average for the style.
Coronado Oktoberfest;Coronado, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Coronado Brewing Company;A typical oktoberfest. Coppery red color with small off-white head. Aroma and flavors are slightly metallic with a light bitterness on the swallow. Body was slightly sticky with a long finish.
Fiddler Tarwebock;Den Haag, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;De Haagsche Bierbrouwerij;On tap at Proeflokaal, Delft. Nice caramel, milky and soft hops in the aroma. It looks real great. Even the waiter was complementing the brewer for making such a easy-to-tap-stil-looking-good beer. Ruby color, beige creamy head, good lace. In the aroma again caramel and milk but also butterscotch, licorice and a soft bitter finish. Very smooth, very easy going.
Fiddler Tarwebock;Den Haag, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;De Haagsche Bierbrouwerij;Had a pint of this one at the Brouwcafe itself. Very nice looking beer. Smells good too, little yeasty. Tastes not like a bock, but nice anyway.

Fiddler Tarwebock;Den Haag, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;De Haagsche Bierbrouwerij;PINT-bokbier 2003: Very cloudy brown color, short creamy head. Initial aroma and taste i described were: Creamy, bitter, coffee, chocolat. I referred to the Guinness even. But after half a glass of this odd brew, i discovered a more fruity aroma, and the notes in my little book changed to: strong berry, grapes. Overall, quite enjoyable.

Urthel Parlus Magnificum (was: Vlaemse Bock);Ruiselede, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Urthel (Swinkels Family Brewers);Pours a murky brown copper color, with a small head and nice lacing. Lots of sediment floating around in the pour. The aroma is caramel, malt, yeast, honey, and a hint of dark fruit. Taste is malty, woody, and creamy, with a hint of alcohol on the finish. The taste is well rounded, with a earthy character that lingers in the mouth. Good stuff.
Urthel Parlus Magnificum (was: Vlaemse Bock);Ruiselede, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Urthel (Swinkels Family Brewers);"The first new Urthel since they are brewed at Koningshoeven and the bottle and label style changed; apparently identified here with Urthel Bock Exclusief, but I doubt this was precisely the same beer, as the latter mentioned 7% ABV on the label and this one 7.5% ABV, apart from - admittedly subtle - differences in flavour. Anyway, this beer is a rich dubbel with a creamy but rather thin and opening, yet stable head and deep, clear burgundy colour. Aroma of dates, pear, blackcurrant, coriander, cloves, medium dry sherry, brown sugar, �speculoos�, pepper, honey. Candied fruits in the mouth, sweet but not in a sugary or cloying way, drying coriander, pleasant finish with soft herbal hops and some warming alcohol. Well balanced and very enjoyable, like most Urthels."

Brooklyn Sustainable Organic Porter;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Pleasant enough.

Glazen Toren Scotch;Erpe-Mere, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kleinbrouwerij De Glazen Toren;(Beer is based upon a historic recipe by the defunct Aalst brewery Burny Bros.) Tasted very young without refermentation. Deep brown with amber shine, no head. Nose gives caramel, some hops, liquorice, brown candi sugar. Taste is liquorice again, very outspoken, dark malts and ending in very typical caramel taste. Medium bodied. Nice try, quite sweet but it has a true historical ring to it.
Heavyweight Hammered Monk;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Pours brown with a tannish head. Smells of nutmeg, figs, raisins, grapes and port wine. Tastes of chocolate, nutmeg and a small hint of ginger. Very good, but this does not taste like a quad, but rather a very good standard Belgian ale.
Heavyweight Hammered Monk;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Heavyweight Brewing Company;The sweet candy sugar and fruity notes of a Belgian Ale blend seemlessly with the dark chocolate and bitter coffee flavors of an Imperial Stout to form one incredible beer. The end result reminds me of a bittersweet fruity dark mocha chocolate bar. Wonderful.
Heavyweight Hammered Monk;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Heavyweight Brewing Company;I thought this beer was so fantastic that I forgot to rate it last month. Drank too much of it I guess. This beer really had a neat flavor - a blend of belgian strong ale and imperial porter. Spices and chocolate-coffee. Who knew they'd give such a smooth, rich beer together? I really with I could get my hands on some more of this.
Heavyweight Hammered Monk;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Apparently they brewed a belgian style quad. and decided to blend in a bit of their Imperial Porter, and boy does it make for one good beer - it has the caramel, candy-ish, dark fruit flavors of the belgian ale, coupled with the bitter-sweet chocolate notes of the porter - this makes an overall taste that is something like candied plums and chocolate covered cherries - a courageous experiment, and quite a success at that.
Copper Canyon Big Oak Barleywine;Southfield, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Served in a snifter, great appearance actually, nice 2 inch head that lasted for a long time. Deep brown/black, lots of lacing. Aroma is quite hoppy and has tons of alcohol. Begins somewhat soft and sweet, though medium acidic. Lots of hops jump in, cascades? I think so. As it warms, the malt flavor dies off and the hops flavor dominates and adds a very bitter element. At this point it would be a decent barley, but the more it warms, the more the alcohol comes out. Has a huge acidic, bitter sharp resiny alcohol flavor that completely detracts from the flavor. Malt is nowhere to be found now. Still, decent body on it, dosent water down badly, but just way way way too much alcohol. Needs some hops variation as well. Not complex.
Johansson's Hoodlehead IPA;Westminster, Maryland, United States;IPA;Johansson's Dining House;Sampler at brewery. Old school hoppy pale ale. Thicker, lightly carbonated body. Very soft feeling beer.

Johansson's Hoodlehead IPA;Westminster, Maryland, United States;IPA;Johansson's Dining House;Draft. Cloudy amber, thin head. Nice floral hop aroma. Medium palate, balanced. Bitterness, doesn�t overpower. Good IPA esp. For food.

The flavor is grapefruit, caramel, tea and pine. Bitterness is a bit rough and chunky. Medium body is round with moderate carbonation.
Johansson's Hoodlehead IPA;Westminster, Maryland, United States;IPA;Johansson's Dining House;Pint at the brewery. 30-40% opaque, color is red-tinged amber. Soppy, globular spotted lacing on the glass, but the beer-head interface dies rather quickly, leaving a thick ring of spotty lacing on the glass but no head at all. Hoppy c-note nose, centers around some grapefruit, lemon and mandarin orange hop scents, some metallic notes and cream in there as well, but overall it seems a bit consumed by a very rough homebrew-ish yeast quality. Flavor-wise you can pick it up even more, with a earthy, gritty doughy texture. Can�t complain too much, though, since overall it actually tastes good � fruit, some honey, some oily (not grassy) hops. Wet and slick and oily on the palate, finishing with more honey, sweet orange and pine hop flavors, although again it�s a little too heavy with muddy yeast.
Johansson's Hoodlehead IPA;Westminster, Maryland, United States;IPA;Johansson's Dining House;Draft at the brewpub, July 2006. A hazy orange beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet with light notes of fruit and hops, the hops also giving it light notes of grass, and lemon. The flavor is nicely fresh hoppy on a good caramel and malt back ground. The alfa acids from the hops bites lightly in the tongue.
Johansson's Hoodlehead IPA;Westminster, Maryland, United States;IPA;Johansson's Dining House;Tap. A nice cloudy straw color. Very hoppy up front with a nice faint finish. A very good IPA for a very decent price at the bar.

Harviestoun Old Engine Oil Special Reserve;Alva, Scotland;Old Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;11.2oz bottle that I am pretty sure is a 2004. Pours black and still, not overly thick in body and I had to stop pouring with a couple of fingers left to keep quite a few chunks out of my glass. Caramel, wheat bread, leather, tobacco, wet cardboard, hints of peat and raisins. Very faint signs of carbonation and a body that is lighter for the appearence yet has a syurpy feel. Cola, wet cardboard, peat, caramel, boozey oak, prune with an aspartame finish. Don�t think my neglecting this one for so long improved it in any way.
Harviestoun Old Engine Oil Special Reserve;Alva, Scotland;Old Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Bottled in 2002. Pour is deep still brown with a faint purple tint to it. No head, this is still now. Aroma is really really rich and velvety with tons of dark fruit, raisin, plum, light spice, brown sugar, light chocolate, and very little if any oxidation. Flavor is crazy sweet up front with a hint of tartness that follows. Then notes of dark fruit slip in quickly before a long lightly smoky coffee finish. Bitter chocolate and coffee linger for a long time. Very interesting and quite complex. But weird.

Barley and Hops Oktoberfest;Frederick, Maryland, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;I enjoyed this quality beer at the 2006 Frederick Oktoberfest on draft out of the bucket I purchased. The aroma was powerfully rich, and with caramel and roasty sensations. It had a dark amber color and only a thin head. The body was medium with an almost lively carbonation level. Definitely a beer that fit the occasion!
Barley and Hops Oktoberfest;Frederick, Maryland, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;Just sampled from 2006 Brewfest in Union Mills, MD. Nothing too much going on here. This was the first sample I had for the day and it is unfortunately rough around the edges. Mild gritiness and preemptive alcohol bite make this offering less than its capable of.
Barley and Hops Oktoberfest;Frederick, Maryland, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;2004 Edition... This beer rocks!... One of the best Marzens I�ve ever had. Beautiful, crystal clear, copper lager with a small, creamy, white head. The nose and flavor have huge notes of caramel, toffee, clover, black pepper, earthy hops and warm, Autumnal alcohol. Medium to full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and lively carbonation.

Dinkel-Lager Pils;Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauhaus Dinkel-Lager;Light colored, just a bit hazy lager from this brand new brewery. Just a bit creamy aroma. Harsh hopbitter flavor with just a bit of yeast. Nice place here, loads of wood, aluminium, copper and steel in an old textile factory building.

Feral Monty's Mild;Baskerville, Australia;Mild Ale;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Orange amber, clear, hoppy nose. I found this to be a full-flavoured midstrength in a style similar to Rogers by Little Creatures, but just not quite achieving the same level of quality. Still among the top 3 midstrengths I�ve tried (the others being Little Creatures and Grand Ridge).
Feral Monty's Mild;Baskerville, Australia;Mild Ale;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);The responsible beer from Feral. Mid strength and with an appearance like a Rogers I expected as much from his one. what I got was a reasonably dumbed-down version of this style. Some reasonable toffee like notes and some countering hops this just struck me as the designated driver�s beer.
Feral Monty's Mild;Baskerville, Australia;Mild Ale;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);On tap at brewery: Medium amber copper clear colour. Musty yeasty stale hop with touch of caramel malt aroma. Medium thin medium carb body. Medium floral hop bitter start moving to sweerer malt middle and dry bitter finish. It seems like they just felt they could brew anything ordinary mid-strength to aleviate their social conscience.
Feral Monty's Mild;Baskerville, Australia;Mild Ale;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Light brown/amber colour, medicinal butterscotch and chalky taste, it was my least favourite out of the feral bunch. At least it was in a clean glass this time.

Ceeps Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceeps Brew Pub;2011-09-02. Crisp golden yellow. Nice foamy white head. Grainy lightly cream corn aroma gives way to straw, floral buttercup hops. 6+ Flavour has a decent amount of bitterness to it, floral hop character. Average palate. Significantly better than expected! Must have improved a lot? On tap at Barney�s, London
Ceeps Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceeps Brew Pub;On tap at the CEEPS Very light pale yellow typical Canadian bar Draught reminds me of the mens room or the bastion. Just fill the table with 10 cent draughts
Ceeps Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceeps Brew Pub;Draught. With MrManning at the Ceeps, natch. Very pale, flat-looking yellow, no head or bubbles. Sweet diactyl and grain aroma - thin, not promising. Taste is yer basic macro-ish Canadian pale lager - sugary, stale grain, enough cloying diactyl caramel to make me leave about 1/3 of it in the glass - watery yet syrupy, pretty flat, sugary and a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. Not on to be proud of - still better than Labatt Blue or most Steelbacks though.
Ceeps Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceeps Brew Pub;On tap at the brewpub. First of all, let me say that I was going into this fully prepared for one of the worst beers ever, and I was suprisingly shocked that it was actually decent. Pours a sparkling gold body topped by a thin white head, that disappears real fast. Aroma is faint in every aspect, but not offensive. Hops, grassy notes, and some sort of spice? Decent. Taste is good, bitter, hoppy, slight corn though, which was a tad disappointing. Clean crisp finish though, bitter aftertaste, and a decent bite to it. Ceeps lager (Mustang Ale) isn�t actually that bad.
Ceeps Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceeps Brew Pub;This is god awful stuff. Smells and tastes like crap. The only redeeming feature is that it�s cheap.

Harviestoun American Red;Alva, Scotland;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harviestoun Brewery;Hoppy, hoppy and hoppy. Like an enhanced Timothy Taylor Landlord great b itself, just to savour.
Harviestoun American Red;Alva, Scotland;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harviestoun Brewery;I am afraid I have never had a genuine American Red beer, so I don't know how authentic this is. However, I did not seem very red to me - more like a pale amber. Otherwise, no complaints here. Fruit, malt & hops in excellent balance with a nice clean dryish finish. It stood from a number of other beers sampled in the same session at the Market Porter that were notably unbalanced by too much underlynig sweetness. This undeniably has sweetness, but it is very nicely counterpointed by other characteristics. Handpump, Market Porter, London SE1, October 2003.
Harviestoun American Red;Alva, Scotland;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harviestoun Brewery;Fresh @ Dog & Bone, Gillingham. More amber orange than red. Slightly sticky sweet, smooth malt flavour, like an American Pale - and with the hop rush that would accompany an American Pale. Excellent dry, tingly finish. Quality & balance & taste throughout. Served in good condition. Nice one!

Redstone Black Raspberry Nectar;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Redstone Meadery;Sweet raspberry mead. Has a light funk to it, but mostly dominated by the fruit. Tried with Emma at Growler USA in 2018.
Redstone Black Raspberry Nectar;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Redstone Meadery;I was looking forward to trying this mead. However, it has a funky flavor, almost as though the fermentation process was too hot, or the mead wasn't aged long enough. It would be interesting to see what flavor profile this mead would if it sat for a year or two.
Redstone Black Raspberry Nectar;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Redstone Meadery;On tap at Brix. Light raspberry color. Aroma is intense raspberry. Taste is muted from the smell. It's solid.
Redstone Black Raspberry Nectar;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Redstone Meadery;Super fruity and sweet mead. The berries pop, but it almost takes away the meadiness of it all. Fun and easy and bubbly.

Molson Carling Ice;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This stuff smells and tastes like cheap beer. Does this surprise anyone? If so, ha, you�re dumb. It�s got a bit of foamy head and is appropriately clear. It�s hoppy--no, I�m just kidding, it�s not hoppy. It is a little bit too sweet and full bodied w/ high carbonation. You can drink it. I give it a pass.

Brewer's Art Scarlet Fever;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;The Brewer's Art;As a RU student, this beer brought me back to the ol raritan.

Brewer's Art Scarlet Fever;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;The Brewer's Art;Brewers Art kegs keep showing up at my local watering hole (Grey Lodge Pub). I don't believe Brewers Art brewed this Sour Ale to quaff while watching college football, and maybe that's why it did not score high with me.

Whale Tail Golden Ale;Old Orchard Beach, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Whale Tail Brewing;On draught at the brewpub, 5/21/2005 with Muzzlehatch. This golden ale appears a hazy copper-amber with a small white head receding to cover, low lacing. Light pale malt in the nose, some honey and almond croissant notes.

Angelic Pagan Porter;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Angelic Brewing Company;"Mocha coffee aroma, dark brown color. Taste is a dry sweetness; dark chocolate malts, cream, coffee grounds, and hops. The hops sit light in the nose during drinking, but in the aftertaste they mingle nicely with the dark malt. Wet mouthfel, but perhaps a tad too thin."
Angelic Pagan Porter;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Angelic Brewing Company;Love the name. Dark rosen brown in color yet still translucent. Aroma is root beer. Is this a joke? Some faint smells of cocoa butter and again with Angelic�s spray starch signature aroma. They must have purchased some tubing second hand from a laundromat. Decent sweet cream taste. Dry, dark chocolate. Could be a case of naming an oatmeal stout a porter. We�ve got oats, trickles of molasses and sweet chocolate malts. As a sweet stout, it�s tasty. As a porter, I need more f�ing hops.
Angelic Pagan Porter;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark Brown Coloring. Small Tan Head. Roasts..Chocolate. Bitter. Didn�t Taste the Hops in the Description. Good Standard Porter.

Angelic Pagan Porter;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Angelic Brewing Company;Festival tap: Looks like this beer is hit or miss, depending on what batch you get! Mine was very coffee dominated and dry at the finish, creamy and chocolatey in the middle, mostly espresso flavors. Very good!

Angelic Pagan Porter;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Angelic Brewing Company;Looks great, tastes alright. Light on the usual porter flavors. Angelic is a nice place, but I personally recommend the Great Dane (if you happen to be in Madison).
Angelic Pagan Porter;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark body, ruby tinted. light brown head. chocolatey and somewhat roastey. A light body. roastey, chocolate finish. a standard brewpub porter, certainly nothing special.
Angelic Pagan Porter;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Angelic Brewing Company;Most of my favorable impression of this beer is from the appearance. Very nice and very deceiving --- looks like it would taste wonderful. No coffee flavor, no chocolate flavor, minimal hoppiness to speak of...just a bare nuttiness. If you like a regular brown ale, this is ok. But if you want a porter, look elsewhere.
Wig & Pen Lachies Ness Scottish Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wig & Pen Brewery;Sudsy looking with a brown/ red copper hue. Soft and mildly chewy. Not as over the top/ robust as other scottish ales I�ve had (which I�ve found ordinary). Elegant beer.
Wig & Pen Lachies Ness Scottish Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wig & Pen Brewery;Having just come from Scotland before trying this, I was a tad dissapointed at the time: I was expecting something a little more robust and earthy like my favorite beers from Inveralmond. But what I got was more a standard Scottish pub ale, light on the hops, mild body and a little chocolate flavour.
Wig & Pen Lachies Ness Scottish Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wig & Pen Brewery;Pretty nice beer. Reminded me a little of Belhave St Andrews. Some peat swabbed with avocado. No head. Flavour sorts of melats away real quick with no enough hop bitter ness.
Wig & Pen Lachies Ness Scottish Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wig & Pen Brewery;yet another wig and pen beer that is a competent rendition of a style otherwise unavailable in this country. plenty of whisky malt in the aroma, rich deep ruby appearance, hint of old jamaica chocolate, but a little thin and bland in the finish
Wig & Pen Lachies Ness Scottish Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wig & Pen Brewery;Damn, spilt beer on my notes for this one. I can still make out most of though. Pretty true to style Scottish ale. Sweet caramelly, with some dark fruit (possible raisins?) notes. Also nicely peaty and nutty, and some lemon or something right at the end, i guess from the hops. Very nice.
Gale's Trafalgar Ale (Cask);Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;A deep orange brown beer with a strong white head. A discreet hoppy aroma with a sweet liquorice touch.

Gale's Trafalgar Ale (Cask);Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;"Cask conditioned Beautiful amber color; a thin persistent cap of foam. Light aroma, a bit yesty. Thin body, too watery, yeast and a light fruitness. A quite bitter final, a bit cheesy. Drinkable, but simple."
Gale's Trafalgar Ale (Cask);Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Cask Conditioned at The Bell, Banbury. Ooh tricky business this rating, I've added Cask into the title to seperate this 4.2% bitter from the 9% Bottle Conditioned Ale. This is a darkl, richly malted beer, a little one dimensional but not without some nutty qualities. Patriotically named for our stuffing of the French, but could have been better.
Brewerkz Strawberry Fields Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Flavored - Fruit;Brewerkz;When the description says it is strawberry, the label is pink and it states that it is a strawberry flavor (Geez, the Singaporeans can't spell either) and rose color (damn, there it is again) believe it. This looks like a Mateus with a faintly pinkish head. The aroma is predominantly strawberry icecream sundae, der, but there is a distinctive English hop in the background. While also tasting of the eponymous fruit the beer flavour does really come through with a good bitterness offset by the body. The fruit overpowers all other potential flavours but for the novelty this is not too bad. CErtainly a beer that would be ideal with icecream, fruit flan or even a fruit salad.
Brewerkz XIPA;Singapore, Singapore;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brewerkz;On tap at Brewerkz Riverside Point. Pours orange gold. Grapefruit, tangerine, caramel, little tropical stuff. Very bitter. Nice enough.
Brewerkz XIPA;Singapore, Singapore;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brewerkz;My favourite beer from the local brewery Brewerkz by the Singapore River. The typical bittersweet American-styled double IPA with a lingering after taste. It is served in shaker glass, a little nose, dark amber hue. The taste consists of caramel, nuts, floral, mango, pineapple, herbal and of course alcoholic bitterness. Nothing beats a pint of fresh local brew on the tap in the merciless equatorial climate!
Brewerkz XIPA;Singapore, Singapore;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brewerkz;Draft - Lots of tropical fruit, mango and Mandarin. Clearish gold with a decent white head. Big boozy stone fruit, mango and citrus with a heavy mouthfeel and bitter boozy finish. Very old school.

Nevskoe Lait;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Can in Tomsk, Siberia. I bought this for the walk home after a night of drinking in Tomsk - even being drunk didn�t help this beer. I rarely pour a full beer out, but this beer watered some flowers.
Nevskoe Lait;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);"First ""lite"" beer in Russia: low in alcohol, calories, aroma and flavour. Pale straw color, dense head (a surprise), neutral, slightly malty aroma. Drinkable but uninteresting."
Brewerkz Nut Brown Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Brown Ale;Brewerkz;The colour of a good NBA should be coppery and welcoming. This succeeds with the crowning of a very clean creamy head. The aroma is smoky with a touch of cigar, balanced by the waft of malt and toffee. The beer is mildly bitter with a goos back palate. For a mid range style ABV there is a good mouthfeel made up by the maltiness of the beer. A good drink even at these temperatures.

Beer Works Pumpkinhead Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Beer Works;On draught at the Fenway location. On the menu as Pumpkin Works Ale but reads similar to this entry. Arrived a hazy deep orange amber with a thin-moderate tan head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace. Dammit if they didn�t serve it with the rim of the glass dipped in cinnamon sugar. Pleasant aroma of pumpkin pie spice with mild pumpkin and sweet malt. The flavor is similar o the aroma. Medium bodied.
Beer Works Pumpkinhead Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Beer Works;From tap at the Canal Street location. Pours clear and golden orange with a white head and seems to be pumpkin spiced sprinkles on top. Sweet caramelish and cinnamon sprinkles, toasted malty and rather spiced flavoured.

Beer Works Pumpkinhead Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Beer Works;1/10/2011 on tap @ Boston Beer Works (2011-480) Little cloudy reddish amber beer, aery bubbly head, pretty stable and adhesive. The rim of the glass though was dipped in sugar with spices. Looked pretty dirty. Aroma: very sweet, cinnamon. MF: light carbon, medium body. Taste: citrus, grapefruit, cinnamon, more cinnamon. Aftertaste: cinnamon, mocha, some caramel. Pretty yuck.
Beer Works Pumpkinhead Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Beer Works;A: The glass comes rimmed with cinnamon sugar, but the beer is amber with a creamy off-white head. S: Starts off with sweet malt and very moderate spices. At first the cinnamon sugar was all I could smell, so I gluttonously licked it all off the glass. After that just a lot of bread and some toffee. T: Only a bit of pumpkin flavor. Not too much in the way of spices, mostly cinnamon and nutmeg. Overall, I must say it is a bit bland. Toasted malt and bread with a bit of toffee sweetness. Very mild spice character. M: Medium in both body and carbonation. O: Sort of a lackluster pumpkin beer. Wasn�t overly spicy, though, which was kind of a nice change.
Beer Works Pumpkinhead Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Beer Works;This one came in a sample of 4 beers, tiny glasses, and very expensive. Not worth it if you visit the pub to order the flight. Beer was real good though.
Beer Works Pumpkinhead Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Beer Works;"Warning, no pumpkins were harmed in the making of this beer....why? Because surprise surprise, no pumpkins were added. None the less this was an above average ""pumpkin ale"". Pours a cloudy medium to dark brown with little lacing. The aroma is extract, pumpkin, cinnomin, nutmeg, ginger and other spices. The flavor is not overly sweet. The body is nice and malty and certainly beats most pumpkin brews"
Beer Works Pumpkinhead Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Beer Works;2010 Tap. One of the best pumpkin ales I�ve ever had. Aroma of pumpkin sweetness, cream, cloves, and molasses. Very creamy mouthfeel, almost like a pub ale. This is such an enjoyable, excellent ale. Highly recommended.

Beer Works Centennial Alt;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Beer Works;Comes out of the cask a dark, coppery honey that is hazy to the point of barely translucent. Aroma is strongly hoppy like a good IPA, with hints of malt and fruit. Flavor is hoppy and fruity, with notes of hay and greenwood but scarce bitterness. Texture is fizzy, if rather thin. A good way to celebrate any centennial.

Beer Works Centennial Alt;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Beer Works;A: The pour is amber in color with a finger of off-white head. S: Smells of sweet malt with toasted malt and toffee. There is a bit of grape flavor and sweetness. A light flavor of yeast as well as a very slight nuttiness. Maybe a little bit of floral hop aroma. T: A nice toasted malt and toffee flavor. There�s some nutty flavors as well as some mild fruit flavors. It�s sort of bitter for an altbier. As with the aroma, there are some grape flavors.

Beer Works Centennial Alt;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Beer Works;"Had this one on draught at the brewpub on Canal Street, Boston, Massachusetts. Dark red pour with a lacy, white head; toasted almond and chocolate malts in the nose, slightly spicey especially into the body, which has a little allspice, grape and apple fruitiness, with some sweet milk chocolate.

The aroma is of roasted malt, with a light hint of cinnamon. Light fruity flavor upfront. The mid-palate gives off some sweet bready malt along with a mild spiciness from Euro-hops.

Clear amber to copper colour with a medium to large sized white head. Smells cork, dusty, sour, infected. Tastes infected, sourish, dusty, hint of cherry..

Sint Servattumus Knalbier;Schijndel, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bierbrouwerij Sint Servattumus;Bottle @ weekly tasting shared by Dutchdrebus. Clear dark orange to lightly reddish color, medium to full sized white head that lasts for a decent while. Weird sourish aroma with some fruity hints. A bit chemical. Taste also had a sourish touch, a weird fermenting fruit touch, orangepeel, yeast. Totally weird and not good at all imo, though it�s a long way from the worst I�ve ever tried. Basically, for an infected beer this is the best ever, simply because it�s still drinkable.

Pours a dark hazy amber with a medium white head and an aroma of roasty malts, sweet spices, toffee, grapes and coreander. The taste is sweet, with a mediumlasting bitter finish.

Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear copper body with thin head. aroma is of light malt, light hops, a pleasant floral scent that I couldn�t figure out. Flavor is mild, lightly sweet. The hops are light and somewhat supressed into the flavor. Sweet malty backbone. Very sessionable.
Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a head of foamy fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a very hazy typically carbonated body. The funky aroma was malty and musty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mediumly tingly finish. The flavor contained notes of malt hops and brown malt. Eh, not for me.
Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;Bottle compliments of patrick767. Very small ivory head that mostly diminished, no lacing, visible carbonation, hazy-opaque, and a deep orange hue. Nose was caramel, malty and some hoppiness. Flavor was malty, caramel, lightly hoppy, lightly bitter, sweet and has a dry finish. Smooth, dry and a somewhat thin mouthfeel. Medium body. Not a great brew, but definitely not a bad one either.
Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;bottle - Pours hazy light amber with very little head. The caramel malt and hop aroma is definitely that of an English pale. There�s a decent, mildly hoppy flavor that�s well balanced. Medium bodied with a smooth finish, this wasn�t great by any means, but it was better than I expected given the gimmicky packaging.
Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;12oz Bottle Pours out a nice amber topped with a fair off white head. A pretty good aroma of malt and sweet maybe caramel. The tast is about the same. This one is much better than I was thinking it was going to be.
Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;Super cool packaging. I got this at a bargain price and didn�t expect much. It has a definately unique flavor. There is more here than a regular domestic beer. But, this isn�t a beer that I would drink regularly. I recommend that one tries this once and then forgets about it.
Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;Won a gold medal at the World Expo of Beer in the pale ale category. Pours an orange color with a small head. Strong caramel and malt aroma. Taste is similar, but not very overpowering. Lots of taste, yet remains refreshing. I have to say this is the most unique bottle/packaging I have seen. Huge style points to Michigan Brewing for such a classic product.
Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;strong caramel & malt feel in this thing. I found this on clearance for about $1.49 4pack, so I expected it to suck...I can say I�m rather suprised, as it is well worth the 37 cents a bottle! In a way it has an rough, almost home-brew quality...I�d swear I made this stuff by accident once....
Helmar Big League Brew;Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Helmar Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours amber with a short offwhite head. Aromas of caramel and toasted malts.

LaConner Harvest Ale;LaConner, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;No lie, it's hoppy. In harvest fashion it is a touch grainy, but only little. Dark amber with a minimal head, this has a fairly large citrus nose that influences almost every aspect of the beer. The alchohol is well concealed, and there aren't any contradictory flavors here, I just wish it was a bit more grainy.
LaConner Belgian Wit;LaConner, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;Belgian-Style Wit Ale--2004 12 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV? 15 IBU�s? (4.25 / 5.0) Mild head.

LaConner Belgian Wit;LaConner, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;Very pale, slightly clouded yellowy appearance. Fruity, herbal aroma. Very herbal, spicy palate, low on carbonation which takes away a little, coriander. Pretty complex version of a wit.
LaConner Belgian Wit;LaConner, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;Bottle from LP, thanks! Pours an expected white hazed golden hue with a small fizzy head and minimal lace. The aroma has notes of saffon, corriander, hint of clove, orange peel, lemon zest, bready malt, and a touch of belgian sugar candi. The taste starts quite twangy with a rush of lemon and orange that linger towards an acidic sour finish. The spices are a bit too subdued for my liking in a wit but you can taste them as the bier opens up and warms. A faint amount of sweetness is there as well with a cross of malt and candi, additionally some rose hips and minor bitters are noticed. The feel is lively, a bit crisp and refreshing. Don�t drink it too fast or you will miss something. Still I would like a touch more spice.
LaConner Belgian Wit;LaConner, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;Hazy orange-yellow color with bubbly airy head.

LaConner Belgian Wit;LaConner, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;Hazy orange tea. Lovely aroma of bitter curacao orange peel and coriander with other hints of pulp, lemon peel, and butter toffee. Characterful spice flavor but not much malt flavor. I really like this style of beer and this is a very unique example, but I still feel that the best example of the style has yet to be brewed.
LaConner Belgian Wit;LaConner, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;Funky, sour lemon aroma. Thin head, good traditional pale yellow color, a little cloudy. Medium bodied. Taste is very citrus, but also quite bitter and sour, especially towards the finish.More lemons. Leaves a long sour aftertaste. A very funky beer.
LaConner Belgian Wit;LaConner, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;Draught, at the brewpubHazy straw colour, a bit darker than the pilsner. Fruity, apple juicy aroma with a hint of coriander. Sweet flavour, with an almost gruity herbal note - very orangey, too. Sweet pale malts like sugar. Body is light. An odd example of the style.

Newby Wyke Chesapeake;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask - The Kings Head, Norwich. Poured a clear golden amber with a small, bubbly & mostly fasing whie head. Quite a rich malt bill it would seem, coupled with the prominence of the alcohol - even at just 5.5% - giving it a bit too much sweet warmth that undermines the otherwise dryish grapefruit, lemon pith & marmalade hop character. Medium-ish body, softly spritzed on the palate with a lingering bittersweet finish.
Newby Wyke Chesapeake;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Thick, syruppy sweet hops, which have a bitter start and aslightly warming orange fruit finish. Pretty good, but slight strength on the finish is not entirely to my taste.

Il Giardino della Birra Contessa Bionda;Milan, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Il Giardino della Birra;Draught at the brewpub. Milky yoghurt aroma. Very cloudy orange colour. Nice stable white head. The flavour is quite dry with a hint of butter. Swelling carbonation. Not nasty or sour, but the driness and butter suggest an infection.

Il Giardino della Birra Contessa Bionda;Milan, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Il Giardino della Birra;Very effervescent, 1-inched head, fully lasting. Cloudy, firmly malty body. Pils-like in its strong bohemian hoppiness, especially by Italian�s standards. Subtle herbal, floral notes which translat into a soft bitterness. Cleansing strong carbonation never bites and leads to the next sip. Fresh, almost mild wheaty undertones make it all the more drinkable. Bordering excellent.
Il Giardino della Birra Contessa Weizen;Milan, Italy;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Il Giardino della Birra;Draft - Soured malts on the nose. Cloudy copper with a rich beige head. Soured malts and a hint of banana. Not good.

Il Giardino della Birra Contessa Weizen;Milan, Italy;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Il Giardino della Birra;Draught at the brewpub. Good, fat banana aroma. Cloudy amber colour. Big stable off-white head. Like their bionda, the flavour is very dry. This one does not show other signs of infection, though, but I guess that hides better in a wheat beer. There is still some banana, and a hint of paper in the finish. OK, were it not for the driness.

Il Giardino della Birra Contessa Weizen;Milan, Italy;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Il Giardino della Birra;Cloudy orange. fading creamy white head. Very estery nature where strong banana and candied bubble gum, honey melon and kinda sweet fruity flavours make it more sugary than most. Still, the authentic body, foamy and with a firm bite ensures a certain balance. Soft, bready malts feel perhaps a bit thin ultimately as the carbonation cuts the flavours shortly.

La Weizen dell Officina;Bresso (MI), Italy;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Officina della Birra (Bresso);Bottle shared by Fajry in a train. Many thanks! Muddy amber colour. Brutal sweet toffeeish caramel aroma, light chocolate. Taste has nothing in common with weizen as well. Some chocolate and coffee (WTF???). Metallic and sourish finish. Weird to say the least.

Weizen 5% A cloudy copper with a thick head of foam the nose is corn(DMS), cloves & wheat. Decent body but a bit too much sweet caramel then cloves & wheat. Pretty nice flavor, not too shabby and a good find at the airport.
La Weizen dell Officina;Bresso (MI), Italy;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Officina della Birra (Bresso);On tap at Fiumicino airport, Rome. Dark orange color, cloudy, with almost no head (very atypical). Stingy nose, winegarish. Aroma is lemon, lots of it, green apples, winegar, yeast, unripened fruit, unripened grapes. This is sour as hell, in the aftertaste there�s a faint weizen malts trail, but dish soap overwhelms. Finish has a medium lenght with a Radler attitude, very acidic. Overall yucky feels like homemade stuff, light body, very carbonated. Maybe this one has gone bad or something, maybe oxidized? As a matter of fact it�s very hard to find good Weizens out of Germany, Brazil being the only exception right now (Baden-Baden Weiss)

La Speciale dell Officina;Bresso (MI), Italy;Bock - Weizenbock;Officina della Birra (Bresso);bottle - maybe I�m missing the complexities, but I had a hard time with this beer. Poured a dark ruby color, small bubbly head.The taste recalled flat coke into which a bit of Weisse, rauchbier and a good bit of cantillon kriek had been poured into. It was really sour. Had a hard time finishing it in the end.

Lambrate Sant'Ambroeus;Milano, Italy;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Birrificio Lambrate;Golden beer, white head. Aroma is sweet lemon, hop, a touch of grass. Taste follows suit with just a hint of booziness reflecting the strength and a bit in the aftertaste too, along with some airy, floral lemon.

Raffles Export Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);I see a lot of negative reviews for this beer. I had two hours to wait at Changi Airport, Singapore. This beer was a good companion against the local humidity and temperatures. It is not a degustation beer, no gastronomy stories, just a fresh, dry and refreshing simple beer. And it is cheaper than other brands. I would recommend it as a daily brew here in Singapore. Not for taste enjoyment but more for fighting against the local temperatures.
Raffles Export Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Can snagged from a local mini-mart in Palau. 4.2% abv and given the �Tropical Brew� moniker.

Also Brew III on the label with the footnote, may contain traces of Jelly Snake, a reference to the Mad Dog I hope. Cabbagey nose, a bit whiffy but a decent enough beer, although I do get a cigarrette, tobacco note. Bitter and hoppy throughout, refreshing.
Wicked Hathern Barking Mad Bitter;Loughborough, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wicked Hathern Brewery;Bottle from Alexander Wines, of course. �Brew III� on label. Golden with a good, frothy white head. Slightly vegetal aroma, but the taste is delightfully fruity and hoppy.

McMenamins Uncle Davids Dunkel;Portland, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;My first dunkel. Very interesting appearance, dark purple almost, with a large head. They gave me a lemon with it, but I threw it off to the side. The aroma and the taste made me think of blueberries, it almost tastes like they added some in there. Really nice, easy drinking wheaty beer. I was impressed, this blows every other American wheat I've had out of the water.
Detroit Brew Factory Centennial Pale Ale;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Detroit Brew Factory;Golden red, quite deep, but mostly clear, small white head as usual for their beers, moderately fizzy. Smells dry, very clean and apparent hops flavor, lightly rusty and quite bitter, with a good malt flavor on the back, but not quite enough. A bit one-sided (hops) with not much else, a touch watery. Decent I guess.
Detroit Brew Factory Centennial Pale Ale;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Detroit Brew Factory;Extremely hoppy nose is full of citrus and grass. Full bodied and nicely carbonated. Caramelly malt is a bit underneath the big hops, but that is OK if you are a hophead like myself. Finish is bitter and sharp, alcohol lurking beneath. A fine pint!
Detroit Brew Factory Porter;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Porter;Detroit Brew Factory;"A strong, alcoholic ""Robust"" porter with great coffee and roasted malt notes throughout. Medium to light bodied. Not much bitterness, but the alcohol dries out the already roasty finish"
Detroit Brew Factory Oktoberfest;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Detroit Brew Factory;Higher alcohol version of an Oktoberfest. Medium golden bronze body, heavy carbonation. Nose and malty flavor is toasty and semi-sweet. Not really a finish, but a long toasty aftertaste dries out a bit (especially as it warms) from the slightly detectable alcohol.
Detroit Brew Factory Pumpkin Ale;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Detroit Brew Factory;"Strong pumpkin nose, absent of spices or ""pie-like"" characteristics. Medium bodied, toasty, Oktoberfest-ish Vienna malt flavor underneath strong pumpkin notes. Too unbalanced, as most pumpkin beers I have had."
Detroit Brew Factory American Pilsner;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Detroit Brew Factory;2004 draught at the brewery. Light yellow-gold, slight head clinging to the sides. This dosent strike me as a premium pils, more of a premium lager. No crisp hops, more of a dry, papery, almost stale malt. Very overcarbonated as Joe points out, no real redeeming flavors. Crisp, but that�s just because it�s so dry and malt lacking. Aroma is sharp and unspectacular.
Detroit Brew Factory American Pilsner;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Detroit Brew Factory;Golden color, highly carbonated and fizzy head. Malty start is crisp and slightly dry, saazy and grassy to the end. A decent pils, but much too carbonated on this visit!
Lilys IPA;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;IPA;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;on tap at the brewery. this is a smaller less attractive version of sven and ollies.
Lilys IPA;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;IPA;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Memories. Uneventful. Not much flavor. Food also not exciting. I always wanted Lilys to be more than it could be. But not be the army.
Lilys IPA;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;IPA;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Draft labled Sven & Ollies IPA, not sure if this is the same recipe others have rated here: Dark pumpkin/brown pour with a white sustaining frothy head. Aroma was mostly hops and something sweet, maybe vanilla, but it didn�t belong there whatever it was. Flavor was the same, hops and an odd sweetness which really didn�t go well. Flat mouthfeel. Fully coating lacing.
Lilys IPA;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;IPA;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Tap. Nice medium to deep amber color with a long lived white head leaving good lacing. Slightly English IPA in aroma with floral and earthy notes. Thin in taste and body. Lacking in flavor and palate. Appearance makes me want much more than this beer provides.
Lilys IPA;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;IPA;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;They didnt serve mine in a tulip glass. . .those bastards. Medium golden/amber color, very clear, medium foamy white head. Smells very dry and citrus hoppy. I must not have had the batch marinaro had because mine was all hops and maybe a touch of caramel malt. No balance at all, and the hops were excessively dry, with a slight metallic character to the finish. Beer had a watery mouthfeel and was thin all the way through.
Lilys IPA;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;IPA;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Served in a little tulip glass, this dark amber treat had a nice big fluffy head that extended from the rim and lasted until the last sip. Superbly hopped IPA was solid all-around, offering not only big citrusy hops but a chewy caramelly malt flavor and a big heavy body. Nicely balanced as well.
Moosbacher Alt Kellerbier;Moosbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Private Landbrauerei Scheuerer;Bottle 50cl, an amber beer with good head. Nose is cereal and grainy like.

Wild honey, and floral hops aromas.Toasted malt and dark caramel as well. Very smooth in feel. Mild flavors of toasted malt, a bit of acidity and light floral hops. Simple, yet I find not glaring faults. The bottle is slightly dated, but I still find this to be a good brew that was likely better when fresh.
Moosbacher Alt Kellerbier;Moosbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Private Landbrauerei Scheuerer;yellow, with a moderate quickly dissipitating head. Some spiciness but a bit metallic-macro-like lager. Really nothing special. Not very drinkable, maybe as it was not very fresh. Light, a touch of toastiness, all didn�t work too well for me.

Toasty malts, light grassy notes, subtle hops and faint spices. Taste has light spice notes, toasted malts, soft caramel, and light grassy hops. Body is creamy and smooth. Chewy in spots. Moderate carbonation. Finishes with a slightly larger grassy hop profile, toastier malts, caramel, hint of toffee and light buttery notes. This has gotten low ratings, and as only my sixth Zwickel/Keller/Landbier, I don�t profess to be an expert on the style, but I rather enjoyed this as simply ""a beer""."
Moosbacher Alt Kellerbier;Moosbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Private Landbrauerei Scheuerer;Bottled: A clean rich golden hue topped by a fizzy head that left good lacing upon the glassware. The aroma has notes of herbal and grassy hops, bready and sweet syrupy malts and a hint of earthy yeast esters. The taste starts with most malt sweetness with support a quick dash of mild fruit with just a drop of hop bitterness. Rather straight forward and lacks much depth but is a quaffable bier and an easy way to start the days drinking activities.
Moosbacher Alt Kellerbier;Moosbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Private Landbrauerei Scheuerer;"2006 swing-top bottle at Sunset Grill on 12/14/06 Deep beeswax yellow with some canteloupe tints and an initially large, off-white head that fairly rapidly falls to cover, leaving only spotty lacing. Clarity is high and if this is an unfiltered ""kellerbier"" it certainly can�t be discerned from the bottle (no sediment at the bottom after investigation). Initial flurry of carbonation dies down quickly, settling out with only a few bubbles rising inconsistently. Grass and butter in the nose. Not a heavy butteriness and certainly no popcorn or papery qualities, but more like a buttercreamy maltiness. It definitely comes across much too rich and overbearing for the noble hops that attempt to complement it. In their own right, the hops are quite nicely done. Leafy, green and very fresh, with plenty of herbal complexity and grassy dryness, they hang lightly and tantalizingly on the nose. But they fall in to the rather soggy, heavy, aforementioned malts and are especially consumed as the beer warms/breathes. Light toastiness on the end, plenty of breadiness and thick honey/light caramel sweetness. No particular lager yeast crispness, but nor is it metallic or flawed. Medium strength of aroma, no alcohol noted. Sweet, but not overly fresh tasting malts are abundant in the flavor. Buttercream, honey, toffee and a lightly sourish, toasted malt note that weaves itself in to the sweetness, creating a sort of tangy buttercream flavor....As you may imagine, it�s not quite the best combination of flavors. The hops are rather lost in the flavor as well, adding a gentle bitterness and light spiciness, but being altogether lacking in real flavor. Carbonation is very low, further accentuating the overbearing, sluggish, syrupy maltiness. Some light mineral character and a hard-to-define staleness or sweatiness sits on the finish. Not crisp on the end. Sticky texture, but loose as well with wateriness creeping in on the end."
Moosbacher Alt Kellerbier;Moosbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Private Landbrauerei Scheuerer;50cl swingtop. Golden brown with a decent off white head. Sweet malt nose, honey notes, caramel. Sweet flavor, more caramel malt and honey. Light body and flavor. Sweet biscuity finish. Not bad.
Moosbacher Edel Weisse;Moosbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Private Landbrauerei Scheuerer;Has a large yeast sediment. During pouring the colour is golden, but after mixing in the yeast sediment it turns into a dark brown. Nice yeasty aroma. Typical banana taste. But somehow this beer tastes weird. Maybe its the low carbonation, maybe its too much yeast, which makes the beer taste unbalanced.
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear deep amber with a brown hue and a tan head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has sweet grains, light fruits and Belgian yeast. Flavor is quite thin with sweet grains and Belgian yeast.
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Keg @ Great Dane, Madison. As ""Abbey 8 Dubbel"". 7.3% ABV. Nearly black pour with a tan head.

Strange stuff."
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Served a dark mohogany with a thin beige-tan head and lace. Aroma of malt and chocolate hues. Taste included malts, with hints of chocolate and coffee with moderate hop finish. Mouth feel was decent. Overall, a nice brew but nothing overly outstanding.
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Dark mahogany with a modest beige head, nonetheless leaves an abundant, sticky lace. Roasty aroma, a bit of aniseed, but overall faint on the nose. Flavor leads with the roasty, again licorice-like, and moves more towards caramelized malts, fig, raisins, cherry pits. Flavorful, but the roast and the sweeter malts clashed a bit for me, and there was a rubbery note and the finish. Medium to full body, only gently carbonated.
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;(Draught) Pours a lightly hazy amber body with a medium-sized beige head. Aroma of toasted grain, nuts, and caramel. Flavor of raisins, toasted grain, and caramel malt with a dry finish.
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Sampled on draught: Pours a dark reddish brown colour with a small to medium sized beige head. Aroma is nutty, caramel, oak and black licorice on the nose. Mouthfeel is light, but creamy. Slightly yeasty, flavors of coffee, hot buttered rum, cinnamon and pepper.
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at Great Dane (downtown). Poured a hazy orange brown color. The head was off white and left some nice lace on the glass. Smelled of subdued banana with a dash of brown sugar and a whiff of caramel. Medium bodied and sweeter than expected. Pear, a splash of alcohol, cotton candy, and clove supported the dominant banana muffin-ish flavor. Not bad, but a touch too sweet for me.
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Copper color with a small tight bubbled beige head. Apples and blackberries dominate the aroma. Very light and airy in feel. Phenols and caramel mid quaff, with bananas and light spice. Perhaps a touch thin, but quite drinkable.
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"From a big goblet. Nearly clear reddish brown with small off-white head. Big fruity bubble gum and spice aroma. Thick, syrupy body; fruity, yeasty, bready bubble gum flavor. Way too sweet -- I liked the malt, but this was just too heavy and candy-ish. As jewedekind said, this beer lacks bite."
Great Dane Belgian Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;This 2006 version is a good one. Had a thin but effervescent head, nose of cardamon and allspice. Clear red-brown. Very malty with a definite chocolate charater. Nice full body and a delight on the palate. Close to a Chimay Blue, but lacking a bit of yeast bite.
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;"Reviewed from notes: had this on draft back in 2005 when the Angelic was still around. Pours a clear golden color with white head. Cereal, some light citrus, and bread on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes clean with not much aftertaste."
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Somewhat misty, orange glow with a creamy white head. Crisp lemon aroma, with wafts of spray starch and clothes stored in the attic for 10 years. Smooth taste with some lemon acidity. The tin twang of their pilsner malt is evident. Something oily about this one, like a macadamia nut. This is a summer quaff, though not my first choice. Carbonation dances like acupuncture on the tongue. Souring finish with a light crescent roll aftertaste.
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Ah the Blonde.... Drinking This Watery...Damn near Tasteless, Aroma-less and Body-less Brew....I scan the Brewpub and see MANY awards for their Beer....I wonder HOW IS THIS SO?!

Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Damn near clear body with no head. Light aroma, light flavor, light everything. Blah.
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Clear light amber body. Honied, pale malt aroma. Clean, grassy hop flavor. There�s a touch of wheat bread, too. A good blonde, no off flavors with hop character to boot.
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Predictably, this beer was pale yellow. A light citrus aroma gave way to a similar taste. A slightly hoppy aftertaste finished it off. A good, nicely balanced beer.
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;light pale malt and faint hop nose. light, clean beer. sweet, tasty and a bit floral. fresh and pleasant. some corn and lots of clean, dry malts, a bit stale and weak on finish. interesting offering
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Look like this one was renamed Avalon Blonde. Looks like the political correctness in Madison hits once again (who would name a beer after a drunken orgy praising bacchus - granted not very angelic, when you can name it after the Isle of the Dead - home of King Arthur and other heros past. That said, Deep golden color with a smallish off white head. Light fruit and floral hops aroma. Light malt sweetness mixed with a touch of fruit(peaches and plums). Finish is a touch sweet and thin, but quite drinkable.
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Clear golden body with medium white head. Aroma is medium sweet and peach. Taste is mild sweet, peach/orange, with no bitterness and no finish. Light watery body.
Angelic Avalon Blonde;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Similar to Goose Island's, maybe not as good. I dont particularly like this style, but this beer was refreshing. Decent level of bitterness and slightly creamy. sweet with noted bitterness in the finish.
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;""" Hausmann Pale Beer is sure to satisfy even the largest thirsts and most discriminating tastes."" Not me it didn�t. This beer was absolutely awful. I sure hope I got a bad bottle, because i would probably never drink this again. Pours a bright clear peepee colour with no head. Aroma is corny, with a faint hop nose. Taste is sour- like fermented apples sour. Not good in any way. Mouthfeel- there really is none. it�s quick to go down, but unfortunately the only place it�s going down is the drain."
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;12oz. bottle from Woodmans in Madison. Medium amber with a small off white head. Aroam is mild sourish malts, hops, and light citrus. The aroma was sour malts but the flavor is sort of a candied malt along with hops and grains. Not bad.
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle. Poured a medium orange color. Head was one finger high and off white. It reduced over a period of a few minutes to a thin, but tenacious, film that left some lace behind. Aroma was of husky grain and biscuity malt. Dry on the tongue up front with some sugars coming out at the end. Tasted husky with a touch of caramel. A grainy aftertaste ""graced"" the finish."
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to Skyview! Poured a clear, brilliant medium orange with a short, well-retained cap of white head. The aroma picked up candied caramel paired with a dry floral hop presence.. soft with building sweetness the deeper you inhale.. quite pleasant. Flavor had a sweet, yet darker caramel and vegetal base with grassy and floral bitter accents.. left a rather lengthy vegetal finish (was pretty good up until that point). Light-bodied and again felt good until the finish... tacky veggies, some sour fruit, and grass left a less-than-pleasant final impression. This wasn�t far from a solid session brew.. just need to iron out a few kinks.
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;Picked up six pack from Bob McFarland�s Liquors in McFarland, Wisconsin. Pours a clear caramel amber brew with a thick white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and some surface bubbles. Aroma of light caramel malt, green vegetables, grassy hops with a touch of dry hay. Taste is lightly carbonated, medium bodied with a taste of toasted multi-grain crackers some dried leaves and a mild bitterness. Finish is little gritty, with some pepper/herb spice aftertaste. Terrific to see another historical pre-Prohibition Wisconsin label has been revived by Grays but the flavor is a little off for a Pre-Prohibition recipe.
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle from Woodmans on Gammon Road, Madison (Oct 2006) consumed a bit above fridge temp from a Corsendonk glass. Bottle says ""Hausmann Pale Beer."" Light gold and slightly bubbly with a thin diminishing head....unpleasant nose of skunk, rotting vegetables, a bit of caramel, sun-bleached plastic....body isn�t so awful as the nose but isn�t really good either, with light pale malt and little caramel struggling to rise above the extremely watery and heavily filtered body, sitting lifeless and sludgelike in the glass....the finish adds a metallic component to the charms of an already nearly worthless beer; Grays should really consider not doing any contract brewing anymore!"
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;12oz bottle-A gold body with a white head with an aroma of malt and vegetables. A taste of malt with a little hops.
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;From a 12 oz. twist cap long neck brown bottle with a coded freshness date stamped on the neck of bottle. Made an average appearance, poured a clear macro lager golden with a foamy white head that settled into a thin lacing, decent carbonation. Had a hay and husk nose with a light sweet maltiness in the background. A crisp and smooth light bodied mouth feel, average drinkability. I was surprised by the taste, a nice hay and husky bitterness upfront that is cut by a balancing dry, crisp grain cracker maltiness and a subtle hay and dry malty finish, very pleasant. Not a bad macro lager from Gray�s, tasty and balanced, would be a good beer to consume after doing some outside work under the sun.
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;I bought a bottle at Woodman�s in Madison. The body was medium gold with a white head. The aroma had potatoes, over ripe tomatoes and some green beans. The taste is some light potatoes with green bell peppers. There is also a little hint of black pepper spice. A slick and thin mouthfeel.
Grays Hausmann Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;Tap at Memorial Union. Amber color with no head. Moldy hop aroma. Bad, bad, bad taste... moldy honey and wet cardboard. This is just wrong.

Buckeye Amarillo IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Golden-orange in colour with a thin white coloured head, excellent lacing. The aroma was very hoppy with some pine, cedar, very light citrus and a bit of mint. The flavour is again very hoppy, dry, soapy, some pine, some caramel sweetness. Hoppy mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation. Finishes long, hoppy and piney. This was quite a fresh sample from a growler. A very good change after a weekend of sour beers. A growler obtained in a trade with miketd, thanks Mike. Opened on March 29, 2008 Very fresh, 5 days in the growler.
Buckeye Amarillo IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Growler at the sour tasting. Gold, nice white head. Nose is a gigantic hop explosion after what we�ve been drinking for the last 2 days. Caramel/toffee, juicy fruit. Flavor is caramel & hoppy goodness. Pine, mint mixed with some kind of fruit. Bitterness increases in the finish.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;As IPA�s go, I was rather disappointed. It wasn�t even close to being as fresh, hoppy and citrusy as Rocky River�s Hop Goblin IPA in nearby Rocky River, Ohio. It lacked everything I love about IPA�s, namely a biting hoppy finish, and that beautiful citrusy, hop flavor throughout.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Hazy orange body witha creamcicle head. Lots of grapefruit and other mixed citrus aromas. Malty, full body that has a nice blast fo hop oil. Very bitter dry finish. Nice IPA.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Tap at Hoptoberfest �04. Golden amber color. Nice white head. Good lacing. Huge citrus aroma coming off. Malt and hops are both noticable in taste, but the hops just seem to take over. Really well done for a person who likes lots �o hops.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;On tap: Aroma of sweet grapefruit. Slightly cloudy orarnge with a little red to it. Okay head. NIce malty taste with a big grapefruit hop finish. Well balanced. Slightly on the hoppy side. Lightly sweet and grapefruit aftertaste.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Murky orange with very few bubbles. Huge fresh hop nose. Great hop flavors of orange and so much pine its almost a forest. The beer needs a stronger malt presence to balance all the hops, and a little more body too. Very much a hop beer.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Puffy White med density head with moderate staying power. Strong, pleasant fresh floral, fruity aroma. Very crisp palate, refreshing, but not thin in flavor. Bitter, but also astringent, with a mild to moderate maltiness. A really great IPA.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Draft at brewery: Golden color, pure white, frothy head. Aroma is total hops assault, citrusy as well. Flavor is extremely hopy and very bitter throughout. A nice IPA, very distinctive and representative of this style of hops, though it's a bit too much for me. Could use a bit more balance. Still a great brew and worth trying.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Hoptoberfest '03, Buckeye Brewing, draft. Very piney, sharp bitterness. Bitter from the start to the finish and beyond. Had resin and citrus in the taste. Nice and hoppy.
Buckeye Chinook IPA;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Another Hoptoberfest debut. Now I know why hop lovers love the ""C"" hops, I've had all Centenial IPA's and lots with Cascade, but this one was close to being over the top! Totally pine, grapefruit, citrus aroma that gave us a good indication of what was in store. Color was dark ruby/brown and slightly cloudy, good head and great lacing. Palate was really thick on this one. Taste was pine tree sap and grapefruit rind, almost sharp enough to sting, and I liked that feeling quite a lot! Sticky and lingering, tropical fruits paraded up and down my tongue. Fantastic."

Sint Servattumus Zoethouter Tripel;Schijndel, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bierbrouwerij Sint Servattumus;Bottle 0,33ltr: Hazy orange colored brew with an dry bitter taste, lacks somehow in sweetness like an proper Tripel.

Pelgrim Bockbier;Rotterdam-Delftshaven, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Brouwerij De Pelgrim;"Clear deep-dark-brown pour with light-brown head; rather foamy, retaining quite well. Aroma is chocolate (earlier choco than caramel), dark fruits, later more roasted malts. Taste is not so sweet, dark fruits, fruity sours; later (warmer) turning into under medium sweet, caramel. Soft carbonation. This is a nice and somewhat unregular bock, with lower sweetness and more fruit."

Tampa Bay Strongmon;Tampa, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;Draught at the source. Pours a golden copper/orange combo, topped by a stout, 2 finger thick off white head. Incredible retention and some very nice coat lacing make this one a winner in the looks department. On the nose we have citrus fruits - grapefruit, orange, some lemon zest - pine, caramel malts, some floral/perfume aromas. Smells good but lacks that little extra bit of aroma concentration and heft to make it elite in this regard. Flavor is very good as well, bringing over all of the promises from the aroma, and adding a good bit of bitterness to the fold as well. Again, could stand to be a little more concentrated, but it�s a good effort. The only place where I can really ding this one any is in the mouthfeel. Seemed thin for the style, but it did retain the oily/slick mouthfeel that this style so often entails. Finish is long, bitter and then juicy fruits. Not their best, but a pretty good beer.
Tampa Bay Strongmon;Tampa, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;Listed as 6.6% ABV on the chalk board. Pours up rusty red with off white head and moderate lacing. It has a mild aroma of sweet and roasty malts and not much else. The taste is much the same with roasty malts to start that are mildly dry with faint astringency. It then moves toward sweet malts and sweet dark fruity esters. Into the finish it gets a bit toasty and toffee like. Nice offering that could use a bolder nose and a little more depth in the flavor.
Tampa Bay Strongmon;Tampa, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;Tap. Pours a clear amber with a one finger lasting off-white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma of caramel, sweet malt, and slighlty earthy. Taste is the same as aroma. Medium mouthfeel with a mild to moderate amount of bitterness. Good.
Tampa Bay Strongmon;Tampa, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;Cask. Very red. Nose is strong, sweet, and a bit scotchy. Woody nose as well. Taste starts sweetly powdery and malty. Fruitiness is spicy and peppery like a mango. Flavor gets dry a bit quickly, then gets somewhat harsh with the ending hoppiness. Might have improved if it hadn't been cask.
Tampa Bay Strongmon;Tampa, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;strong but not intensely malty, I thought this was attempting to be an english strong but it's more like an ipa, still this musters a good rating. the company a factor? yes.
Tampa Bay Strongmon;Tampa, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;I was lucky enough to enjoy this brew with some fantastic company, adding to the experience. I had this hand pulled on cask�. A dark dusty amber colored body with a thick creamy off white head. Nice malty presence, some toffee and sweet chocolate malts. Medium silky smooth mouth feel, slightly hopy finish. Quality local drinking�s
Tampa Bay Strongmon;Tampa, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;(Draft and cask) - Dark ruby with excellent lacing and a nice creamy off-white head. Huge caramel aroma almost lie a scotch ale. Flavor is swwet caramel and medium hops. Flavors do not quite come together to form a whole. Medium body, expected a bigger body on this one. Cask version was not quite as good as draft. Body seemed even thinner and but head was still very nice.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Nice dark ale with a thick tan head, Malty aroma with some bittersweet chocolate mixed in. Nutty, bittersweet chocolate flavor and a touch of rum balanced by some hop bitterness, medium mouth feel. You seem to either really like this brew a lot or not at all, happen to like it a lot, perfect company to a fine hand made cigar.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;On tap at Alternative Brews. Light brown color with a small tan head. The aroma and taste remind me of nutella spread. The body is a little thin and very carbonated. Not too bad but nothing to go out of your way for.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Tap at Amherst Pizza/Ale house. Tastes like someone dumped a bottle of hazelnut extract into the glass. Absolutely overwhelming nutty, hard to finish. At least there are no other vile overtones present.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Pours a clear brown color with a thin offwhite head. Very strong and disgusting aroma of nutella. The flavor has the same nutella thing going on with some malt. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation. Yuck.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;I will admit that the hazelnut is huge and over the top. It tastes good, but the obvious use of the hazelnut to hide everything else is detracting.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Clear brown w/ light tan foam. Aroma of hazelnut extract & not much else. Medium, syrupy feel. Artificial, sweet & cloying hazelnut flavour.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;[draft - 2004 Autumn Festival of Ales - Honeoye Falls, NY] Clear brown color with a thin tan head. Intense and rich aroma of hazelnuts and coffee. Very thin flavor however. Very watery and with a hint of the big hazelnut aroma. A little too sweet. I loved the way it smelled, but it wasn�t balanced properly.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Buffalo Brewfest 04. A great looking and smelling beer, but downhill from there. Huge hazelnut aroma, and I even got some cream soda out of it as well. Nice murky brown appearance. Syrupy like nut taste though - I often complain nut browns have little nutty taste but this is at the other end - overwhelming and unbalanced. Pretty interesting though!
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Huge nut aroma. Like they dumped a bottle of Hazelnut syrup in the vat. Thin bodied, somewhat astringent. Nut flavor tends to overwhelm.
Alternative Brews Hazelnut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Had this beer at Shea�s. The aroma was of great hazelnut and chocolate. Pour was dark brown with tan head. I dont know, this beer was just awesome. Great sweet taste throughout which tasted like a chocolate milkshake. The best beer at this place. My initial rating was from 10/30/03. I was evaluating this rating, and I stand firm after having this beer a couple times. It may be 1 dimensional and fake tasting, but I thoroughly enjoy drinking this beer. I still believe it is worthy of my top 10 and I will not change the rating any.
Sockeye Off-Kilter Scottish;Boise, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sockeye Brewing;On Tap at Sockeye Boise. This was last years release that was aged for 1 year. Pours out a dark mahogany topped with a tan cream head. Sweet brown sugar all over this one. A little smoke on it aswell. Very good.
Sockeye Off-Kilter Scottish;Boise, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sockeye Brewing;Draft at brewpub: Dark reddish brown color with a medium sized foamy beige head and good lacing. Nose is musky of malt and earth. Taste is dark fruits with smokey hues and an odd sweetness. The flavors were competing a bit. It could have been a little better balanced. Finish is more smokey and a little bitter.
Sockeye Off-Kilter Scottish;Boise, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sockeye Brewing;On Tap at brewpub: Brown with red hues when held to the light and not much head. The aroms is alcohol and something a bit strange I couldn�t identify. The taste is sweet and smoky, tangy leather flavor with a ting of bitterness. The aftertaste is grain as well as cardboard. At times, it seemed weird and I couldn�t tell if it was due to what I was eating or what.
Sockeye Off-Kilter Scottish;Boise, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sockeye Brewing;"2005 Batch: pours with naught the head and a slightly cloudy, burnt amber body; caramelly, peaty aroma; smokey and quite malty and thick, some notes of earthy hops, peat, toffee and medicinal phenolics; almost cloyingly sweet, initially, but with a definite bitterish finish; thick and chewey palate; slightly undercarbonated even for the style, but quite a nice example."
Sockeye Off-Kilter Scottish;Boise, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sockeye Brewing;I felt like something was missing from this one. It has good appearance with its head, lacing, and amber/brown color. The aroma was pleasant but it foreshadowed what was to come: nothing great. The malt is sweet but subtle. Other flavors are present but very weak. Decent beer, but Josh can do better.
Sockeye Off-Kilter Scottish;Boise, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sockeye Brewing;Aroma is delicious with complex malt and a sweet caramel and light hop nose. Color is dark ruby brown with small head and lacing all the way up. The flavor is has notes of fig and cheese with a startling good balance of sweet malt. The mouthfeel is very light given the flavors, but rounds out everything. Overall this was a great scottish served at one of the best brewpubs in town, another winner from Sockeye.
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;12 ounce bottle at sisters house. Smell sweet. Golden in n color. Small white head. Taste banana, sweetness and wheat. Light bodied and easy to drink. Banana aftertaste. Super nice beer. Cheers!
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;(12 oz bottle, part of a mix 12-pack) AROMA: light nose, some classic hefeweizen aspects, clove/banana/baby-powder, yeast APPEARANCE: moderately hazy, brownish copper yellow, initially a decent white head but it did disappear kinda quick with minimal residual TASTE: bit tart, citrusy and some other tropical fruits, some clove and herbs, undertone of yeast, the wheatness is what lingers PALATE: very crisp and frizzy on the front/tongue, light medium body, tad oily and smooth in the middle, touch of residual bitterness and coating of the inner cheeks OVERALL: not a bad take on the german wheat beer, not as good as Franziskaner (maybe a bit lighter?), but quite drinkable. fair amount of tartness which is refreshing but might be tiresome if you drank more than one. so ... a slightly tart, slightly lighter take on a german hefeweisen that would be nice on a hot day sitting by the pool (and you don't want to drink some tasteless pale lager).
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;On tap at sky dome lounge at double tree DC. Pour was nice deep orange. Taste was very mild with a small hint of banana
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;"At the festival I was at, they advertised this as ""One Love"" but looks like it's the same thing. I wasn't too impressed with this one. Seemed like a sweetened up version of Blue Moon or Shocktop, but I just wasn't feeling the ""love"". My buddy bought us a round, which I was fortunate enough to get the Northern Lights IPA instead. He couldn't finish his One Love, so I drank the rest. Maybe I needed a freshie, or to try it in a bottle or something. After two samples (this One Love and IPA), not so sure that I'll become a big fan of Starr Hill."
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;Bottle. Cloudy, gold in color with a large three finger head. Aroma cloves and bananas. Taste is cloves and bananas.
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;Draft at Macs. Cloudy yellow amber pour with a diminishing head. No lace. Navel oranges. Banana bread. Peach. Clove. Blonde caramels. Lightly toasted malts balanced with mild hops. Easy drinking. Nothing complicated. Bit flat.
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;Pours hazy medium yellow, white head. Aroma is wheaty, cloves, ripe banana, yeast, ripe white fruit. Taste is slightly tangy, lots of ripe fruit, typical wheat bear notes. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy not too heavy. A very pleasant, drinkable beer.
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;(Can) This was the last of the four beers from Starr Hill that I tried, and like the others, I drank it twice before reviewing it: once from a glass, once from a can. Very aromatic, and smells just like a classic hefeweizen...there�s the distinct wheaty aroma, and strong notes of banana and clove. It was evidently so fruity, a fruit fly that was hanging out in my kitchen flew right into the glass after I poured it. When poured, head quickly dissipates, leaving a hazy orangeish-yellow cup with no visible head or even foam residue on top. Carbonation is oddly prickly, leaving sharp sensations on the palate, more like what I expect from seltzer water than beer. Pleasantly light-bodied. Little sweetness, which I like. This beer is eminently refreshing and pleasant to drink on a very hot day. The prickly carbonation is odd and atypical for this style, which I usually think of as being very smooth, but once I got used to it, it was very enjoyable. Probably my favorite beer out of the sampler.
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;Bit flat, wheat-y but no complimentary citrus or banana, which tends to be what makes a wheat beer stand out. Disappointing...
Starr Hill The Love;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Starr Hill Brewery;On tap at Paramount, Birmingham, AL, 3.5.16. Clear-to-hazy blond with a white head. Faint green banana aroma along with faint plastic. Sourish taste. Banana at first and then mild bitterness with a hint of clove. Light body, soft fizz, abrupt fruity finish.
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Tap at saxon pub in Austin with commonmac and the bachelor party crew. Pale gold with small white head. No lacing. Light grain smell. Thin. Not a ton of flavor but crisp and pretty refreshing.
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Found out of can. Pours a clear straw yellow. Really just a hot summer day beer. Nothing unique.
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Great crisp tastes very refreshing on a hot day outside light golden color slightly sweet smell ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);"Even though this is labeled as a lager, it reminded me more of a lighter version of Shiner Bock. Appearance is a thin clear light brown. Taste of caramel malts.....a little metallic....and yeah, watery. Less filling and tastes ""great"". Well, not really ""great"", but ok for a light. Gotta be way better than miller, coors, or bud light. Got in the variety pack, but don't think I would buy again unless I had to switch to light beers."
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);"Poured from 12 oz can into pilsner glass. Appearance: pours a thick 2"" sudsy white head that falls quickly with quite a bit of lacing. Color is clear pale straw with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aroma: malt sweetness and grain husks with even a bit of hop spice. Mouthfeel: light & crisp with a dry finish. Flavor: lightly toasted barley malt, corn sweetness, a slight mineral aspect and enough hop bitterness to actually be detectable. Overall: for a light beer this has a surprising amount of flavor. If I drank light beers on a regular basis I would definitely consider this an option."
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Originally rated on 10/8/2006. For a light beer its not bad, definatley better than most lights, but it is a watered down version of shiner bock. Decent aftertaste and smell is o.k. If you have to drink a light its worth trying.
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);From bottle at dark Continental Club. It�s a beer, I think because it�s a fluid. (Houston 201505)
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);"""Had w dinner. Non offensive but nothing special as expected. If I needed to go light this might be the choice (though Sam Adams is more likely) but I hope that day never comes. Grassy hop aroma that disappears a little on the palate."""
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);355ml twist off. Absolutely watery beer, very similiar to any other light lager in all ways.
Shiner Light;Shiner, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);This beer has a very clear straw yellow color with a light soapy head on top that quickly dissipates. Only a small ring of bubbles is left and lacing is nill. The aroma is light clean and a little bready with the slightest hint of grassy hops. It�s simple, clean and light bodied. Light bready maltiness brings mild sweetness for the light hops to balance. The texture is light and well carbonated but not overly fizzy.
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Clear ruby appearance. Decent tasting. Rich malts with little hop flavor. Finish keeps the malted bitterness. A touch of soured butter. Not bad though.
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;(Tap @ TwoRows Houston, TX): Pours a light brown color, similar to apple cider but clearish. Nearly no head, whitish. Malty apply aroma, watery. Watery apple-y, odd fruit. Somewhat dry-sweet. Not good.
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Pours a watery amber with an aroma of raisin bran. Flavor is spicy with hints of burnt leaves. Watery palate.
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;orange pour with a limited off white head. dampened aroma of vegetation, ivy maybe?taste is watered down caramel with a lingering overcarbonated tongue attack. it hurts a bit. sawdust flavor to boot. a very slick fell to the needles.
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;For a $1 beer, you really can�t complain about this. Clear amber with a decent amount of head (mine was nearing the end of the keg, however). Light aroma that almost struck me as yeasty, but clearly dry and hoppy, like a dandelion or other flowering weed. Thin body. Long, light finish of malt and hops, both discernable. Not at all offensive, there are some commendable elements to report here. (on tap, Greenville Ave. location)
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Tap, Dallas--Thin white head with a dark amber color. Taste came with deep malt flavor throughout the glass. Great on $1.00 pint night, Two Rows best beer by far.
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;I have to eat crow with this one. As much as I rail against the morons who run this place, this beer was actually really good. Just on a whim, I called up there to see if they had anything interesting on tap, and I was right down the street, so I swung in for a pint of this. Beautiful pour- nice white head. Nice malt flavors with a really interesting hint of spice through out the whole pint. I hate to admit it, but I am looking forward to seeking out their next seasonal.
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Poured caramel with thin off white head...smelled sweet and a little roasty...tasted much the same with that same bitterness Nathan and Andrew mentioned...not bad, just a generic style...
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Nothing too spectacular, but good, and drinkable. malt caramel etc. with a good balanced bitter in the finish so that the sweet doesn't get cloying. easy to drink.
TwoRows Octoberfest;Dallas, Texas, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Pretty typical for the style, sweet malts, nuts, caramel, a somewhat bitter aftertaste that lingered on the tongue. Ive seen this recipe many times before.
San Diego McGowans Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;San Diego Brewing Company;On tap at SDBC. Dark brown with creamy light tan head. Sweet chocolate and grainy aroma. Creamy mouth feel, but slightly watery palate. Chocolate roasty taste with a sweet molasses syrup taste to the finish.
San Diego McGowans Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;San Diego Brewing Company;Nitro, San Diego Brewing. Black in color with a thick nitro head. Sweet and malty aroma with a little bit of sour cream. Pretty sweet. Roasted maltiness. A little bit of a burnt finish. Pretty tasty.
San Diego McGowans Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;San Diego Brewing Company;I had this on draft at Pizza Port�s strong ale fest in carlsbad. A nice stout with candy on the nose and mouth and burnt sugar notes set against smoke and molasses. Not bad.
San Diego McGowans Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;San Diego Brewing Company;Draft at SDBC. Poured dark dark brown with a decent head. Lacing was pretty nice too. Aromas of coffee and nuts. Flavors were more complex. Chocloate, more coffee, roasted nuttiness, and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Not too bad.
San Diego McGowans Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;San Diego Brewing Company;Tap. Difficult aroma--minty with some choco-malts. Slight roastiness. Very faint aroma. Mildly hazy mahogany color with a light tan head and a thin appearance. Slight sweetness, a little chocolate roastiness. Finishes thin and slightly roasty. Bleh.
San Diego McGowans Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;San Diego Brewing Company;This stout pours with a dark brown body with red tinting topped by a medium thick head with some lacing. The aroma is slightly sweet yet bitter and very roasty with an odd woody note. The flavor is very similar with less roasty notes. Not to good of a stout. Full bodied, smooth and a touch dry.
San Diego McGowans Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;San Diego Brewing Company;Sampled Pizza Port Real Ale Festival 2003. Black pour with a good chocolate chip cookie colored head. Huge nose redolent of dark and milk chocolate. Unfortunately the flavor didn't match up to the nose. Very sour lactic finish threw everything off in this one.
San Diego McGowans Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;San Diego Brewing Company;Didn't like this. Watery, and the oatmeal-coffee taste was roasted almost to the point of being burned. Looked exactly like the nut brown.
W�rzburger Hofbr�u Sympator Doppelbock;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Tap. Clear reddish amber pour with a white head. Mild pumpernickel, caramel malt - fairly sweet. Just okay.
W�rzburger Hofbr�u Sympator Doppelbock;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bereits im Antrunk entfaltet das Bier einen sehr w�rziges Malzaroma an den sich ein untergeordnter s��er Ton klammert und so die W�rzigkeit unterst�tzt. Im Mittelteil kommt der Hopfen hervor und stellt sich in den Vordergrund. Dennoch wirkt er sehr unwichtig, dagegen wird das Malz etwas erdig und schokoladig und zieht so die Blicke erneut auf sich. Angenehm r�stig-karamellig, dunkelmalzig, aromatisch. Die s��e im Abgang weicht, da sich auch hier das Malz breitmacht und noch einmal seine volumin�se Seite zeigt. Ein sehr gelungener Doppelbock ohne Fehler!
W�rzburger Hofbr�u Sympator Doppelbock;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);19th November 2006 Warning! Early amateur rating! Smooth easy drinking dark beer. Lingering sweet notes and traces of banana. Very nice.
W�rzburger Hofbr�u Sympator Doppelbock;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);(on bottle) Dark orange, white head. Dark caramel sent. Straight forward roasted malts, too sweet and cloying finish. A typical bumper of a D. B, totally overkilled, sugarwise.

Bios Amber Ale;Ertvelde, Belgium;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Draught at Bishops Arms, Gothenburg. Nice white head, hazy orange color. Aroma is a little like weissbier. Thin flavor, a rather mild ale, but not one of my favourites.
Bios Amber Ale;Ertvelde, Belgium;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Draught at The Bishops Arms, Gothenburg. Amber and maybe a bit hazy with a fine head. A yeasty, cider-ish aroma with notes of wormwood. Rather flat and weak flavour. Some hints of fruit or forestberries.
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Hand-pulled pint in the excellent Cock Hotel, Wellington, Shropshire with my Dad on 27th July 2013. Light golden with a thinning white crown. Hop and mixed grain nose, the hops being floral and peppery in nature. Taste was also mixed grains with floral and spicy hop notes: the beer got more dry and bitter with each mouthful, or that�s how it came across to me. OK and thirst quenching: wouldn�t want to drink it all night though.
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Tried this golden ale in the Three Judges, Glasgow in September 2003. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight roast grain note in the short aroma. Resiny thin mouth feel and poor lacing. Pale malts give a smokey malt flavour with dry roasted peanuts and green pepper evident. Very dry spicy hops give a tart aftertaste. This continues into the dry finish. A decent blond ale and ideal for a summer session.
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Cask, Criterion, Leicester. Light gold with a thin foam. Aromas are floral with stewed apple and some caramel. Lemon with tea and hints of sulphur. Flavours are dry and woody with some background caramel sweetness. Grassy and dry with a peppery, bitter finish. A little bit rough but decent overall.
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;"Cask at the Briar Rose, Birmingham, UK on 28th December, 2009. Gold with thin, lasting white lacing head. Hoppy with some peppery notes and grassiness; brief caramel malt interlude before a very dry finish on a zingy texture. Just a hint of saline. Full of condition, very well kept by the pub too!"
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Cask Handpump at the Valley, Scarborough 06/02/2009 Floral aroma. Small white head. Clear golden coloured smooth on the palate and hoppy with a little dryness in a bitter malt finish.
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;"Cask gravity, 2nd Bulkington Beer Festival. Still amber gold. Nose white grape juice, musky hopcone; some wet oaky wood, alcohol, spliff. Rich and full malt character overlaid with citrus and stone fruit. Dryish, slightly boozy and humming softly with citrus hop, grape, mushed-up custard cream, oat and vanilla afters. Satisfying, full and dry. Octo couldn�t leave it alone. Another winner from Beowulf."
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Cask in the market porter. Alround rating: Good balance of fruity lemon hop and some sweeter fruit cake like malt character. Balanced and very drinkable.
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Cask handpull at The Hop Pole Inn, Aylesbury, Bucks, 21-07-09 Pours gold with tight white head. There is a little fruit and malt on the nose, these also appear in the mouth. Surprisingly bitter and a bitterness that lingers, the end is rather dry. Really quite enjoyable. A6 A4 F7 P4 Ov14 3.5
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough Market. Lager gold colour, thin white head. Eggy yeasty aroma. In mouth, its still eggy and a not very intense blond ale. Dull and the aroma isnt great.
Beowulf Chasewater;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;A Mes rate: cask at the Market Porter. Clean gold, good white head and in very good condition. Slight egg on the nose but it�s just about held in check by some decent citric hoppage. I�d love to say more but the flavour is almost identical other than a lick of earthy malt and a developing bitterness in the finish. Straight forward and a little unimaginative.
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;On tap at the Corner Pub. Deep unfiltered brown-black body, steady thin head. Mellow delicate dark malt aroma. Somewhat watery and thin, a standard Porter at best. Sweet mild roasty chocolate tones. Too thin, not so impressive, but still has a little flavor and is quite sessionable. Smooth brown chocolate tones. OK..
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;[Tap] Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. Decent lacing. Aroma of molasses and caramel. The taste is of roasted malts, astringent grains, burnt toffee and some cocoa. Seems a bit thin to me. Nothing offputting here, but I was unimpressed by this one.
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Had about a 7 oz glass of this a couple of weeks ago at the Corner Pub. This is simmilar to the other beers I had of theirs with the exception of the Cream Ale in that they�re watery. This was served with a pale tan, small head and a bit of lace. Color was dark brown. Aroma was a slightly roasty and sweet malt. Flavor was the same and shallow. Body is thin with sharp carbonation. Bit of dark caramel in the finish. Not a lot there. Bartender said it was a local favorite. Not a session beer.
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;On tap at the Wisconsin Micro-Brewer�s Beer Fest. Poured medium-deep brown with a well-retained tan head. The aroma picked up sweeter roasted black patent and grainy notes, leaving an underattenuated impression. The flavor was sweet again with chocolate, black patent, and lesser coffee present at the core.. roasty finish picked up light earthy bitterness and pine. Medium-bodied and dry on the palate with a grainy feel to it.. OK balance, but the flow was off.
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;"On draught at the brewpub in Reedsburg, Wisconsin as simply ""Corner Pub Porter."" Pours a nearly opaque dark brown brew with a decent off-white head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, some roasted nuts, flowery hops and dark bittersweet chocolate. Taste is medium to full bodied, light carbonation, and flavors of sweet dark malt, chocolate dark pitted berries and a touch of coffee. Finish is slightly mild bitter with a dark bread and sour berry aftertaste. Much better than the previous brewmaster�s brew."
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Dark Brown Coloring with Sandy Skink. Faint if Any Aroma. Dry Malt, Coffee Roast Notes. Dry Bitter Aftertaste. Thin Mouthfeel and With all These Brews, Taste Like There�s Sanitation Issues with the Brewing.
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Dark brown color with a medium head. No aroma. Slight coffee and burnt roast taste. Watery body. Oh, here comes the Lysol Patrol again! Can�t have a beer without that wonderful aerosol quality to it! Ugh.
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Opulent chestnut brown in color with some sort of thin tan splotch in the center and on the edges. Aroma of birch, toasty graham crackers and a chocolate confectionary block. Creamy body at first, then slips into a coma of moderation. Cocoa syrup, chocolate morsels and maybe a dash of instant coffee. If I had a dollar for every brewpub stout/porter that tasted exactly like this, I�d be a rich, rich man.
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;On tap at the pub. Dark brown color with almost no head. Very thin feel, an Ok porter.
Corner Pub Black Beauty Porter;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Festival tap: deep brown with smokey nose. Some vinous flavor, vanilla. Light all around. finishes peaty again with anice hints.
Leek Tittesworth Tipple;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);[i] [b] Bottle that dad bought along this week having purchased from a bottle shop in Belper, 08-04-08 [/i] [/b] Exploded out of the bottle in quite impressive fashion. Once it settled it was medium gold with a haziness to it. This tastes like a decent IPA and nothing like a wheat, whatever it is very good and really surprised me for a Leek beer which are often quite hit and miss. Good hoppy bite to this and lingering bitterness, maybe there is some spice on the nose but its subtle. Its a damn good beer, very tasty and I will search out for it again
Leek Tittesworth Tipple;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Cask Stillage at Wilkie�s Tavern, Warrington 30/11/2003 Golden coloured hoppy and creamy on the palate. Fruit flavours. Slightly bitter lasting finish.
Leek Tittesworth Tipple;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Despite careful pouring ended up with a cloudy pint. Orange colour with a lasting off-white head, and good lacing. Aroma is spicey, orange, and wheat. Refreshing wheaty taste, with a nice acidic touch and a lively mouthfeel. The alcohol is not particularly apparent. A good wheatbeer.
Leek Tittesworth Tipple;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);This brewery can be very inconsistent with its bottled beers but this one is superb.The wheat taste is pleasant without being overpowering and encourages to drink more of this lovely beer. At last Leek Brewery have got it right and whats more produced a British wheat beer to be proud off.
Leek Tittesworth Tipple;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Bottle Conditioned. BBE Nov 04. Orange gold colour with a wheat enhanced head which soon settles. Some spicy wheat notes and an orange sweetness. Earthy hops in the finish. Quite fragrant and pleasant, but hasn�t quite lifted me off my seat. The interplay between the lighter more floral and citric notes and the later heavier, more typically British hops is not to my taste. I�m drinking one beer which is light and pleasant and quite girly, but I�m finishing with something more dirty and honest and male. The abv is not immediately apparant, but eventual starts to go to the head. Interesting, and some may like this more than I did. Best served a little cold.
Leek Tittesworth Tipple;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Bronze coloured. Has a spicy IPA-like aroma - Unlike a wheat really. Still this is a refreshing, very bitter, dry wheat beer. English wheat beer should be a style of its own. Not many are better than this.
Vlaamsche Leeuw Tripel;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Mooi geel bier met schuim. Smaak is bitterzoet en licht kruidig met iets van anijs en graan. Erg goed bier met een fijne bittere nasmaak.

Vlaamsche Leeuw Tripel;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;33cl bottle. A clear pale golden beer with a huge most good lasting white head. Aroma of strong mid sweet fruits, strong pale malt, some belgian yeast. Taste of strong pale malt, yellow fruits, stone fruits, some yeast, okay!

De Dolle Zannekin;Diksmuide, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Dolle Brouwers;Bottle brought back from Lampernisse in West-Flanders, thanks to Jan! Surprised to see it's been retired now... Pours clear golden with a frothy, diminishing, white head. The aroma contains grapes, apple, honey, herbs, hops & spices and flowers (especially in the smell). It tastes light fruity/flowery sweet and medium spicy bitter, with a herbal finish. Medium body, slick texture, fizzy carbonation. Not my style but interesting nonetheless.
De Dolle Zannekin;Diksmuide, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Dolle Brouwers;Tasted at the Kulminator years ago, this is apparently a beer Dolle Brouwers makes for a French customer and with 10% white wine added. Though the aroma typically reveals DDB yeastiness, maltiness and hoppiness, the white wine does come through, and strangely, it does seem to fit in well (I�d expected a lot more conflict in taste). One of the weirdest beers I tasted from this brewery, interesting, but not my favorite Dolle Brouwers product.
De Dolle Zannekin;Diksmuide, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Dolle Brouwers;Bottle (thanks DA for sharing_... Poured hazy, golden amber with a thin head. Spicy yeasts, some awkward fermented flavors. Biscuity malt, light fruits. Vinous and boozy. This one didn�t do it for me.
De Dolle Zannekin;Diksmuide, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Dolle Brouwers;De dolle zannephin. 330cl bottle.. thanks to jeppe for pouring some of this retired de dolle offering.. Pours a hazy cidery orange brown and a thin frothy white head... Aroma of pungent wine, yeast, and a little bit of oxidation... Flavors are semi-sweet. Light on the wine, sherry-like with mild oxidation. Body has thinned out some. Interesting. 7/3/6/2/13
Schmieheim Hieronymus Unfiltriert Naturtr�b;Kippenheim, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Schlossbrauerei St�ckle Schmieheim;Creamy head, cloudy yellow to orange haze.

Schmieheim Schl�ssle (Gepflegtes Pils);Kippenheim, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schlossbrauerei St�ckle Schmieheim;(bottle) clear golden colour with a frothy white head. aroma of floral hops and straw, slightly rustic, with a touch of bran flakes and some lemon peel. flavour is mostly pale malts and potato starch, slightly meaty, with some more bran flakes and a light-bitter herbal-hoppy finish. surprisingly full-bodied with average carbonation.
Schmieheim Schl�ssle (Gepflegtes Pils);Kippenheim, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schlossbrauerei St�ckle Schmieheim;"330ml bottle [Thanx to bartlebier, who�s neither ""phlegmatic"" nor ""Flegel"", but knows to appreciate a ""gepflegtes"" beer]. Clear, yellow-ish golden colour with average, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Minimally malt spicy, grassy hoppy aroma, a touch of hay and dry, woody, yellow apple. Taste is minmally strawy, grainy, a touch of protein, subtle pale malty sweetness. As the ambiguity of ""gepflegt"" leaves the field open for a wider range of interpretations, maybe the proper understanding here is in the sense of maintained custom instead of cultivation and care. Not bad, though."

The beer has got a deep golden colour with an low airy head and medium body. Aroma of hops and grass, followed by a taste of hops, citrus fruits, grass, white bread and light malt. Easy drinakble and refreshing - solid Pils.
Schmieheim Schl�ssle (Gepflegtes Pils);Kippenheim, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schlossbrauerei St�ckle Schmieheim;"Bottle(kindly donated by Quack-Duck!): Pale golden to golden, clear, small and stable white head; dryish grainy nose bitter and honeyish background plus a very slight metallic tinge; moderately dry bitter-sweet flavour, relatively soft, light bodied, but not watery ; slightly lingering dryish herbal-hoppy nose. Nothing special, but still O.K. �"
Schmieheim Schl�ssle (Gepflegtes Pils);Kippenheim, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schlossbrauerei St�ckle Schmieheim;Thanks to quack-duck for that one! Bottle looks good. Beer in the glass zippy, small head. Starts mild, malty, spicy, grasy, light sourish notes. Modest dry background. Finish moldy-malty, still some grasy notes. Okay.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Bottle in the Poconos with Caressa, Apollo, and the wife. Deep amber pour. Aroma of sweet malt and dark bread. Toasty malt flavor, earthy, caramel, with a grassy hop finish. Great fall beer.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn 12/16/2005: Pours a clear deep copper with a thin off-white head. Sweet toasty caramel aroma has a touch of honey and German yeast. Starts with a sweet dark caramel maltiness, some sticky honey flavor and a mild noble hoppiness. Finishes clean, malty and enjoyable with a touch of light fruit. Brewed true to style.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Curiously, I liked this one quite a bit. My first altbier, I wasn�t expecting the hop attack that I got. It wasn�t an american citric bitter attack, but rather a very pleasant German attack. Nice nutty taste, hazelnuts and walnuts, followed by that spicey bitterness. Very nice. I�d like to try more alts now.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Clybourn. Mostly translucent with an attractive creamy khaki head pocked with bubbles at one end. Caramel laden aroma met with copper, hazelnut shells, barnyard fence posts and a burlap bag of barley. Quite a hoppy rendition, tipped off by flavor revolving around moderate spruce and a mildly toasted grain bill. Some husky traits and other tributes to the simple life (autumn dampness beneath a raked pile of leaves, and basement paneling.) Mild hazelnut coffee sweetener gives the biggest suggestion to the traditionally malt driven style trait. Unique take on the style, and enjoyable at that.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Dry hopped cask version at Clybourn. Deep mahogany brown. Nice hoppy smell over lightly toasted brown malts. Smell carries through to the taste. Like a nut brown ale with a nice overload of German hops. A good aftertaste. I thought the cask serving worked well with this blend of flavors.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. Dark amber with a foamy tan head. Aroma of malts with hints of floral hops. The taste followed with some burnt undertones and a nice hoppy finish. A good beer.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cask conditioned version: I think this is a case where the conditioning took the oomph out of the beer, the other raters finding it to be a much livelier drink. Pouring a deep but light brown body with a creamy tan head that did good lacing, it nonetheless had little carbonation remaining. The aroma was quite malty, slightly fruity, and had a hint of smokey woodiness to it. Fairly thin in the mouth, it had a roasted malt flavor with a touch of berries and a trace of muted hops. The finish was the best part, malty and smokey. Goose Island Beer Company - Clybourn, Chicago, IL
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled on Tap at GI Clybourne Ah, a Sticke, my first I believe, can it live up to the regular Alts that I have sampled in Dusseldorf. The beer is a deep amber color and is quite clear, it is topped by a thin tan head. The aroma is fruity and herbal with notes of fruitcake, toasted grain, and strawberries. The taste is light and refreshing, yet full of flavor. It is sweet and has a toasted malt finish to it that seems appropriate. There is a solid fruity component throughout this beer (strawberry again, but also plum and raisin), and it also has a nice bitter finish to it. The hops are certainly here, yet they are not nearly as prominent as my favorite regular Alts. The maltiness is in full force though, with the fruity spicy hop notes acting in an accentuating/ supporting role to the malt. This is really quite an enjoyable beer, even though I was hoping for something a bit more hoppy.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);5 oz sample at the Clybourn location. Darkish red brick/dull brown with just a touch of off-white head...big woody nose full of cherry and brown sugar sweetness...in the body, fruity, caramelly, sweetly bready with smoky deep maltiness, juicy late orangy hops and just enough finishing dryness to keep the sticky wetness from overwhelming. I�m impressed.
Goose Island Sticke Alt;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Quite a nice alt but not really what I consider ""authentic"" for the style (not that I care) with a sort of american hop flavor with some citrus notes."
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pretty decent, nothing special or bad about this one. Wheat and some light spice from rye present. Nice amber malt flavors and color. Medium body. Refreshing.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Bottled. Nice dark brown. Has a sweet malty taste. With a piney nutty after taste. Really good dark ale.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);From the 12 fl oz bottle. Renewed for 2015. It looks nice with its mahogany amber pour underneath a modest cream colored head.Great clarity. Aroma - Mild roasted malts with a kind of plum and peat moss character in there too., Light to medium body but astringent. Roasted malt sweetness in the taste at first but the peat moss and even a touch of overripe fruit notes kick in to bring this to a bitter finish. Interesting but not unique. Reasonably drinking.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. Pours a clear somewhat red/auburn, glowing, small frothy white head. Aroma is pungent, moderately sweet, apple spice, Belgian yeast, estery, sharp banana, strong and sharp clove, light grassy edge, nutty, vegetables trailing off. Flavor follows, sweet, sticky, quite hot, estery, nutty, weird yeasty, tea-like bitterness. Medium bodied, noticeable alcohol, smooth fine carbonation, heavy.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On Tap @ Clybourn location. I don�t know, this one kinda had me guessing at the style, it was kinda of an in betweener of a begian ale, brown, ASA. Had some yeast but also nutty. Pours a nice orangish-brown, foamy head, malty aroma, taste is very malty and of dried dark fruits, yeast presence but lightly. Bitter aftertaste. An o.k. brew.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Interesting brew. On tap @ Goose Cly. Pours reddish brown with small off white head. Aroma of spices, sweet malt, touch of hops. Good flavor, spices and sweet malt mainly.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft sampler, Nov. 1. Another punchy amber ale with a mild snout full of American hops. Specialty malts give it a more spicy tone that sets it a little more apart.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at GI Clybourn. Actually a Belgian strong ale. Pours a deep red-brown. Nose is very nicely hopped with some spice and pine. Taste is super grainy/spicy. Very clean tasting with a kiss of citrus, though the rye does dominate, a bit of sweetness from the corn as well. Finish is dry rye. Nice.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);tap at goose island clybourn.... semi-clear caramel brown pour with a slight off-white head.... aroma of corn and grains, sweeter malts, and a little grass... flavors deeply embedded with grains and caramel maltiness that finishes with a slight spicy bitterness. thin layer of spicy rye throughout. medium carbonation and average mouthfeel.
Goose Island Autumn Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);I wasnt a real big fan of this draft. I usually like rye beers but this was a little too spicy. Alsmost grainy. It a nice creamy feel to it and looked great in the snifter, but the mix of rye and oats didnt really do it for me.

Olde Swan Bumblehole;Netherton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Olde Swan;"Cask (backlog). Golden colour with a small white head, which vanishes quite quickly. Aroma is mild wood, resin, some slight herbal and floral notes along with some sweet malts and mild nutty notes. Flavour is resin, wood, some herbal, earthy and grassy notes. Balanced, but nothing ""extraordinary"" when it comes to an ESB."
Olde Swan Bumblehole;Netherton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Olde Swan;On cask at Olde Swan, Netherton. Pours golden honey amber with white head. Quite a sticky ESB, hint of honey, silky smooth, nice hop kick. Good stuff.

Olde Swan Bumblehole;Netherton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Olde Swan;Lovely beer. It just really is. Smooth, full of flavour, lovely appearance and satisfying finish. Bitter, malty, rich. I love this beer. The only problem is that you wouldn�t guess it was 5.2% and it goes down too well!

Bitter End Fulmers ESB;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. No joke, people...""Fulmers ESB"". Light amber, small head. Twinge of lemon in the nose. Very malty taste, perhaps a bit excessively so...but I'm not much of an ESB fan in the first place. Drinkable."
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This beer poured really yellow, with a nice head with good retention. Pleasing bitterness, smooth and complex for such a yellow yellow beer!
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On tap. I thought this was kinda lame. Aroma was not very pronounced. Taste was a bit grainy and of hops. Was actually quite full bodied in the mouth. Overall, not bad.
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pour is bright clear yellow with a thin small white head...faint aroma of grain...mildly sweet taste with a gritty mouthfeel...crisp finish...
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pours a nice pale blonde, but there is no aroma to speak of. Flavor is a nice array of hops rounded out by a tart malt aftertaste. Palate is watery and slightly slippery. Overall, this is a good session beer.
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Decent if not mind blowing. Well made with no off flavors and good a nice maltiness to carry the bitter forward. Would enjoy throwing some more hops in there for both aroma and bitering, but this is an easy drinking one that might serve to convert the ""lesser"" people. (heehee)"
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at the brewpub. Light golden appearance, good, thick fluffy head. Aroma has some fresh lake water aroma accents. Has a bit of honey accents in the flavor. Smooth, agreeable mouthfeel. Overall, a most decent Pils.
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Crystal clear straw yellow. Not much head but good lacing.. Slight malt nose. Very smooth and clean tasting. A well balanced beer. Dry finish.
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This is essentially a well hopped Pils. Its on tap right this very moment at the bitter end and it is really not that bad. Much like a lonestar in the body...which I kind of like...but with the added plus of good lager yeast and a healthy amount of hops. Good brew Grat
Bitter End Single Star Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. From the brewery that brought you ""Fulmers ESB"" and ""Phlatt Tyre"", it's Single Star. I'm guessing this is a take on Lone Star? I kinda wish they wouldn't do this, because it has the connotation of being inferior to the big-name brands, like those sodas that have names like ""Dr. B"" or ""Stars Up"". This stuff kicks the crap out of Lone Star!! Pale, golden, a bit fizzy. Not much of a discernable nose: hints of malt, not much else. But it gets points for being a pils with no adjuncts or skunk in the nose or flavor. Curiously thick mouthfeel considering the smooth taste...this might not be world class but I don't see how budcoorsmiller drinkers could not absolutely love this stuff; it's their beer minus the crap. I bet it sells very well."
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Tap at Feral. Not much to say here. Doesnt quite compare to most of their beers. A tad farmhousey with some lingering citrus. Quite boring but easily sessionable if you�re looking for something like this brew
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Funny piss like smell. Lots of carbonation. THe taste is actually a reasonable approximation of the style, but the piss comes through again, which is a bit off putting. Solid but needs work.
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);"Tap, listed as 4.3% ABV. Just hazy gold with a lovely white mousse-y head. Aroma of honey, flowers, peel, coriander. Light-bodied. Tasting reveals the ""honey"" as palm sugar - unusual and it works. Sweet with some sourness (not obviously less than Funkie Junkie) and spices. Finishes slightly sweet and quite spicy. Good."
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);on tap, brewtopia06. labelled provencal. hazy golden with a sure, bulbous head. big dupont yeast and custard aroma. great mix of flavours - dry leaves, white grape, assorted citric peel with a tart finish. i thought this was the best oz attempt to brew a belgian style ale that i�ve had the good fortune to try
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);A good effort by Feral. Nice acidic tartness. Good spicing. I can�t wait to have it again. AIBA 2006
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);"1, 3, heck I lost count schooners of IIPA and a side of ploughman�s lunch may have obscured my tasting of this, but I ordered a pint to make sure my tasting wasn�t too offside. I see my notes don�t match the others which also don�t match each other, meaning this beer has changed over the years. Poured a hazy, pale sunny gold with a very thin short listed white layer of bubbles that managed a leg or two. Alongside the IIPA the aroma for this one was disappointing with only a light apple peal, clove and herbal note that I could have mistook for a Scrumpy in a blind tasting. Tight, watery and softly tart in the mouth. Apples and cloves are still oddly prominent; no malt is there, seems to have soured. No real sweetness. Quite fresh, but watery without definition and actually becomes clammy as it begins to warm. Souring milk, pulped tomatoes and apples make the palate as the spritzy carbonation wanes. Finish is short and only shows some watered down apple cordial. Not the best, especially after the magnificent IIPA. I suppose it was still braindeadedly sessionable. Weird. One to try again!!!"
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Hazy orange, wheaty with some citrus and spice, light palate. Similar character to a heffeweissen but not as estery. A pleasant summer beer.
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Hazy amber orange with a small short lasting off white head. Aroma is very faint spicey and malty sweet. Lowcarb thin body. Candy malt sweetness dominates the flavour overwhelming everything else. Good to see a small brewery trying something different. I don�t think it really quite worked out.
Feral Farmhouse Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Wanted to try the stout but this was there replacement for the summer. I think I would have preferred the stout though. Cloudy orange colour with no head and no lacing. The highest in alcohol of their lot and that didn�t make it the best. Glad I tried it last as it was too sweet for me to have anymore beer afterwards. Re-rate 30/07/06. Once again wanted to try something else but settled for this when it was not available. Anyway this deserves a better rating than my original rant, it hasn�t changed much in taste but head and lacing were now present and still quite filling.
S�vde �pplesider;S�vde, Sweden;Apple Cider;S�vde Musteri;Bottled, from Folk�lsbutiken, Stockholm. Clear pale yellow. Green apples and notes of lemon up front. Tart, light and spritzy. Concentrated green apples, notes of winegums.

S�vde �pplesider;S�vde, Sweden;Apple Cider;S�vde Musteri;A very natural and tasty cider. Not very strong, but still lots of flavour. Not too sparkling, as Swedish cider often is.
Turtle Mountain Golden Ale;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery, golden color with vanishing head and lace. Some hops and bread in the aroma. Medium-body, not much malt depth of flavor on the palate. Watery finish. I wanted more citrusy notes, malty sweetness and body in this American Golden Ale.
Turtle Mountain Golden Ale;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Pours golden with a nice head and a good dry hop aroma but nothing over-powering. Drinkable but maybe a little too lite. Good but not great.
Turtle Mountain Golden Ale;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Golden-honey color. Has characteristics of fresh grapes, honeysuckle, and flowery hops. Actually quite hoppy compared to most blond ales which is quite nice. The best beer for this style that I've had.
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;cloudy light brown / orange. nose is snappy orange oil and citrus acid and juice. focused hops are moderately resin-heavy sitting on top of hints of nutty malt. bit too full-bodied and big for what it�s presenting.
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;This is the TMBC IPA. Had at the ABQ beer fest Oct�11. Muddled color, burnt orange. Juicy fruity aromas of papaya, but also smells chewy. Has a silky palate, and a toasty finish. A nice balance overall but seems dull next to the Citra IPA, which seemed fresher as well as more characterful.
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Orange-amber with a nice lasting disc of foam. Citrus, caramel and resin nose. Flavor is a great blend of the same. Light-medium body is sessionably watery and tingly with hops and carbonation.
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Poured deep orange with a white wispy thin head. Big pine hop aroma. Grapefruit and floral flavor, dry finish, a touch astringent but all in all a really fine full bodied IPA
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;from a 36 hour old dead flat growler... still it pours hazy a burnt sienna color. the nose is really spicy and stinky with hops, caramel, dirt, peaches and flowers. the palate is dry and has a nice bitterness on the finish. the flavor matches the aroma and adds some orange and grapefruit. the mouth feel is slick though it is dead flat. quite full bodied.... 6/4/6/4/15/3.5
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Nice aroma coming from a descent head. Color is a good copper-golden hue and the bite is noticeable. Nice finish, definitely one of the better IPAs in Albuquerque.
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Deep caramel colored pour, small off-white head. Nice citrus hop nose, maybe a bit subdued. A touch to thick for the style IMO, carbonation is right on. Nice flavor, good grapefruit hoppiness, nice bitter finish. Maybe just a touch sweet in the end.
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Solid amber with the merest of bubbly head. Nice piney hop aroma. Starts out OK but the roll off the palate results in a weird dirt-tinged earthiness. Haven�t been to TMBC in a while, but I was disappointed. #2469
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;tap at brewpub-great citrus aroma with some toasty malts to compliment these wonderful hops. great balance! hops and malts mesh very well together. creamy mouthfeal. full bodied but soft. Fantastic IPA!
Turtle Mountain IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;"Draft. Cookie, caramel, toasted light bread malt (ML); grapefruit, piney hops (M); maybe a little bit of apricot. Thin, creamy, off-white head is slowly diminishing and sits on a deep orange-amber body. Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a heavly bitter, lightly acidic finish. Medium-heavy body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. The bottom line is: nicely aggressive without being overly acidic...creamy to boot!"
Turtle Mountain Dunkel;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Clear, dark copper body with a nice velvety off-white head. Aroma of caramel, butterscotch, nuts, and some grape notes. Nicely sweet with just enough balancing hop character and bitterness. Subdued and pleasant.
Turtle Mountain Steam;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;"On tap at Hallenbrick Brewery. Pours a clear amber brown with a small white head. Aroma of sweet malt, sweet fruits, and bready malt. Flavor of sweet malt, caramel, oatmeal, and sugars. Decent APA (not sure why they call it ""Steam""). 7/4/7/3/14 [3.5/5]"
Turtle Mountain Steam;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;from a 36 hour old growler... fairly dark copper hued brown with a small off white head. the aroma is really hoppy with a sizable malt background... dirty spicy hops mix with some citrus pith, caramel and flowers. the flavor of chocolate shows p as it warms... before it does... caramel, citrus pith, flowers, peaches, dirty earthy hops and a very dry slightly resinous finish. hoppiness sticks around to parch to palate. it is quite full bodied from the maltiness yet it is not sweet. it has some oomph to the mouth feel. this pairs great with food and reminds me a lot of four peaks steam... 7/4/7/4/16/3.8
Turtle Mountain Steam;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;ReRate-Tap at brewpub-11/20/043 pours a copper hue with no head whatsoever. citric hop aroma with a touch of caramel sweetness. the beer has suffered from a flimsy watery palate. very low carbonation. buttery hops. another TMBC beer suffering from diacytl. tap at brewpub-pours a nice amber hue with minimal head. very hoppy aroma for a steam beer. piney, citrus hops with toasty malts. Kinda reminds me of SNCA, but this is a Lager? Crazy!!! rating 3.7
Turtle Mountain Steam;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Deep copper-colored beer with a thin sticky head. This is a super well balanced malt-hoppy goodness with a tannic finish. I think this beer rocked!
Turtle Mountain Steam;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Poured a clear amber with a thin head. I probably had palate fatigue but this tasted like the Red Rye. Hoppy aroma and flavor with a bitter finish. Nice.
Turtle Mountain Steam;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;A great session brew with a dark amber body. Creamy head with the aroma of fresh cascades. Might be brewed in the same manner as anchor steam but is far darker with a lot more character. I drank two of their liter mugs of this. re-rate 3/18/04: Found out that its' made with 1056 but is cold conditioned. Lots of hoppiness and could easily pass for an ESB. A great seesion brew!
Turtle Mountain Steam;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Copper body and nice hop spice in this beer. Darker, bigger body, and hoppier than any steam beer that I've encountered. A good food beer.
Turtle Mountain Heather Scotch;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;A deep brown with a creamy head. Very woody nose with hints of heather. Very nicely made and fairly clean for a Scottish ale. Very nice, I got a whole Growler!
Turtle Mountain Heather Scotch;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;A bronze color beer with warm caramel and toffee maltiness and some nice woody tones. Soft palate. A quality beer.

Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Smells like nothing with a hint of dirt. Taste: some rye, some soapy and woody hops. Malt character is dirty old biscuits.
Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Amber, bright. Lightly fruity, chewy aroma. Sweet with a hint of rye late. Sticky caramels.
Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Draft @ brewpub. Nice glowing amber color. Decent lacing. Malty throughout with a nice level of chewiness. The caramel flavors works here. Solid, quite like it.
Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear orange with a white head. Aroma of sweet malt, indistinct. Flavor of sweet malt, a hint of rye but it�s a very sweet rye with some oatmeal. Light, sweet, and drinkable. Just ok for me. 6/4/7/4/14 [3.5/5]
Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Draft at the new brewpub. Copper-amber with a lasting ring of creamy bubbles. Nose of spicy caramel and resin. Taste is caramel, spicy grain, green herb, and light resin. Light-medium body is smooth and well-balanced with a crisp peppery rye and hop finish.
Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub, alhough, with the brewing equipment gone, I guess this is just the restaurant now. Anyway, this red pour had some head, but not much by the time it got to our table. The rye was apparent right off the bat which is great for the style. The spicy rye was also in the flavor along with decent malt backing and a nice hop bitterness. A good Rye Beer.
Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Deep amber with aromas of caramel and rye. Definitely more than 20 IBUs, although Mark always underestimates. A nice caramel sweetness that rounds out the rye spice and the ending hop bite. Slight diacetyl, but nothing offensive.
Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;ReRate-brewpub 11/20/04-pours an orange hue with no head. Thin body and light mouthfeal. some hops, but very limp. what happend to this beer? This used to be a very good rye.... tap at brewpub-pours a copper hue with nice carbonation and lacing. rye/roasted and citrus hops aroma. strong, dry rye malt flavors almost salty due to the rye malts. Pretty good!-rating 3.5
Turtle Mountain Red Rye;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Copper-red and smooth. Lightly carameled, but not as syrupy as a Fest might be, for example. Light alternative.
Turtle Mountain American Wheat;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;On draught at brewpub. Pours a clear pale straw color with a white head and lace. Light bodied. Soft, wheaty flavor and mellow mouthfeel. Mild hop flavor and bitterness lasts into finish. Well-carbonated. A nice light beer.
Turtle Mountain American Wheat;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Nice golden pear color with filtered clarity. Aroma of grapes and buttery diacetyl. Seems inappropriate for the style. Sugary sweetness and very low bitterness. No yeast complexity due to filtration, of course. I'm just not a fan of this style.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);This starts out pretty decent, with a mix of pumpkin and nutmeg but they both just kind of overpower at the end. Not bad, but not my favorite.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Can sample at a tasting at troubles' place. Thanks Stas. Dark brown, Winter spices, pumpkin, caramel, some nuts, a bit of chocolate, sweet, medium-bodied.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Can pours a clear brown color with amber highlights. Off white head that vanished with a blink of an eye, no lace in sight. Aromas of clove, ginger, black licorice,cooked brown sugar and minerals. Tastes of traditional pumpkin pie spices as stated above with ginger and RC cola, with just a hint of toasted bread and the minerals again. Light to medium body, tingly carbonation, watery mouthfeel and a spicy cola like finish. Overall the spices are subtle but the body of this beer is weak. It�s easy to drink because it�s not to heavy or cloying but nothing special. Average fall beer. I should have cut and pasted wedgie9�s rating below because he/she nailed it! Would�ve saved myself 10 minutes of my life. Of course that would be plagiarism! Lol!!!
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Cola appearance with a browned caramel head. Dusty allspice and ginger dominate the nose. The body is of moderate pumpkin, allspice, ginger, and perhaps some other traditional spices. Solid.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Tasted on 9/27/16 from a 12oz can purchased at Sun Devil. Pours dark, but clear deep brown with a thick, fizzy beige head that quickly recedes to nothing at all. The nose is some light cinnamon bread with just a hint of roast. The flavor is almost like a cinnamon cola with just a light hint of bitterness. The body is light and watery with fizzy carbonation, and a medium lightly bitter and spiced finish.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft at South Rims. Aroma of pumpkin and mildly roasted malt. Flavor of sweet pumpkin, cherry and soft caramel. Nice.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Ah yes. Fall in the desert!! Doesn't leave much to turning leaves and colder nights, but it does bring out this delicious seasonal brew! Used to be only available on premises and during the month of October. Now available in cans, year round... It still screams fall to me! Well balanced. Refreshing for a porter. Great aroma without being over burdened with spices. Clean finish and not bitter.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap with lunch at Cornish Pasty Co. Dark brown pour with just a slight head. Well made porter, hitting all the right notes with the pumpkin being subtle, which I really appreciated.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Canned beer that is more widely available now. Nice dark color, smell of pumpkin spice, malty goodness but not too sweet. Nice pumpkin flavor in a porter style that is not heavily roasted. Great beer for the fall.
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft in Cave Creek. Pours cola brown with a fizzy off white head. Tastes like dry roasted pumpkin, cinnamon, light sugary sweetness, toasted malt. Light body and low carbonation. Smells like sweet roasted pumpkin, roasted malt, light cinnamon, and light vegetable.

Glazen Toren Slagersbier Blond;Erpe-Mere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kleinbrouwerij De Glazen Toren;Bottle (sip) @ Akkurat, Stockholm 30 June, 2005. Golden with a lot of wheat beer character. Bananas, pistage, vanilla, citrus and rather sweet.
Glazen Toren Slagersbier Blond;Erpe-Mere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kleinbrouwerij De Glazen Toren;Bottled, brewed by De Proef, according to Akkurat. Lightly hazy golden, small head. Estery yeasty banana aroma. Sweet and lively with balanced sweetness. The intense estery nose is followed by a clean, rounded body, and there�s a mere hint of grassy hops. Fresh and with obvious wheat malt character.
Glazen Toren Slagersbier Blond;Erpe-Mere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kleinbrouwerij De Glazen Toren;Bottle Clear, blond body. Fizzy, white head, mostly diminishing. No lace. Yeast aroma. Lightly bitter flavour. Some anise in the finish. Not bad, but rather dimensionless.
Glazen Toren Slagersbier Blond;Erpe-Mere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kleinbrouwerij De Glazen Toren;(bottled, 0.75l) Pale blonde color. Mild, yeasty aroma. Soft and pleasant taste, medium-bodied. Reasonably nice Belgian, but easily forgettable.
Glazen Toren Slagersbier Blond;Erpe-Mere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kleinbrouwerij De Glazen Toren;"(Brewed at De Graal for the beginning Kleinbrouwerij De Glazen Toren.) Pale hazy orange; yellowish thick head, dissipating, lacey. Nose with crystal malt, cookies, citrussy hops. Quite bitter taste. Both pale and coloured malts very obvious but the refreshing, again citrussy bitterness is clearly hoppy in style. Fruity finish with also a sweetish peanut-like flavour. Well-bodied. Alcoholic mouthflavour and aftertaste, orange-liqueur like. A rather typical strong Belgian ale. The citrus hops at the start stand for the individual Jef van den Steen touch. Yet, it is a beer where I like the individual things, and less the overall result."
Legend Rye;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Legend Brewing Company;Draft - Copper colored body with white head. This was a unique twist on a Pale and is very well done. The spicy malt flavor mixes well with the hoppiness of the beer. Very refreshing.
Legend Rye;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Legend Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub on 07/16/2008. This was their Rye Pale Ale, so this may not be entered under the proper entry, but I�ll confirm more later. Clear golden orange body with a large foamy off-white head. Light rye and grain aroma with light floral hints. Rye flavor, some grain and some floral and citrus hops. Medium body with moderate carbonation.
Legend Rye;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Legend Brewing Company;On draft at the brewery. They called it their RyePA. Pours an orange-copper with decent eggshell head. Light floral hop aroma. Grainy with a hop bite in the finish and a hint of pine. Medium body, with medium carbonation. A bit tannic in the finish. Didn�t care fo rit too much
Legend Rye;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Legend Brewing Company;"Hazy golden color with a substantial white head. Piney hop aroma and mild malt aroma. Acidic, dry and full bodied. Malty, not overwhelmingly ""ryeish"", but it does have quite a thick, enjoyable, full mouthfeel. Very pleasant."
Legend Rye;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Legend Brewing Company;This beer was ordered as a pint on tap at a bar. The head was modest and slowly disappeared. The beer had a good clean taste that lingered. The coppery color complimented the drink. The finish had a hint of hops and some malt.
Legend Rye;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Legend Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub, pretty copper color with a very nice looking head, rye really seems to help in this area for some reason. Faint aroma, a touch of pepper. Flavor was of pepper, a bit of smokiness, and a malt sweetness. Sweeter than I would have expected, especially considering the slightly acidic finish. Quite nice with food.
Legend Rye;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Legend Brewing Company;Bottled version. Pours a copper body with a medium tan head. Nose was somewhat thin. Some rye, definite malt, light hops and smoked wood. The taste was excellent. The light rye and malt mixed with a lighter hop body and a smooth finish. Seemed more like an Octoberfest beer to me. Good stuff though!
Legend Rye;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Legend Brewing Company;On tap at brewery: Amber hue with a good creamy white head and excellent lace. The aroma was faint, really had the stick my nose in this one to fully detect the smell. What I found was rye (of course), toasted malt, aromatic hops, slight hint of smoke and dust. The taste made my effort worth it. Very good balance between sweet and bitter tones, crisp and clean mouthfeel. The rye character makes it presence known more toward the acidic and bitter finish. Pretty nice brew which works well with spicy lunch I had.
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;The aroma keeps this from being a better than average diet beer. There seems to be gasoline in it. I don�t taste it but that along with corn and alcohol seem to be in the aroma. The appearance is super typical and not worth mentioning. The flavor on the other hand is another story. If you can hold your nose its better than some low cal/low carb beers out there. Mostly it tastes like malt but it�s not offensive. The palate is super thin. The brewer needs to work on the aroma of this one.
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Dull light yellow color with a modest white head. Dry malt aroma, actually more of a sake aroma. Devoid of flavor, well except for cardboard, corn, dry grass and hint of oats. fairly thin and fizzy as expected. Stop the insanity.
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Thin rocky head with low carbonation. Smells like rotting grass and maybe a bit of moldy corn. Pale gold in color. Flavor, what little there is, is offensive. Fizzy, watery, moldy, crap. Finish is slightly dry. Man these ""low carb"" beers suck!"
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Done in a simply tragic side-by-side with Rock Green Light. Why? They were cheap, I had both, and I apparently have some significant issues with self-loathing I need to contact a beer therapist about. Barely colored, just a hint of gold. Was apparently brewed for those who tragically lost their noses in industrial accidents, as it smells like nothing whatsoever. Flavor is a bit there, sweet, some adjuncts. I guess it�s kind of fruity. Really thin, a bit obnoxiously fizzy. No malts. No hops. It�s apparently designed to Accel-erate the drain pour process.
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Wow - really really light. No head. Strange fruity aroma, tones of blueberry and banana? Very light fizzy beery soda water flavor. Off-bitter finish. No redeeming characteristics at all.
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Minimal fizzy head, almost clear. Thin watery, not much of any kind flavour. There was almost nothing here to taste.
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Mildly fruity aroma with hints of mint. Very pale. No head. Carbonated water has more flavour than this. Thin watery mouthfeel. Bottle (sampled at Mondial 2004).
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Mondial de la Biere 2004. Club soda again, a la Sleeman clear. Pale yellow, white fizzy head. No discernible aroma. Light, fizzy, and watery.
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pale yellow body with a slightly frutiy aroma. Highly carbonated effervescent body with a diluted watery fruity flavour profile. Boring. Give me back my carbs!!!!! Sufficiently bland beer to finish up the Mondial with and not feel like I should stay too much longer. Mondial 1T (Radek). Oh yeah - www.flamesgirls.com
Matt Accel;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Just a little to fruity for my liking. But all in all not terrible. Just a fruity tasting weak beer.

Dogfish Head World Wide Stout 2003 (21%, CA and UK release);Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours black as motor oil, minimal head that quickly vanished, never to be seen again. Boozy, dark fruit and coffee aromas. Dark chocolate and raisin flavors predominate, the alcohol is obviously there, but it�s not overpowering.

Lirarnas Lager;Grebbestad, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grebbestad Bryggeri;"Bottled. Brewed by Grebbestad, I�d expected more. Still, this is a decent brew. Amber colour with a vanilla coloured head. It�s herbal in its aroma and gives a fresh impression with a distinct dill profile. Flavour is dill up front and is malty with a somewhat prickly mouthfeel. Slight salty finish. Not bad for being a hooligan brew. But then �IS fans don�t drink beer, they drink ""good wine""."
Lirarnas Lager;Grebbestad, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grebbestad Bryggeri;Bottled. Golden with a frothy head. Some fresh hoppiness in the aroma. An international standard lager.

Dominion Winter Brew (Polish Porter);Dover, Delaware, United States;Porter - Baltic;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Polish porter is really Baltic Porter, a beer style that is a direct descendant of a British beer style, known as Imperial Stout. In the 18th Century British brewers sent strong, robust, flavorful stouts to Russia and the Baltics as a winter warmer. These beers became so popular, Russian/Baltic/Eastern European breweries(Poland being one of them, hence the name) began brewing their own versions of this beer style with a slight twist. These breweries were lager breweries, so naturally, they used the lager yeast strains in their breweries, instead of brewing with an ale yeast strain, which was traditionally used in Imperial Stout. Baltic porter as a style was born, and over the years, it has be produced by only a handful of Russian/Baltic/Eastern European brewers. Poland has some excellent examples with brands like Okocim and Zyweic porters, that have a strong cult following here in the US among Polish immigrants, and beer lovers. Polish Porter is similar to Imperial Stout, but due to the use of a lager yeast strain these beers tend to be smoother, rounder, cleaner, and lack the fruity estery flavors of an Imperial Stout. OD version is true to style, but is a little low in alcohol, coming in at only 5.8% abv. 8%-10%+ is on par with the style, but the lower abv, makes OD Winter Brew �03 a very, very drinkable brew, with lots of big roasty/coffee aromas and flavors, and lots of big chocolate malty aromas and flavors as well. It is brewed with German malts, and Polish hops, and of course a lager yeast strain. It is then cold conditioned like a lager, and makes for a wonderful, flavorful beer, just perfect for the Winter season. Old Dominion Winter Brew �03 pours to a beautiful, deep brown to black color with a creamy white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic with lots of big aromas of chocolate, coffee, and roasty malt aroma with a nice back drop of herbal hop spice. The palate is firm with lots of big chocolate malt, coffee, and roasty flavors that just glide over the tongue. The body on the beer is just so round and polished, making it so drinkable. OD Winter Brew �03 finishes with more chocolate and coffee flavors up front, then ends with some nice mild roasty flavors that lingers. Another fantastic beer from OD, of a style of beer that is very rare. I would have liked a little more alcohol heat in this beer, but the lower abv in this beer is only a minor flaw.
Dominion Winter Brew (Polish Porter);Dover, Delaware, United States;Porter - Baltic;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Poured a deep chestnut color with a thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and mild chocolate. Flavor is lightly tart with chocolate and roasted malt. Slightly bitter on the finish. Light to medium body.
Dominion Winter Brew (Polish Porter);Dover, Delaware, United States;Porter - Baltic;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);5.8% is a high gravity beer? No quite. Anyway I very much liked this beer. it was smooth, rich and tasty. Not overpowering or cloyingly sweet. Excellent and one of Dominion�s better winter brews.
Dominion Winter Brew (Polish Porter);Dover, Delaware, United States;Porter - Baltic;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours a dark, dark opaque brown with absolutely no head. Very still. Smell is nicely smoky and nutty. Taste is malty and creamy immediately with light coffee flavors sneaking in there as it goes. Quite smoky and nutty and lightly sweet from the maltiness. A bit light or thin on the palate. Would liked to have a fuller mouth. Very smooth for a very flavorful beer. would have liked just a touch of carbonation (this beer had basically none) to add a bit of a refreshing quality to this beer but maybe that is indicative of the style, only the second baltic porter I�ve ever had.
Dominion Winter Brew (Polish Porter);Dover, Delaware, United States;Porter - Baltic;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);I can�t believe I actually found a couple of these just recently as they haven�t been in the store for a while. I thought I would pick up a couple of bottles and give it a try to see how they held up. The 12 oz bottle had a bottled on date of November 12, 2003. A deep opaque black liquid poured from the bottle with about a half-inch of tan head residing on top. After making its entrance the head quickly dropped to a light scattering of bubbles leaving not much in the way of lace. Dark chocolate mixed with a bit of roasted malt mingled in the nose with notes of berries. There was also a bit of an earthy hop presence as well. The flavor started off a bit tart with berries before the coffee and dark chocolate stormed through. A roasted lingering aftertaste was how this finished. The body was about medium with a nice slick mouthfeel that went down very easy. Very drinkable as I would have had more if it was available. Hopefully this brew will return sometime, but for now these bottles have held up pretty darn well.
Dominion Winter Brew (Polish Porter);Dover, Delaware, United States;Porter - Baltic;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Bottle: Deep, dark brown color with a nice mahogany tint and a small off-white head. Aroma: dark roasted coffee, cocoa, roasted malts, anise, espresso. Taste has bitter hops, bitter dark roasted malts up front, cocoa, cola, chocolate, carrot, alcohol, tea, brown sugar, vinous malts. Interesting.
Dominion Winter Brew (Polish Porter);Dover, Delaware, United States;Porter - Baltic;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Perfectly brown color, decked out in an impressive, fluffy, rich toasty tan head. Aroma: ah, goodness! Espresso, tar, pitch, cola, thick, and twisted. A wickedly arousing smell, redolent with dark, devilish flavors. Taste: Small hops, major malt, full-bodied, and ringing with continual tastiness. Bits of anise speak up, dark fruits for a cameo, sqeaks of dark rum, shades of bitter root, and it�s rather smooth despite the complexity. Mouthfeel is lush and warm, and it hangs sturdily on the palate. In the end, though, this doesn�t really reach the heights attained by the greatest examples of the baltic porter style, lacks their power and fullness of flavor, but I�ve got to admire the attempt.
Copper Creek Abbey;Athens, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Copper Creek Brewing Company;On tap and then on cask. Pours a redish brown with a small beige head. Aroma of spice, malt, fruit, yeast. Taste is a sweet fruit, with spice, and yeast. Mouth is smooth. Finish is also smooth. Not a bad brew. Cask contained good amount of coriander.
Copper Creek Abbey;Athens, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Copper Creek Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a deep, deep red with a fast fading whitish head. The aroma has hints of basement, baking spices, and distinct sweet cherries. The palate on this is sticky which makes the pronounced sweet character a little much. Cherries are all over the flavor with modest esters for balance which makes me think of pie crust and cardamom. A vanilla note is present throughout. This one became pretty tough towards the bottom of the pint glass. The sugary cherry flavor approached that of medicine.
Copper Creek Abbey;Athens, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Hazy brown. Dark fruits in aroma. Alcohol and spicey flavored. Not bad overall.

Caramel malty aroma with spice, and some subdued Belgian yeast notes. More sweet caramel malty flavors, with some estery medium dark fruits and more notes of that yeast character.
Copper Creek Abbey;Athens, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Copper Creek Brewing Company;On tap at the 2005 GCBC: Clear deep copper color with a well-lacing off-white head. Heavy spiced caramel musky aroma has some bready yeast character. Body starts with a grainy malty sweetness, a touch of fresh hops and a drier earthy finish. An interesting Belgian ale, but could use some more sweet malty balance.
Copper Creek Abbey;Athens, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Pours dark amber with a fully receding off-white head. Aroma is toasted malt, coriander, and apricot. Taste is sweetish malts, raisin, and toffee. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with mild carbonation. Doesn�t taste like any dubbel I�ve had.
Copper Creek Abbey;Athens, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Draft at the brew pub. Cloudy ruby ale. Lots of red fruit in this one - along the lines of Ommegang�s Ommegang. Happy to have had the honor of a sample.
Copper Creek Abbey;Athens, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Poured cloudy/hazy brown color. Tangy and fruity aroma.

Copper Creek Abbey;Athens, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Copper Creek Brewing Company;This had a big, airy head on top of a hazy dark copper body. There was big alcohol (much like La Trappe Quad) that gives an almost whiskey-like feel to it. Very spicey. Good flavor, nicely malty pretty dry. Warm alcohol but not harsh. This is a big beer methinks.
Cambridge Great Pumpkin Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cambridge Brewing Company;"Tap from brewing company. Amber color; small head with large bubble that don't last long. Odor is of pumpkin pie spice with an unexpected hop tang to it. Taste is more bitter of hops, and the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors are more pronounced as well. There's a touch sweetness and possibly some vanilla; bitterness lingers. Mouthfeel is unremarkable but not unpleasant. I don't think I like the how present the hops are with the pumpkin."
Cambridge Great Pumpkin Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cambridge Brewing Company;No dating on the bottle. Looks a lightly hazed rusty gold with a nice billowy head of foam. Smells of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and a bit of booze. More booze than I would expect considering the abv. Nutmeg and cinnamon taste, cloves, and then comes the finish and aftertaste. A strange unpleasant bitterness. Body is medium, the carbonation is spritzy, especially during the swallow. Not my cup of tea.
Cambridge Great Pumpkin Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cambridge Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pours clear copper with a very thin head. Tastes like sweet roasted pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, molasses, and a hint of vanilla. Light body and low carbonation. Smells like sweet roasted pumpkin, cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, and molasses.

Cambridge Great Pumpkin Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cambridge Brewing Company;Bottled 09/08/16. This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a ruddy burnt orange close to amber color. Thin finger�s worth of foamy white head started and clung nicely to the glass. Slight wispy in it�s lace. The aroma starts with the spices of allspice, light ginger, cinnamon and the cardamom (yeah, I swear I�m getting cardadmom, now where in the hell is that coming from?). Light pumpkin flesh as it warms. The flavor brings it all together nicely. Pumpkin fleshy sweetness punches some of the spices to balance decently.Light bready/somewhat pumpkin aftertaste. Sweet to pumpkin spiced finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Low riding carbonation. Spices don�t distract the harshness. Good all around feel. Overall, I say it was a pretty good pumpkin ale all around. It�s no Night Owl, but this�ll do.
Cambridge Great Pumpkin Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cambridge Brewing Company;Sent to me by Strykzone. Thanks Dave. I see I liked this better than you did. Pours copper with an off-white head. Nose of pumpkin pie spices. A hint of vanilla. Medium body. Flavor has cinnamon and nutmeg and of course pumpkin. Finishes with a lot of spice. Good.
Cambridge Great Pumpkin Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cambridge Brewing Company;Bomber. Copper with some cloudiness. A decent head. Pumpkin and pie spices in the aroma. First sip is very tart bitter hops. Is there a Pumpkin IPA style? Hops are very big for the style and could be reduced. Not really a fan.
Cambridge Great Pumpkin Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cambridge Brewing Company;Second bottle to finish off MNF. Orangey brown small head. Nose is light pumpkin, hint of spice, and barnyard. Tastes of nutmeg, caramel, light dough, some sugar pumpkin, touch of herbs. Medium bodied and smooth. All right.
Cambridge Great Pumpkin Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cambridge Brewing Company;From the 650 ml. bottle. 2015 batch. Orange-amber pour with long lasting off-white head. Decent clarity. The aroma is subdued with hints of pumpkin spice and sweet malts but nothing that jumps out at me. The body is about medium. The taste has some subtle pumpkin and yam characteristics but nothing that is overly explosive. Mild bitterness to finish.
Copper Creek Royal Oats Imperial Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Not a great stout, but definitely not the worst. Light and sticky in the mouthfeel, there is just hardly any body to this at all. Mouthfeel is very light and syrupy sweet. Rich and creamy, but very green.
Copper Creek Royal Oats Imperial Stout;Athens, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Tasted at the Georgia Craft Brew Challenge. All I�ve got to say is that between tiny Copper Creek in Athens and Dogwood in Atlanta that Georgia will be rolling in great-tasting big beers if the Senate and Governor approve HB 645 in 2004. I�ve got a sneaking suspicion that 5 Seasons will be helping out in this area as well. Now for the beer. It was nicely black with a good thick, creamy, medium tan head, the kind that pockmarks easily. The aroma was very chocolatey, that quintessential Imperial Stout overripe fruit smell and a little alcohol. In the flavor, the chocolate and fruit was joined by nougat, low roasting barley levels. Not bitter or harsh, much almost underbalanced in that area (but not enough to be a flaw in my eyes.) My only qualm was the the body seemed a little thin. Still a good imperial stout.
Olde Stone Pumpkin Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Olde Stone Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Dark amber/brown body with a thick creamy tan head. Aromas of pumpkin spice and ginger are at the forefront with vanilla and clove notes being more subtle. Very oily. Low carbonation. Bitterness is very well blended and minimal.
Olde Stone Pumpkin Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Olde Stone Brewing;This porter, or any another produced here, could probably be considered this brew pub�s signature.

Olde Stone Pumpkin Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Olde Stone Brewing;Sampled at the brewpub, amber color, with a thick beige head, mild toasted, bready, caramel malt, spicy nose of allspice, with a faint caramelized pumpkin fruity note, with a hint of nuttiness in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a fruity, spicy character of all spice, with a gingerbread, nutmeg, cookie flavour upfront with some toasted, biscuity, caramel malt backbone, leading towards a fruity, biscuity malt, ginger spiciness, lingering leafy hop bitterness finish.
Olde Stone Pumpkin Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Olde Stone Brewing;At the brewpub. Dark orange/brown, very little head. Pleasing pumpkin spice aroma. Taste is nice.

Olde Stone Pumpkin Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Olde Stone Brewing;4oz sample from brewpub. Rich orange colour, with a sparse whitehead. A bit of spice in the aroma.

Olde Stone Pumpkin Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Olde Stone Brewing;(Disclaimer: I really don�t know what pumpkin tastes like!) A pint at the pub. Aroma is caramel, and a little spice. Flavour is sweet, a little malty. Something a little fruity/spicy in there which, I suppose, must be the pumpkin. Kinda like a best bitter. With pumpkin, I guess. Not bad, but I probably won�t get it again. They have others that are better.
Olde Stone Pumpkin Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Olde Stone Brewing;Light orange-amber in colour. Aroma was sweet, wheaty, slightly sweet. Flavour of pumpkin, sugar, wheat. Finishes with a medium bitterness.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle thanks to Matt! Pours a near clear deep brown with a tan head that dissipates completely. Aroma has a good amount of dark fruits and an alcohol burn as well as some dark grains. Flavor has smooth sweet dark grains with a bit of toffee and a touch of fruits in the finish. A touch thin.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);12 oz. bottle from TheBeerSommelier- thanks again, Matt! Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a small off-white ring for a head. Aroma of caramel and chocolate malts, molasses, brown sugar, dried berries, cardboard, and dust- yeah, some oxidation, but not too bad. Flavor of just barely smoked wood, caramel malts, molasses, brown sugar, dried fruits, and peat. Drinks a lot like a Scotch ale, actually. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation. These Dogwood beers are holding up all right after all these years, not that I�d sit on them any longer.

Thin head that faded quickly. Nice nose of chocolate. Taste is faded fruits. Light brown sugar. Lacking carbonation, due to age? Far from good but not bad at all. Thanks matt
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle shared by kp (and Jordan, the brewer of the beer). Pours a dark hazy cola brown with a huge tan head that lingered for quite a while but left only hints of lacing. The aroma as very sweet with some caramel malts and fruits, though there is a hint of sourness coming out as well (I suspect from oxidation, not by design). The taste had some brown sugar sweetness, Belgian yeast and some vanilla wood presence. The mouthfeel was surprisingly active for the age of the beer with lots of carbonation, maybe a little too much. Despite some signs of oxidation, this was a pretty decent beer.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);sample on Nov 6, 2008. dark brown with a half inch tan head. some plum on the nose. light body. sweet caramel. nice finish, some smoke.

Pours an opaque cola color with a thin tan head that quickly disappeared and left no lace at all. The aroma was rich malt, brown sugar, and light soy sauce. The flavor was much more heavily influenced by the soy sauce flavor with malt and molasses also present. Very effervescent and tingly on the tongue. I would have liked to have tried this one fresh.
Auroras Hefe Weisen;Brisbane, Queensland, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Brewhouse Brisbane;Cloudy, dark gold, with a small tight head. Very subtle aroma of bananas and not much else. Wheat flavour was slight, and generally overdone by the hops. Slight fruity aroma as it warmed.

Auroras Bulldog Pale Ale;Brisbane, Queensland, Australia;Pale Ale - English;The Brewhouse Brisbane;hard to find a lot of other flavours than some mandarin pip bitterness. pretty tame and standard australian interpretation of a pale ale
Auroras Bulldog Pale Ale;Brisbane, Queensland, Australia;Pale Ale - English;The Brewhouse Brisbane;No big surprises,some citrusy hops and lightly caramelly malts, but light seems to be a word i wrote 3 or 4 times in my notes. Bitter-ish towards the finish. Pretty screwed up and boring otherwise.

Heavily malty aroma with molasses and some slight toastedness and bread, possibly a minor hint of hops but I wouldn�t be sure. Taste is initially very sweet, almost annoyingly so turning into a moderately sweet finish with a hint of burnt bitterness and a slightly acidic feel. Medium body, oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation. A bit too sweet for me, reminds me a lot of kotikalja/kvass that I�m usually not a huge fan of due to the sweetness.

Smells of mash, sweet malt, caramel with brown sugar. Light prune and a aniseed. Medium thin light body. Tastes like a malt drink. Sweet with caramel, rye and slight burnt flavours. But of dark and burnt malt makes it a bit more complex than your typical malt drink. I love the sweet sugar water. So I give it a decent rating.

Aroma is syrup, mashlike sweetness along with toffee and rather burnt sugary notes. Flavour is very sweet mashlike sweetness along with some caramel and mild ryebready and syrupy notes.

Neuzeller Malz;Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Ein erstaunliches Bier. Und eins, das man auch schwer beurteilen kann. Als malziges Bierchen ein Knaller, da es hier eine unbestimmte entfaltet. Als echtes Piwo jedoch einfach nur eine suesse Suppe mit viel Karamell und einem Haufen Zucker. Fuer Fans was Feines, doch irgendwie wird man den Gedanken nicht los, es sei kein Bier fuer Kenner. Oder doch ?
Auroras Fallen Angel Ale;Brisbane, Queensland, Australia;Dubbel;The Brewhouse Brisbane;Dark gold, very clear, with little head or carbonation. Almost completely without aroma.... or flavour for that matter. Finish very dry, hinting at a soda water type taste.

Inner City Brickhouse Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Red Brick Brewing Company;The beer came is an elegant brown bottle with a black strip pasted across the cap announcing this beer to be just under the 5.9% ABV cap. The beer poured out a hazy golden yellow color with fizzy short lived head. The carbonation level was very lively and appeared to not subside during the entire session of drinking. The lacing on the sides of the glass was also quite a bit better than most lagers. The smell was very faint with a note of husky soured grains and some noble hops. The malts displayed a refreshing lemony sourness and a distinctly smoky zing. It was also a bit metallic in character. The hops were generally subdued with not a lot of bitterness. The mouthfeel was quite good for the style. It was substantial and filling and did not feel watered down. This is a first beer for Inner City Brewing Company (which claims to be Atlanta�s first African American owned brewery), and is contract brewed by Atlanta Brewing Company. I like this first effort, and look forward to more offerings from them.
Inner City Brickhouse Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Red Brick Brewing Company;Not very impressive at all. Heavy malt taste that is not balanced by anything tastes like an upscale malt liquor. Very bland flavor with a bad aftertaste. I couldn't recommend this beer to anyone.
Inner City Brickhouse Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Red Brick Brewing Company;Okay, there was absolutely nothing premium about this lager. The pours is yellow and hazy, with some light carbonation adding to the mouthfeel, but the flavor is very one-sided and dense, with nothing really coming through, except for that crappy lager aftertaste.

Buckhead Lakeside Light;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);A beer that would be great in the summertimes. Very crisp, clean and refreshing, with very little aftertaste, well very little taste to begin with, but very light and would go great after mowing the lawn or something of the like.
Dogwood Mark and Ted's Excellent Adventure;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle that got buried in my cellar - given I probably got this in a trade ~ 8 years ago, I can only imagine its true age. Looks as though it was handbottled and had an Avery label slapped on it. Ok, here goes nothing...after warning my friends that this could be unpleasant, a murky reddish brown liquid with very little carbonation is poured. Aroma is sweet and sugary, boozy, toffee, dark fruits...quite inviting. Flavor was actually pretty impressive...brown sugar, plums, toffee, and a strong bourbony/whisky feel to things. Palate was incredibly smooth, albeit with just north of zero carbonation. Very minor oxidization, and what was there did not detract heavily. Knowing I�ll never try this one again, I�m glad it was still well above drinkable when I finally cracked it open. Far from disappointing, this was quite a good drink!
Dogwood Mark and Ted's Excellent Adventure;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Apparently this may be one of the last bottles in existence. And it's my first perfect rating. Everything from the initial pour to the aftertaste is downright outstanding. The flavor is deep and lingers on the tongue in a delicious way. The flavor is deep and and rich with a slight bit of malt sweetness near the finish.
Dogwood Mark and Ted's Excellent Adventure;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle courtesy of Jimmack at Paul�s May 2014 tasting.

Like a fruit roll up. Minimal white head. Cloudy deep red. Flavor is a little flat with some booze. Lots of oxidized alcohol but not papery oxidation. Pretty solid.
Dogwood Mark and Ted's Excellent Adventure;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle. Rating #220. This was still pretty nice. It has lost something, but the sweet toffee is still there. (2591)

Tyranena Pretty Damn Black Stout;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Tyranena Brewing;Brown with a thin dissipating tan head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts. Taste of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, molasses. Semi-sweet and malty with a dry finish. Quality brew from Tyranena that I hope they put into bottles sometime soon.
Tyranena Pretty Damn Black Stout;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Tyranena Brewing;(growler from Skyview) Pours black with a tan head. Aroma is lightly burnt popcorn, stale grain, and day old spent coffee grounds along with some soy sauce. Nothing really too pleasant. Taste is chocolate, some coffee, but the best part of the beer is the finish, which has some good roastiness to it that lingers nicely. This tasted a lot like the Chief Blackhawk, but was just a little better.

Tyranena Pretty Damn Black Stout;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Tyranena Brewing;"Small pour (approximately 3 oz.), on tap at Gitchee Gumee Brewfest in Superior, WI on 4-5-08. This was the first of 12 beers that I rated (out of about 20 total beers that I tried). This one didn�t even make the program, but I�m glad that it made an appearance. I think I was the first person at the festival to try it. Pours a very dark brown (some might even call it ""pretty damn black"") with a large amount of tan head. Produces surprisingly good lacing in my small plastic cup. Nice, roasted malt aroma. Dry, roasted coffee taste. Lemon flavor present. Medium body. Smooth and lively in the palate. This was a good beer with which to kick off the festival."
Tyranena Pretty Damn Black Stout;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Tyranena Brewing;2003 Vintage: Many thanks to Skyview for hauling this gem back for us! Growler. Black color with a thin head. Good aroma of heavily roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Holy crap... the roasted malts absolutely dominate the flavor. Coffee and a bit of lactose sweetness, but overall this is like chewing on a spoonful of roasted barley. Yum.
Tyranena Pretty Damn Black Stout;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Tyranena Brewing;[growler] Thanks to Skyview for sharing this. Best balanced coffee stout I�ve had so far and not as thin mouthfeel. Obviously coffee, caramel, some hops, and cannabis. This is a fantastic beer.
Tyranena Pretty Damn Black Stout;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Tyranena Brewing;Nice to have Rob un-retire this special beer. On draught at the brewery�s taproom only, pours an opaque dark brown brew with a creamy off-white head that slowly dissipates to a lumpy light tan ring and film top. Aroma of toasted dark malt, coffee, a touch of molasses and some flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with roasted dark malt, coffee, a touch of mild chocolate and some flowery hops. Finish is mildly bitter with a dark malt and mild coffee aftertaste that quickly disappears after the finish. Not over the top coffee flavor but a nice balanced flavored dry stout with coffee.

Beer Works Red October;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Beer Works;Pours a deep brown with minimal tan lacy head. Aroma is subtle, mostly sweet caramel with some roasted malt. Taste is initially sweet with a bitter finish. Each successive sip gets a little more bitter and a little more displeasing.

The aroma displays apparent diacetyl- butterscotch and caramelized grains dominate. Light body with a macro carbonation to it. Grainy nondescript flavor with a touch less diacetyl than the aroma.

Rock Bottom Bethesda Extra Scary Bitter;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Bethesda;On tap at Bethesda. Nice big red body with slight head. Nose is floral, fruits, with maltier notes of chocolate. Taste is fruits, brown sugar, yeast, not really my thing. Too sweet and not nice texture.
Rock Bottom Bethesda Extra Scary Bitter;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Bethesda;Draft at Bethesda, MD location. Arrived at the table a clear reddish amber color with a thick and creamy beige head. There was a pleasant aroma of oranges, light grapefruits, cherries, a little caramel, brown sugar, and some touches of pine. Went down thin and slightly watery. There were no real surprises taste-wise - some caramel upfront followed by a bit of a biscuity maltiness and some light citrus at the end. More oranges than grapefruits. Tart cherries here and there. Only slightly bitter. Kinda roasty throughout. Too thin.
Rock Bottom Bethesda Extra Scary Bitter;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Bethesda;Tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear deep red. Weak beige to gray head. Nose is heavy grenadine, mild chocolate, cocoa. Taste is soapy, mealy apple, detergent, paper, freezer vegetables. Palate is poor- sugary, cloying, medicinal. Welp- I guess 10 years of this recipe in the making hasn�t improved this beer.
Rock Bottom Bethesda Extra Scary Bitter;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Bethesda;On Tap at Bethesda: I had this on tap at the brewpub. It was among the best of thier lineup. Which isn�t exactly saying its worldbeating but its pretty darn good. A nice carmale malt flavor was the main flavor. Some fruit flavors, maybe even some floral noes. Mild and enjoyable but good.
Rock Bottom Bethesda Extra Scary Bitter;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Bethesda;Tap at Bethesda: Clear, copper/amber color with a medium eggshell head. Aroma is not what I would expect for an ESB. Sweet malt, fruit, mildest of hops. Weird taste here - I�m getting some sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, no hops, or caramel or earthy flavors. Has a sweet malt backbone, but just no earthy/bitter/caramel notes to back it up.
Rock Bottom Bethesda Extra Scary Bitter;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Bethesda;(Bethesda) Clear copper body with off-white head. Aroma is weird -- medium sweet, anise, artificial cherry, and something else unpleasant. Taste is pretty much the same, complete with an unpleasant unidentified flavor. No hops discernible! Medium body.
