High Noon Lewis & Clark Lager;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;Sampler @ brewpub. I wasn’t going to rate this but I was actually surprised by this brew. Its not that is a well made beer but they were able to make it bad while having it come out nice enough to drink. Color is hazy clear dark straw. Its a weirdly lightly sweet lager. Has just a bit of lemon zing to it. Again, not well made to style but works for me enough.

Pour is almost all clear golden, some carbonation. Smallish white head. Aroma of not much, maybe some soft malt. Taste is clean, sweet fruit (almost banana) a touch of malt and OK hop bitterness to the back. Palate is slightly on the thick side for a lager, but gave it a nice body without hurting how it drank. Small diacetyl as it warmed, giving some buttery notes. Overall, nice beer.

The nose is a fairly muted light grain with not a whole lot else going on here, but it has nothing offensive or distracting in it like so many other adjunct-laden lagers. Light-bodied and thin with a tight but mild carbonation and a clean finish. Sweet and clean with just a touch of a floral hop note at the finish. Not too shabby. I’d drink this any day over BMC lagers.
Fitgers Watermelon Wheat;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fitgers Brewhouse;A strange brew. Pours a nearly clear, nearly pink-amber with only a thin layer of head. Interesting, strong aroma almost exactly like those Jolly Rancher watermelon candies. So far so good. Didn’t care for the taste. Tasted more like a canteloupe than a watermelon. I don’t really care for canteloupe very much. If you do, you will like this beer more than I did. Light body, light carbonation. Well made, to be sure, just not for me.
Fitgers Watermelon Wheat;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fitgers Brewhouse;Sampled this beer at the Great Taste of the Midwest in Madison WI.

Fitgers Watermelon Wheat;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fitgers Brewhouse;Strange combination - but surprisingly good together.

75th Street Belgian Wit;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;75th Street Brewery;Tap at brewpub. Pours a clear gold, although this advertises itself as a witbier.

75th Street Belgian Wit;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;75th Street Brewery;Pleasant looking, coming with an orange slice, which I found odd.

75th Street Belgian Wit;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;75th Street Brewery;Slight head and effervescence. Faint but insistent aroma of orangeade and coriander. Light, hazy golden amber color. Some wheat malt present in the flavor, along with some sweet-tart spiciness and definite orange peel. This sounds like it would be good, but the flavorings are almost artificial tasting, and the palate is very fizzy indeed. Aftertaste is more of the same. Not complex. It's hard for me to say exactly what makes this beer taste the way it does, but either way it needs less of it IMHO.
t Smisje Kerst;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;My bottle looks like the picture with Kerst not winter so this may be a bit old. Pour is a murky dirty river water brown. Aroma is dark fruit and fig pudding. Flavor is some dark fruit and lots of tootsie roll like sweetness. No alcohol is felt but it is getting a bit warmer in here. This is a big malty, dark fruit flavored strong ale. Not much spices are felt this is all about the dark fruit malt and sugar.

Hazy dark amber almost brown color with off white to beige head. Aroma is yeasty light funky, spicy, citrusy fruity, caramel malty. Sweet and light bitter, lot of caramel - burnt sugar, fruity, light wineous. Medium oily body with soft to flat carbonation.
t Smisje Kerst;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;"Appearance: It is a hazy murky iced tea brown color with a thin dirty-white head that fades instantly. As usual head retention is not something to hold against a beer that is 12%. Aroma: There is a strong caramel scent along with dates. It has a very rich aroma to it, that completely consumes all olfactory senses. If aroma had a ""mouthfeel"" it would be syrupy. Taste: It has quite a lot of flavor. At first there is this rich candy caramel flavor, then it is followed by this nutty pecan flavor, which has a biscuit aftertaste, and a popcorn-like ending. I like it. Mouthfeel: Despite the collection of flavors and ABV of the beer, it comes across as a fairly medium bodied beer, and a lighter shade of medium to boot. It has a touch of effervescence which seems to further the lightness of the body. I would like to see a larger beer like this have more of a coating quality. Overall: I didn’t pick up any coriander or grains of paradise, but the flavor qualities were still there to make this an interesting beer. It didn’t blow me away but it was a good beer. Try it if you like large Belgian beers, but you’re not missing anything if you can’t get it."
t Smisje Kerst;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;It pours a very hazy/cloudy dark honey colour, 1 finger head of foam with the usual Belgian quality re retention and lacing. The smell is of dark fruits, black cherries amongst them?, yeasty, some light spiciness. The taste is stronger than the nose but not as impressive to me. Dark pitted fruits, yeasty, orange peel bitterness, has some woody notes and light Port(more of that please), vanilla,..to me, a tad over complex and not everything comes together in total harmony. Top end of medium bodied, medium carbo, very good mouthfeel. So, in the end analysis, I reckon, despite what I said about the complexity above, this IS a very good brew.
t Smisje Kerst;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Bottle@home with Erik. No head. Muddied. Very low carbonation. Dry fruity figs dates prune. Rather prominent heavy sweetness. The spices drown in the sweet flavours.

Cumberland Pale Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cumberland Brews (US);on tap @ Cumberland / Louisville KY --- Clear medium amber, off-white head cover, broken bands of lace. Taste is bracing bitter malt that adds a burst of hops on the swallow, slowly drifting through a long finish. It works reasonably well because the hops, while assertive, aren’t overwhelming.

Firehouse Barely Blonde Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Tap @ Firehouse. Clear, light orange-amber pour with a short white head leaving moderate fine lace. Nose is neutral. Light toasty body, no hops detectable due to strong butterscotch flavor. This is my second off ale of two from Firehosue and I have to believe they have a problem. Infected lines would be my guess. I’m done here & would recommend avoiding this place until they sort themselves out.
Firehouse Barely Blonde Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);"On tap currently at the brewpub. Golden orange appearance which is notably dark. Aroma of cream candies, cotton candy, apricot, and floral, earthy hops. Some biscuit and honey; really clean, comfortable, and relaxed. Flavor is soft and smooth with crisp grassy hops, lavender, and crystal malt; no intonations of bitter minerals or metallics that tend to drag down these brewpub renditions of european blonde ales, just a wholesome, polished canvas of czech hops and doughy, honey-sweet pale malt. Palate tepid and watery. Solid example for refreshment without any real drawbacks."
Firehouse Barely Blonde Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);This brew pub is just a few blocks from home, but I recently visted for the first time. Tried this on tap and was pretty happy with it...it's a bit overpriced if you ask me unless you make it to happy hour. No head...I mean none...fair smell and decent taste. If you're in Rapid City, it's worth a try (at happy Hour).

Firehouse IrishRed;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a gentle hazy red color with a light transparency about it. Bar pour yields a film of a white head that dissipated within less than a minute. The smell had some bitter citrus-like hops with a light underscore of sweet caramel malts. The taste was sweet, balanced between the malts and hops, and came across somewhat crisp. On the palate, this was about a light in body. There was a slight sessionable aspect about it. Overall, decent red ale worthy of having again.

The beer has an amber body (go figure) with a small ringlet of beige head. Spotty lacing. Aromas of pale malt, apple, grain. Light earth notes and floral hops with a malty body.

The appearance was a gentle dark brown close to black color with a thin white to off white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Some light stringy lacing slid into the body. The smell had a dry roasted coffee bean with a super light underscore of chocolate. The taste was dry, light chocolate with a lighter dose of the coffee bean.

Ginga Kogen Ko Mugi no Beer;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Can from the supermarket . Cloudy, light orange white head. Clove, a hint of banana. Relatively dry, spicy, not as heavy as the Bavarian versions. One of the better Weizen I have had.
Ginga Kogen Ko Mugi no Beer;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Bottle from an online Asian supermarket. Extra marks for the attractive blue bottle. Cloves to the forefront alongside citrus. A banana aroma lurks in the background. Cloudy gold. Frothy translucent white head soon shrunk away. Initial citrus sourness - quite tart. There's an underlying sweetness. Medium bodied. Slick verging on creamy. Low key fizzy carbonation. Dty finish with an edge of astringency. This as been sat forgotten at work so thought it may have faded but a refreshing Hefe which I could easily have downed on this hot summer day.

Ginga Kogen Ko Mugi no Beer;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Can. Hazy yellow color. Thick white head, but falls quickly.

Ginga Kogen Ko Mugi no Beer;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Weird 33cl blue glass bottle at Haikan in DC. Drank from the bottle, so who knows. Nose is medium esters, what you expect, bubblegum and clove, some orange and grass too. Flavor is tpale grist and dough, orange, clove, banana, chewed bubblegum. Finishes off dry. Fine.
Ginga Kogen Ko Mugi no Beer;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Bought the Silver Bottle version (which is actually in a nice blue bottle) at Shilla, a Japanese/Korean grocery in Amsterdam.

Sapporo Namashibori;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Fairly skunky aroma. Sweet malt, hay, mildly creamy, fairly empty finish. Light and boring beer substitute, still fairly quaffable overall.
Sapporo Namashibori;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Best of the happoshu variety without doubt. Keep in mind this is meant as a mega-refreshing beverage along with your meal.
Sapporo Namashibori;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;"350 ml can bought at YATA in Grand Century Place, Mong Kok. Piss golden yellow colour; Three-quarter finger head and white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Moderate sticky lacing and active carbonation; Very pungent smell of malt, with soaked urinal, strong grains, light burnt rubber, thick bread, light lemon and smelly pissy grass; Light sweet taste of thin malt, with strong grains, wet cardboard, chemicals, soda water, bread, thin lemon and faint bitter grassy hops; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is Happoshu-level very thin malt water, soaked with slightly sickening cold medicines, cardboard, strong grainy notes and stale bread. Doh!... Hoppiness is piss grass and light lemon nose and taste. Faint bitterness for chemical non-finish;Dry after taste, easy but awkward to mouth. Comments: Yes, this is a lowly Happoshu - it stinks in my nose, taste like near water and quite chemical-ish, but this is not the worst offender, at least it has some light malt and grain palate, and I managed to finish half a can before I poured it down the drain."
Sapporo Namashibori;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Pour from a can is clear yellow with slight white head. Aromas of grains, a little grassy, some sweat. Taste is grains, slightly sweet. Thin mouthfeel. Full carbonation. Very easy to drink and refreshing, but without much character.

Sapporo Namashibori;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;"Can. Good Lord! No one has rated this for two-and-a-half years. Well, guess what? It hasn’t got any better. Some fruitiness in the aroma, also hair perm chemical, and maybe elephant piss. Typical pale yellow, thick 1-2 cm. head. Harsh grassy initial; cardboard emerges in the mid palate -- but it is very clean cardboard; the finish goes off into the fourth dimension... and I could not follow. Thin palate, with a strange sharp whole mouth feel, like a sort of mild mouthwash. Yuck! Warning: this happoshu should be consumed for research purposes only."
Sapporo Namashibori;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Can. Clear, bright gold. Scant head. Dirty socks and hot electronics aroma. Harsh rubbing alcohol and acetone in the palate and flavors. Finishes dry and does have some malt character.

Bit malty aroma with somethin grassy. Thin mouthfeel. Mild flavour of some malt, bit of grains and grass. Brewed with Ryofu barley grown in Hokkaido only. Sapporo claims that you get a ""sense of nature"" with this beer…. Hmmm."
Sapporo Namashibori;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;"Painful stuff - very light, thin and watery. There is no English on the can, not even the word Sapporo, except for ""namashibori.com"" in real small text on the side. A typical asian brew, though not as dry as most Sapporos. For tax reasons, Japanese brewers create these ""happoshu"" (low-malt) beers which are made with rice, I guess, instead of barley. Lots of water flavor."
Orion Aroma Tone;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Certainly wasn't impresed with this offering from Orion. But then again, Orion isn't my favorite Japanese beer either. Had a funky, rather unbalanced taste and not much Aroma, despite the name.

Orion Senkai Nama;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);12 Aug 02-Similar to the regular Orion but with less carbination. Just another Japanese 'Yellow Fizzy'. Wonder why they all seem to be 5.5%, like it's a magic number or something. Re-rate- 6/24/04, Even more boring than I remembered. Knocked it down a few points.....just because.

Smooth, Drinkable..Thin Mouthfeel..Simplistic Porter.

CB Bayer;Bergen, Norway;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;8/18/2007 2:59:41 AM On tap at Beer Palace, Oslo. This was quite a boring beer I thought. Not much taste too it. It has an amber body and was quite smooth. Some sweet taste, of caramel. Slight bitter finish. Didn’t finish.
CB Bayer;Bergen, Norway;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;On tap @ Patricks, Kristiansand. Well now, a Norwegian previously retired bayer? This is a clear copper beer with a small thin just off-white head. The aroma has tones of both caramel, ripe fruits and candy. Not to horrible actually. The flavor on this one is not extreme in any way. Hints of thin butter, caramel and again some fruity-ripe candy-thingy. It’s actually a bit tasty. It has a average+ carbonation level with a somewhat thin and watery mouthfeel. Easy to drink and it actually has some flavor. A bit sweet and quite low on the bitterness if anything. 30.03.2012

Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Bright, clear golden color. Lots of slowly rising bubbles. Smells like corn. Tastes like all kinds of cereal mash. There’s no need to macro the micro.
Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold color with a small off-white head. The head didn’t stick around for long, and there isn’t much lacing. It smells mostly like grainy/bready malt, along with a bit of a vegetal aroma. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it’s mostly grainy/sweet malt and not much else. Not bad, but not really good either. Mouthfeel/body is light, it’s thin and watery but is also easy to drink. I’ve had worse, I really wasn’t expecting much when I bought a single of this for 99 cents. Nice to try, but I wouldn’t buy it again.
Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;"1988 Bengals Collectors Can. Given to me by 1_2many after finding a few that had been sitting in his family’s fridge for 20 years. My can had survived a bit more successfully than the one he first drank. Actually had some decent carbonation and with a thin white head that tried it’s best to stick around. Has absolutely no aroma, or taste for that matter. I can’t even say it had much in the way as negative flavors, because it really had none at all. It only scores a ""2"" for aroma and flavor due to it’s actual lack thereof. It was fun to at least try it....I think."
Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;1988 collectors can just opened twenty years later to celebrate my 100th rating! My dad has had three of these tucked back in his refrigerator for twenty years! I can’t believe I’m about to drink this it looks aweful. Clear golden yellow. This has a ridiculous amount of carbonation and the head disappeared in literally two seconds leaving nothing at all except for a few lonely bubbles around the edge. Pouring this is like pouring a Pepsi or Coke. The aroma is surprising however in that it doesn’t smell entirely of rotten corn or rice. It actually has some toffee malt aroma. The hops are gone... completely...I stopped trying to smell the hops ten minutes ago. The flavor is sweet with almost zero bitterness. This beer is very light with a thin oily texture to it and a lot of carbonation. I will not finish this just because it kind of scares me. The beer didn’t go bad really but it probably wasn’t good in the first place and definitely wasn’t made to age for twenty years. Twenty year old Hudepohl 14-K Premium special collector’s edition. This can has the 1988 Cincinnati Bengals schedule on the back. I can’t believe I just tried this. Oh man...I just poured out the remaining contents of the can and the sediment ring on the bottom just broke up and came out...oh that’s horrible. I think I’ll go throw up those few sips now. Well I went back and opened another can with Bigmmartin and this one was a lot better but not by much. Carbonation was better and the head actually stayed around for a little bit. Same aroma and bland flavor but the appearance improved quite a bit. That’s about all I can say about it. Still don’t know what possessed me to drink this.
Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;It’s so sad to see this one retired. This was my high school beer. $1.10 for a gallon jug at the brickyard lake tavern (in the ’ 60’s). One of the several Cincinnati local beers that have been bought out and closed by the Macros. Crisp, clean and light on the palate. A nice session lager.
Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;very smooth, ballpark beer. not sweet but not bitter. classical beer taste. Looks healthy and full from what i can remember.

Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;This is just one notch below Hudy Delight. I had this once after a softball game. It was on tap, and I was surprised. It was a very smooth, crisp beer. No bad aftertaste, just a very good beer.
Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Its not as good as its Hudepohl counterpart, Hudy Delight, but it is still very drinkable.
Hudepohl 14-K Premium;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Not my typical style, but looking for something different to introduce to my macro-consuming friends. Had some on draft at the brew tour in Frederick. Quite refreshing, which would be good if it weren't 20 degrees outside with more snow on the way. A good quality lager, not too dry, not too bitter, just a solid mouthfeel and no watered-down taste. I bet it's great with hotdogs and burgers in the stadium parking lot.
Tenaya Creek Pale Bock;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Tenaya Creek Brewery;The best thing about this pale bock to me, is that unlike so many other strong pale bocks, the alcohol is never overwhelming, in the aroma or flavor. One of the better of this style to me.
Tenaya Creek Pale Bock;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Tenaya Creek Brewery;On tap @ Tenaya Creek poured a clear gold with a small diminishing off white head. Aromas of sweet malt, and light fruit. Palate was light bodied and smooth. Flavors of cereal and light fruits with a mildly bitter finish.
Tenaya Creek Pale Bock;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Superior beer. Solid color. Excellent smooth caramel malt taste. Strong beer (don’t know the ABV) but without the alcohol sting, just a hint in the sweet flavor. Recommended!
Central Waters Whitewater Weizen;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Pours a cloudy copper color with a very little head. Scent is that of strong grassy wheat. Very awkward taste here. It starts off rather bold, but quickly diminishes on the pallet. Overall it’s very grassy and grainy with slight hints of citrus and maybe some caramel? Could be a little more bold and a better 2nd half of the taste. Taste is very similar to that of Organic wheat beers. Nothing too special here, but better than the cheap beers!
Central Waters Whitewater Weizen;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Fairly subdued nose of bubble gum, bananas and bread. Lightly sweet with a light bitterness for refreshment and balance. Lively. A nice drinking beer with some estery personality.

Central Waters Whitewater Weizen;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Pours hazy amber with a small white head. The aroma has big smooth sweet creamy wheat, some banana notes and light tobacco. Medium / full body with gentle, yet sharp, carbonation.

Central Waters Whitewater Weizen;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Bottle. Pours a hazy dark orange with a white head. Kind of odd earth, bread, grass, clove, spice, banana notes. Some off flavors. Not my favorite but could have been worse.
Central Waters Whitewater Weizen;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Poured from bottle to pint glass. 2 finger head at best, whichi quickly dissolved. Watery, but malty with no hint of banana or bubble gum as prior reviews have stated. Just watery inside-of-a-can taste. No spice as promoted in the description either. Take a pass on this middling brew.
Zoffmann Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;Can. In airplane. So metallic aroma and metallic taste also. I didnt feel malts or hops. Watery.
Zoffmann Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;Bottled. This is one of the worst beers in Serbia, if not the worst.It’s quite hazy, looks almost like a lighter Weizen. There are some nice malty and yeasty tones but the overall taste is simply horrible- sour and acidic. Used to be better, but now this is the worst Serbia has to offer when it comes to beer.
Zoffmann Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;Bottle from Boris, just back from Zagreb. The best beer we tasted tonight. Creamy yellow colour. Malty and sweet. Nuanced. Slight bitter finish to it. Refreshing and would drink again.
Zoffmann Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;1.5l bottle found at a Žabac store in Zagreb Whoa. This is bottle conditioned. A bottle conditioned pale lager in a 1.5l plastic bottle. Never thought I’d see the day. There was a big yeasty stain on the bottom of the bottle. Was it a mistake, or was it intentional? Who knows. Anyway, poured a hazy yellow colour with a medium sized firm white head that went away at a medium pace. The nose is weak, but still quite nice... agrumes, malt and a touch of honey. The taste is quite... empty. Bit yeasty, malty notes, the hops are missing in general but emerge from time to time to give some weak lemony and/or metallic flavours. Completely lacks bitterness. Easy drinking, but...
Zoffmann Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;Canned(500ml). -Awful beer, when you drink it from can it tastes like a metal, when you put it in a glass, it still tastes like a can
Zoffmann Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;Bottled. Pale amber. Spicy, yeasty nose. Malty, fruity and gently rounded with mild, lightly bitter finish.
Suntory Super Magnum Dry;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;"Poured a clear pale golden colour with a thick, six-finger (half the height of the 500ml glass) white foamy head that partially collapsed then quickly dissipated. Poor lacing. Moderate to high carbonation as evidenced by lots of trails formed by large bubbles. Aroma sweet, sour and metallic. Taste of sweet grain and malt – bland. Very light body (bordering on watery). Short sort of ""sweet and sour"" finish. Not for me."
Suntory Super Magnum Dry;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Not the worst drain pourer, but not fantastic. Sweet corn aroma with a coarse palate and slightly sweet finish.
Suntory Super Magnum Dry;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Medium coarse offwhite head shrinks quickly. Yellow body with carbonation. Unbalanced alcohol and corn aroma with chemical notes. Dry lightly chalky apple taste with chemical aftertaste. Nice grassy hop background. Not bad for a happoshu. (0.35l can.)
Suntory Super Magnum Dry;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Heavy, soda-like carbonation. Large foamy head. Yellow color. Funky, sour, sweet, and mildly offensive aroma. Thin flavors of corn, malt, water, and nothingness. Watery, and indeed dry. Pretty horrendous stuff, but very cheap.
Suntory Super Magnum Dry;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Can. Yellow colour. Short lasting white head. Aaroma of sweet malt and hops. The flavour is quite hoppy and dry. Thin aftertaste.
Suntory Super Magnum Dry;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;This beer is absolutely disgusting! I usually have no problem downing a beer because I dont believe in wasting beer, but this stuff was insulting. I drank it in Shibuya, on the Subway, then somewhere near Tokyo tower......same can.....it took me that long to choke it down.
Suntory Super Magnum Dry;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Can bought in Kyoto, Japan. Clear yellow with a white head. Slight beer aroma, weak, watery taste with medium carbonation.
Suntory Super Magnum Dry;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;8/13/02-2.5 This is in my opinion, the best Japanese Macro. It has a mildly sweet malt nose & taste and a nice crisp finish. *Re-rate*- Yikes, not in any way, shape or form the best Macro in Japan. My tastes sure have changed in the past few years. This is adjunct charged macro swill, not a decent beer.
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;On tap. Offwhite-yellow/gold. A-Slight sour fruit. T-pine hop with some bite, lt/med malt-maybe some caramel.
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;"""i just wasn’t getting the same thing as the previous three...light bodied AND a tad watery. no hop balance at all, just some nutty toasted malt. perfect example of what i’s expect of a decent macro attempt at an amber, but not good from a micro. passable."""
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;Thanks to Haley for this one. Can was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice semi-dark red color with a one finger white foamy that dissipated within about a minute. Light messy lacing falls all over the glass. The smell was a deep roasty caramel to nutty aroma. The taste was sweet and roasty through the previously noted aromas. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the palate. It’s got a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation was appropriate. Overall, I’d have it again.
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;This one poured a medium orange color with an off white head. Aroa was of caramel malt and grassy hops. Flavor was similar, moderate bitterness to keep it balanced but nothing stands out.
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;Thanks Robertdale. Light amber pour with a light tan head. Caramel malt and a little spiciness in the taste. OK beer. OK lacing..
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;heavier broomastraw malt and used cigar with some scratchy light pine and light citrus hop. light sweetness with a full body. nice real amber color with light beige head. full suds, good beer.
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;Location: 12 oz can (as pictured) from Buy Rite, 3/7/13 Aroma: The nose is buttery, with some caramel malts, a little wet paper, and some metallic notes Appearance: It pours a hazed reddish color with a small off-white head and medium-plus lace Flavor: The taste is pretty much the same as the nose, which is to say, not very good at all Palate: The body is light-medium, it starts off okay, but the mid and late palates both feel unpleasant Overall Impression: This one is a total stay away for me. It didn’t work at all. Way way too many of the components of it seems like mistakes/flaws. Don’t bother...
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;Hops & malt nicely balanced. I always start my visit to High Noon with a pint of Annie’s before moving on to another style.
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;Poured from a 12 ounce can. Aroma: fruity, toasted malts, bready Appearance: this is golden/ down right yellow, not amber Taste: astringent/ husky, fruity, roasted malts Palate: thin a little dry/ astringent Overall: this needs some refinement, watch the astringency and this would be a nice beer.
High Noon Annies Amber Ale;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;From a can poured an amber color with a good amount of head. Light malty flavor with an almost tart lingering finish.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Mixed malt is the perfect beverage and should be enjoyed with friends. Perfect body. Perfect Mixture between sour and sweet and perfect color. Rich, almost earthy flavours and a fine mouthfeel. I have stored 2 bottles for the future in my winecellar.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Great refreshing taste of peaches. Felt rich and full on the tongue. Only downside is that i only had one.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can. Pale pink colour with no head. Aroma of chemical peaches. Flavour is sweet, chemical. With some imagination it could be described as peaches. Not a beer. Not a cider. Something completely different and not worth of brewing and putting into a can for sale.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Chemical as can be, sickenly sweet, smells like a cider and tastes like one as well, Only more artificial.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Orange with a low head. Aroma of peach, additives and soda pop. The flavour is cloying and fruity - BUT in an artificial way.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can Very light blond color. Sweet aroma of peach syrup. Very sweet (saccharin too), with strong artificial peach character. Soda.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;An orange beer with a lazing off-white head. The aroma is artificially peachy - very much like a sodapop. The flavor is sweet malty with strong notes of peaches.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can. Clear golden coloured with a small head. Aroma of peaches and fruits. Flavour of peaches and fruits.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Very sweet candy-like peach aroma offers no sense that this is actually a malt beverage. Pink tinged transparent liquor is topped by a fizzy white fully diminishing head. Sweet peach candy flavour is wholly unappealing. Watery body with very strong, gassy carbonation. This is not beer. It’s alco-pop. Can (Ireland, May-06).
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Persika;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;[Canned] very pale pink, soda-like absence of a head. Artificial aroma of peach. Cloyingly sweet with candyish horribly artificial peach flavour. Dear god. People drink this?
Stout Bros. Stronghold Pilsner;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Stout Brothers Public House;Funny they call this a Bohemian pilsener...I thought it tasted a lot like Gosser, which is Austrian. *shrug* Pretty decent choice for people who weren’t sure about stouts and cream ales at this brewery, which unfortunately went belly-up a couple years ago.
Stout Bros. Stronghold Pilsner;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Stout Brothers Public House;Light color and a good pils. Straw flavors with some mild hops. Perhaps could have been kicked up a bit, but good for a style that I'm not particularly fond of.
Stout Bros. Stronghold Pilsner;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Stout Brothers Public House;Nice! Closest thing I've had to enjoying a fresh tap pils in Eastern Europe since I was there 10 years ago. Grassy and a bit grainy, crisp and refreshing.
Stout Bros. Stronghold Pilsner;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Stout Brothers Public House;Apple juice body with small white head. Aroma is grassy. Taste is medium grassy, mild sweet. Finishes acidic but not dry.

Stout Bros. Stronghold Pilsner;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Stout Brothers Public House;an acceptable rendition of the style, but nothing to write home about.......
Stout Bros. Celtic Cross Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Stout Brothers Public House;This was a light-bodied and flavorful stout from a brewery I’m sorry to have seen go belly-up. I drank many a pint of these during football season -- Stout Bros. did an AYCD for $10 special.
Stout Bros. Celtic Cross Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Stout Brothers Public House;Near black with a typical nitro light tan head. Light aromas of mocha and cola. Coffee and caramel flavors with a peat and light malt finish. Somewhat thin but enough oats to hold it together. Very dry in the finish.
Stout Bros. Celtic Cross Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Stout Brothers Public House;Light bodied and a little darker than the porter. Vanilla nose. Slightly bitter. Bland, watery, without any variation.
Stout Bros. Celtic Cross Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Stout Brothers Public House;Black, light bodied stout with a superb nose of milk chocolate and sweetened roasted coffee. Thin bodied but still creamy.
Stout Bros. Celtic Cross Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Stout Brothers Public House;Completely opaque. hints of brown at very edges, a tight, tan head. Really Roastey, notes of espresso, cocoa and coffee, lots of coffee. Lacks just a bit in body. Nice chocolate flavor, finishes strongly espresso-like with a bit of milk chocolate as well.

Stout Bros. Underground IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stout Brothers Public House;"Where are the hops? This is a brewery that I was sad to see close, although this was NOT an IPA and not even a PA; more of something along the lines of a strong ale. Decent taste, but the missing hops kept this from being a favorite."
Stout Bros. Underground IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stout Brothers Public House;Tarnished copper color. Good head. Seemed to be more of a strong ale than an IPA -- not many strong hops. Some citrus and floral flavors. Also a tad straw, and grass.
Stout Bros. Underground IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stout Brothers Public House;Very hoppy nose with citrus notes and a slight nuttiness. Light bodied with an overall grainy feel in the mouth. Biting hops at the end, very quick, dry finish. A strong IPA that need a bit more malt to balance it better.
Stout Bros. Underground IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stout Brothers Public House;Orange/amber body with little carbonation. Nice white frothy head. Sweet fruity, floral: Where's all the hops? Mildly bitter, definitely an english style IPA. Finishes fruity and sweet as well. nice body front to back, mildly acidic, not bad for a midwesterner IPA.
Stout Bros. Underground IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stout Brothers Public House;Clear light copper body with medium off-white head. Aroma is pine/grapefruit. Taste is medium pine, light grapefruit, medium sweet. Medium body. Clearly there's a lot of medium in this beer, and my rating reflects the same.
Stout Bros. Underground IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stout Brothers Public House;Aroma is very hoppy but the flavor somewhat disappoints. Light brown color, frothy brown head.
Stout Bros. Underground IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stout Brothers Public House;hop bitterness, but not flavor or aroma... slightly sweet caramel...........
Stout Bros. The Yank Cream Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;I miss this brewery, and I miss this beer more. Very smooth and creamy, and a great session ale. They used to have AYCD for $10 during Monday Night Football. This was perfect for that.
Stout Bros. The Yank Cream Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;Nitro - golden brown/apricot color. Quite nice. Heavy yeast and malt nose. Has the smooth nitro feel, which might be expected for the style. Strong yeast, malt, toffee flavors.
Stout Bros. The Yank Cream Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;Amber/orange with a thick fluffy head. How does a combination of two lagers make an ale? LOL! Grassy and thin without much taste. Dry finish. Not much going on in this one.
Stout Bros. The Yank Cream Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;Medium creamy off-white head topping clear amber body. Aroma is light grassy bitter. Taste is mild sweet, with light grassy/herbal bitter that begins a mid-tongue and remains through the swallow. Creamy light/medium body with pleasant accessible beer.
Stout Bros. The Yank Cream Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;I'm liking the cream ales more and more lately. Creamy head, brownish blond color. Very smooth. Good session brew.

Stout Bros. Yodeler Weisse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stout Brothers Public House;Very sour, like a cup full of sour. Tasted like lemon juice. Couldn't taste the banana, clove, or wheat malts through the artifical sour lemon flavors.
Stout Bros. Yodeler Weisse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stout Brothers Public House;Banana and clove nose is pleasant. Some graininess mixes with some sour notes in the middle, finishes biscuity and dry, leaving clove and wheaty tastes lingering.
Stout Bros. Yodeler Weisse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stout Brothers Public House;Cloudy light yellow with small white head. Aroma is strong banana and mild clove with tough of wheat, medium sweet. Taste is banana up top, lemon (complete with moderate sourness) brings it home. Light body.
Stout Bros. Yodeler Weisse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stout Brothers Public House;Bubble gum/Banana nose. Not filtered but looks as though it may be. Cloudy blond. Not a bad Weiss, just not a great one.
Stout Bros. Yodeler Weisse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stout Brothers Public House;Light hazy straw with a nice head. Light aroma of banana. Very light flavored, light malt, light banana, light clove. Just very light, not a lot to chew on. A hefe brewed for the masses. Just a quencher.
Stout Bros. Yodeler Weisse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stout Brothers Public House;by far the best beer I had at this pub, very authentic weisse...............
Stout Bros. Taverner Nut Brown Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;Uh, it's brown. Smells like the water that I pour out of the garbage cans at work. No nuttiness. No flavors.
Stout Bros. Taverner Nut Brown Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;Reddish brown. Tangy, roasty, caramel nose. Sweet taste just doesn't go anywhere or do anything for me. Some strange nutty aftertaste.
Stout Bros. Taverner Nut Brown Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;Medium tan head atop a clear copper body. Aroma is nutty/toffee, moderately sweet. Taste is medium sweet, toffee, toasty. Light watery body.
Stout Bros. Taverner Nut Brown Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;Actually I think this is as good as Newcastle. I really don't like Newcastle all that much, however. Cloudy brown color. Slightly bitter with good balance.
Stout Bros. Taverner Nut Brown Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Stout Brothers Public House;breweries in wisconsin can't seem to make a good british style ale..........
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;They brew some fine good beer in Colorado. To me, this is better than the average IPA. Not in the top tier by any means, but I would classify as 2nd tier-ish. Mostly about the flavor and smooth mouthfeel here. They do not skimp on the bitterness either, which lives up to it's name. Citrus-grapefruit hops is the theme, but balanced well with the caramel malts, etc. Appearance is semi-cloudy medium orange...not a pale/clear IPA. Only grabbed a single in a mix-and-match to sample, but will look for more so I can taste test with some of my favorites in this style.
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;From Oct 2006 Poured from 22oz bottle a clear amber gold with a smallish head of foam that pretty much maintains its size for the entire session. Btw, they have a year and month bottled on the label but nothing was notched. The smell is on the subtle side with faint whiffs of grassy and citrusy hops. The taste is really grassy and it has some good citrus flavour as well..mainly lemon, with a really faint malt presence but... I *like* what the hops are doing in this IPA and it's making for some really good drinkability so being weak in the malt isn't going to hurt my review of this American IPA at all. Good stuff! Bottom line: A nice American IPA from a small brewery in Boulder Colorado. Give it a chance if you find some.
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;12oz bottle. Hazy orange color with an off white head. Grain hops aroma. Strong hops flavor up front with a hops malt finish. Medium heavy body with a bitter finish. Definitely a hops focused beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;"Hazy orange amber with thinck bubbly foamy white head; aroma is sweet woody floral malt hop balance; flava malt roast molasses notes then some hop bitters; feels light to medium and lively fizzy; finishes dry bitter with woody notes"
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;[Bottle (12oz)] Pours a cloudy golden-orange with an average size lasting frothy off-white head. Minimal lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, bread, citrus hops, citrus peel and finally, earthy and herbal notes. Flavour of caramel malt, resiny hops, citrus, light vegetal notes and a long bitter finish -- hops mostly come through in the finish. Medium bodied. Something doesn’t quite gel here, it’s just decent.
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;Hotel room breakfast tasting with Jack & Leighton, Hilton Tampa, 22/02/15. Golden orange with a moderate off white covering. Nose is caramel malt, light pine, bitter citric peel. Taste is caramel malt forward, orange, light pine, toasted malt. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close. So so - generic old skook brew pub malt driven IPA affair.
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;"Pours a light coppery color with off-white head. Caramel malt, light citrus, and funky pine notes on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with more malt than hop."
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;Bottle at home. Pours a copper color, white head, dissipates into a thin laced film. Aroma is caramel malts, orange and citrusy hops. Taste is slightly earthy, citrusy hops, lots of cracker and caramel malts. Malts overpower the hops, finishes with an underwhelming bitterness. Palate is medium body, high carbonation. Malts wash out some good favors in this one. Below average IPA.
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;Bottle shared during RBWG 2015. Pours clear orange gold with a frothy white head. Pale bread in the aroma, rindy orange. Medium sweet flavor with crackery pale malts, old pine needles, citrus peel, metal. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Boring finish, perhaps a bit aged, with dusty pine, leaves, dry citrus, more crackers. So so.
Twisted Pine Hoppy Boy IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Twisted Pine Brewing;Not your prototypical ipa but I kind of enjoyed it. Soft but passable hop aroma w/ a clear golden pour & thin white head. The taste has an underlying bitterness but isn’t dry & is quite drinkable. I understand the low scores for the style but found it to be a decent beer overall!
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;Pours a clear yellow body with a small white head. Aroma of wheat, florals, some raspberry, and cereal. Flavor of raspberry syrup and wheat with a thin, somewhat fizzy mouthfeel.
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;Pours hazy orange with a thin white head, low retention. Strong raspberry aroma, maybe additional notes of biscuit, caramel, and grass, but so faint, it’s hard to be sure. Light body, somewhat watery, light carbonation. Medium sweet, lightly tart, light bitter finish. Reminds me of an Izze soda, only a touch more bitter.
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;Thin golden pour w/ a tiny white head & minimal lacing. The aroma is almost nonexistent for a fruit beer. The taste is fairly heavy in raspberry upfront but finishes kind of dry & uneventful. Nothing to write home about!
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;"""Pretty boring in all regards even for the style. Light raspberry nose with some rather generic sweet malt. Flavor identical. Really really boring. Want more something!"""
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;Bottle. A- Cloying sweetness, artificial raspberry syrup, wheat, berries. A- Golden color, slightly hazy liquid, white head. T- Sweet, raspberry syrup, subtle berries, artificial, slightly tart, sticky. P- Light body, average texture, average carbonation, sweet finish. O- No offense to Twisted Pines but they have some of the worst bottle artwork I have ever seen. So generic and reminds me of a cheap novelty soda. Sadly, the taste isn’t much better. artificial syrupy tasting and overly sweet. Just not very well done.
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;12 oz bottle from Evergreen Discount. Golden yellow and clear appearance with a small white head. Aroma is mostly raspberry fruitiness with pale malts and light bread. Similar flavor, fruity and mildly sweet. Light body, pretty thin and easy to drink. Simple and refreshing, as described.
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;Hazy yellow gold pour with a thin, soapy white head. Aroma is raspberry, lemon and a hint of doughy yeast. Flavor is seedy raspberry, floury wheat and old tap water. Light body with a water feel, and light, blanketing and quite sharp carbonation. Nothing too offensive here, but there really just isn’t much here at all.
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;INteresting. Refreshing and easy to drink. thin but just good enough in all the features was.
Twisted Pine Raspberry Wheat Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Twisted Pine Brewing;On tap at Capitol Beer & Tap Room. Pours clear blonde with a modest white head and a Raspberry aroma. There is a watery light malt flavor with a bit of raspberry. Not muchthere.

Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Clear amber color with fine white head. Malty, honey aroma. Flavor has a very sweet sticky honey taste.
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle. Pours a brown/amber colour with off-white head. Both aroma and flavor is mostly all about honey. Taste is sweet and also has come grass/citrus notes, but very dominated by honey. Decent.
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle at Chris_o birthday bash 08. Amber colour with thin beige head. Honey aroma. Just actually a rather nice beer. Good honey. Like a crunchie with honeycomb. It’s got better as it went on.
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle. Pours a clear, golden amber with an off-white head. Small lacing. Sweet honey aroma with malt and wooden notes in the background. Flavour is sweet with honey dominating. Some bitterness. Slight metallic notes and a sharp acidic touch. Dry finish with a lingering honey sweetness. The honey is nice in itself but it produces a strange off-note which is not wholly to my liking. Still, not too bad overall though. 21-06-08.
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle 0.66 l. Bought Kvickly Hilleroed. Aroma filled with pure honey. Beautiful red-brown colour - small beige head. Taste quite dominated by the honey. Low carbonation.
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;A Mes rate: Bottle at the Oi Oi Saveloy tasting at Chris O’s. Amber with a thin off white film. Heavy corn in the aroma. Slight sweetness from the honey and clear malt. Flavour is more of the same but slightly better but there is just too much honey for me.
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Nice amber apperance, with a fine white head. Aroma is nothing but honey. Very sweet taste with a lot of honey in it. Ok carbonation, very sweet finish.
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Orange-chestnut coloured beer under a cream-coloured, small, but persistent head. Extremely powerful nose of dark liquid honey, to the exclusion of anything else. Leafy flavour, autumn leaves, nuts and honey in the finish only. Not too sweet, in spite of the nose. Hint of alcohol, and herbs. Very slick, pappy MF, impression of alcoholwarming, despite the low ABV, but medium bodied at best. It certainly deserves its name. Many thanks to Dirk and Leen
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottled. Amber color with small head. Strong sweet flowery honey aroma. Dryer flavor with flowery honey, fruity tartness and hint of nutty maltiness. Mostly honey in the aroma and flavor.
Carlsberg Semper Ardens Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Dark amber colored with little yellow head. Honey dominates this overly sweet aroma, mild grains also here. Medium bodied. Flavor is the same with nothing but sweet honey, aftertaste has mild cardboard. No good.
Salopian Gooseberry Fool;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salopian Brewery;Hazy yellow-orange. Nearly no head. There’s some weird leaves or blades of grass or something in the bottom of the glass. I’ll assume it’s the bog myrtle or whatever crazy spice they’re using in this stuff. Personally, I’m leaning toward bog myrtle because bog myrtle is super cool and it drives the ladies crazy. Nose is dusty with a hint of floral honey and some sort of herbal oddness that I can’t quite place. Once again, I am forced to assume it’s bog myrtle. Mouthfeel is smooth and a tad undercarbonated. I don’t know what a gooseberry tastes like but I don’t think I taste anything fruity or berry-like here. There is an interesting earthy character that comes across as almost chocolaty, undoubtedly due to the bog myrtle. Like many of this brewers other beers, this Gooseberry Wheat is more interesting than it is good, aside from the bog myrtle which is awesome.
Salopian Gooseberry Fool;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salopian Brewery;Martin Barry, the Salopian brewer, was a chef before founding his own brewery in Shropshire. Many of his beers experiment interestingly with spices, and this is no exception. The careful mix of three different malts, four different hops, and god knows how many spices, result in a light, modern ale with a rich complexity. Flavours include cabbage, mushrooms, ginger, coriander, oranges, Chinese spice, nettles, and something quite familiar that I couln't quite pin down: gooseberries? Pleasing though all that is, I didn't find it that satisfying or exciting an ale. Barry's intention is to produce a range of ales that can also be used in cooking, and there is a recipe for gooseberry fool included on the bottle. Interesting, but not highly recommended.
Salopian Gooseberry Fool;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salopian Brewery;Bottled. Doesn`t say on the label that it contains gooseberries but has such an unusual aroma that it must have. Amber gold in colour with a good head and condition. Aroma with the glass at a distance is of peardrops, but close up it is like crushed garden weeds like nettle or dandelion. Body has a sweet maltiness to balance the harsh earthy bitterness and the finish is soft and dry. Weird.
Great Deep Manhita Scottish Ale;Hagatna, Guam;Scottish Ale;The Great Deep Brewing Company;Tasty Scottish Ale. The hops are there from start to finish. Probably be better if not brewed at sea level.
Great Deep Manhita Scottish Ale;Hagatna, Guam;Scottish Ale;The Great Deep Brewing Company;After straightening out the tap situation at Mac & Marti in Guam, I realized this was a pretty good Scottish ale and not a very good Irish Red ale. Poured a cloudy butterscotch color with a medium off white head. Hoppy, somewhat skunky aroma. Earthy hop flavor. The smokiness is light up front but after a few sips, it becomes more pronounced in the finish. Good.
Great Deep Manhita Scottish Ale;Hagatna, Guam;Scottish Ale;The Great Deep Brewing Company;Wonderful hop hop and more hops! A beauty, dark amber with a nice thick head, great flavor from this well balanced brew. Hands down the best offering from this small microbrewery (the only one I know of in Guam!) I've had many a pint of this delicious ale. Great food, nice folks, awesome brew! Stop by if your in the neighborhood!
Erharting Export;Erharting, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Erharting;500ml bottle at RIO, courtesy of Phillip. Aroma is light malt. Appearance is yellow with a small white foam. Taste is light bitter. Watery. Ok.
Erharting Export;Erharting, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Erharting;Unremarkable beer from the design, but certainly a good Export or Dortmunder type beer. This underrated style deserves a renaissance, and Erharting Export is a good example of this moderately drinkable Export type.
Erharting Export;Erharting, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Erharting;(bottle) clear golden colour with a frothy white head. aroma of sugar icing and cashew nuts, with a light hint of nettles, some overripe pears and green apple. flavour is mostly metallic hops and starchy pale malts, slightly earthy, with a touch of ethanol, dried apricots and a semi-dry finish. medium-bodied with average carbonation.

Kanclerz Jasne Pelne;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);No 281 Rated:19.12.2007 Can, 500 ml Appearance: Pours bright and shiny, clear, well filtered golden body, carbonation of body is medium, head is white, foamy, quite quickly disappearing, rather no hints of lacing, what lasts is a small, thin froth on the surface of the body. Aroma: Wet fur, some unfreshness, no distinctive hoppy nose, neither grainy nor hoppy, accidic, some notes of rust, metallic, can, slightly milky, chalk, rather faint aroma,nothing special or worth interest, tap water with a water supply pipe accent, the wormer the beer is the more chalky and unfresh the aroma becomes. Not inviting. Flavour: No sugar, like a poor quality Pilsener, water, accidity, rust, watered grains, a bit crispy, later on barley malts on palate and quite tolerable water quality, but in fact dominating over the flavour. Finish duration is short. Palate: Body is light, texture is wattery, carbonation is soft to medium on palate. Finish feel is wattery, accidic, grainy and crispy but dominated by water.
Kanclerz Jasne Pelne;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Can. Clear golden colour with a medium mostly diminsihing white head. Malty aroma and taste with only notes of hops.
Kanclerz Jasne Pelne;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Can, from High Spirits in Cleethorpes. Gold, thin shortlived white head and low condition. Vague sweet cereal notes in the nose with a little fruitiness, quite smooth and refined in the mouth but quite muted. Some gentle malty sweetness balanced by a modicum of hop bitternesss and a warming background alcoholic note. Warmth extends to the finish but little else can be bothered to make the short trip.
Kanclerz Jasne Pelne;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);"Slightly disappointing lager from Koszalin breweries, whose Brok beers I like.

Kanclerz Jasne Pelne;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Canned. An orange coloured lager with a big head on pouring, but that disappears in no time.

Sports City Cafe Pale Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;CJs Grill and Brewing;I'm thinking this is their warrior pale ale but if it isnt most wont care cuase it sucks anyways. A very strange orange aromoa to it, not normal. Boring, yeasty, with little hops, back to work chicken fuckers.
Sports City Cafe Pale Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;CJs Grill and Brewing;I was very dissapointed with this beer. Little to no aroma and the flavor was just bland. For a pale ale it was lacking in hops. Seemed more like a cheap golden ale or lager, but the bartender insisted that it was the pale ale.
Kopparbergs Special Brew X-Strong 7.5%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;En meget stærk guldøl. Den har varme og en sødme fra malten, der gør at den ikke er helt udrikkelig, tvært imod.
Kopparbergs Special Brew X-Strong 7.5%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can from Systembolaget. Oddly funky smell, like someones old underwear, sweaty and with a slight toilette aroma. Also boozy. The taste is different. Sweet without bitterness and an artificial malty taste. The taste isn’t as boozy. However it isn’t nice to drink.

Kopparbergs Special Brew X-Strong 7.5%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;"Can shared at The Wellington during the final stop of the RateBeer Black Country Bus Bash. Massive thanks to tommann for hooking this up. The beer pours perfectly clear yellow with a creamy white head. Honestly, you cannot really knock this beer on appearance; it looks better than most of its peers. Smells mostly like cleaning detergent, real industrial grade stuff, enit. There is some dry, lightly bitter lemon in the snout as well, harkening to mind Pine-Sol or something of that ilk. The flavor is massively sweet, terribly astringent, with lots of alcohol heat and tons of simple, sugary cereal grains. I would imagine if you used toilet cleaner on your corn flakes in the morning instead of the usual milk you might arrive at a flavor profile approaching that which I am experiencing right now. This malt liquor is full bodied with medium to high carbonation. The finish contains some odd, unexpected fruit notes but also plenty of expected notes of intense alcohol and grainy cereal. Overall it is a pretty poor beverage. Although, in all fairness, we had this on the last stop of a long day of pub crawling and the beer may not have been served at an optimal temperature. Still, not a great specimen of the tricky-to-make-well style we know as Malt Liquor."
Kopparbergs Special Brew X-Strong 7.5%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;6th July 2013 Black Country Beano. Not sure where this can was split. Light haze on this pale gold beer.

Kopparbergs Special Brew X-Strong 7.5%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can split by Tomman. Cheers for landing this top want. The pour’s light gold with no head. Pretty nasty, cheap looking. The nose is newspaper covered in garbage juice. Frankly, the taste is pretty similar. Nice hot boozy kick on the finish. Rough and ready mouthfeel. Unnecessarily fizzy, full on the palate. Overall, a proper bus station malt liquor. Not completely without merit, but still pretty terrible.
New Amsterdam Light New York Amber Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a medium amber with a decent head. Aroma of malt and caramel. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is not their best but still tasty.
New Amsterdam Light New York Amber Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Light amber with some finings. Sticky, compacted white head. Very light carbonation. Healthy toasted caramel aroma, oxidation and soft hops. Decent body with a dose of toasted caramel, wet paper and slightly citric hops. Would never guess this for a light (95 calories, fat free) beer. Although the flavor seems a bit stripped it is still moderately tasty. Medium body. Clean and smooth. Fresh water taste. Hints of minerals. Seems stale at the finish. Why don't these guys use dated packaging? Decent, if fresh.

Tennent's Special Ale / 70/-;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);Jan 2018 - Keg at the historic Horse Shoe pub, Glasgow. As 'Tennent's Special 70/-'. Pours an orange brown, translucent and still with a creamy white head that leaves thick lacing. Aroma is airy, faintly malty. Body is light and smooth with tingly carbonation. Taste is watery, little character to it - a bit like drinking vaguely malty dish water or the water vegetables have been boiled in. Nothing much to it so it's not offensive. The old boys here are loving it as an accompaniment to chatting up waitresses 40 years younger than them. (4-4-4-3-10=2.5)

Crystal clear pale straw in colour with a thin white head. Slight floral note to the short hopped aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing.

Hazy golden body with a full, deep and lasting off-white foam blanket for a head. The aroma was both fruity and biscuit: anyone like Garibaldi biscuits, but sweeter and not just currents. The taste is also a sweet blend with the malts winning the flavour stakes throughout the brew. Tasty and robust in nature the body feel is just right and suits the alcohol level nicely.

Rainier Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz can (Old Notes)-Pours a light golden with a small white head. Aroma of nothing. Taste of nothing. Another light pale lager.
Rainier Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"There is no reason for this beer to exist except to provide a little more variety for your everyday schmo in his list of ""light"" beers. At least it has a pretty mountain on the can."
Rainier Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours a light golden yellow. Aromas of minor hops, corn, grains. Flavor is light, crisp, watery with a little hop and not much else.
Rainier Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Guam SwillFest 2004: Pours a very pale yellow with a quickly dissipating white head. Moderately fruity aroma-grapes with a hint of hops. The flavor is almost nonexistent. Very carbonated and almost tasting like club soda. There just ain’t anything in this one.
Rainier Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Baisically it's like Bud Light et al. It really makes me angry that Rainier sold out to Miller and closed the brewery in south Seattle. I used to enjoy the aroma of the brewery, it was the highlight of an otherwise awful commute to work. I don’t live in Seattle anymore, but it still bugs me. It used to only be sold in Washington, but I don't think that Miller gives a rat's a$$ about tradition and the beer is making its way across the country now, I suppose.
Rainier Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Rasta Rex brought this with him on his way to Moab. Although it was a Rainier Light its always good to drink a beer with an old friend in your driveway.
Rainier Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Certainly looks like a light. Yea, tastes very light too. Nothing impressive but what would you expect for a generic light beer?
Abbaye de Vaucelles;Hordain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;La Choulette;Ale fajniutkie piwo. Piana biala jak balwan na sniegu i tak dlugo stoji jak on prze 40 stopniowym mrozie. Metniste w odcieniu moreli piwo. Pachnie superowo morelami suszonymi i swiezymi, gruszkami i mirabelkami. W smaku nie czuc alkoholu bardzo owocowe morele i brzoskwinie a na wykonczeniu wyglodzony smak przecieru z mango i jablek.

Abbaye de Vaucelles;Hordain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;La Choulette;750ml bottle (One Pint Pub, Helsinki) Messy petfood aroma, bran, some tinned tomato. Clear orange, ephemeral head. Messy grains in taste. Some wheatiness, again the tinned tomatoes. watery and a bit fizzy. Not good. Does at lest have some real full hops in it. But that can’t save a watery incipid ale.
Abbaye de Vaucelles;Hordain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;La Choulette;Bottle 0.75l at One Pint Pub, Helsinki. Colour is clear orange with very small white head. Aromas and flavours: Fruits, spices, ginger and biscuits, sweetness and malts.
Abbaye de Vaucelles;Hordain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;La Choulette;(Bottle, 0.75 l - BBE 21.09.13 (the year was more or less unreadable), at One Pint Pub, 20130913) The beer poured golden and clear. Its head was medium sized and white. Aroma had fruitiness, caramell and molasses. Palate was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Flavours were malts, molasses, mildly Belgian style yeast, fruitiness, hops and bitterness. Aftertaste was fruity, malty and bitter. A decent malty bière de garde.
Abbaye de Vaucelles;Hordain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;La Choulette;"Fast gone head over pale clear-golden beer, very fine pearling. Vanilla extract and caramel, liqueur, as something to add to dessert dough, suggesting excessive sweetness. Sweet-nutty beer, some raw grains; much less sweet as suggested by the nose, and much less alcoholic as well. Feels more spritzy than the visual; slick, medium bodied, and a certain fery, burning feel backthroat. Not very distinctive taste, unsettling nose; clashing instead of balance."
Abbaye de Vaucelles;Hordain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;La Choulette;Light hazy amber with an off-white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, fruity and yeasty. Flavor is quite sweet and moderate bitter. Sweet finish. 160512

Ambassador Hemp Ale;Windsor, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Ambassador Brewing Company;Surprisingly tasty, bad aftertaste. Objective- keep drinking. VERY filling. Overall- worth a look.
Ambassador Hemp Ale;Windsor, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Ambassador Brewing Company;Stale hoppy aroma, pours without much of a head, slightly bitter. Perhaps this was an old bottle?
Ambassador Hemp Ale;Windsor, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Ambassador Brewing Company;Deep amber colour, with a buckwheat nose and a slightly whiskeyish malt notes, and caramelized pears.
Ambassador Hemp Ale;Windsor, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Ambassador Brewing Company;Light golden color. Sugary, faint sweet malty presence, smooth, slightly bitter hop finish. Not much going on, and I don't taste any hemp, but maybe I'm looking for something different.
Ambassador Cherry Stout;Windsor, Ontario, Canada;Stout;Ambassador Brewing Company;Doesn't have any cherry to it. The body is thin, with light, beany coffee notes and a remarkably quick finish.
Ambassador Lemon Lager;Windsor, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Ambassador Brewing Company;Suffers from being based on a rather lousy, grainy lager. The flavours do not come together especially well, and the balance is a little off as a result. Will work as a patio refresher, though, and is better than the cavity-inducing 'hard lemonades' out there.
Isle of Skye MacNabs;Uig, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Isle of Skye Brewing Co.;Draught: This is a really lovely bitter with lots of malt and biscuit flavors. Worth a trip to Skye and McNabbs for a pint.
Isle of Skye MacNabs;Uig, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Isle of Skye Brewing Co.;Bottle at some hotel- pours cola-esque dark brown, hazy, dark orange, grayish head. nose is cola cubes. sea air like uig, seaweed, roasted malt, taste is light, strong saltyness light roast flavour. Like a lighter version of the oyster stout.
Isle of Skye MacNabs;Uig, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Isle of Skye Brewing Co.;Any first impressions? -Great foam lingers atop the reddish brown. -Fruit jam and caramel are invitingly spread on toast. -The aroma had said it all apparently, as the flavor profile repeats everything announced. -Quite full-bodied due to rich maltiness and comfy carbonation. What if you dig deeper? -Subtle supporting hoppiness almost balances the flavor profile. -Strawberries and cherries make up fun fruit flavors. -The bready character is sustaining. -This is purportedly a blend of Red Cuillin and Black Cuillin, and I wouldn’t be surprised this were true after having a pint of each over a few days in Portree. Whatever it is, it remains a complex and flavorful pint of scottish ale. On cask at MacNab’s Inn, part of the Royal Hotel, in Portree.
Isle of Skye MacNabs;Uig, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Isle of Skye Brewing Co.;Sampled cask conditioned at The Royal Hotel, Portree, Isle of Skye. Dark ruby/mahogany. Creamy and lightly roasty. Medium bodied, fruity and softly malty. Salty finish. Solid, but unexceptional.
Maumee Bay Willy's Wheat;Toledo, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Maumee Bay Brewing Co.;Sample at the brewpub: Clear dark gold color with a minimal white head and sparse lacing. Wheat aroma is difficult to detect but it is there, along with a bit of bubblegum. Light and clean mouthfeel with wheat and hops flavors, along with a fair amount of malt backbone. The finish is wheaty and lingering. Actually pretty good.
Maumee Bay Willy's Wheat;Toledo, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Maumee Bay Brewing Co.;draft - The aroma is virtually nonexistent. I think I smelled a trace of malt. The flavor is malty and very light. The mouthfeel is thin and the finish is clean. That’s about all I can say for it. This is not an impressive American Wheat.
Maumee Bay Willy's Wheat;Toledo, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Maumee Bay Brewing Co.;Editorial, Ok I just don't get this style. Light straw color with a wispy, foamy white head. Mild malt and wheat sweetness. Light dry, honeylike, finish. Seems like a waste of yeast to me.
Facon Ouden-Bruin;Kortrijk-Bellegem, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brasserie Facon;"Dark amber colour, hazy, big head, fine perlage. Characteristic aroma of oak cask, tart, black fruits, old hop. Pretty malty, some sweetness, not enough sour; good body, smooth, a hint of liquorice; halfway between a Dubbel and a Oud Bruin. Ordinary palate. A hidden complexity, a great potential, but definitely not ready; must try after a few years of cellar."

Cloudy, thick honey color, little head. Bread, baby cookies, light grass, tiny it of citrus, and light final bitterness. Thin body. Okay. Seems a touch muddled, as a kolsch. But tasty enough.

Oh! La! Ho Kölsch;Toumi-shi, Nagano Prefecture, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Oh! La! Ho;Mild tropical aroma and flavor, pretty mild overall. Quite a light kolsch attempt, but still quite refreshing and drinkable.
Oh! La! Ho Kölsch;Toumi-shi, Nagano Prefecture, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Oh! La! Ho;Can from Le Collier. Straight from the can. Lightly creamy, bit of lemon, very kolsch like. Always easy drinking. Bit tea like, earl grey element and decent fruitiness. Quite nice. Very soft in the mouth.
Oh! La! Ho Kölsch;Toumi-shi, Nagano Prefecture, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Oh! La! Ho;Bottle. Hazy pale golden with a white head. Surprising lemony hop aroma. Grassy and lemony hop flavours in abundance. Almost chewy texture. A very tasty beer that makes most other Kölsch beers pale in comparison.
Oh! La! Ho Kölsch;Toumi-shi, Nagano Prefecture, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Oh! La! Ho;Can. Fruity, sweet aroma with a bit of cream. Some esters and a touch of citrus (grapefruit and lemon). Nice but not authentic. Light to medium gold color with a medium, frothy head. Rich golden malt flavor, sweet, grainy, creamy. Fruit including a bit of citrus noticeable. Rather typical Japanese Kolsch: too sweet, thick and creamy for the style, but pleasant nonetheless.
Oh! La! Ho Kölsch;Toumi-shi, Nagano Prefecture, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Oh! La! Ho;0,35 l can. Fruity aroma. Taste of apricots and mango. Very fruity, and there are aroma hops hat contribute to the full flavour. Decent.
Ellicottville Imperial IPA (Pantius Droppus);Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;Draft at Shepherd and Knucklehead, Hoboken. Darker reddish color with a thin beige head. Sticky caramel and booze with some go notes. Heavy, cloying malty flavor. Kinda reminds me of all the bad barleywines that use to be everywhere in the early 2010s. Not sure how you can possible call this an Imperial IPA in 2017.
Ellicottville Imperial IPA (Pantius Droppus);Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;Pours a hazy rust orange-amber with light head. A string malt and dark fruit aroma. A strong malt forward taste with caramel and dark fruits and light hops. A lingering caramel malt and light hop aftertaste.
Ellicottville Imperial IPA (Pantius Droppus);Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;"Bottle. Nose gorgeous PNW fruit salad, typical citrus blend but with really nice cookie dough and a little spice, also stronger malt than usual. Just a touch of nut. Very inviting! Pour a deep but still clear burnished orange with red highlights and a creamy beige head. Taste strongly sweet (too sweet) and strongly bitter, a big mash up of resin and sugar, berry and light citrus squeaking through, meaty malt and spice, lighter vegetal, medium and increasing alcohol numbing and warmth. Aftertaste picks up a little mint and structure without astringency. It’s bold but boozy and a little flabby; still, I welcome more traditional, maltier IIPAs that are actually pulled off, and this one is, more or less. [3.3]. Second go: naaah, way too sweet. [2016.06.17: 3.0]"
Ellicottville Imperial IPA (Pantius Droppus);Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;Sampled at Mile, this disgusting brew pours hazy brown with small ring of white head. Notes are so fucking gross: shampoo, commerce bank lollipop, caramel pie, shit malt, shit grain and shit hops. So much booze heat, pushed back the 1 ounce sample after a sip or two. Horrifying
Ellicottville Imperial IPA (Pantius Droppus);Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;12 ounce bottle. Amber orange pour. Large creamy beige head. Sweet fruity malt nose has notes of sweet orange and caramel. Flavor follows the nose with additional notes of tropical fruit hops and dried apricots. Noticeable alcohol notes in middle.

Pours a clear amber color with a medium sized, creamy beige head. The aroma and flavor have sweet malts, caramel, some candied fruit, a mishmash of faded hops, citrus, some herbal notes, mild bitterness, seems old.
Ellicottville Imperial IPA (Pantius Droppus);Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a red-amber color with a large creamy orange-beige head that lingered and left great lacing. The aroma was bitter, perfumey hops and a bit of sweet fruitiness. The flavor was bitter and boozy with fruity hops, some perfume, an herbal presence, underlying sweetness and then more perfume. Very long perfume and herbal hop finish. Moderately full bodied. Booziness grows. Meh.
Ellicottville Imperial IPA (Pantius Droppus);Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;Strange beer- Tons of malt and hops but not bitter at all. The sweetness covers up the alcohol well. I enjoyed it. Good in it own right but different from other Imperial IPAs. Pseudo aged 120 min if I had to compare.
Ellicottville Imperial IPA (Pantius Droppus);Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;12 oz. bottle, sent from wilco (thanks a lot, Mike), pours a clear bright orange amber with a small white head. Aroma is pretty sweet, with caramel malts, big resinous hops, and a syrupy quality. Flavour is certainly on the sweet malty side for a IIPA, bordering on cloying sweetness, with lots of resinous hops underneath. Not at all my kind of IIPA - just way too sweet for me. It’s not bad though.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;Pours brown with white top. Aroma is nut, toffee and grain. Taste is faint nut and residual sweetness from the malt. Basic and good.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;I don’t remember much about this one. Had on tap at the brewery. Most of their beer was pretty decent.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;Ob tap at the brewpub w Ronnee. Medium to dark brown pour, nothing out of the ordinary. Nose is nutty and a little coffee. Palate is loaded w vanilla bean and hazelnut. Some hop bitterness and a hint of roasted coffee. Enjoyed.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;Draft. Pours amber brown with a beige head. Sweet malty aroma with notes of coffee. The flavor has coffee, roasted malts, and sweet toffee. Pretty good.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;On Tap at the Brew Pub. A translucent brown pour. Aroma of roasted malts. Flavor of roasted malts with nuts and some sweetness. The alcohol was hidden well. (or maybe I had too much by now and did not notice) Decent
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;Brown with a decent head. Has a roasted, slight earth hop aroma. Flavor has a deeper roasted malt note, light chocolate, some oak, toffee, and light herbal hops. A decent brown that went down easy.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;On tap @ Ithaca BrewFest Amber brown with a bit of white head. Aroma is mostly malty, caramel, bit of coffee, hint of hops. Somewhat bitter, medium to lighter bodied, hops come out more on the palate.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;Part of a sampler at brewpub. I found all the brews to be better than average though I don’t remember specifics for most of them. It is worth mentioning that the sampler here is very generous with glasses that are big enough to really give you enough to form an opinion.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;Cask at Pony Bar. Cloudy brown pour with a thick sticky tan head. The aroma is lightly toffeeish with a kiss of cold coffee as well. The coffee character is really quite pronounced and as it warms it sticks around. Lightly hoppy with a fairly assertive bitterness on the back of the palate that works pretty well. A fairly complex malt bill… toffee and brown malt with a touch of herbal cocoa sweetness, but it is well balanced by the hops. Lingering herbal/hoppy finish. For a style that I’m not typically a fan of, I enjoyed this a lot.
Empire Downtown Brown;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Empire Brewing Company;"Sampled at the brewpub. AU15/08. App.: Medium ruby, clear, remnants of a light tan head. Aroma: Nice burnt sugar and light molasses, hints of warm spices, coffee, treacle, slightly nutty, somewhat fruity, a bit of alcohol. Palate: Medium-ish body and fairly soft carbonation. Flav.: Much like the nose, full and lovely; dry with a nice amount of bitterness. I really enjoyed this."
Empire Honey Ginger Beer;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Empire Brewing Company;From 2002: Lots of ginger apparent in the nose and taste. I thought this beer was way too sweet, but not too gingery. Pull back on the honey or maybe add some more hops and this beer would have been much better.
Empire Honey Ginger Beer;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Empire Brewing Company;Didnt kill you with ginger, so that was nice. It was more sweet than it was gingery. Would have benefited from some more hops. Dont think they will be brewing this one again, though it wasnt a bad experiment. Certainly on a better quality level than its honey brown neighbor at high falls.
Empire Honey Ginger Beer;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Empire Brewing Company;LIght yellow and, for me at least, scary looking.. GInger spice aroma with some adjuncty vibes.. Ginger flavor subtle at first but grows and grows as the beer travels through your mouth...Gingerness stays on palate for an eternity..Honey sweetness lingers around in the background throughout..Kinda sweet..But not overly so
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);375ml can. Amber in colour with a medium white foam cap. Clear with no real aroma or taste. Typical of mass produced pale lagers. Very unisnpiring.
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);This used to be a great beer produced by an independent brewery in competition with the big brewers. Carlton United Breweries (Fosters) took them over and gradually denatured the brew until nobody wanted to drink it, which gave them the pretext to axe the brand. (Typical big brewery tactic). I have not seen this beer on sale here for a couple of years. Fosters still have rights to the Powers name and put out a feeble Powers Gold at Holiday times as a cheap ’opportunistic’ special.
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);(Can 37,5 cl) Pours a clear, golden with a white head leaving some laces. Sweetish aroma of malt and corn. Medium body with sweetish notes of chicken fodder. No bitterness. Classic Aussie swill. 230108
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Light gold colour, poured a good head,this beer was very gassy on the stomach.Aroma was very hoppy slight fruity and sweet like.Flavour, bitter tended to be sour,hoppy flavour .Finish,bitter a beer I grew tired of,very boring.
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);(375 ml can from a friend from Australia) Pungent sweet scent. Clear golden color with a white head. Acidic mouthfeel and taste. Medium bitterness.
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);In the can from a sampler pack at the Sydney Airport Duty free shop. Yellow color, white head of vanishing presentation. Aroma of grains and metal. Thin and watery. Bitterness is limited and harsh, not flavorful.
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);"Is there a scarier phrase in the Australian brewing world than the one on the label of this beer: ""Queensland brewed""? The Sunshine State has a great deal going for it, but the beer... Ah well. Despite the name, this is another pale gold lager. The aroma has that wonderful Pride of Ringwood metallic ring with some wet grass and butter. Typical CUB lager burp-inducing soda-water carbonation. A hint of honey and peachy fruitiness in the mid-palate before the curse of POR washes it all away in a metallic finish. (375ml bottle)"
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Big, fat, toffee, earthy crystal malt aroma with diacetyl and mushrooms. Quite interesting. Crystal malt flavour isn’t so dominant but it’s there, light acidity and metallic bitterness. A bit watery, some pineapple. It’s actually not that far off a real bitter, which is a bit of a surprise.
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Pale gold, coarse carbonation to form a thin head which drops to nothing within a minute. Carbonation finished in a similar time. Pleasenet, sweet malt/honey aroma, but not well balanced. thin body, drying with a harsh metallic bitterness, and still a notable sweetness. Sounds like it should be nicely balanced but somehow misses out.
Powers Bitter;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);This beer was alot better than I expected, but it is still not good, it looks like an average lager but with a nice head. Average, average, average, pretty poor. cheers
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. It poured a hazy purple color with a white head. The aroma was of raspberry, hay and bread. The taste was similar to the aroma with more raspberry, hay, bread and mild carbonation with a sweet aftertaste. Ok.
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;Keg at the Water Street location. Hazy orange, no head. Weak aroma of berries and not much else. Taste is tart berries, hints of wheat. Thin.
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;"Tap at brewery. Hazy light Brown with moderate head. Smells like ""berries."" Taste is fake berries and wheat. Not cloying though"
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;On tap @ WSB, Oak Creek. Pinkish purple pour. No head whatsoever. Nose of raspberry Kool Aid. Weak, sickly sweet, and lacking in any natural fruit flavor. Tasted more like a flat generic soda than any kind of beer. This is really sub-par for this genre.
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;Smells sweet citrus but wouldn’t call it raspberry. Pink color. The wheat flavor is lost to the sugars. The touch of fruit is a little like fruit stripe gum before it goes to pot. Tap
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;Light red pour with small off white head. Standard wheat beer aroma. The amount of raspberries is perfect (not cloy). Not my favorite but I would drink again
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;On-tap, this pours a reddish color with pink head. The aroma is tart with raspberries and hints of wheat. The taste is sweet and tart, the raspberries really come through. A decent brew, much better than the rating would suggest.
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;"Draft at the downtown brewery in Milwaukee. Cloudy, reddish color. Raspberry aroma. Tart, raspberry flavor. Watery mouthfeel. Dry finish. Seems to be a brew that is caught between being a traditional beer with a hint of fruit and a full-fledged fruit beer; this doesn't quite work. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;Draft at the source. From notes. Sweet and tart with loads of raspberry. Not exactly my style, but very good.
Water Street Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;On tap and dispensed to a weizen glass at the Grafton location, showing a cloudy, reddish amber color, with white head foam that quickly diminished to a thin ring, and spots of lacing. The aroma was light grain/wheat, some acidity, subtle spice, but no noticeable phenols due to a dominant raspberry puree scent. The taste was similar notes, with a light body, effervescence that seemed to wane by mid serving, but tartness & fruit that remained to the finish.
Bullant Midland Fettler;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Flavored - Other;Inchant Brewing Company;Perched upon a bar stool supporting my ’Gunner’s’ in the FA Cup 2003, I quaffed a good eight or nine pints of this, before passing out ( not a normal thing for me ) during the trophy ceremony. Spent weeks afterwards searching for the ( I thought? ) British Ale ’Midland Fettler’s’ only to find it non-existent... Until now! Inchant brewery in Guildford, West Australia, sadly,went out of business just before I downed these pints and what a glum chain of globalist events ensued, for a revolutionary Australian Craft Brewer like ’Bullant’. From a vague memory, the palate ( On draught ) was medium bodied, light carbonation with a spritzy effervescence. Aroma was slightly dank, with yeasty highlights. Taste was overly sweet, but not cloying and ginger hit midway through. Short malty aftertaste, caramel sweetness and little hop tone gave me the impression of a Midland Mild ( hence the short story ), now to find out it’s strength and heritage somehow saddens me. :( Seemed a decent Traditional ’Gruit’ Ale, just sad to see a craft brewer go under.
Bullant Midland Fettler;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Flavored - Other;Inchant Brewing Company;Tawny brown colour with a short lasting head. Aroma of slight yeast (broth), cinnamon then honey. Flavour was ginger followed once again by honey as well as some spices. It is not a full bodied beer (thankfully I think) but it was wet.
Bullant Midland Fettler;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Flavored - Other;Inchant Brewing Company;cucumber salad aroma - the stuff with vinegar. old bottle, quite dark, dunno about the bottle conditioning. notice the alcohol. i think i'd still prefer it to my baby ginger olde
Bullant Midland Fettler;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Flavored - Other;Inchant Brewing Company;"like morocco spiced ale with extra compost. sweaty rotting pawpaw esters and thin brown sugar tang spoil what might otherwise be a drinkable powdery-malty ginger ""old"". motelpogo's h.b. on the same theme wins on a head to head, even at the ripe old age of 3 days out of the barrel."
Bullant Midland Fettler;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Flavored - Other;Inchant Brewing Company;Poured amber-brown, quite thin with basically no head. Spicey pudding-like aroma with hints of ginger. Quite sweet flavour, no hop prominance. Hints of ginger, caramel and a slightly smokey aftertaste. Medium body.
Bullant Midland Fettler;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Flavored - Other;Inchant Brewing Company;Deep red brown clear with a small short lasting fine bubbled cream coloured head. Unusual light roasted malt and spice aroma (as indicated in the commercial description) plus interesting hints of sherbert, fibreglass resin and marzipan. Medium thin body with flat watery soft drink style palate. Sweet perfumed light roasted malt sweet and the ginger and cinamon are a bit more evident in the flavour than aroma. A touch more bitter woudl really help liven up thsi beer. Soft sweetish quick fading finish. Normally I don't like ginger flavours in beer but this one sufficiently subdued to make it OK.
Bullant Midland Fettler;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Flavored - Other;Inchant Brewing Company;Well, it definitely is sweet, perhaps a little too sweet, very spicy cinamon in both the nose and palate, and a very honey like sweetness from the start to the finish. I actually didn't mind it that much, but my only real complaint was the sweetness, and probably the lack of bitterness or even roastiness to balance it out a bit. still, its good to see an Aussie brewer experimenting a bit, even if it isn't so great.
Bullant Thomas Jecks Commonwealth Ale;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Inchant Brewing Company;Dark brown with tawny tinges and a short head. Yeasty and dusty aroma, more bonox than vegemite flavour with a honey aftertaste, medium texture with a mild carbonation throughout. Enjoyable beer made in WA.
Bullant Thomas Jecks Commonwealth Ale;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Inchant Brewing Company;Deep ruby red clear with a medium size shortish lasting mid-beige head. Complex aroma and flavours but not quite as polished or as well blended as one might expect. Quite yeasty (vegemite), faint soapy hops and honey aroma, some treacle and acetone on glass swirling. Medium thin low carbonated body. Medium mild hoppy bitter with fainter nutty, coffee and sweet roasted malt flavours. Soft sweetish finish and mild bittersweet aftertaste. Quite interesting and if the brewers polished it up a little could easily rate a 4/5.
Bullant Thomas Jecks Commonwealth Ale;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Inchant Brewing Company;Deep brown, and slightly red around the edges. Little lasting head, but OK lace. Sweetish and roasted, and slightly hoppy, not insanely flavoured, but pretty tasty. Brown Ales are never a favourite of mine, but this one was OK, tasted like somethin between a porter and a brown ale (IMHO). A very surprisingly OK brew.
Bullant Guildford Porter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Porter;Inchant Brewing Company;Deep brown nearly black in colour with a brown short but almost lasting head. Aroma is lots of things, rich dark chocolate liquorice toffee and malt. Flavour is milky coffee, sweet, caramel and medium bodied. Enjoyable but slightly different for a porter.
Bullant Guildford Porter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Porter;Inchant Brewing Company;Deep opaque brown with a larger than average and relatively long lasting dark brown head. Aroma begins with strong roasted malt intertwined with coffee and hints of port wine, someting yeasty & chocolate. Medium thinnish typical porter body with medium malt and hint of cough medicine start. Reasonably strong bitter and roasted flavours dominate the middle and thereafter. Finish also has hints of caramel sweet malt before going back to a dryish bitter. Quite a surprise for a small local brewery in the middle of nowhere to make such an interesting brew. One to follow up.
Bullant Guildford Porter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Porter;Inchant Brewing Company;Not too bad at all. Deep brown to black in colour with a tan head. Roasty nose, with perhaps a bit of fruit. Sweetish on the palate, but the finish is a tad more drier, and a tad bitter. Lots of roasty coffee and caramel flavours, not insane, but pretty good for an Aussie beer, quite full-flavoured, slight molasses flavour, which didn't quite agree with me, but i think this beer was more good than bad, another surprise from this brewer.
HopTown Oatmeal Breakfast Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;HopTown Brewing Company;27-Apr-14 (22-oz bottle) I like Oatmeal Stouts that develop a hint sourness over time. This one has an entry of dark chocolate, dark toast, sour dough, and perhaps some tart cherry, finishing with a nice earthy, smoky, tobacco flavor. The aromas show cacao nib, toast, oatmeal, sour dough, tobacco, shiitake mushroom, and tart berry and cherry. The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, lightly acidic, and generally dry on the palate. It’s dark-brown in color with a medium-brown rim and a small, tan head fading to a thin ring. Overall, this is a pleasant, complex Oatmeal Stout that’s cellared quite nice over the years, although I don’t know exactly how old this one is. Maybe 8 years?
HopTown Oatmeal Breakfast Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;HopTown Brewing Company;Transparent dark brown, minimal beige head. Decent aroma of chocolate, licorice and coffee, light hop character in background. As it warms more and more coffee coming through. Coffee dominates flavor, not much else going on. Mouthfeel lacks a bit, body thins out a bit as it warms.
HopTown Oatmeal Breakfast Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;HopTown Brewing Company;"Vintage 2005 Pours opaque black with a dense, thick, dark tan head. The batter-like foam rose to over an inch, and fell slowly to the surface. Remnants of clingy froth failed to stay on the walls of the glass, and only a trace of lacework remained as a result. Aromatics are a nice blend of coffee and dark chocolate. Slightly acrid and heavily roasted, with a mild creamy note. Drizzeled caramel and chocolate syrup come forward in the end. The mouthfeel is a bit spritzy and some overcarbonation keeps the brew from having any creaminess. Not a thick as I had hoped. The pallet is laden with dark chocolate and burnt caramel. A strong espresso note follows through along with a generous dose of roasted malts and a hint of smoke. Finishes slightly warming with a lingering bitter chocolate bite. Lacking a lot of character that is eluded to by the moniker ""breakfast stout""."
HopTown Oatmeal Breakfast Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;HopTown Brewing Company;Bomber pours a big brown expansive foam ball with dark dark body and spotty lacing. It smells like a hand full of steel cut oats mixed with faint roasted malts. The over bubbly carbonation causes the beer to explode and punctuate the initial burnt malt, astringent malt and roasted malt notes. As the mushroom cloud of carbonation subsides the oatmeal twang, burnt malts and coffee all ride the flavor to the finish. The beer leaves burnt malts and oats into the after taste.
HopTown Oatmeal Breakfast Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;HopTown Brewing Company;"Meh. A very boring sweet stout. Thanks hopdog for sending it my way though! It is not bad by any means, but it does not differentiate itself from the loads of other stouts out there either in quality or innovation. Typical thin head, dark near-black color, roasted coffee, chocolate aroma. Taste is very much coffee and bitter chocolate; finishes slightly creamy, but the hoppiness of the beer really cuts into the creaminess of the beer, making the cream seem like a worthless pursuit. The flavors just do not all come together to create a great beer. Decent beer, but just decent."

Side Pocket High Gravity Malt Liquor;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Malt Liquor;Universal Sales Inc;40 oz. bottle, with moderate particular buildup in the bottom. Pours a medium, rapidly collapsing white head, over an effervescent, light gold (SRM 4) body......nose is mild malts, sweet corn, minimal hop tones.....taste is mild malt, corn tones, sweet fruit tones, minimal ho finish.....mouth feel, light watery body, high alcohol, moderate carbonation. This is a very simple beer in both aroma and flavor and is very high in alcohol. It is dangerous. BJCP 4/1/7/2/3
Side Pocket High Gravity Malt Liquor;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Malt Liquor;Universal Sales Inc;This shit is fucking amazing. There are very few beers where I’d rather not drink anything than drink that beer and this is one of them. It’s sweet and sticky, heavy w/ loads of weird nutty and overripe berry notes from oxidized malt. This is pretty much disgusting across the board.
Side Pocket High Gravity Malt Liquor;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Malt Liquor;Universal Sales Inc;40 at Adnielsens pre-wedding bash. Pour is clear orange with a big white head and good lacing. Corny, doughy, grassy, green apple, and grapes in the aroma. Taste is ethanol, corn, green apples, and dough with a lot of alcohol on the backend. So fucken good.
Side Pocket High Gravity Malt Liquor;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Malt Liquor;Universal Sales Inc;Classy clear glass 40 pours with a thin clear pale gold body that supports a tiny white head. The aroma offers up an estery mess of sweet apples and pears and then a sliver or two of corn flowing into boozy table sugar. The taste is similar and it gets harder and harder to drink the deeper you go into that 40. So it’s all sweet with honey covered apple wedges and pear like juiciness that’s balanced off by a slight corn flake sort of cereal sensation and then modestly sharp booziness. All in all not bad for a 10.5% boost vehicle.
Side Pocket High Gravity Malt Liquor;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Malt Liquor;Universal Sales Inc;Gold pour, white head. Thanks(or no thanks?)to ibrew2or3. Sweet, corn, grain, artificial crap. Bleh.

Side Pocket High Gravity Malt Liquor;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Malt Liquor;Universal Sales Inc;Fo’Ty shared by AndrewCat. Pours a very clear yellow with a white head that dies immediately. Aroma a like sugar water with some fruit. Like a jolly rancher. Taste is just as sickening sweet. Lots of fruitiness too but no significant alcohol presence.
Side Pocket High Gravity Malt Liquor;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Malt Liquor;Universal Sales Inc;Can. Pours a clear yellow with a gold hue and a white head that dissipates quickly to the edges. Aroma has lots of sweet grains and corn with an odd light fruit note. Flavor is similar with sweet grains and corn up front with sweet light fruits in the finish.
Side Pocket High Gravity Malt Liquor;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Malt Liquor;Universal Sales Inc;Bottle. Clear gold with a small white head. When the pour is fast and vigorous you get some soapy and floral yeast esters which settle quickly out into a corn and alcohol and red apple malt stew. Super sweet and sticky corn syrup / candy corn / pale malt extract syrup / other ingredients. surprisingly not hot or fusel or alcoholic or gross, not in that way. the malt is disgustingly cloying and syrupy and the red apple flavor / smell lingers for far too long.

Crombé Artisan Reuzebier;Zottegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Crombé;bottle shared with Tomaz. pours cloudy golden, thick white head. aroma had something unique not typical to most Belgian strong ales, something of fermented white grapes with a blossom hops and yeast. Found it to be sweet and reminiscent to the Bloemenbiek beer. Flavors, yeasty, some caramel malts, honey like palate, sweet with some raisins, hay/attic flavors. Tasty and surely doesn’t feel like 8.3%
Crombé Artisan Reuzebier;Zottegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Crombé;This was a great beer. Very nice brown-orange a bit trouble. Spicy and vanilla on the back ground.

It was a really one of the nicest beer.

Sourish nose with green apples, yeast and a touch of vinegar. Malty, fruity taste with notes of dried fruit, apricots and a spicy finish. Balanced sweetness. Possibly a bit too old, but still drinkable.
Davidson Brothers Smoked Porter;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours black with a thin tan head. Aroma of smoked meats, roasted malt. Flavor of light roasted malt, light smoked meats, bitter chocolate. The smokiness could be a little more powerful, as the flavor is somewhat bland when compared to other smoked porters. The palate is nice and smooth though. 6/4/6/4/14 (3.4/5)
Davidson Brothers Smoked Porter;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Looks beautiful in the glass dark with a slight tinge of amber. Ample head that leaves a nice trace along the edges of the glass. Taste is a little sweeter and bitter than I prefer, lacking the full bodied smoke I prefer, almost burnt. The arome has more of the meaty, leathery character of the classic Schlenkerla Rauchbiers. On tap at Davidson.
Davidson Brothers Smoked Porter;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Not my favorite porter out there. It was moderately smokey, some nice malts to complement, but nothing earth-shattering. It was solid, just not outstanding.
Davidson Brothers Smoked Porter;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;A - Served a dark black color with a finger of super creamy tan head. The retention on the head was very good and left behind some nice lacing. S - Aroma has some nice smoky notes with some sweet caramel/chocolate malts. Bit subtle and could have used a bit more punch. T - Starts off with sweet roasted caramel malts and just a hint of smoke. The smoke flavor builds a bit through the middle and some chocolate malt flavors blends in. The finish is a mix of the malt flavors and some smoke that lingers. M - Medium bodied with moderate-low amount of carbonation. Feels really smooth and creamy and the finish really fills the mouth. D - Very drinkable. Was expecting a bit more of a flavor punch from a smoked porter, but what was there was fairly good. The mouthfeel was very nice.
Davidson Brothers Smoked Porter;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Deep brown-black pour. The nose has a touch of briny smokiness. A touch peaty but it’s not overpowering. Soft licorice on the back of the palate. Slightly watery palate but has an assertive bitterness. Kind of light-bodied despite having a fairly silky finish. Odd, but pretty nice.
Davidson Brothers Smoked Porter;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Dark brown with nice dense off-white head.

Hale's Volkswagon Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hale's Ales;Light amber colored and darker towards the top. Made with a special kind of german yeast, this beer exudes a boquet of lilac and lavender--pleasantly perfumey with a flavor that is similarly painted. Would love to try this again--have not had anything else like it to date.

Hale's Stingo Strong Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Hale's Ales;Hazy tan-amber color approximating a wheat/IPA.

Via Maria DOro;Holland, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Sample Brewery (Old Notes)-Pours golden with a small head. Aroma of citrus and sweetness. Taste of the same with a bit of grass coming in. This light bodied brew is well balanced.
Via Maria DOro;Holland, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Cloudy golden pour with a thin white head. Aroma and flavor of honey and hops. The body is light to medium with an oily texture and moderate carbonation. It’s not a badly done beer, it’s just that it fails to interest me.
Via Maria DOro;Holland, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Hazy, pale straw yellow. Grassy and faintly swett nose. Light to medium body is nicely carbonated. Grassy with a touch of honey and fruit, very farmhouse-like. Reminded me of the golden Jolly Pumkin beer minus the barrel touches. Interesting.
Via Maria DOro;Holland, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Hazy, very pale yellow color, very little pale white head. Light citrus/lemon in the nose. Fruity with a sweetish, almost pinapple hint. Sugar a light touch of grass in the end of the nose. The body is lightly bitter and somewhat roasty. Light citrus notes, fruity and spritzy. Grassy and organic in the end.
Via Maria DOro;Holland, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;pale golden-yellow colour. Dry, fairly crips and hoppy. Not bad. ........
Via Maria DOro;Holland, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;malt balanced, slght sweetness, very light with a minimal hop taste. Somewhat yeasty. The beer would fit the Italian food nicely at this Italian Brew Pub.

Via Maria DAmbra;Holland, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Clear copper color with a thin snow white head. Toasted caramel nose, hints of cascade hops lurking underneath. Malt heavy and rich, but the hops were so muted and weak.
Via Maria DAmbra;Holland, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Citrusy hop aroma. Crisp hoppy bite to start with some weird late flavours that I can't quite place, but still good.
Via Maria DAmbra;Holland, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;cascade aroma and a very citrusy charecter. This and D'Oro are the brewpubs staple beers, less interesting then the others I had.

Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Did not know they mage this. Found randomly on a lower shelf in a FNQ bottle shop. Corn, lurid yellow, very low carbonation and put me to sleep on a hot FNQ day.
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Poured a light golden amber with a three-finger white foamy head that collapsed more than diminished. Laced poorly. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of malt with a strange slightly metallic tint. Taste bit bland up front but has a nice hops bitter after taste. Light (watery) body (3% ABV). Finish is pretty bland with a hint of bitterness.
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);375ml can. Dull amber colour with a reasonabley nice head of soft foam that stayed around. Mild carbonation and a heavy malt aroma - skumky. Bitter and tart on thye palate with a long aftertaste. Light and dry texture.
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);In Australia it is common for breweries to run a special batch of beer to be sold on special, packed in 30-can ’blocks’ and sold quite cheaply compared to the normal can or bottle 24 ’slabs’ as they are known here. Powers Gold is only ever sold as a 30-can block and tends to be issued at major selling times like Christmas or Easter. It is usually very cheap indeed, less than $AUD 1 per can and tastes like it. Originally it was 3.5% ABV but has been watered down to 3% recently.
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Little brother of powers bitter and not too nice,pours out a darkish gold weak head some lace,aroma is malty but metallic,the flavour green and metallic some fruit like but finish bittery sour,I gave it away quick.
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Bronze gold colour with big white head. Malty corn aroma. Metalic flavour with hint of oxo cube.
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);In the can. Pours pale gold with a medium-sized fluffy white head. Smells like a cross between apple juice and urine. Mild residual bitter finish. Weak and watery. Not sure that this has any sugar-donating adjuncts as it only reaches 3% ABV. Boiled vegetable flavors abount. Yuck.
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);"One of six from the ""Beer down under"" six pack brought back from Australia. This offering from Carlton pours a pale yellow with a thin white lace. There is a metallic pale hop presence, the carbonation is high it almost burns the throat. There is a small bitter grapefruit quality in the finish but overall it is really weak."
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Can. My Uncle Don brought this one over from Sydney in a pack of 6 different Aussie beers. Can says that it’s good until April 06. OK. I didn’t get to try this one in Australia, so here we go. Pours with a fluffy head, and that head leaves quickly, but surprisingly leaves some decent lace. Golden color, a little darker than I anticipated. Nose is like a lot of domestic macros, but not unpleasant, just corn and hops. I glanced at the can and .... what?.... 3 percent?.... Is this near beer for Aussies? Lots of flavor from the hops when I take a slurp. Pride of Ringwood hops I’m guessing because it tastes a lot like the other Australian lagers that I have had. Not bad. Highly carbonated. I think that I could easily drink 15 of these. Pretty tasty actually.
Powers Gold;Yatala, QLD, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Queensland Breweries (AB InBev);Damn, bugger and all those really bad words. I looked at the ratings of some of my colleagues and I noticed I hadn’t rated this. So, being in close proximity to the Australian Hotel in the Rocks I wander in and find, to my dismay, that this was available. Yup, typical Queensland description of a mid strength beer with all that such a style promises. Too grainy, corny adjuncty to be a real light and not enough guts to be a heavy. These beers are a bit like a transvestite, they technically have balls but they just can’t use them to any real extent. And they certainly are trying to be something they aren’t.
Harboe Grøn Guld;Skælskør, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Harboes Bryggeri;[Canned] Clear golden, no head. No aroma. Paper diluted in loads of water. No malt nor hops, perhaps the vaguest trace of maize can be noted before it fizzes out in an empty finish.
Harboe Grøn Guld;Skælskør, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Harboes Bryggeri;Very thin, no taste or aroma. Golden and a little white top. The cheapest beer is in fact also the worst. As it turned out.
Harboe Grøn Guld;Skælskør, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Harboes Bryggeri;Canned. Pale olden, chemical aroma and flavour. Is this skunky water? No the label says beer, but I doubt it...
Harboe Grøn Guld;Skælskør, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Harboes Bryggeri;Yellow, with a head that actually was ok. No aroma, and this is probably one of the thiinest beers I have tried. Skunky finish, thats all except water.
Harboe Grøn Guld;Skælskør, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Harboes Bryggeri;I wanted this to be good, but it wasn't. Musty pils nose, decent golden color, foamy head. Sweet malt body with some honey (maybe) and a gritty bitter end. Oily mouth feel. You can do without this...
Harboe Grøn Guld;Skælskør, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Harboes Bryggeri;Sweet rice nose. Pee yellow, soft carbonation. No head. Light water - nothing with a spritz of hops.
Harboe Grøn Guld;Skælskør, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Harboes Bryggeri;Bland, tasteless, pale-colored, very boring. The foam is dying very fast. There are no many words to describe this beer.
Harboe Grøn Guld;Skælskør, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Harboes Bryggeri;Light, uninteresting, some bitterness in the flavour, cheap.................
Brøckhouse Festival Ale;Hillerød, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Brøckhouse;A very delicious ale with a smooth taste. Fine head and a long taste with a fine bitterness. Only on draft.
Brøckhouse Festival Ale;Hillerød, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Brøckhouse;A very good English style ale. Some Danish homebrewer won a competition with this ale and Allan of Brøckhouse decided to brew a small amount of it. You can taste that it is handcrafted. It is full of taste but still very smooth and pleasant.

Boulder Beer Hazed Hoppy Session Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;12oz bottle at home, pours a clear amber with a thin white head. It smells like bread and it tastes like a pretzel. It's a good beer, not too hoppy though like the bottle says
Boulder Beer Hazed Hoppy Session Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;A-. Pours a hazy amber color with white head. Hoppy but not bitter. Nice amber beer flavor balances nicely with the hops
Boulder Beer Hazed Hoppy Session Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;"From Feb 2006 Poured from bottle a cloudy reddish gold with a medium sized head of foam that dissipated quickly.. The smell is quite hoppy with lemony notes, The taste is very hoppy with strong citrus tones that make for a very bitter attack on my palate but that's not a complaint from me. ;^) Solid APA. Bottom line: Here's a very flavourful APA that only tips the scales at 4.85%abv thus making it a good candidate for a session beer. I recommend it."
Boulder Beer Hazed Hoppy Session Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;12 ounce can from the remainder shelf at Liberty Beer in Pittsburgh. Nice and clean and unpretentious. Seems appropriately named for Colorado.
Boulder Beer Hazed Hoppy Session Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;This beer had a lot going on. The hop flavors were really unique and I got the Colorado vibe while drinking it. Just a nice solid ale.
Boulder Beer Hazed Hoppy Session Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Can at Cafe Nero, september 28th 2016. Light copperish body with a fingerthick white head. Aroma of caramel malt, mild earthy and floral hops. taste is light, mild fruity, biscuit, strong bitterness.
Boulder Beer Hazed Hoppy Session Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;I got this from a beer club sampler. Appearance is pretty fine, I see a dark amber with a lingering, almost white foam. The nose contains a woody, lemony scent. For taste I find a slightly hoppy edge along with some citrus and meadow, a metallic ending. A session beer so that kick is just not there.
Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;For its price tag of $1.25 plus deposit, I am rating this beer purely on its price to quality ratio which is great. At 120 calories, it is great for those who are calorie conscience as well. Its quite difficult to find but if you can, stock up as much as possible.
Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;341ml bottle. $1.10. Clear body, uneven white head. As is tradition. Lots of bubbles. No aroma. Not bad, just non-existent. The taste is fresh.

Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;Pale gold pour, almost no head. Aroma of wet paper, wet grass. Musty hops, cooked veggie finish. Nothing but macro swill.
Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;MIni keg brought to my house so figured what the heck I would try it. When really cold it was drinkable...not so much once it became just plain cold. Yellow with a copper hue, white head, smells of stale caramel, grainy, corn adjunct with an unpleasant aftertaste.
Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;355ml bottle pours a pale straw color with a small white head which leves no lacing. Aroma is light grains and faint hops. Taste is light malt sweetness and moderate hop bitterness. Average macro lager and nothing more.
Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;tastes like piss. same as all the other macro crap. dont know what else to say...even on tap.
Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;"pours pale yellow with a small disappearing white head. malt lacking, corn, light herbal hops. don’t you get fooled by ""best north american lager in ontario""... it’s the usual macro brew."
Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;Comes in a 4-pack for $5 at the LCBO. One of three beers being pushed there nowadays. Had a few at the jam, kind of warm and it was not that good. Now, from the cold fridge to the glass, it actually is better. Pale yellow-golden colour, small white head and decent lacing. Malty start to the aromas, but then, corn comes out and then later, adjuncts. Refreshing wet mouthfeel with a little stickiness, but with a light dry finish. Not many flavours, quite mild with a little malt start and a little hop at the end. Probably would be appreciated by Labatt Blue lovers.
Cool Beer;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;Pours a thin straw yellow with a quickly disappearing white head. Aroma is grain and corn. Taste is nothing. I mean literally nothing. Well some grain and shitty wet newspapers.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;Just a normal amber, maybe a bit sweeter than usual. Very drinkable, enjoyable, but very simple beer. Thanks Ron.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;It's a smooth wheat beer and it fortunately doesnt taste anything like cannibis.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;Can, Ann Arbor, MI via Mulmur. Clear dark amber. Metallic caramel aroma. Sweet. Caramel flavor. Balanced.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;This is a clear amber beer w/ a big head. It’s interesting more so than good but it’s still a reasonable thing to drink, I suppose. It’s got a sort of caramel, vanilla, tobacco thing going on. It’s sort of creamy in texture w/ medium carbonation. With some tweaking, this recipe could actually be legitimately good.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;355ml slim can. Dark amber pour with a frothy creamy long-sticking off-white head. It is a bit carmaally and toasty very light roast. Unnofensive but gimmicky.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;Pours red amber with a very fizzy and quick fading off white head. Small malt aroma. Taste of malts, grain and straw. Not an impressive beer.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;Comes in a cheap 4 pack. Has a foamy off-white head with a dark amber appearance. Malty aromas, wheats. Watery mouthfeel. Flavours are of weak citrus notes, light malts, some mild spices. If it’s made with hemp, I can’t tell. Nothing too special, but for the price, well worth trying again.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;I’m not a lager man. I tried Buzz largely because I was curious about what a hemp beer would taste like. The answer: hay. That’s about it. A thoroughly forgettable beer kept aloft only by the gimmick of putting a marijuana leaf on the can.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;On tap at the Arrow and Loon. Appearance: Pours a clear copper colour with little head. Aroma: Malt Flavours: Malt, rye, cereal, yeast. Mouthfeel: Thinner with low carbonation. Overall: Lots of malt and I’m getting some rye. An okay beer but not one of my favourites.
Cool Beer Millennium Buzz;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cool Beer Brewing Co.;Amber clear body with a quickly dissipating head. Bready euro-lager aroma. Some hop bite, reminiscent of a pilsner in character minus the color. Very thin.
Rohrbach Flour City IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Rohrbach Brewing Company;This beer is by far the best Ithaca has ever made. The co,or is nice and dark. The smell is of floral hops. The taste is balanced with sweet smooth caramel malts and then nice bitter, but not overwhelming hops. Overall exquisite beer. Amazing this comes from the same brewery as the scotch ale, pale ale, and amber. Outstanding.
Rohrbach Scotch Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Draft: Poured a light clear burgundy color ale with a small off-site foamy head with light retention and lacing. Aroma of light caramelized notes with subtle toffee notes. Taste is a mix of caramelized malt with light residual sugar. Body is light with good carbonation. Nice seasonable scotch ale with limited amount of complexities.

It is a clear, warm amber color with a slight beige head. Aroma: sweet and nutty, molasses. Tastes like it smells, sweet bready caramel;. Mouthfeel: medium-bodied. Finish was sweet and stayed sweet.

Rock Bottom Milwaukee Honey Creek Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Had on tap at the place. Decent, but lacking the citrus they claim, and not much of a pale ale, even for the American style.

Aroma of malt and a slight hop note. Flavor of malt, lemon and grapefruit with a very slight hop bite at the end. Average.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Honey Creek Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear golden yellow with a thin white head. Very little aroma of pale malts and barely a floral hop note. Lemon citrus, pale malt flavors that are lightly sweet with a floral hop poking out in the finish. Nothing bad, but pretty mediocre. I’ll be trying something else next time.

Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Subtle popcorn nose. Cloudy ochre, thin head, good lace. Milk chocolate, wood. Dried leaves are dominant. Medium body, easy carbonation.
Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Tasted at RB in Arlington. Color is opaque brownish red. Aroma is fruityy, sweet, malty. Taste is sweet malt, honey, touch of bitter hops on the finish. Not a bad intro craft beer, but that is all it is.
Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Draught at the campbell location. 5.8%abv, and they call it an ESB. The character is definitely English leaning (caramel, toffee, earthy) but American ESBs are pretty much ambers anyway. I’m wondering if other locations are hopping this in a more American fashion, because I didn’t get any of the American hop character, or much at all, that other raters seem to notice at other locations. The color is an amber-red, topped by lasting white foam with small bubbles. The aroma has a touch of dark, roasted caramel, sweeter caramel, and an earthy touch. Malty-sweet flavor with caramel and toffee, and just a touch of earthy hop flavor and bitterness that doesn’t quite balance. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Sweet, relatively clean, and displaying a pretty English malt and hop profile, though the yeast seems pretty neutral. A few more IBUs or a few less finishing gravity points would really make this a more balanced, drinkable package. Well-brewed, but the recipe just isn’t what I would want.
Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Clear orange pour with a thin white head. Mild piny hop aroma. Sweet malty flavor with touch of citrus and some hops. Mostly bland and watery.
Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Amber with thin head that disappated quickly.

Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Location: I venture into the Rock Bottom Bethesda every now and again because it is so close, this is one of their standard offerings, and I’ve had it a few times on tap Overall Impression: I actually think that this one is the best of their standard offerings. For it’s style it’s at lease a solid C, while the rest of the Rock Bottom Bethesda always available beers , in my opinion, are at best D+ beers. It is a little thin though.
Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Tap at Bethesda location. Amber color, caramel malt on the aroma, caramel malt and mild English-style hops on the flavor. Body a little light. Nothing special, just an amber/red ale.
Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;draft at the downtown Indy brewpub - Pours amber and laces well. It has a light caramel malt aroma. The flavor is sweet caramel malt with some mild hops. It has a light body and light carbonation. It’s an average session brew, no more.
Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;From draught sample at Bethesda. Light hoppy aroma with just a bit of dull herbal hops. Not very aromatic. Medium amber with light haze and small off-white head. Medium-light watery body with medium carbonation. Starts with carbonic acidity an a bit of pale malt. Neutral fruity character before a heavy hit of hop bitterness. Bitter is too harsh in the finish and is not balanced. Astringent after.
Rock Bottom Raccoon Red;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;A nicely refreshing amber, tasting of caramel with nuts and dark fruit. Good side to a burger.
Rock Bottom Pils;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Charlotte NC Prospector’s Pilsner-on tap-pours a creamy white head with yellow color.

Rock Bottom Pils;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;On tap at Arlington location, 11/17/05, listed at 6.0% abv. Light golden, short head, good lacing. Aroma is sweet with a warm hop. Not much detectable Saaz hop in this version - just lots and lots of Hallertau. Taste was sugary sweet malts and a warm bitter finish. I was hoping for something more exciting on this one.
Rock Bottom Pils;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Not bad for a pils, this was one was very light, but sweet, creamy and sweet, and refreshing.

Rock Bottom Pils;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;"Draft, Chicago At the downtown Rock Bottom, they named it “Rooftop Pilsner” for its rooftop dining area (with a fine view of all the much taller yuppie condos surrounding it). They had to brew this in a hurry following the May windstorm that blew their rooftop taps open, draining all of their serving tanks! Pretty good for a style which we've all had bad examples of. Have to give a ""5"" for appearance, it looks just right. Fizzy head leaves a golden yellow color underneath. No off-flaveors to speak of. Nice citrsy hop aroma which I found to be a little stronger after a scoop of salsa. As the Milwaukee corrspondent notes, a decent session beer."
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Clear dark brown with a full beige head. Nice coffee and chocolate nose. Smooth texture. More dark chocolate flavors, roasted malt, black coffee. Light-medium bodied, lingering smooth finish.
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;Bottle. Aroma of roasted grain coffee. Nicely malty toasted grain, coffee, clean finish. Fine porter.
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;Draft at Palmetto, May 2015. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown to black. Aroma is moderately malty (Oreo cookie, chocolate, roasted grain), with a note of vanilla. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Quite a tasty stout/porter...one of the better of four brews I tried here.
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;Only had 2oz worth at world beer festival January 2013 Columbia,SC,, smells like coffee, ok... but a bit heavy
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;Originally reviewed: 8/27/09. Poured into my pint glass a deep charcoal black with a thin tan head on top. This doesn’t stick around very long, but it leaves some sticky lace rings in its wake. Smells very roasty, with a big presence of chocolate and hints of coffee. This smells warming and pleasant. The mouth is little too carbonated than my liking for the style, but it’s decent enough. There’s a subtle twang at the first sip. Slightly acrid and, some might say, sour. This washes away though and is replaced by a big black coffee-like bitterness that hits the spot. Finishes with a nice toasted flavor on the mouth. This is a pretty good porter. I’m glad I had the opportunity to try it!
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;From Charleston Beer Exchange. Light brown with little head. Aroma is coco and roasted nuts. Flavor is chocolate and coffee. Toasty finish. Really great. Blows their other beers out of the water!
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;I like porters but this one was lacking. The malts are okay. The hops are lacking. The aromas are not too strong. This is a good local brew but not my cup of tea.
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;Black pour with tan head. Unique scent, lot going on in here, smoke, coffee, burning wood.....Roasted malt taste is very good and like the scent...unique.....tasty brew.
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;12oz bottle brought back by a friend. Dark brown pour with a medium tan head. Malty aroma with chocolate and roasty coffee. Coffee flavor up front with sweet malt, chocolate and a roasty finish. Light colored pour made me think it would be weak, but it’s a solid porter.
Palmetto Porter;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Porter;Palmetto Brewing Company;Pours a deep very dark chestnut brown almosr black color with dark mahognay edges when held to a light source and a 1.5 finger foamy beige head thar quickly dissipates into a lasting ring and cap leaving minimal lacing. Smokey roasted malt aroma with chocolate, caramel, hazelnut, oatmeal, toffee, coffee bean and burnt toast notes. Medium body with a huge smoked/roasty malt presence. Chocolate malt, oatmeal, toffee, espresso beans are all very prominent in the flavor with subtle hops and a nice hazelnut and lactic caramel taste. This is a pretty complex beer for the style and is very well balanced. Roasty and sweet with a nice bitter dry finish. Extremely quaffable.
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;THIS is the only beer i actually dumped down the drain. And I drink crap like Ol’English all the time.
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;EEWY EEWY yuck sicky woo-woo! grodyyyyy!!!!!! Notes of barley, and dispair.
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Yeah, this isn’t really a real rating, but I can remember enough about this one to make some comments. Used to drink Rainier from time to time, and at a party we had Rainier Ice once, and it make everyone absolutely sick who drank it... has the worst rotting broccoli and fuel smell and taste ever. Completely disgusting.
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;A light corney lager, highly carbonated, sick as it warms, but actually drinkable cold. suck a few down, and you can be in trouble! lol
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours a light golden yellow. Aromas of minor hops, corn, grains. Flavor is light, crisp, watery with a little hop and not much else.
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;The hotter the day and the colder your RI, the more you will appreciate it.
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"This is the beer of choice for those of us here in the Northwest that are short on cash and ready to partake in a night of drinking games. The ""Ren-Wah"" Ice is truly a beer you need to drink cold. At low temperatures it is simply thin grains, corn, alchohol, and water. As it warms the corn turns into a funky rotten conglomeration and it is just no good anymore (no not-so-good anymore). Better than the Ale, worse than the regular."
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;A poor attempt at the popular ice beer process. The one I had in the US on the week end was 6%ABV not 5.8%. Still this beer bore no resemblance to a Rainier that had been but in the ice filter...this is a distinctly different recipe from Rainer....and not a particularly good one. Poured a pale straw color (for an ice beer) and had a small cap that went away fast to reveal carbonation that puts that distinctly cheap sweetness of adjuncts in your nostrils. The beer was smooth but I had a time determining any character to it....sweetly malty with no proper hop balance. I’ll give this one a pass.
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Not to great of a taste, its an ok beer wouldn't get it again, its only 5.6 which is low for an ice beer. not my first choice.
Rainier Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Looks like a Safeway brand soda! It's cheap and drinkable!..................
Lake Tahoe Meeks Bay Blonde Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Lake Tahoe Brewing;If you like light beer, you'll like this one. Smooth easy to drink, session beer. Not bad.
Lake Tahoe Meeks Bay Blonde Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Lake Tahoe Brewing;This beer is a nice thirst quencher after skiing on the lake or hiking in the mountains. Not much of an aroma, even in the bland desert air. The color is a very, very pale straw (looks like a filtered hefe weizen). The flavor was just slightly malty and barely hopped. Pretty thin. The finish was crisp and clean, like a good pilsener. Lawnmower beer.
Lake Tahoe Emerald Bay Pale Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Tahoe Brewing;I got a bomber of this while in Reno, July of 2008. The body is dark bronze orange with a thick, lightly off white head. The aroma has some grapefruit and almonds. There is also a nice bread crust note. The taste has some rich grapefruit and bread crust. There is also a nice grassy note that is pleasant in the finsh. Not that Lake Tahoe Brewing made great stuff, but I enjoyed the little bit that I tried. I hope that the brewers and quipment have gone on to bigger and better things.

Lake Tahoe Emerald Bay Pale Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Tahoe Brewing;Bottle, with label as pictured, but from Citrus Hts CA. Very light amber with a big ol’ head. Quite the citrusy aroma. But it drinks with more of a tilt toward earthy grassiness, with just a twinge of the citric bite. Relatively light body. OK.

Lake Tahoe Emerald Bay Pale Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Tahoe Brewing;"Brewed in Citrus Heights, CA. Perhaps at the Sac Brew Oasis? ""Tahoe’s backyard, bar-b-que, skateboarding beer"" on the label. Very strong aroma of pine. Amber golden color with a very frothy white head. A bit thin in body with smooth, but sharpish carbonation. Flavor is roasted malt with a mixed citrus/pine aspect for hop. Pretty hoppy in a soft way. Finish is almost sweet with floral aspects. It drinks very well."

Lake Tahoe Emerald Bay Pale Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Tahoe Brewing;A very light pale ale, and a very good one. Almost a sweet tasting hoppy beer. Not much aroma, but still very good.
Lake Tahoe Emerald Bay Pale Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Tahoe Brewing;"ATTENTION HOPHEADS!! Nice beer. Very well-hopped. The commercial description suffices except that a ""well-balanced hop finish"" seems like an oxymoron. This beer is wonderfully unbalanced. It’s an IPA in my book. ’Nuff said."
Lake Tahoe Summer India Pale Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;IPA;Lake Tahoe Brewing;This beer rocks. A lovely, clear copper hue. I wanted to hold my pint glass up to the sun and take a picture. This beer is wonderfully unbalanced. The front is slightly sweet and then... BANG... the hops hit you right in the face (and nose). This ale cleared my sinuses. Very complex flavor and finish. First sweet, then bitter, then it sucks all moisture right out of your mouth. This ale is a HopHeads wet dream. I love it.

Rickard's Honey Brown;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Mousse consistante de couleur caramel, et breuvage cuivré qui semble pétiller de façon régulière. Mi-mince. Nez de bois, caramel, sucre cuit et quelques épices douces. Assez odorante et invitante. Bien sucrée, miel très présent mais agréable. Houblon, malt grillé. Piquante par effervescence. Agréable, sans être une boisson effarante, la Honey Brown présente de belles qualités dans une catégorie saturée et souvent décevante. Belle couleur, goût intéressant ; un côté plus fonceur, moins « lager + miel » pourrait la remonter encore d’un cran."

Rickard's Honey Brown;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated July 2005. This honey brown from Rickard’s pours a brown colour with orange highlights. The head does not last as long as their pale and red. Lacing is not bad. The scent is of caramel malt with some floral notes. The taste though, is very smooth... almost missing. Ah... found it ! It’s in the background. Not much there, slight bitterness and sweetness. Hardly any aftertaste. Close of being refreshing.

Rickard's Honey Brown;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Light brown body, with a pretty good light caramel head. Smells of sour dough, some slight roastiness and honey. Tastes pretty good, with a balanced sweetness and some caramel notes. There is some unpleasant sourness to it, though. Pretty soft on the palate; light-to-medium body to it. Overall, this WAS the best of the Rickard’s line-up, so it’s somewhat sad that they discontinued it..."

Lion Brewery Adlys Ale;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Draught. At the brewpub. Clear light amber with an average white draught head. Herbal/grainy aroma, light alcohol - clean. The taste is pleasingly bitter, decent roast caramel malt and more than enough dry herbal bitterness to balance it. Slick, lively mouthfeel - decent carbonation and a reasonably long bitter finish - not overpowering, or memorable, but of all the beers I tried (8) during my visit, this is the only one I would bother to have a pint of.
Lion Brewery Cream Ale;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;"Not really a distinct brew but a metered blend done at the taps of 2 ales and a light lager. This tap head blend had the effect of approximating a cream ale in appearance and flavor. I’m told by brewers that mixing 3 penny pale ales with a lager at colonial taverns was how this style got started before it was brewed as a discrete style. Malty, lightly hopped, light and mild. Good sessioner with no ""off"" tastes as some early reviews note."
Lion Brewery Cream Ale;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;(Draught) I was assured by our server that this was not the Raspberry Cream Ale even throught the flavour was very berry flavoured.

Lion Brewery Honey Brown Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a darkish-but-not-really amber with a small white head. Aroma is the characteristic malty sweetness of this brewery. Flavour has some nice richness to it from the honey, which is not overly-sweet or cloying. Along with the worty grainy malt character in all of their beers. Crisp, fairly well carbonated palate that at times seemed a little rough. Not my favourite from this place but still pretty decent. Surprised I hadn’t tried it until now.

Lion Brewery Honey Brown Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Draught. Caramel candy, artificial honey and sweet malt are in the faint nose. Pours an amber color. Like their other beers its thin and a little watery. More hops then I would have expected in a honey brown. Not a good example of the style, like a generic with honey forced into it.
Lion Brewery Honey Brown Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Looks nice - amber, good sized white head. Aroma of honey and some malt. Taste is right on style if Honey brown was a style - it is malty (for a lager) with lots of honey. Unfortunately, I’ve never found it a a particularly good combination in any beer. Light body. Ok at best, will not have it again.
Lion Brewery Honey Brown Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Tap at the hotel- Pours an amber liquid. Head is thin and short lived, leaving no real lace. Malty nose, with grains and a bit of burnt sugars, followed by some cookie dough.

Lion Brewery Honey Brown Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Dark golden colour. Head is white and disapates to a little bit of nothing. No real fancy lacing just tiny little bubbles that one by one go away. Aroma might be honey then again it might be malt. Flavour is sweet malty and clean. Palate is clean with nothing to syrupy. But there is a nagging cloying sweetness to this.
Lion Brewery Honey Brown Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;[360-20070623] Tap @ Lion Restaurant (Waterloo, ON).

Lion Brewery Honey Brown Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Tapped a light copper-amber color, smallish head leaves soon, leaves light lace on the glass. Aroma of grains, hay and a light whisp of honey...no sweet tones. Light body, slick mouth feel, fluid chracter. Strange flavor profile for a honey lager: You’re hit up front with caramel sweetness and can just taste the honey when a sourish woodsy tang kicks in as the abundent hops take over. Hops continue to dominate the flavor through to the quick clean finish where it turns softly bitter....a different honey beer to be sure, no flaws just too well hopped to enjoy the honey
Lion Brewery Honey Brown Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;One of the worst honey browns I have ever tasted. Tried it once thought it must be skunky, since I had heard good things. Tried it a second time a few months later, still terrible.

Pale golden colour with a medium sized white head. Meh, not a standout lager by any means, but still enjoyable. On par with every other generic lager made in Ontario right now.

Lion Brewery Light Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;At the brewpub. Yellow pout, small white head. Slightly sweet bready aroma - the first aroma from these guys that was sort of fake corny to be honest. Taste was better - it could have passed for any of their house beers, so that is a credit in terms of flavour to this light lager. Bready not grassy, slight sweetness, medium mouthfeel. It was refreshing enough with brunch but not packing a ton of flavour. Still, in terms of light beers, it was exceptional.
Lion Brewery Light Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Not really my favorite Lion quaff but as a light ale it was remarkably fresh and malty.

Lion Brewery English Ale;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;"Draught. At the brewpub. This is on tap, so it can’t be OLD, but ... read on. Deep clear mahogany pour, with a smallish creamy beige head (4-). Oddly sour caramel malt/grain aroma, a touch herbal, even a hint of dry cocoa. Taste - weirdly sour, grapeseed, dry oak and lemon juice sour, a bit like those oxidized old Gales corked bottles - but this is TAP; some coffee ground acidity and green herbal (almost mint) bitterness under the unpleasant sourness. Average-bodied, astringent/acidic mouthfeel, very weakly carbonated, with a thin, dry lemon-sour aftertaste - it wasn’t horrid, but I think without the dry tartness it might be solid. (not boozy at all, but also, not very roasty either)."

Lion Brewery Raspberry Cream Ale;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;A lack luster seasonal...not because of the fruit...which was real...but because of the weak cream ale under it.

Lion Brewery Raspberry Cream Ale;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Hazy light yellow appearance. Surprisingly sweet and untart (if you will) even after the waitress politely reassured me that is was in fact made with real fruit and not a concentrated fruit juice.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;"I think this beer should be in the ""bargain beer"" catagory. Tastes stale and tinny. Barely passable grade."
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Huge bottle. Light brown, small of white head. The aroma is sweet of butter, and the flavor is malty.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Bottle - Caramel and some twiggy bitterness. Clear copper with no head. Caramel and light bitterness. Decent.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;680 mL bottle. Pours medium amber with an off white head. Some caramel malt and a possible suggestion of hops. Flavorless and watery. Light bodied with above average carbonation. At least it’s not macro.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Clear copper colour. Malty aroma with some earthy notes that I don’t enjoy, yeasty funky like. Medium to light body and a watery mid palate and a finish that doesn’t have much to offer. Boring brewery and one that is part of the ’ol guard’ providing swill to the few that come by this brewery.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Bottle at CGBD. Pours copper with an off white head. Sweet toffee malts, light grain, light earthy notes, and a faint hoppy finish. Not bad.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Nothing special but it was an ok pint of beer, was better then all the other Macro beers that was on tap at the pub. Nothing bad about it but nothing great either. As far as craft beers go however the brewery is lacking compared to what many other micro brewery’s in the Ontario region are brewing, they need some new beers once and a while, brewery is a bit boring.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;On tap. Light amber with a creamy biege head. Inofensive light malt and hop aroma, bit of stale caramel, little sweet. Moderate carbonation, mild body, some honey, not great but not terrible.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Not worth your time, like most old credit stuff its below what you’d expect from a craft brewer.
Old Credit Amber;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Clear red pour with a thin head that fades quick. Aroma is full of syrupy caramel. Taste is mild. Hints of caramel and sugar. Slightly estery. Very light mouth. Slightly astringent.
Old Credit Pale Pilsner;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Old Credit Brewing;Bottle from LCBO at Royal Winter Fair in Toronto. This was the only beer -- plus a couple of ciders -- from their sample Ontario selection that I hadn’t tried. Wish I hadn’t bought it. This is a sweet corn water pale lager of the most banal kind. It’s a farce to call this a pilsner. Tastes like watery apple juice, water from a can of sweet peas & melted margarine. Shudder.
Old Credit Pale Pilsner;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Old Credit Brewing;Pours golden with quickly dissipating head. Clean pilsner malty taste with appropriate hoppiness. Nice smooth aged flavour.
Old Credit Pale Pilsner;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Old Credit Brewing;Not sure why this is rated so low. Sure it’s not a trendy style but this was a pretty legit pilsner in my opinion.

Pours a clear golden colour with a minimal white head which recedes to a small outer ring. Aroma of hay, bread, and some apples. Taste is just like your average Pilsner with light sweet flavour. It's a notch better than your Molson Canadian or Bud.

Clear straw under wisps of large, white bubbles. Sweet pilsner malt flavour with very low zesty noble hops and a little sour grain accent. Medium light body, medium carbonation, almost crisp.

Sweet grainy aroma and flavour, a bit of corn, a bit of apple, odd chemical/preservative note in the finish. Not good.

Old Credit Pale Pilsner;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Old Credit Brewing;680 mL bottle. Very pale with a thin white cap and no lacing. Mild pilsner malt and the faintest note of hops. Has an odd sweetness. Light bodied and moderate plus carbonation. Not flawed, but painfully boring.
Brava Negra;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Swillfest ’04: Dark golden-brown. Slightly rocky head. Palate is slightly chalky, very sweet. Awful plastic notes and artificial caramel. Shit, Lakeport really is one of the worst breweries on earth.
Brava Negra;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Tea color , creamy head . Plain sweet aroma. Light in flavour, especially for dark lager. Slightly mineral finish.
Brava Negra;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);(Bottle) Deep brown body with a thin, almond head. Faint Corn syrup aroma. Thin, sugar water taste. Better than the regular but poor overall.
Brava Negra;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);This is the only good thing on the Brava line up. Dark brown with a very light brown head that didn't disappear. To my surprise. Sweet sugar water. And water on the palet. Not very appealing. A step up from the other Brava products but I would still avoid it.
Brava Negra;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Clear dark brown w/ slight beige head. Mild corn aroma. Watery feel. Roasted cardboard and corn aroma.
Brava Negra;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Light brown appearance. Light sweet malty nose, slightly skunked (I wonder why?) Dry, faint malt presence. Maybe a step up from Brava...maybe.
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);(drain pour and ticks’ night) pours clear straw with a very small white head, no retention. skunky and corny, absent malts, almost absent hops if not some herbal blandness. average carbonation, light body - watery. bad like its big sister.
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);"Father inlaws brother brought some to easter! Yay! ""hey Rob, would you like a Brava Light? "" ""would i, hell yeah!"" this was quite the foray into light beer territory. Good god, this is nothing but a mash of corn, and cheapo grains, with some grass included. Well atleast it tasted like slmething. Nice to see they were able to get rid of that pesky aftertase and finish that i know everyone hates. Awesome stuff!"
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Originally rated June 2009. Well, Lakeport has re-released this Light version of the Brava (they had a few years back). At The Beer Store, it is highly advertised and they are pushing on it for this summer (2009). This info is probably the best thing of this review... ha, ha. Pours a pale golden colour with a white fizzy-foam head that does not stay long and hardly has lacing. Big bubbles are all around the glass, so quite fizzy. Malt piss nose with a little corn taste, but also, this chemical aftertaste of raw sewage. Almost like vegetables gone bad. It is quite yuckie overall.
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);It’s a light beer, it’s a discount beer and it’s made by a big beer company. You get what you pay for - its not a beer for beer snobs. If you want a light, clean taste, you got it. Not malty, no aftertaste, no skunky flavour. Easy to drink.
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);[3559-20110119] 341mL clear bottle. Corn and rotting haystacks aroma. Clear, yellow body with a quick foamy white head. Sweet corny yeast flavour. Light body. Not repeatable, not pleasant. (2/2/2/2/3) 1.1 (w/ jerc)
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);2011-01-19. Sweet grainy aroma has small hints of skunked hops, light touches of lemon both in a good way and a not so good way. Flavour is pretty mild, and mostly inoffensive. Sweet sort of industrial cereal grains, very slight bitterness. Average to light palate. Less bad than expected, but not particularly endearing either. Bottle from the LCBO
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);bottle. Clear pale straw coloured. Light corn aroma. Watery mouthfeel. Grainy and bland. No aftertaste.
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Smells of corn and adjuncts, straw yellow, tiny white head. Taste is muted corn and rice, light bodied and listless.
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Clear bottle 341 ml Appearance: plain pale golden look with light fizzy thin white top 2- Nose: Aroma of cardboard with hone and sugary dust, slight off fruity hints. Flavor/Palate : Very thin bodied. Plain, flat almost flavorless malt expose. Very little going in here and what is present is not very welcoming. Hint of honey mid late. Very slight oily finish. This brew would not win against targeted competition Corona and that says plenty.
Brava Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);"Sample from the Beer Store. I don’t think I would have really ever bought this so I was thankfull for the sample that was at the store that helped me save some money if I was ever to buy this. When I drank it the lady asked me what I thought. And I said to her, ""Do you really want to know?"" She was like, ""Ya"" and I gave it to her... man was she disappointed. I saw her face go from happy to why are you even here in about 1 second. Pale yellow with no head. Aroma is grainy and shallow. Sweet flavour is really bland and very watery. No aftertaste. Not offensive at all."
F & M Eramosa Honey Wheat;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;not too bad. nothing vile, but nothing outstanding. the honey doesnt come through as well as i would l would like but its ok.
F & M Eramosa Honey Wheat;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;(Bottle) One of the quickest dissipating heads I have experienced - remindes me of ginger ale. Amber body. Nose of spoiled milk and apples - smells almost flat thought there is slight carbonation. Thin, honey flavour with a strong dough finish. Gross!
F & M Eramosa Honey Wheat;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;Light honey nose and flavor with too much alcohol heat for this style. Not much else
F & M Eramosa Honey Wheat;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;Really weak in appearance department, bland look. Very boring brew. To much feel of alcohol for a wheat.
F & M Eramosa Honey Wheat;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;Nutty roasted aroma, golden, a small head. Nicely bitter, not too sweet, pleasant mouthfeel, so so.
F & M Eramosa Honey Wheat;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;this beer is quite similar to the draft, only a bit rounder and overal meatier with a slight honey-ish taste. not bad, but still not great.
F & M Eramosa Honey Wheat;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;As bland and tasteless as anything I've had.................................

Pacific Crest HefeWeizen;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Straw and slightly hazy. Wheat aroma and flavour. Eas to drink but lacked any real complimentary flavour like citrus or corrianer.
Pacific Crest HefeWeizen;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Draught at the breweryVery pale straw. Quite cloudy. Sweaty, with a hint of wheat. Effervescent, sweaty, and with a good bit of wheaty acidity. Low on phenols/esters, though.
Pacific Crest Dryhopped Red;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;This beer is a classic American amber/red ale that is big on hop aromas, flavors, and bitterness, but also has enough malt sweetness to balance that assault of hops. It is brewed with Centennial, Chinook, and Cascade hops, and then dry hopped with another huge dose of Centennials. These locally grown hop varieties make American IPA’s or pale ales, what they are, but with a red ale, lots of malt is key flavor component to the style. Trailhead Red is brewed with 5 malts including pale, ESB, wheat, crystal, and Munich malts, giving the beer the malt backbone it needs to stand up to all those hops. Trailhead Red pours to a beautiful, deep amber to ruby red color with a thick and creamy light tan head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is so fresh and aromatic with big citrus aromas of grapefruit and lemon rind, with hints of ripe fruit and sweet malt. The palate is firm on the tongue with lots of big pale and sweet malt flavors paired with some plumy estery fruit flavors, and a nice back drop of candied grapefruit hop flavor. Trailhead Red finishes with more sweet malty, and candied fruit flavors up front, then ends with a zesty burst of grapefruit/lemon hop bitterness that cuts the edge of the sweet maltiness and lingers with bitterness. Trailhead Red is a fantastic example of American Red Ale, and is well worth taking the trek out to Pacific Crest to try fresh on draught. The Hole in the Wall Barbecue brings the experience to a higher level, and for me makes it a trip any beer lover visiting the PNW must make.
Pacific Crest Dryhopped Red;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Reddish amber with short beige head. aroma is light malt. Flavor is also light malt with very weak hop end.
Pacific Crest India Pale Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Washington Brewers Festival. Pale color with good head. Citrus taste with nice hop nose. Hops are very forward and then disappear quickly on the finish. Nice.
Pacific Crest India Pale Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;pale copper colour with decent size head. Aroma was lemon and hops. Nice hop flavouring with good alt balance. Not overpowering like a lot of IPAs. Nice bitter finish.
Pacific Crest India Pale Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Draught at the breweryLight copper colour. Soft body, citric hoppiness. Slightly honeyish malts. Despite a little resiny bitterness in the end, this is a fairly restrained example. But it is balanced so you can’t argue with that.
Pacific Crest India Pale Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Had on tap at brewery. Pale orange color, fairly light on carbonation and limited lacing. A little light for an IPA, but good hop flavor. Needs more body.
Pacific Crest India Pale Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;GABF 2003: Clear orange color, deep pine aroma, bitter ending. I also wrote 'baxy', whatever that means.
Pacific Crest India Pale Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;This was a draught sampled at the brewery taproom A hop monster which is about typical for a northwestern IPA. A little thin, the hops came more into balance as the brew warmed. Strange that they served it so very cold. A beer that should be more popular in the Seattle area
Pacific Crest India Pale Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Thin fast fading head. Decent body. Faint malt with good hop profile........
Pacific Crest India Pale Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;"On draught at the taproom. Color is an attractive orange-amber, but with very thin head--decent lace, however. Aroma is very pleasant, floral and hoppy...Prominent hop profile does not immediately overwhelm the senses but overcomes with relentlessness--dominating all the way through the finish--and beyond! This leaves the front of the tongue aquiver and fills the entire oral cavity with hop essence. Malt is faintly detectable in flavor and offers just enough body to ward off the dreaded ""thin"" label. The comprehensive effects of the hops on the whole palate are impressive, and the fruity edges also add positively. Hop-heads will like this offering--bracing and fresh."
Pacific Crest Blackmouth Porter;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Porter;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Dark brown colour with huge foam, took about 5 minutes to settle. Aroma was some cocoa and roasted malt. Flavour is nutty and slightly sweet. A little thin but still enjoyable.
Pacific Crest Blackmouth Porter;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Porter;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Draught at the breweryNut brown colour. Slightly musty, chocolatey, roasty aroma. The flavour is quite nutty, and sweet with occasional floral notes and toastiness.
Pacific Crest Blackmouth Porter;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Porter;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Light in body and taste. Was rather disappointed in this one .............
Pacific Crest Blackmouth Porter;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Porter;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;To thin, to dry, not enough body to support the hops. But to fair they served this taproom sample much to cold and I was thirsty and drank it before it warmed up. It may be a better cool not frozen
Pacific Crest Pilsner;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;On draught at the taproom...This has an unfiltered look: hazy yellow-gold color that glows in the glass...unusual...head very light but with lingering lace. Aroma is slightly sweet with a spicy herbal-hop quality. This spicy hop countenance defines the top-end of the flavor spectrum. Light malt sweetness supplies secondary support and lingers throughout the tapered finish. Carbonation is moderate and in spirit with spritely demeanor of this brew. However, the flavors aren't quite all in harmony here...Body is a bit thin, even though this is clearly intended to be a thirst-quencher. Overall, this is not a classic pilsener, but certainly captures the spicy Saaz nip successfully. What this brew lacks in refinement it compensates for somewhat with a degree of rustic charm...
Pacific Crest Golden Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Golden body with minimal head. Some malts in the aroma and a little fruit (citrus). Tastes more like a lager due to the lightness. Didn’t notice a lot of hops.
Pacific Crest Golden Ale;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Draught at the breweryGolden-bronze colour. Crisp, slightly biscuity malt accent. Fruity hop notes. Kolsch-like, which is surprising because it’s not lagered and uses American hops.
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;From a bottle that likely day for a while. Malty , dusty Aroma. Faintest whiff of floral hops. Too much carbonation and very very boring overall. Oh well...
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;355 ml bottle as Big Easy Imperial Maibock Lager. Mostly clear orange yellow, off-white foam settles and mostly fades. Malty boozy aroma. Stronger sweet fruity lager malty taste, not too big, easy to quaff. Softer carbonation, medium bodied, low hopped. MLF (More Lagerboy Friendly)
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;Pretty enjoyable. Medium body amber lager. Bready in quality. Fairly boozy on the nose and in the body. Nice balance without being cloying.
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;Bottle. Pours a hazy orangish color. Aroma and taste are sweet with caramel and biscuit.
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a bright golden color with a huge creamy orange-white head that lingered and left good lacing. The aroma was sweet, tangy and yeasty with notes of sugar and golden fruit. The flavor was sweet, tangy and yeasty with notes of sugar, golden fruit and a hint of pepper. Medium length finish. Moderately full bodied. Well done.
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;Clear golden color with modest head. Limited aroma. Leans sweet which is appropriate to style.
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;Bottle shard with Parksy. Deep golden amber. Husky toasty malts, subtly spicy. True to style, and actually quite good.
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;Bottle. Pours a clear gold with a slight orange hue and a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has lots of bread with underlying notes of hay and sweet grains. Flavor has notes of earthy grains and bread with hay underlying.
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;12 oz single bottle from Mile High Wine & Spirits. Light golden-orange and clear appearance with a beige head. Aroma of bread, floral notes, light peppery spice, light citrus and other fruity esters. Similar flavor, strong and malty, lightly sweet and bitter and a touch boozy. Medium body. Pretty mild overall, not a lot going on. Kind of hard to drink after a while, a little messy.
Lakefront Big Easy Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lakefront Brewery;That bocktown monaca is a great place to taste beers. Funny on this one its called big easy but its brewed in wisconsin, heheheh. Good co2 from the start. Fairly clear smell about it. Perhaps a hint of candy on the nose. Fairly light at first but then there is this somthing happening. Some mild bandaid thing. What is this trying to tell me? Was it a purposefully beer to that this way or was it an accident? I’m not sure. yes, is this a maibock or is it a heller? Could be a premium lager as well. Could be a mestake that they just wanted to get outtah here. Finish is a bit difficult and unique fer sure. Hides alky well if its over 5%
Coffaro Italian Style Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;THOUGHTS: This was a gift from a coworker, who obviously had a beers of the world case sitting around for a few years and didn’t realize beer can go bad and decided he’d give it to the beer guy of the office. Well it was skunked. I normally won’t rate a skunked beer, but since I don’t think it is made anymore, I will never have the chance to rate it again, I think I will rate it. TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a cloudy, medium to dark dirty yellow with virtually no head that somehow left fair lacing. The aroma was mostly vinegar. The flavor started sweet and finished sour acidic and a little acetic with an average to short duration. There was corn, sweet malt, skunk, dust and metal. The light to medium body was like watery syrup with soft to flat carbonation and a metallic and light to moderate astringent finish.
Coffaro Italian Style Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Nah - not good. Cloudy, dirty yellow color and odd taste. It’s spicy, but not in a good way. Definitely not one of my top picks (or one of my mid-range picks, or even a lower level pick). It’s just plan old not good - down there with Bud and Miller.
Coffaro Italian Style Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;(bottle - 12 oz) Slightly cloudy peach color with not much of a head to speak of. Some light dashes of white. The light aroma is kind of sweet. Almost like cotton candy with a hint of grass. Sweet taste of apple juice and some sour hops at the beginning with a watery middle and a warming and semi-bitter hop finish. Slightly sour aftertaste and very thin-bodied.
Coffaro Italian Style Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;I tried this, to see. Poured very fizzy with huge head. No aroma? tasted like bud, at first. As it wamed some good tones came out. But stil. Nothing great
Coffaro Italian Style Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;I have had worse. Big head initially which goes away just as fast. Aroma of something that I can't place but not that great. Flavor is slightly acidic and very thin. Slight hops finish and is quite dry. An ok lager but can't remember the last time I saw Italians drinking beer with their ziti.
Coffaro Italian Style Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Italian makae wine not beer. Nothing good come from Wilkes Barre especially beer. Stay away and save your money.
Coffaro Italian Style Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;At first this beer was not that delicious, but I have quickly warmed to it. I enjoy the delicious taste, although it is too expensive.
Coffaro Italian Style Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;A bit fizzy, much like the macro-swill it could be mistaken for. However, when it warms, this beer reveals a character that's hidden when it's ice cold. Sadly, few will taste those flavors, but this is a respectable, family-brewed Italian lager with enough flavor to be respectable.

Pacific Crest Old Man Winter;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;Draught at the breweryDark amber colour. Not much nose - some sort of amber malts, perhaps. Fairly malty flavour, with a brown sugar/wood dynamic, and a hint of citrus in the finish.
Pacific Crest Old Man Winter;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub. Pours a light brown/mahogany color. Sort of porterish, but with more hop flavor. As with the IPA from this brewery, needs more body.
Pacific Crest Weizenbock;Tukwila, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Pacific Crest Brewing Company;lots of malt flavor. healthy amount of wheat - but it doesn't create the sour characteristic it does in a lot of weizenbocks. solid hop presence. you can taste the alchohol - but it's not overwhelming. nice golden color - not hazy. exceptionally well balanced and very easy drinking. this is how a weizenbock should be done. just had two of these at pacific crest's tap room. bought a grizzler of it to take home.

Robinsons Snowdon;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Robinsons Family Brewery;Cask (handpump) at the Castle, Manchester, circa 2001. I’m departing from my normal practice of not entering pre-Ratebeer notes as this beer is retired. Mid-brown, mid-weight, mid-hopped (earthy, subtle), mid-malted (caramel, light) beer. I would describe this beer as middling. Perhaps a bit more body than the average session beer, but a bit less bite too. Like many Robinsons beers, I found it worthy but uninspiring.

Weak malty finish is rather disappointing with little body or complexity for a 5%. A poor ESB.

Fire Station 5 Steam Pumper IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Reviewed from notes. Every time I had this beer, I had it in a pint glass. The appearance was a decent orange brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated leaving a decent lacing sticking finely to the sides of the glass. The smell tried to be hoppy bitter, but was basically just bitter to be bitter. The taste was bitter at times and then it showed some sweetness to it as it ran back and forth. There was no aftertaste nor was there any finish. On the palate, it sat a light to medium in body with a decent sessionable quality to it. Overall, this was a basic AIPA and most likely one I probably won’t revisit.

Sternburg Pilsener;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Standard/average Pils. Aroma suggests more grainy and fruity elements, reminiscent of a Bohemian Pils. Unfortunately its taste cannot live up to this, lacking intense enough flavours. Even a bit watery at times, low level of bitterness. Drinkable though.

Rother Bräu Öko Urtrunk;Hausen/Rhoen, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Rother Bräu;Ein weiteres Ökobier -schön, dass es mehr werden. Zum Rother-Zwickel fällt mir als ersten ein Geschmack aus Schwarzbrot mit Orangenmarmelade ein. Es hat klassiche zwickelige Brot- und Hefearomen, dazu aber ein paar interessante fruchtige Ansätze. Allerdings merke ich auch eine gewisse Muffigkeit, welche an alte Kelelr erinnert. Passt dazu, aber gefällt mir weniger. So hat man am Ende doch nur ein recht durchschnittliches Bier.

Overall kind of disappointing
Rother Bräu Öko Urtrunk;Hausen/Rhoen, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Rother Bräu;Bottle consumed in Nov. 2015, best by Jan. 2016: Hazy yellow. Puffy white halo of foam. Subtle aroma of melon, fennel, lemon, baguette, wet hay, and a hint of metal and sulfur. Soft and prickly bubbles. A sulfurous grip and gritty minerals pave a rustic path for lemony hop succulence which brightly ensues. Pils malt is lightly toasty and baguettelike, with just a touch of wet paper and hay poking through and marring things with some limpness. Smidgeon of claylike yeast coats the palate and reinforces the rustic profile. Assertive herb- and lemon-charged Spalt caps the budding baguette and sweet hay notes in the soft, scratchy hop finish. So many kellerbiers beg for more bitterness, so it’s good to see the brewers weren’t shy with the hops here. A very soft and quaffable rendition, with a touch of Old World mystique.

City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;On tap in a tumbler (interesting choice). Pours dark brown with a beige head. Aroma of lightly roasted malts with a little chocolate and sweetness plus some light hops. Flavor the same, with hints of coffee and chocolate. Average texture. Tastes and feels more like a normal stout than an imperial stout to me.
City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;Tap at the source - Black, tan creamy head. Nose held notes of black chocolate cream with soft underlying notes of butterscotch and currants. Sweet chocolate and roasty flavors fade in to hints of coffee and warming alcohol (8.5%). Faint hops try to round out the sweetness, but stays on the sweet side throughout. Medium to full bodied and oily, soft carbonation, soft sweet finish. More hops could have really made this one amazing. Still ok though for sippin...
City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Sable with a beige head. Somewhat weak chocolate and charcoal nose. Bitter chocolate and coffee flavors, followed by a bitter baking chocolate finish. Pretty dry. Good.
City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;Pours dark brown with a creamy light brown head. Smells of figs, dough, coffee, chocolate and candy. Tastes more subdued than it’s smell suggests with a thinness on the mouthfeel.
City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;on tap-pours a big, creamy brown head with black color. Aroma is dark malt, coffee. Taste is dark malt, coffee, alcohol. Somewhat sweet. Not my taste, nicely done.
City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;On draught at brewry with Clarkvv 8/11/05: Opaque dark black color that almost sticks to the side of the glass when swirled it’s so dark. Atop it sits a large tan head that dies to a small but lasting film and ring around the glass. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, licorice, earth, and some grapes or prunes. The taste is a bit sweet, but I didn’t find it to be syrupy or over the top. It starts off with licorice and chocolate, caramel, then roasted malt, near charcoal, and a hint of toffee. Finishes a bit chaulky with sweet sugars lingering on the tongue. Full bodied, medium carbonatoin, creamy chewy body.
City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;On draught at the brewery, 8/11/2005 with Bucknaked. Big tan head recedes quickly to cover, tons of lacing as usual. REALLY dark black and opaque. Aroma of dry, nutty malt, earthiness and light roast. Cigars perhaps. Some prune-like vinousness, but again, low aroma overall (even sticking my face in the glass). Flavor begins with some sticky caramel, a bit of black licorice and some smoky, charred wood. Dry, salty black malts. Sweet toffee and a hint of anise and vanilla. Dark, bitter roast on the end. Retro smoke with some chocolate undertones. Hops and alcohol are up front, before it really gets dark and bitter. Seems it could use a good deal more chewiness. Getting some alcohol apparency in the nose as the beer progresses. Pretty flat, some ashiness lingers along with cola and caramel (kind of an odd mix). Loose and somewhat thinned out, but not overly watery.
City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;On tap at CT Brew Fest. Aroma is mildly sweet with some chocolate and the typical licorice notes that City Steam always has. Opaque dark brown/black with a brown head and nice lacing. Sweet start with lots of sugars turning chocolate and roasty. Finishes very sweet and roasty. Extremely sweet for an Impy Stout. Almost as though it wasn’t fermented enough. Unfortunately, the girl pouring this beer was told by the brewmaster to say it was 20% ABV. Because of this lameness, I have deducted overall points.
City Steam Czars and Girls;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;City Steam Brewery;"Draught: I was a bit disappointed in this one. I expect Imperial stouts to be more full bodied and flavorful than this one was. It was good, but more of an ""Imperial Stout Light"" than anything else. It was still very drinkable, but just not all I would expect from an Imperial Stout. Re-rate 9-07: Definitely improved from the last time that I had this. Much more body and flavor than before."
Olde Stone Cream Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Olde Stone Brewing;Yellow body, small creamy white head. Lightly yeasty aroma with a mild fruity character. Very mild flavour with light sweet fruit. Average to light palate is smooth. Tasted pretty much like you would expect if you have had a cream al at another brewpub. Well executed but a bit dull.
Olde Stone Cream Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Olde Stone Brewing;"I'm the first ever Ratebeerian to visit P'oro? Wow. Well, I went spelunking at the Warsaw Caves (Warsaw Lunch, for the record, has some fine staff) and made sure to stop at the Olde Stone on the way home. This one was billed as being ""like Boddington's"". Light bronze colour, lemon, EKG aroma...sweetish and mild. I guess so, although I never did find cask Boddy's in Manchester last year. Anyway, it's useless."
Olde Stone Cream Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Olde Stone Brewing;This is my least favorite of the Olde Stone beers. This was watery, and had a candy-wheat flavour to it.
Alcatraz Maibock;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Light gold bock with no head, no aroma, heavy malts in mouth with very german lager hops. Friendly server at booth, but not much else. (July 31 at Indiana Microbrewers Festival)
Alcatraz Maibock;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Alcatraz Brewing Company;I’d guess this was 9% abv as there’s considerable burn. Touch of sweetness helps to conceal the alcohol. Typical light golden bock color. Good attempt at the style.
Alcatraz Maibock;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Sweet, fragrant aroma. Opens very hoppy, the middle is sweet and malty. Finishes with hoppy bitterness. A bit overdone on the hops, as they linger a long time on the aftertaste, but all in all, the best American beer I have sampled.

Lass O Gowrie Lass Ale;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lass O Gowrie;On cask at the Lass O Gowrie, Manchester, April 2008. This is clearly still being made somewhere but I have no idea where. Rosebridge, who made some of the Lass O Gowrie beers for a while themselves went out of business in 2007 so this remains something of a mystery. Amber, thin white head. Dry malt with touches of earthy hop. Standard UK bitter. PRE-RATE. Vintage rating. On cask (handpump) at the Lass O Gowrie. Its not my intention to put all my pre RB stuff onto the site but, where the brewery has recently closed and the beer was still made up to that point (I’m surprised they kept going as long as they did) I’ll add a few for posterity’s sake. Amber colour. Mellow. Soft malt. Some spicy notes, but not very bitter. Serviceable enough without generating too much excitement. (5/3/6/3/11)

Bergbräu Hefeweizen;Uslar, Lower Saxony, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Privatbrauerei Haffner - Sollinger Bergbrauerei;Das Baby-Weizen sieht im Glas sehr schön aus: Blond, etwas schlierig und im oberen Bereich etwas ins orangene gehend, hefetrüb mit toller, stabiler Schaumkrone. Der Geruch fruchtig. Der Antrunk zunächst recht süsslich, dann kurzzeitige zitronige Noten, und danach prickelnd fruchtig. Im weiteren Verlauf werden feine Malzzüge wahrgenommen. Der Hefegeschmack wird nach und nach im Hintergrund aufgebaut. Insgesamt recht mild und fruchtig. Könnte im Mittelteil prägnanter sein. Das Etikett ist schön designt.

Fills the entire half litre glass with foam. Impressive but less then useful. Eventually some cloudy amber beer appears at the bottom of the glass. Smells more maltier and less spicier than other hefes. The towering white head takes a long long time to reach manageable height. Eventually a sediment laden amber beer appears with a fluffy white crown. Good body, taste is light on, a bit sickly sweet. Finish has bitter notes not normally found in this style of beer. Tiny touch of fruity banana at the end, not much spice. It's OK.

Bergbräu Hefeweizen;Uslar, Lower Saxony, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Privatbrauerei Haffner - Sollinger Bergbrauerei;Pours hazy, straw-colored from the bottle. The aroma is banana and puke. Don’t think I’ve ever written that about a beer before. Taste is lightly sweet, buttery, bready, with light acidity on a highly carbonated palate. The head after the pour was truly monumental. Thins and turns one-dimensional going into the finish. The sweetness fades and the vinegary, fermenting notes pick up slightly, leaving behind a somewhat sour aftertaste. Overall a disappointing effort, and not worth repeating.

Sierra Nevada Old Chico Crystal Wheat;Chico, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"Nothing offensive, but less flavor than a mass market pilsener. Definitely not ""a great choice for those new to craft brew and longtime beer aficionados alike""."
Sierra Nevada Old Chico Crystal Wheat;Chico, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"Clear golden coloured body with a light white head, about three centimetres at first that fades down quite nicely. Aroma of fresh hops, citrus, grasses, hay and some hop pellets. Light-bodied; Grassy flavours at first with a dose of fresh malt and hops, a hint of artificial sugars and a dose of grain noticeable right behind. Aftertaste shows more of a funky malt with cardboard than anything else, but some fake sugars are also around. Overall, a decent beer that shows some very light flavours, but nothing too exciting and definitely not in the same class as other kristalweizens are. I feel like this beer is more like the beers of the East here, instead of a beer from California from one of the bigger breweries. I sampled this stubby twelve ounce bottle purchased from City’Super in One IFC in Central, Hong Kong on 29-July-2017 for a marked down price of HK$22,00 sampled in my hotel room here in Admiralty, Hong Kong on 01-August-2017, marking this the first time I’ve ever seen this beer, which is halfway on the other side of the world from home and the U.S."

Arcobräu Weissbier Hell;Moos, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Arcobräu Gräfliches Brauhaus;"Fand ich bei der ersten Verkostung einfach nur schrecklich, inzwischen hab ich es etwas besser zu schätzen gelernt. Trotzdem, irgendetwas stört den puren Genuss. Es besteht eine deutliche Disharmonie zwischen der (für ein helles Weizen) ungewöhnlich malzigen Grundnote und den säuerlichen, süßen, bitteren und fruchtigen Tönen. Beim dunklen Weizen aus gleichem Haus gibt es hingegen absolut nix zu kritisieren. Arco ist nicht gleich Arco. Es gibt 2 vollständig eigenständige Brauereien die ""Arco"" Im Namen tragen. Hier handelt es sich um Arcobräu in Moos. Nicht zu verwechseln mit Graf Arco in Eichendorf / Adldorf."

Arcobräu Weissbier Hell;Moos, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Arcobräu Gräfliches Brauhaus;Nun, bei diesem Bier bin ich doch sehr gespannt, wie es schmeckt. Bin ich doch bis jetzt nur guten Bieren in dieser Region begegnet und Arcobräu ist auf dem Gäubodenfest mit einem sehr gutem Festbier vetreten. Der Anblick zeigt orangene Farbgebung mit fruchtig, leicht nelkigem Geruch. Der Antrunk ist etwas säuerlich, etwas nelkig und fruchtig. Im Mittelteil versucht das Bier vollmundig zu werden, schafft es aber nicht. Es ist kurzzeitig malzig, würzig und weiterhin fruchtig, säuerlich und nelkig. Die Hefe bemerkt man als Unterton. Fazit: Das Bier ist mild, süffig, fruchtig und ein Tick zu säuerlich.

Rapunzel Export;Weiler-Simmerberg, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Aktienbrauerei Simmerberg;0.5l bottle from a bioshop in Zagreb (thanks again to ozujsko for the tip!) Right, I forgot to say this in the Pils review, but both of these are brewed by some brewery called Aktienbrauerei Simmerberg for the Rapunzel Naturkost. I’ll do some research, and send corrections if necessary. Now, onto the beer. It poured a big thick white head that went away fast (smaller but thicker than the Pils head), leaving a lot of nice lacing on the edges of the glass. Slightly hazy golden colour. Looked promising until I smelled it.... Remarkably n/a-ish malt nose. I agree with muzzlehatch on the corny part... something just felt odd. The taste was interesting, but in my opinion not as good as in the Pils. One rather assertive, and interesting kind of malt dominates the taste going from honey to strong caramel to nuts. Sounds impressive, but in practice, it isn’t, some fruitiness in the background, provided perhaps by the same kind of malt as in the Pils. No noticable hops, exept maybe some extremely faint hints in the aftertaste. Interesting beer, but not great.

Panil Blanche;Torrechiara (PR), Italy;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Panil Birra Artigianale - Birrificio Torrechiara;Une autre Panil qui explose chez Yan. M’enfin, ils nous restent deux petits verres et cela est malgré tout suffisant pour rassembler quelques idées. Donc, une mousse increvable qui scelle pour un moment les parfums de cette blanche qui présentent, rapidement, des similitudes (le pouvoir de la suggestion) avec la Weizen Bam de JP. Des notes de bretts, une aigreur citronnée et des arômes épicés caractérisent le nez de cette fontaine. Sur les papilles, des saveurs sèches, acides et aigres qui fonctionnent et qui sont, sans grande surprise, plaisantes. Une bouche, par contre, qui n’a pas l’étoffe des bières de Dexter. Le corps et la texture sont minces et souffrent-ils de l’attaque des microbes? En finale, ce sont des notes aigrelettes et surettes qui s’exposent avec une attention délicate sur une période de temps relativement courte. Bref, une blanche transformée qui reste relativement intéressante à boire.

First of all, I smell of old melon bubble gum, accompanied by floral and dubious fruit nuances. Just quite yeasty really. In mouth, a very husky feel detracts from the attempts to appreciate.

Cask, handpump dispense. Cloudy copper red in colour with a poor open white head. Strong sulphurous aroma with hints of canned fruit salad. Good smooth mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malts deliver a very juicy malt base with syrupy fruit salad flavours. Sweet cherries, honeydew melon, peaches and pears are present.

Blackpool Pale Ale / BPA;Blackpool, Lancashire, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blackpool;Rediscovered rating found on a scrap of paper. Some time in March 2004 (same time as Barnsley Bitter from the same brewery). Venue unknown. Not that pale. More like mid-amber. Fairly bitter, but tempered by plenty of juicy fruit. More on the palate than in the aroma. A decently balanced best bitter. After going bust for the sixth time it looks like we have finally seen the last of the Barnsley/Blackpool set up as the kit was sold to Acorn.

Dwans Paddys IPA;Thurles, Ireland;Strong Ale - English;Dwan;same as Carden’s IPA - not really an IPA, more of a strong pale ale, not enough hop for IPA
Dwans Paddys IPA;Thurles, Ireland;Strong Ale - English;Dwan;i wonder if the name indicates that this is some sort of hybrid between an IPA and an Irish Red? anyway, not a lot of hops in evidence: more like an extra strong fruity bitter. very clear dark red colour. whiff of black bananas, or my old chess set. tastes uncannily like glace pineapple chunks marinated in bovril. spicy brown sugary finish.

Pours a copper brown color with a big off-white beige head. has a caramel aroma. The beer produces a great malt syrup bolus. The sweetness is then smoothed out by at great bitter hop palate. This has a phenomenal mouth feel. The best beer poured here.
Widmer Brothers Dopplebock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);what is in my mouth? roasted malt thinned with water, whiskey, dark cheries & maybe a stray cigarette butt. aroma of roasted malt, dark syrup (sans maple.) dark brown with ruby highlights, no head. great in the mouth--- numbing the tongue and all around. a good intensity, but hte pieces dont fit together
Widmer Brothers Dopplebock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);1/19/08 On draught at the Portland brewhouse. Aroma is smoky, malt-forward, with no hop character and some dark fruit character in the background. Appearance is amber/brown with a very low head. Flavor is rich, sweet and fruity, with malt dominance followed by moderate flora-free bittering and a low alcoholic note. Mouthfeel is medium/high bodied with medium carb texture and good alcoholic warmth. Overall, great complexity, but probably wouldn’t go for more than one.

Widmer Brothers Dopplebock;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);On tap at the Widmer Gasthaus, Portland brewhouse.Smells amazing. Tons of malty sweetness that oozes with caramel and raisins. Even the most vigorous pour only produced a thin ring that I wouldn’t even call head. The beer is dark brown in color with a ruby glow. The lack of carbonation in this beer is almost to the point of flat, and it makes for a dissapointly watery mouthfeel. It isn’t as sweet as the aroma suggests, but then that’s not such a bad thing. There is plenty of caramel and toffee flavors up front. Towards the end there is a bit of alcohol and a faint bitterness that is more astringent then hop induced. A decent doppelbock with an amazing aroma.

Pours deep cherry red with a fast falling white head. Sweet malt aroma with chocolate and caramel. The first taste I noticed was some cocoa up front followed with a rich caramel body, some nice weight on the palate showed the thicker body of this beer. Very well balanced but fairly mild doppelbock.

Abbeydale Last Rites;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Abbeydale Brewery;Keg at the Rake, 06/11/19. Pale yellow with a decent white head. Nose gives off a good bourbon waft, caramel, light fruit esters, alcohol, candied fruits. Taste comprises caramel, stewed fruits, sugar cane, good bourbon rip, prunes, light spice. Medium plus bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close with a balanced rising boost. Not a bad sipper ... all comes in well below the hefty ABV but perhaps also lacking depth for a 11% jobbie ?!

Abbeydale Last Rites;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Abbeydale Brewery;Typical cloudy colour. Aroma is if you imagine melted Haribo sweets.

Barley Creek Jenkins Wood Pilsner;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Draft. Very malty, deep yellow color. Hop presence dominates, with a smooth, hoppy, honeyish finish. I'll stack this one against Pilsner Urquell any day.

Barley Creek Old 99 Barley Wine;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Wow! This may be the worst one yet. The nose reeks of cheap alcohol. Pours from tab dishwater brown with a small brown head. Taste has a faint pruniness but doesn’t linger and doesn’t improve as it warms. It’s very thin and it doesn’t wear it’s 10% very well. Recommended only for people you can’t stand to see happy.
Barley Creek Old 99 Barley Wine;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Cask at the brewpub. Aroma of toffee and earth, not much else. Flavor of sweet malt, nougat, orange and red fruits with some citrus notes. Only had a bit of this, was hard to tell if the sweetness in it would be wearing over a full glass, but it was pretty good for me.
Barley Creek Old 99 Barley Wine;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;On cask at the brewpub. Pours brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of sweet malt--medicinally sweet-- and acetone. Flavor is very very sweet with some sourness and booziness too. Not terrible but it’s good good either. Much too sweet. 6/4/6/3/12 (3.1/5)
Barley Creek Old 99 Barley Wine;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Tap @ the pub.

Very dark brown in color- almost looks like an English Old Ale, or something similar. Aroma is dark fruit, oxidized malts as well as some wild (sour) notes.

Barley Creek Old 99 Barley Wine;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Revised rating 11/1/2008. On tap at Barley Creek. I’m sorry, but this is not the same beer I loved and enjoyed the last time I had it two years ago. While there is still an ample amount of fruit, this beer lacks the richness and silky mouthfeel that made this beer a standout for me. I don’t know if this is just an old keg or if there were strorage issues, but there is definitely some oxidation present, especially towards the finish. I also noticed some mild oxidation in my wife’s Wanderlust Chocolate Porter, which I know is a very fresh batch that was just released, so perhaps it is a quality control issue. In any event, I was disappointed with this year’s edition and hope future editions are improved. <br /><br /> Original rating 8/29/2006. On tap at Barley Creek. Served in a small brandy glass. Pours a very deep reddish brown with virtually no head. Holding the glass up to the light, there is just enough light passing through to see the color of this brew. Wonderful aroma of plums and raisins. The flavor follows the aroma with lots of plum and raisins. Not at all bitter. The alcohol is very well hidden and there is no bite at all. Very smooth and luxurious beverage. A winner! 8-4-8-5-16.

Barley Creek Old 99 Barley Wine;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;tap at the brewpub, pour is a caramel color with a thick creamy head. body of the beer is viscous as it clings to the walls of the snifter. aroma is full of caramel malts and maple sugar, there are some flowery hops and a slight scotch scent. flavors progress from grassy hops up front, through the malts and end up with the maple/scotch flavors. each mouthfull was smooth and creamy, with no hint of the nearly 10%v abv. if it were a little thicker, it would have been utterly fantastic, but there was a little bit of wateryness in the mouthfeel which knocked off a couple points
Okells Cooil Pils;Douglas, Isle of Man;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okells;"Light gold; watery, fizzy, bland. Given that you can't buy it in any serious Okells pub, but you can get it at the ferry terminal, I guess the rating isn't that big a surprise."

Slater's Monkey Magic;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Slater's Ales;12th May 2012 saw me on a pub crawl of Shrewsbury: Mild in May is a CAMRA thing, so I had one every time I saw one (or tried too). Hand pulled pint in ‘The Coach and Horses’: dark brown body with a beige head. The aromas given off were of roasted/toasted malts, caramel and other semi-sweet molasses, almost burnt smell at times. Rich is the wrong word, but this was full of flavour: over cooked malts being the main taste, they in turn reminded me of ground coffee, dark chocolate and malt loaf. Another good beer from a fine brewery
Slater's Monkey Magic;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Slater's Ales;cask at southampton arms ... coffee roast light malt nose ... light coffee roast .... little thin ... dark malts ok
Slater's Monkey Magic;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Slater's Ales;Can’t remember that much about this beer, so might have to revisit and rerate it at somepoint, however what I do remember was a smoked sausage kind of taste which combined with beer is excellent
Slater's Monkey Magic;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Slater's Ales;Cask conditioned handpump Wellington Birmingham. A black beer with an off-white head. I’ve not been impressed by a Slaters beer for many a year, but this was good. A roasty aroma with liquorice and arrowroot. Good bitterness and burnt malts in the mouth with abit of veg for good measure. An impressive mild.
Slater's Monkey Magic;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Slater's Ales;From the barrel, pours a deep brown. Nice burnt caramel & malt on the nose. Palate has nice hit of dark malts, & a light juicy finish. I’m not a massive fan of milds, but this has pleasant flavour & is a refreshing pint. There may be a slight metallic undercurrent, but it’s very light & doesn’t ruin the experience.

Darkest ruby red in colour, lacy white head. Flavours of malt, coffee and bread, but generally rather dull and thin bodied. salty finish. gentle drinkable bitter.
Slater's Monkey Magic;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Slater's Ales;[i] [b] Cask at the Lamb and Flag, Oxford, 01-06-08 [/i] [/b] Pours dark brown with slim white head a few ruby glints catch in the light of the window. I could smell the caramel as this was being poured so came as no surprise that the main aroma that I could sell was caramel. Some caramel and dark fruits blend together nicely in the mouth but to be honest it was a bit thin, also served slightly too warm which wasn’t so helpful, but ok.
Slater's Monkey Magic;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Slater's Ales;Cask (Peterborough Beer Festival 2004) Dark brown, thin head. Pleasantly hopped for a mild - clearly some cuts through the otherwise caramel malty aroma. A paradox - quite a simple taste but with a complex balance of roasted malt and hops. Very well balanced, and excellent for only 3.4%.

Slater's Monkey Magic;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Slater's Ales;A notebook audit yields four beers that I hadn’t entered up to now. Can’t say where or when I had them, except that it was some time in 2005. A fairly standard, easy drinking, mild, with a bit of roast malt but not much else. But let’s not forget that it is a mild and that’s what a lot of them are intended to be.
Bullmastiff Welsh Gold;Leckwith, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bullmastiff Brewery;Cask Conditioned handpump Market Porter London. A golden beer with a whitish ring of bubbles. A bit sweet of nose but quite plain. There is a dirty water like taste to this with yeast and bruised fruit. Pretty poor.

Dull black in colour with a dark tan coloured head. Strong roast coffee and vanilla fudge in the long aroma. Very thick mouthfeel and poor lacing. Dark malts deliver a strong treacle sponge base with sweet molasses, chocolate and mocha notes. Slight prickle of dusty hops but this is lost in the thick chewy aftertaste. Malted toffee and liquorice noted in the heavy finish. Surprisingly thick for 4.1% and the solid texture reminded me of Youngers No 3. Maybe not one for a session but still highly recommended.

Roman Special;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Roman;"Adriaen Brouwer’s precursor, one of those remnants of a time when every brewery in and around Oudenaarde made this type of beer; basically ’oud bruin’ without the bacterial fermentations which typify the West-Flemish variant. Bronze colour, thin, off-white head, caramelly profile with some candi, dried fruits, dough; earthy and yeasty taste, sweetish, even a bit sugary but in a good way, smooth, but thin mouthfeel. Honest and old-fashioned - who can have anything against that? Doesn’t age very well, though."

Roman Special;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Roman;Das Bier beginnt mild malzig und leicht cremig, dabei spielt der süßliche Unterton eine große Bedeutung.

Bürger Kölsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Privatbrauerei Gaffel Becker & Co.;One of the lesser known examples of its style, with a yellowish white, moussy head, quite stable, and a pale golden blonde colour, cristal clear. Nose gets pale malts, a tad of sourish wheat, apple, cheese and an earthy, leafy hoppiness. Pure and sweetish pale malts in the mouth, minerals, in the end a herbal and leafy hop bitterness, a bit more herbal than I am used to in this genre.

Im Antrunk dann Kölsch-Wässrigkeit par excellence, gefolgt von einem geschmacklichen Bermuda-Dreieck, das etwas malzig-süss ist. Der absolute Kotzbrocken ist aber der Abgang: Hier kommt eine bissige-metallische Note, die einfach grottig ist und den Billigeindruck zu 100% bestätigt. Never again!

Sunny, simple citric malt in the nose but a little lean toward peach/apricot. Clear yellow body with a soapy white head.

Shumensko Premium;Shumen, Bulgaria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shumensko Pivo (Carlsberg Bulgaria);Bottle, 360 ml. Wow, the best beer so far this afternoon. Bright golden, almost no foam, but the aromas and the taste are just nice. Smells sweet malt with a bit of caramel inside (or maybe it's not caramel, but they use some interesting malt inside which is sweet). The palate is refreshing, good amount of barley(s) and a nice structure. Faint aftertaste, but very pleasent taste with a nice touch of sweetness. I like it a lot, this is a great value for 1.05€. New favourite! Update: the canned one tastes more intensive for me, great bitterness on the end, this is simply a great lager!
Shumensko Premium;Shumen, Bulgaria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shumensko Pivo (Carlsberg Bulgaria);"500ml bottle, drunk many times over the years. Review from old notes as this one is now sadly retired. Pours clear with a frothy head, medium retention, some bead. On the nose, a good mix of bread and honey malts with grass and floral hops. In the mouth, medium carbonation, flavours consistent with the aromas, mild bitterness, a crisp short finish. Overall, a refreshing and flavoursome lager, now sadly retired, despite being Bulgaria's best macro. Its ""twin"", Shumensko Spetsialno happily lives on."

L’intensità olfattiva è normale e la persistenza olfattiva è corta. Il gusto al naso rimanda a percezioni di orzo. Il cappello di schiuma ha una scarsa tenuta, con la grandezza delle bollicine che è grossolana, a carbonazione media. La consistenza del liquido è limpida. Le bollicine sono poche e fini. La carbonazione è morbida. Il colore è giallo paglierino. Il corpo è snello. L’amaro è leggero. L’intensità gustativa è leggera e la persistenza gustativa è corta. Il gusto è piacevole. Le sensazioni boccali finali sono di facile beva. Il finale è dissetante e semplice. Il retrogusto è veloce. Al palato arrivano sentori di pane e cereali.

Billed as ""Raspberry Light"" and is a variation of the Sebago Light, not a wheat beer. Very clear. Raspberry soda children’s drink smell.

This is basically what appears to be their light beer with some raspberry flavors thrown in. It was a nice tangy raspberry which made it a little different than the other raspberry wheats i’ve had, although I’m still not a big fan of wheat beers, nor am i a fan of fruit beers. I’ve gotta say you should skip this one.

Ind Coope Draught Burton Ale;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Carlsberg UK;First tasted this in the Wee Howf, Paisley in December 1980. Cask, handpump dispense. Danny always kept this in good nick and won an award for this back in the day. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale copper in colour with a thick creamy white head. Warm yeasty dough in the robust malty aroma. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a powerful, fiery digestive biscuit base with some ginger nuts mixed in. Strong tart marmalade flavours also present in the mouth. Dry black pepper flavours present in the spicy hop resins give a fiery aftertaste. Finish is robust and malty with dry leather and oak cask wood notes strong in the palate. An excellent session ESB and a pub with happy memories.

Drab but inoffensive flavour with a faintly peppered Weetabix sogginess, a weak, unidentified jellied fruit hint. Some chalk and caramel. It’s immensely tedious but drinkable.

Pours clear, but almost opaque with a thin frothy pale brown head, plenty of lacing, no bead. Dark brown in colour. Light aroma of toast, caramel and corn. Creamy mouth feel with mid to high carbonation and flavours of toast, cereal and bread. Crisp finish with well-balanced bitterness. Overall, a fairly ordinary dunkel, but nevertheless, a welcome change from the raft of supermarket lagers and pilseners, and refreshing enough to be drunk all year round. Sadly, it remains one of Bulgaria's seasonal dark beers.

Boliarka T'mno;Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Boliarka-VT Brewery;Bottle in Bulgaria. Pours dark brown with a fast-fading beige head. Malty aroma, some turbinado sugar in there. Flavor is interesting in its first impression: strong notes of lightly charred whole wheat toast. Further taste of light dough and faint dark sugar. Light to medium in body with average carbonation. Lingering toasted bread in the finish, lightly dry, with only subtle malt sugars. Really a quite nice beer. I can’t remember having a beer with a similar flavor profile. Good stuff.

Wickwar BOB;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;Live rating of a 500 ml bottle from B&M Gateshead, picked up by mistake when I was stocking up on the brewery’s Station Porter which I love: this however, is a different beast. Amber with a white head, so it looks good. Weak lemon barley water in a rusty tin can aroma, which manifests itself in an initially sourish flavour. A bit of muted lemon, a soupcon of toffee malt, a mildly bitter finish, and that’s yer lot. Perhaps it’s about context: perhaps after lashing it back on a night out with a group of raucous mates, I would score this higher. It doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny at home. Not horrible.

Archers Summer Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);(Hand Pump) A straw coloured ale, with a loose head that fails very early. Reasonably hoppy flavour, and drinks above it's weight. It is what it says it is, a refreshing summer beer.
Archers Summer Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask, Frog and Toad, Gillingham. Aroma of rancid nylon.

Rogues Roost ESB;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rogues Roost Brewpub & Eatery;Deep copper colour w/ big head & nice lacing. Fruity aroma w/ hops cutting through nicely. Full bodied, resiny & sticky. Malty & fruity upfront w/ a lingerinig bitter finish. A little harsh & earthy for the style.

Rogues Roost Oatmeal Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rogues Roost Brewpub & Eatery;Smallish creamy khaki head dimishes quickly atop a black body. I expect a larger pour in a different glass would have lingered longer. Decent lacing (3+) Aroma is muted, mild dark roast malt and a hint of chocolate. Flavour is fairly dry with just barely enough sweet malt. Dry mild roast with touches of nutty dark chocolate at times. Chocolate comes out a lot more as the glass warms. Medium palate. Decent average stout, not really doing much for me today.

Slaapmutske Tripel (Triple Nightcap);Melle, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Slaapmutske;This strange tripel is sort of a wolf in sheep's clothing. The aroma is just delectable with tons of orange, apple, pear, stone fruit, spicy hops and yeasty esthers. If my nose could live inside the glass, I would be eternally grateful. But the flavors here are just muted and underpowered. The beer comes across as old. Fruitiness is there, but past it's prime as are the hops. Not quite stale, just not bright and lively. A bit of a disappointment given the amazing aroma. Not a heavy Tripel, it drinks light with a nice carbonation profile. It died almost everything right... But the flavors just don't pop.

Three Needs Belgian Singel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Objectively speaking: Most likely a different recipe, but drank in July 2008 under the Abbey Single name. I like: Fair bready malts provide a supple medium body. Relatively dry all througout, though not hoppy. I dislike: A bit disorganized yeastiness. Not much freshness involved. Not very challenging esters, barely fruity.
Three Needs Belgian Singel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;I'll agree with muzzlehatch that this beer is sub par.

Three Needs Belgian Singel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Really liked this pub's dubbel and trippel, so had some hopes for this singel; alas, unfounded.

Three Needs Scotch Ale 80 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pint at the brewpub, February 2006. Deep walnut-bark color, hazy-to-opaque, with very little head atop the murkiness....nose lightly nutty, chocolaty and just a touch peaty-smoky, fairly restrained....served too damn cold, this does offer more as it warms, hints of buttery toffee and anise are noticeable....whoa, it’s a sweet one, lots of brown sugar and perhaps a bit of maple at first, licorice in the center, and as it warms and especially at the end, thick rich toffee, almost too much as there’s little in the way of balancing hops....touches of woody-twiggy character do kill the sweetness just enough to make it drinkable, though it could use a little more body....wasn’t too into this at first, but it does get a bit fuller and more expressive as it warms and is certainly recommendable.

The Brewery At Lake Tahoe Washoe Wheat Ale;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;Poured into a shaker pint at the brewery while sitting outside enjoying the view. From notes, July 27, 2012. A: Bready wheat malt, light-colored fruit and light pepper and clove spices. A: Hazy orangish-golden color with a small white head that fades pretty quickly. T: Taste seems weak in every aspect. Very light clove with some grassy, wheat-like malt and a slight fuit flavor. No flavor is very strong, however. P: Light-bodied with good carbonation, and a mild dryness. O: This beer isn’t bad, but it’s pedestrian. Again, everything is a bit too subdued.

The Brewery At Lake Tahoe Prince of Pales;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;The 2nd beer of the sampler order. An English style pale ale?

Hoppy for a Mild. Super beer! (2010-05)
Dark Star Over the Moon;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);On cask at the Speaker, Westminster dispensed into a pint glass (Dec ’11). A mid brown colour with a small head that had vanished after 4 or 5 sips. Smelt very hoppy, citrus nose, light malts and nuts, maybe another fruit (of the dried variety) or perhaps mild spices. Smelt a lot like the Hophead! Tastes akin to Hophead but earthier and more emphasis on malt and nut, maybe a smidge of toffee/caramel, but similar hoppy pleasanteries! Mouthfeel was fine. Hophead in a brown winters jacket !
Dark Star Over the Moon;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);My first ever visit to ‘The Southampton Arms’ (London) and one of the many cask offerings was this beer: my third beer of a slow Saturday afternoon session was a hand-pulled pint of this, poured into an old ‘dimpled pint mug’, like all the cask ales are in this pub. I like a good Dark Mild now and again, this fitted the bill nicely. Dark brown with an off-white wisp of bubbles on top it looked your typical beer of that style. Roast/toasted malts in the nose, coffee and toffee like with some slightly burnt bits in the smells too. The taste is also malts all the way, again roasted/toasted with some dried fruit and malt loaf flavours coming through as well. The finish is fairly dry and the beer is far from sweet, the hops coming into their own towards the end of each gulp (you don’t sip Mild). Not the richest or thickest Dark Mild body wise, but very enjoyable non-the-less.

Dark Star Over the Moon;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Very pleasant hoppy/bitter dark ale. Well-balanced without any of its elements out-doing the other.

Dark Star Over the Moon;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);A good beer. Described as mild it has all the characteristics you would expect. Dark. Malty.

Dark Star Over the Moon;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Dark toffee with ruby highlights. Tan head, thin in size. Lacing. Caramel and malty aromas.

Not a whole lot going on though. Too thin and lacking in flavor.

Some light eggy/sulfuric notes in the aroma, which weren’t too pleasant. Not really up there as far as witbiers go.
Dark Star Landlords Wit;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask at Oliver Twist, Stockholm. Pale yellow. Citric, lemony hop aroma. Light bodied with medium sweetness and soapy hoppiness. The mouthfeel is light and rounded and there’s lingering bitterness in the finish. Much more of a blond ale than a witbier.
Dark Star Landlords Wit;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);(sampled cask-conditioned at Akkurat, Stockholm) Light yellow, low firm white head. Vague lemony aroma. Lemon and pale malts in flavour. Notes of grapefruit in the aftertaste. This is not a Wit!
Dark Star Landlords Wit;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Gravity at Banbury Beer Festival. Sampled with Maeib. Hazed yellow, no head. A bit of a pork inspired Wit. Hints at the requisite chalkiness, and is lemony, but seems like more of a Golden ale to me. Nice dryness in the finish. Very citric, with a lemon smell. Ok.
Dark Star Landlords Wit;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Banbury BF. A light haze to this yellow-green coloured attempt at a Belgian Wit. The aroma has a tiny amount of spice and some lemony notes. The taste is a bit medicinal with hints of lemon. It is a reasonable beer but not really true to its style.
Dark Star Landlords Wit;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Presumably intended to be in a Belgian wit bier style, but I don’t think its one of Dark Star’s more successful efforts. Very pale straw colour, only slightly hazy. There some citric edge here - even a little sharpness. However, I didn’t pick up too much in the way of spicing and, overall, I found this a bit dull. Cask (handpump), Head of Steam, Euston.
Dark Star Landlords Wit;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);(Cask conditioned) Slightly hazy golden color with a medium, white head. Quite mild, flowery-hoppy aroma. Sweetish, very flowery and somewhat fruity flavor. Would like even more hopping, though. Medium-bodied, sticky, very soft and smooth, low-carbonated palate. It’s interesting to see a British, cask conditioned wheat beer. It’s just way too mild and flat to be interesting as a witbier.
Dark Star Landlords Wit;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask Conditioned at Banbury Beer Festival. A reasonable attempt at a Witbier, but the spice is a litle over the top, no subtlety. Lemon with a corriander flavour.

Dark Star Starbock;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask (gravity dispense), Chelmsford Beer Festival, July 2005. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a British brewer attempt a bock before, so full marks for trying. However, it didn’t succeed entirely. The colour is a deep tawny. Malty aroma but it has a quite raw, stagnant, feel to it. Dull, malty flavour with caramel, hints of licorice and a touch of bitterness. But the flavours were a bit muted and, overall, there wasn’t really a lot happening for me.
Dark Star Starbock;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask@Chelmsford Beer Festival. A bock on cask? Doughy caramel sweetness, touch of soy (only aa very small touch). A little sticky and flat in the mouthfeel. Not the best from thiss brewer, but still nice and soft and as usual from Dark Star, well made.

Struggled to enjoy this to be honest; it looked OK, an orange hue to the light brown body with a fairly good head of off-white bubbles perched on top. The nose was flowery and fruity with lightly baked bread yeast in the mix. The taste was also on the flowery/fruity side with a mini-hop bitterness towards the end of each sip.

Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;Sampled this bitter in the Three Judges, Glasgow in February 2004. CXask, handpump dispense. Clear pale copper red in colour with a thin loose white head. Slight malt in the aroma with a juicy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt complexes giving a digestive malt flavour along with a note of redcurrant fruit. Dry hop in the aftertaste giving a faint metallic tang. Finish is malty with dry vinous notes in the mouth. A good session ale.

Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;Cask, South Causey Inn, Stanley, Co Durham. Golden colour with a minimal head.

Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;Cask conditioned at Harbury Beer Fest ’07. Orange gold with white head, hazed. Beer with a big dose of caramel in the flavour and a sweetish toffee note with a chalky powdery feeling. Some malty graininess and a little late bitterness, but certainly not a session bitter of class.
Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;Squashtness is at a minimal here, but he must have been on glue here anyway as its one of the palest beers iv ever had. Excellent condition crystal clear. No aroma at all. Taste is honey with pale malts, lightly bittering pale malts. Easily drinkable but somewhat nothing as a beer.
Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;[Cask at The Three Judges] Clear and golden with a minimal head.

Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;Cask conditioned@ Guide Dog, Soton. Light copper. Some spicy hop and fruit aromas. Lightly sweet with a fruity vinous acidity which although pleasant in darker beers seems slightly misplaced here.
Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Star Inn, Huddersfield 11/03/2006 Golden coloured with some fruit and wheat flavours. Dry on the palate in the finish.
Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;Very interesting, sweet in some way and not squashy at all. The colour is a little dark. But it is still a bitter.
Wylam Hedonist;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wylam Brewery;Although the brewery describes this as a session bitter, the colour is pale yellow and the aroma betrays a very obvious Cascade hop presence, so it is really more like a golden summer ale. Slightly cloudy. Lemon & citrus notes in the aroma as well as aromatic floral elements. However, the palate was very grainy and dull, with murky flavours and just the merest hint of peach in the background. Dull finish. No zing at all. Not in peak condition. Cask (gravity), Cambridge Beer Festival.
Wylam Rocket;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wylam Brewery;Bottle. Traditional stuff. Pours foamy headed amber from the bottle. Soft malty aroma.

Poured into an Abbot Ale badged glass tankard and shared with no one. Lively bit of kit, a huge off-white billowing foam head only allowed me to fill half the glass with beer, copper hue to the clear amber body. Nice blend of flavours and well balanced with neither the hops or malts ruling the brew. Woody, nutty and tasty. Semi-sweet malty molasses vie with the mildly bittering hops for your attention and dance around the mouth in perfect harmony: a great start to my evenings mini rating session.
Wylam Rocket;Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wylam Brewery;Bottle from Darlington railway station. Appearance -dirty honey colour and decent head. Nose - honey, toffee and hazelnuts. Taste - yep praline again, light biscuit bitterness. Palate - light to medium bodied with a creamy yet tangy texture and a tangy and fairly dry finish. Overall - quite complex but slightly sweeter than I’d have made it.

Boat ELB;Castleford, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boat;The last beer of my first day at the GBBF. I had to take a class in ancient Sogdian to read my notes, but I figured out that this beer had dark fruit flavours and a creamy body.

Alchimiste Écossaise;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bière style scotch ale assez sucrée au gouts de cassonade, caramel et levures. Je trouve le gouts des levures choisis pas super pour le style, un peu aqueu et fade. Pour le prix c’est ok.
Alchimiste Écossaise;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Couple of bottles from a tasting box. Pours dark brown with white lacing. Roasted and caramel malt, and some woodish aromas. Lots of sweetness. Kind of messy. Not my thing.

Goût de caramel, de cassonade et de céréales grillées. Aucune amertume perceptible. Bonne bière très facile à boire
Alchimiste Écossaise;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Nous manquons de BRUNES au Québec alors je ne retiens pas mon (petit) enthousiasme pour celle-ci! Bel exemple de brune caramélisé, avec pointe de sucré et amertume bien dosé, couleur ambrée alléchante, assez d'épices pour intrigué. Bel asssemblage des sucres du caramel, fruit confis, malt, pain d'épice et soupcon d'houblon, facile a boire car le sucre arrondit le tout avec sagesse. Bière sans prétention et pas chérante offrant un rapport qualité prix surprenant comme la plupart des bières offerte par Alchimiste.
Alchimiste Écossaise;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bouteille. Léger gushing. Robe ambrée foncée et claire avec un mince voile de mousse. Arômes de noisettes, caramel grillé, léger sucre d’orge, anis et mélasse. En bouche, caramel fade, sucre d’orge, noisettes âcres, vieux houblons herbacés, fruits séchés, raisins rouges. Texture un peu aqueuse et corps mince à moyen. Bonne brune grand public.
Alchimiste Écossaise;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bière brune foncée aux reflets rubis, plutôt limpide, effervescence moyenne, et surmontée d’un col brunâtre étroit, mais tout de même assez dense et persistant. Arômes bien maltée, principalement sucrée, beaucoup de caramel, cassonade, nuances de sirop d’érable, raisin foncé bien mûr voire confit (raisin sec), compote de prune, pruneau… Effluves également un peu rôti, pain grillé et grain rôti, avec notes fumées, tendance tourbe, terre… Nez agréable, intéressant et appétissant, intensité élevée mais complexité plutôt moyenne. En bouche, pétillement plutôt faible sur la langue, onctuosité moyenne au palais. Au goût, pain grillé, grain rôti, caramel, cassonade et fruits foncés (raisin, mais surtout prune/pruneau). Saveur également un peu terreuse, marron, tourbe… Finale de houblon herbacé et feuillu, menant à une amertume bien légère. Bière significativement moins sucrée que ce que le nez laissait croire, et surtout bien moins riche et intense qu’anticiper, impression aqueuse en bouche, c’est décevant considérant le nez qui était si prometteur. Goût correct, complexité et intensité en bouche plutôt faibles… Bière correcte, sans plus…
Alchimiste Écossaise;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;341ml bottle. Clear dark amber body, small beige head with average retention, almost no lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, black currant jam, herb liquor, a touch of leather and some metallic tones. Light tone with a strong mineral note: caramel, dried dark berries, toasted malt. Not the best interpretation of the style.
Alchimiste Écossaise;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Très bof, peu de corps, très aqueuse. Un arome caramel fumé assez perceptible mais sans longueur ou surprise. Une scotch ale très bas de gamme.

En bouche, malt caramélisé, sucre d’orge industriel, confit d’agrumes, houblons nobles, mousse au citron, un peu de saveurs grillées. Fibale plutôt fade. Texture huileuse et corps mince. Une bock très d’entrée de gamme.
Alchimiste Bock de Joliette;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;"Sucre d’orge, caramel, peu de fruits, plutôt mince et surtout, courte en bouche. Une bière qui n’est pas mauvaise, mais qui ne peut remplir les attentes portées par le style et les caractéristiques annoncées. Le corps est trop mince pour le degré d’alcool à mon goût, la finale (inexistante pratiquement) est incapable de balancer un liquide trop sucrée pour ce que le corps est en mesure de soutenir. Du fruit, du houblon, des notes plus grillées; tous des éléments qui auraient pu contribuer à créer un meilleur équilibre."
Alchimiste Bock de Joliette;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bouteille de 341 ml. Couleur cuivré avec un joli col. Arôme de malt, de pain et de caramel brûlé.

Alchimiste Bock de Joliette;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bière orangée un peu brunâtre, moyennement voilée avec quelques particules visibles, effervescence moyenne-bonne, et surmontée d’à peine quelques remous beige en guise de col. Arômes de pain grillé, pâtisserie et sucres mi-foncés (réglisse rouge, sucre d’orge, cassonade, caramel…), avec quelques notes d’érable. Effluves également assez fruité, baies, bleuet, fraise, raisin rouge, prune… mais ça reste «pâteux» comme nez, pâte à fruits… tendance cartonnée même par moment (oxydation?). Enfin, odeurs aussi subtilement herbacé par moment, et même salé… herbes salées… caramel salé… Nez intéressant et agréable, complexité correcte,, intensité plutôt moyenne. En bouche, pétillement assez élevé sur la langue, mais breuvage plutôt mince au palais. Au goût, entrée maltée de pain grillé, pâtisserie st sucres (surtout cassonade), suivi des saveurs fruitées précédemment humées. Même si l’impression pâteuse et cartonnée est moins présente qu’au nez, les saveurs fruitées font tout de même pas mal «pâte à fruits» et «réglisse rouge». Finale plus herbacée, et même feuillue (feuille verte et feuille morte), avec subtil citron, légère acidité, légère amertume… Même si les flaveurs de la bière s’orientent principalement vers le malt et les sucres, le breuvage reste relativement peu sucré et montre un équilibre impressionnant. Complexité correcte, mais, comme au nez, l’intensité en bouche est plutôt moyenne. Bonne bière!
Alchimiste Bock de Joliette;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bière très maltée. De la noix assez présente. Manque de longueur et d’équilibre. Pas 100% convaincu par cette bière.
Alchimiste Bock de Joliette;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Merci à Dominique. Un look doré et sucré. Le liquide est clair et paraît rond dans mon verre à vin. Un nez qui malheureusement me rappelle le beurre et le diacétyle. Très orienté sur le malt - un malt gras et peu soigné, le liquide aurait présenté un quelconque houblonnage que ça ne lui aurait pas fait de mal. Enfin. Ça sent la fermentation et le beurre. Un instant. En y laissant traîner mon nez qui qui ne se lasse de chercher, je décèle un légume vert qui me rappelle le poivron. Est-ce une illusion? Non je ne rêve pas. Il y a bien un poivron vert et/ou du concombre. Ça fait du bien! En bouche le corps est moyen. Les saveurs tournent encore une fois autour du malt et d’un miel surgissant! Peu complexe, cette bière pourrait être bien meilleure si un sérieux houblonnage venait équilibrer le tout.
Henri De Splenter;Dentergem, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Riva Brouwerij (Duvel-Moortgat);Aroma was a bit skunky. Nice looking white head, bread crust like color. Taste unusual also of rye bread crust, hmmm ... Some bitterness.

Big Horn Ned Flanders Red;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Poured a thin red with a white head. Nose was much bigger than the taste. It was of tart berries and spices. Taste was a bit watered down. Not something I would order a second glass of.
Big Horn Ned Flanders Red;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);(TX) Im surprised no one has made the simpsons reference to this style of beer until now. Smelled promising, very fruity with hints of alcohol and yeast. The taste was disappointing, eerily similar to a redhook ESB....except the annoying aftertaste was spicier and longer.
Postel Kerstbier;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);"Tasted as Postel Christmas. Abbey beer with warm bronze colour, creamy head and caramelly and spicy character, with impressions of banana, pear, butterscotch, liquorice, cloves, chocolate, white pepper; malty sweet taste, soft, smooth with mild hop bitterishness and warming alcohol in the finish. Like the other Postel beers, this is actually not bad and well balanced, though very mainstream and stereotypical for its style."

Postel Kerstbier;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);(bottled)From old notes from an October trip to Brussels . Probably the best Christmas beer ive had at 5 am in the morning while intoxicated of my ass !!! My notes say in reflection...Rich of course ...a rather creamy unity of caramel and spicy boozy relentlessness in liquid brown format ...A wave of dry texture slowly breezes in to refresh my palate ... Exactly what I would expect from a Belgian Christmas ale ...
Postel Kerstbier;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);33cl bottle. Deep brown colour, beige head adhesive.

Hyde Park Special Old Bitter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Pours a fairly faint yellow with a thin head and leaves some lacing. Not a lot going on in terms of taste. I was expecting some sort of hop expression but all i got was this astringent thing. Very disapointing!
Hyde Park Special Old Bitter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Location: Draft at the Brewpub, 10/2/10 Aroma: The nose has caramel/toffee malts along with a bit of hops, a fairly light nose Appearance: This one is a clear orange color-red beer with a head that leaves light lace on the glass Flavor: The taste is fairly balanced, subtle, with a light malty sweetness and some hops as well Palate: The body is light to medium, it has an alright mouthfeel, but it thins out a bit as it goes Overall Impression: Overall this reminded me of a something between a simple, standard ESB and a low hop English style IPA. I didn’t love it, but I found it to be sessionable enough to enjoy with my meal.
Hyde Park Special Old Bitter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Tap. Bitter, but very one dimensional. Aroma was weak and focused only on grassy hoppy. Not complex in flavor, just bitter and bland. Not spicy as some bitters.

Hyde Park Special Old Bitter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Rerating this one after about a year and a half, as this was one of the reasons I haven’t been to this place in over a year. Pours a clear caramel brown. Nose is all caramel and toffee, no hops. Sweet caramel and bitterness. Still unexciting. Still not fully attenuated and heavy. Cleaned up a little since the last time, but not great. Original rating: 5/3/4/2/9 On tap. Pours a copper to dark brown color without much head. Smells of burnt malt and little else. Smooth in the mouth, but rather flat, leading into a disappointing finish which elicits the first appearance of anything hoppy or bitter, and not much of it at that. I haven’t had this beer in a while, but I recall years ago it being a much more solid choice. Heck, if it didn’t come out of the tap flat and they just hopped it a bit more it would have picked up an extra half a point.
Hyde Park Special Old Bitter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hyde Park Brewing Company;The beer pours a clear light copper color.

Hyde Park Special Old Bitter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Umm not the best bitter I have tasted, not very bitter or hoppy, but, nice and smooth with soft carbonation. Not bad
Hyde Park Special Old Bitter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hyde Park Brewing Company;I wasn’t going to rate this beer because I believed what I received was not representative of what the brewmaster intended. However, after sending it back as undrinkable I was told by the waitress that 4 other people has tasted it and that 3 of those people made a face while the front end manager said the beer was supposed to taste the way it did. It tasted like it was brewed in a dirty diaper pail. There was a bit of a sour flavor up front and a diaper pail aftertaste. The beer looked nice and there was some lacing from the few sips I had. I feel that there was a problem with the yeast. Beyond that the beer was bitter, but had no flavor from the middle addition of hops nor any hop aroma. A very poor effort that should be poured down the sewer.
Hyde Park Special Old Bitter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Very low, sweet, soapy, floral, lavender aroma. Clear copper coloured body is topped by a fine bubbled white head. Mildly bitter floral, soapy hops with stale notes of cardboard. Medium light body with soft carbonation.

Liefmans Cassis;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Pours a purple black colour with a very bubbly short lasting puple-reddish head. Aroma of cassis indeed with a good sweetness and sourness. the flavour has planety of cassis, sweetness, nice sourness. Sweet and sour fruity dry finish. Very fruity beer indeed!
Liefmans Cassis;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Beer #3 at Croydon Draught Belgian Beer Festival. One of the murkiest, muddiest looking beers I’ve ever had on draught. And pink mud is a very odd appearance indeed. The cassis is very pronounced, with cough sweets and pear drops. Maybe something a little clammy in the aroma. Juicy and fruity, but a bit sweet and simple. Like other Liefmans fruit beers, there seems something a little synthetic about the fruit to me. There’s a touch of late sharpness, but not really enough to temper the sweetness. Despite misgivings, I still found myself enjoying this.
Liefmans Cassis;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Draught@The Belgian Draught Beer Festival, Croydon, London. Sweet cough lolly like sweetness. Obvious cassis characters. Some tart sourness makes this at least bearable to drink. Otherwise this was a little too sweet.
Liefmans Cassis;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Draught: Cloudy mud brown, with a tan head. Strepsil? Cough lolly aroma. Sweet blackcurrant all the way through. A little dry and slightly tart in the finish. Medium bodied, perfectly drinkable though a bit unbalanced.
Liefmans Cassis;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);500 ml bottle, imported and doubtless left on the shelf awaiting me for a good long while. Nose is like a batch of blackberry's that have set in the cellar too long--a bit musty with an acidic wang on the backend. Nice effervesence and a nice, light purple/pink head of fine bubbles. The first taste is tame for a lambic--the sour pucker is not quite equalled by the fruity berry flavor of the currants. The palate of this lambic isn't fresh and crisp as it should be--perhaps due to too long on the shelf, or perhaps not. In any case, this is a nce sparkling fruit beer that makes for a nice apertif. I prefer Kriek and Framboise at this point.
Liefmans Cassis;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);[Draught at The White Horse, Parson's Green, London] This really gives you suberb refreshment. Very natural and flavourful with a great balance between the sweetness and the acidic notes. I love it.

Liefmans Cassis;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);the white hoss seems to be the only place you can get this stuff. basically liefmans kriek - cherries +ribena = cassis. the blackcurrant stuff is tasty enough, but the brown ale base is what i really like - beautiful, subtle blend of sourness, wood and malt. good stuff.

Worthington 1744;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);The head is quickly disappearing. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of fruit, and I sense a light bitterness on the middle of the tongue, that last throughout the finish. OK, but definitely not a beer that will be remembered....
Worthington 1744;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);Not a bad beer by any means, but not particularly interesting. Poured crystal clear orange-brown with a decent sized head. Initial salty vegemite aroma that, once settled, transformed to a weak caramel and even weaker roasted malt. Fairly bland flavour, with not much bitterness to speak of - that was surprising - just some sugary sweetness. Thin bodied with a good carbonation level, the palate was in thread with the rest of the beer’s characteristics.
Worthington 1744;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);Attractive gingery colour. Otherwise, its a fairly nondescript beer with gentle, yet insistent bitterness, soft malt and a touch of toffee (once it warmed to room temp). Not much aroma. Worthy, but a bit dull. 500ml bottle from Safeway.
Worthington 1744;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);Jan 2005 - Some earthy aroma notes with sweet malt and hops. Clear red-brown colour and reasonable head. Easy drinking malt flavour but a bit too simplistic. Tangy bitterness and a bit of a light finish.
Worthington 1744;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);50 cl bottle. Dark copper with white head with not too impressive durability. Aroma has caramel and is a bit metallic. Smooth flavor without bitterness, making it a bit boring. The flavor is dominated by caramel with some slight roast. Pleasant carbonation, but watery mouth feel.
Worthington 1744;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);Tasted a little after it’s use-by date, but it didn’t seem to matter as it turned out to be a very disappointing and undemanding little bitter, that fell into the take-over/profit revolution, sadly seen in a lot of the U.K.’s ’once proud’ breweries. Pours a clear deep amber with a short dense off-white head, that gave reasonable length and lace. Musty, dry and a little earthy in the aroma, faintly hinting at stale hops. Quite dry, also, in the mouth with a light roasted grain and burnt sugar palate and a little caramel sweetness upfront as it warmed. Medium carbonation and medium-light in mouth feel, it started off alright, but became quite boring and one dimensional by the end. Without quoting ’Highlandlad’ too much, it was just another forgettable U.K. Bitter with a proud heritage written on the label and not in the beer itself. Bastard pasteurisation!!!
Worthington 1744;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);Disappointing pasteurised English bitter. Poured a plummy amber colour with a 1.5cm lacing head. Aroma was initially tart and fruity (sour plums) but developed some caramel malt and nutty notes. Thin in the body, moderately carbonated, with a well balanced finish. Drab pasteurised boiled flavour smothers any subtlety this might have. Mildly fruity. Flavour is mainly caramel malt. A thoroughly forgettable brew. (500ml bottle, Camperdown Cellars)

Hofbrauhaus German Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Amerisports Brew Pub at Ameristar Casino;The first thing I noticed about this beer was the glass it's served in! It was like a shallow bowl with a horn-like shape coming out of it. Very unusual for a brewer in Kansas City to serve out of obscure glasses. Anyway, this beer reminded me quite a lot of a Belgian witbier. It has a light, wheat-malt aroma, with unmistakable citrus (orange) and coriander. Very nice lacing and head. Medium golden-orange in color, this beer is really quite attractive. Spicy, sweet, orangey and coriander profile, with some light spicy hop flavor. Finishes mostly sweet and malty, aftertaste is all spice and citrus. Very soft palate/body, creamy carbonation. Tasty, but rather one-dimensional.

Mishawaka Wall Street Wheat Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle. Wheaten, lightly chalky aroma with yeast and strong lemon overtones. A touch grainy. Pretty pour, golden with a lacing, creamy, rocky white head. Lemon and lemon cleaner taste with light pretzel dough. Medium tartness. Fullish body, crisp and prickly, slightly oily mf with a slightly artificial lemon and wheat finish. No real contribution from the hops. Does not mesh.
Mishawaka Wall Street Wheat Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle: This looks okay, a golden yellow body with a decently sized head, but it smell like a freshly opened box of Wheaties with some lemon juice squirted in. You can taste the wheat and a little sweet malt, but the lemony flavor increases and gathers at the back of the throat. Rather uninspired rendition of a style that doesn’t thrill me too much to begin with. Pat’s Liquors, Porter, IN
Mishawaka Wall Street Wheat Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Mishawaka Brewing Company;This bottled brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of finely sized white colored bubbles that was long lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated orange brown colored body and a good lacing. The mild aroma was wheat and dough. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of tingly wheat and mild malt. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again. This one goes down easily! Very drinkble.

Joh. Albrecht (Hamburg) Hefeweizen;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauhaus Joh. Albrecht Hamburg;Tap at the brewery. The whitest weizen i've ever seen so far, a weird very pale milky yellow, thick yeast suspension, foamy white head which collapses after a while but carbonation keeps a layer. It looks like pineapple juice with milk, huh. Taste is super citrusy, lemon everywhere with classic wheat and banana tones, in the finish an unexpected note of almond and nuts comes our. Relatively thick texture, super strong carbonation, watery texture. Taste sour. Finish is lemony, dry, with almond spirit, refreshing, nice. I like the fact weizens develop a citrusy flavour but it can't be this strong, I suspect they added some lemonade... hopefully not. Quite surprised by this, quite original.

Dark ruby highlights and a thin grayish filmy rim. Nice big dark roasty smoky and salty nose. Creamy medium body with very pleasant medium carb. Smoky, earthy, slightly salty mid-palate. Long earthy finish. This is a very forward, aggressive dunkel, you might say Americanized, with plenty of carb, flavor, and aroma. Drinks very easily and has copious amounts of flavor for 4.5%. Kind of glad I wasn’t prejudiced by walking into a casino and trying this; it’s much better than I might have been inclined to think in such a setting."

Brewer's Alley Trinity Stout;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;Had on cask at the brewpub, served at about room temperature. The beer had a big spicy and roasty aroma of chocolate, coffee, and caramel malt, a bit of grainy and earthy hops too. It was a dark brown-black color with a creamy, dark tan head that had fairly good retention and size. The flavor was pretty sweet, slightly spicy and lively, and the chocolate and coffee tastes were detectable. It had a very creamy palate, and was very wet and full, with a lower amount of carbonation. It’s a good beer, I think if it was chilled a little more it would help with this beer, but it did have a lot of character.

Solid tan, gold, copper slight color, a nice pale ale spriti to begin with. Taste is malty sweet as it could only be the malts that transpire this amber rush of greatness. there is a flatness to it though, which had me second guessing the brillance of a good brew. Hops bounce around like chickens on a trampoline and hit the pallate subsideingly like a dump truck going 48 on a freeway. A solid, average pale ale here from good old greenfield.

De Graal Speciale;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Graal;Another addition to the Graal range, since 2007. Creamy, moussy, light beige head, colour a deep, misty bronze. Sweetish aroma of pear, caramel, chocolate, pepper, yeast, cinnamon, dates, flowers. Sweetish fruity taste, soft caramelly and chocolatey maltiness, bit nutty, typical Graal yeasty spiciness, ending in a mild, herbal, flowery hoppiness with a glow of warming alcohol. Very decent and pretty well-balanced without being world class, like most De Graal beers.
De Graal Speciale;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Graal;pours a semi-clear maroon with a small beige head that dissipates, and some lacing. smell is of wild yeast, dark fruits, and a touch of caramel. taste is of dark fruits, some caramel, a little cocoa, and wild yeast. ends slightly tart.
De Graal Speciale;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Graal;14-Mar-12 (750-ml bottle) This dark Belgian ale has an extremely complex, intriguing, and enticing nose. It’s very fruity, malty, and candy-like, with prominent aromas of fig, date, and raisin, but also toffee, brown sugar, caramel candy, treacle, clove, nutmeg, aged wood, leather, nut shells, dust, and old books. Unfortunately, the beer doesn’t taste nearly as complex or enjoyable as the aroma suggests. It’s still quite fruity, again with the not-uncommon trio of fig, date, and raisin, plus some red apple, and the sweeter elements such as brown sugar, holiday spices, and caramel are also present, but apple skins and the slightly roasty, woody, dusty, and vinous aspects are strong throughout, but especially dominate the finish, creating a rather bleak and dreary final impression. There’s also a noticeable suggestion of hard alcohol that doesn’t help either. It’s full bodied on the palate and delivers moderate carbonation, but despite the suggestion of sweetness from various flavors, the mouthfeel is actually quite dry. The beer pours a hazy, amber-brown body capped by half an inch of tan-colored head that recedes to a thin ring. Overall, it’s an interesting beer, but the nose is the absolute high point. Too bad the beer doesn’t taste as good as it smells.
De Graal Speciale;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Graal;"From a bottle which gushed the beer pours a crimson color with a medium tight head. The aroma is musty and nutty with some fig and rotting leaf notes. The flavor is malty and for lack of a better term ""rustic"". Lots of fig character is displayed here without being overly sweet, in fact it finishes dry and has light peppery and roasty notes throughout. On all accounts a very enjoyable beer."

De Graal Blond;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Pas réellement une réussite cette De Graal Blonde. Côté arômes nous sommes sur du relativement classique, coriandre, céréales/pain, miel et agrumes. Mais c’est sur l’équilibre qu’elle pêche et une ligne plutôt brouillonne. En verre blond légèrement voilé (EBC aux alentours de 20) avec un mousse blanche de 3 mm, donc rien d’exceptionnel. Le nez est classique et appréciable sur la coriandre, le pan, le miel et les agrumes. A la dégustation, nous sommes moins heureux : acidité présente laissant révéler des arômes de citron et coriandre et petit côté plastique pas agréable. La deuxième bouche est légèrement plus équilibrée laissant s’exprimer davantage le fruit (agrumes/pomme/pêche) mais avec une arrière bouche brouillon, encore portée sur l’acidité. Le final allie acidité et amertume avec des épices dominant l’ensemble. De Graal sait faire mieux.

De Graal Blond;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Flaska från Saveur-bier. Gyllenfärgad, lätt disig, lågt skum. Söt och ganska kryddig doft med lite söt frukt i bakgrunden. I grunden en söt blond med lätt kropp, lite som en lättare variant av Duvel med söta fruktiga inslag, söta päron, äpplen, apelsinskal och druvor. På det en rejäl kryddighet med pors, malört, koriander som kanske är lite väl tilltagen. Men annars ett trevlig belgare.

Smaak: moutig, kaneel, gember, kruidig, fruitig, bloemig, Mondgevoel: middelmatig met gemiddeld koolzuur. Totaal: Aanvankelijk typische Belgische Ale, maar met een onderliggende kruidigheid veroorzaakt door de gember. Na een tijdje is er een milde maar onderscheidende smaak van gember, zeker niet te veel. Nogal een interessant en goed gemaakt brouwsel.
De Graal Gember;Brakel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;De Graal;Golden with a very light haze, white head. The first impression is that of a typical Belgian Ale, but with an underlying spicyness caused by the ginger. Just after a while there is a mild but distinctive taste of ginger, yet not too much. Quite an interesting and well crafted brew.
De Graal Gember;Brakel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;De Graal;Trotz des ordentlichen Alkoholgehaltes kommt dieses Bier (im Vergleich zu anderen belgischen Starkbieren) eher mild herüber.

De Graal Gember;Brakel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;De Graal;Déception avec cette De Graal Gember qui manque d'équilibre et de structuration. Robe blond doré voilé (EBC aux alentours de 17) surmontée d'une mousse blanche de 8 mm d'épaisseur. Nez pas exceptionnel avec orange, gingembre, citronnelle, céréales, un brin acidulé et avec un petit côté plastique. L'attaque est également acidulée et toujours avec ce petit goût de plastique avec, en complément du miel, du gingembre et des agrumes. Pas réellement équilibré. La deuxième bouche voit l'amertume et l'acidité monter en intensité avec un gingembre qui devient plus présent. L'arrière, linéaire reste peu équilibrée. La troisième bouche est la plus appréciable, sur un bon équilibre aromatique et un gingembre très bien intégré. Le final, peu intéressant, ne continue malheureusement pas sur la lancée. Trop court, retrouvant l'acidité avec des arômes de citron et gingembre. L'alcool, pourtant à 8% Abv, ne structure pas assez la bière et le sucre quant à lui est légèrement surdosé. Dans le genre, on fait mieux.

Arômes de malt cara, toffee, et une fantastique bière luxembourgeoise maltée dont j'avais fait mon dada pendant une période de ma vie. 1ère bouche souple, précise, sur toffee et butterscotch. Arrière-bouche fine, nette, à l'amertume stylée. 2ème bouche équilibrée, au style festif indiscutable.

La Hervoise;Hombourg, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie Grain d'Orge;Gekocht op 16-08-2018 bij Dranken Geers in Oostakker. En thuis geproefd op 24-11-2018. La Hervoise wordt verdeelt door SA Corman-Collins in Battice en is een wazig donker-bruin biertje dat maar weinig beige schuim maakt bij het uitschenken. Het heeft een romig tot moussige structuur en het blijft wel op een normale manier aan het glas kleven. Pareling kan je zeer moeilijk zien wegens de donkere kleur van het bier. Het schuim zakt vlug in elkaar en na een tijdje blijft er slechts een zeer dun fijn laagje over. Het aroma is karamel-zoet met wat citrus, vanille en een hout-toets. De smaak is karamel zoet en karamel-moutig. In de mond toont La Hervoise een volle body met een ietwat olieachtige textuur en toch ook prikkelend koolzuurgas. Een eerder complex biertje. De nasmaak is wat plakkerig en vloeit lang uit, is wat hop-bitterig en zoetig met hier toch wel wat peer en ook koffie-mout en een heel licht droogje. Een leuk biertje gebrouwen met siroop op basis van appelen en peren maar dit heb ik met enige moeite slechts in de nasmaak waargenomen. Foto's en wat info vind je op: http://www.beersfrombelgium.eu/nl/La_Hervoise-b-528.html

Bouche également fruitée sur des saveurs de poires et de fraises, amertume agréable avec de houblons herbeux et épicés. Longueur moyenne mais amertume durable, les notes de fruits restent quand même bien en bouche, corps dense limite liquoreux, bonne carbo, alcool qui chauffe les oreilles. Belle surprise, méfiant habituellement quant à l'ajout de sirop dans la bière, on a ici un bel équilibre entre l'amertume de la bière, le sucre et le côté fruité du sirop de Herve !

RCH PG Steam;Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Bitter and dry but very malty flavour. Not so much a floral aroma, in fact tastes like most if not all of its complexity must originate from the choice of grains and fermentables, not a variety of hops. Takes a while to unfold in its full complexity. Due to the high bitterness it takes some effort to get through all if the layers.

Elevator Hubris Vienna-Style Amber Lager;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Elevator Brewing Company;7/19/2007: Elevator XTRA Kölsch is a pretty mild Vienna-style Lager.

The brew is a ruby copper. The tall beige head is mostly lasting and leaves light lace. The huge toasty flavor is slightly sweet & roasted. The finish is long and subtly smokey. The medium soft body is creamy. Very interesting.
Elevator Hubris Vienna-Style Amber Lager;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Elevator Brewing Company;Amber color with a small beige head. Toasted malt aroma. Malty flavor with a slight amount of bitterness.
Elevator Hubris Vienna-Style Amber Lager;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Elevator Brewing Company;Nice amber color with a thin head. Not a spectacular aroma. nicely and slightly bitter. medium thin body. crisp aftertaste. Reminiscent of Murphy's Irish Amber.
Elevator Hubris Vienna-Style Amber Lager;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Elevator Brewing Company;A very good amber color to it. Not a bad beer...............................
Elevator Hubris Vienna-Style Amber Lager;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Elevator Brewing Company;A little on the syrupy side for me. Strong sweet flavor. I couldn't drink a whole glass in a reasonable amount of time.
Elevator Hubris Vienna-Style Amber Lager;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Elevator Brewing Company;Me: Do you have any seasonal beers? Waiter: Yes, we have a Vienna-Style Amber Lager. Me: That sounds good, I'll have that. Waiter: Here you go. Me: By the way, what do you call this beer? Waiter: Vienna-Style Amber Lager. Me: No, I mean what is the name of it. Waiter: Vienna-Style Amber Lager. Me: Oh... I didn't like this one as much as Great Lakes' Eliot Ness but it was still a good seasonal from the Elevator. Lack of creativity in naming it aside, it was not a bad beer at all. Dark amber color with medium bone white head and rather sticky lacing. Sweet malty aroma. Flavor was sweet and a little syrupy. I'll get this one again next year.
Streets of New York Skyline Stout;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Streets of New York Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Opaque black color. Head was tan, lasted a while, and left some lace on the glass. Aroma was of milk chocolate, vanilla, and subdued coffee. Smooth on the tongue with vanilla, roasted malt, and a touch of smoke.
Streets of New York Skyline Stout;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Streets of New York Brewery;This beer has a wispy full tan to light brown colored head that sits atop a deep-dark amber-brown to black beer that is somewhat hazy. It shows amber highlights when held up to the light. The aroma has strong notes of coffee, lightly roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is sweet with a solid chocolate note, and finishes off with a smooth, roasty, light bitterness. This is quite quaffable and pretty tasty, I would be happy to drink a couple pints of this. There is some fruitiness here (I get notes of raisin and fig) as well as a hint of vegetal character in the finish.
Streets of New York Skyline Stout;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Streets of New York Brewery;Didn’t get much of anything from this sample so had full glass. Good thing I did. Best beer of the day. Black body with tan creamy head and real good lacing. Good chocolate aroma with some light coffee. Rich chocolate roasted flavor to it.
Streets of New York Skyline Stout;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Streets of New York Brewery;Black with a nice thick head with a roasty malt, chocolate and coffee aroma. Flavor is rich and creamy with a heavy roasty finish.
Streets of New York Skyline Stout;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Streets of New York Brewery;"Great bar, but this is one bad beer. Easily the worst Stout I've ever tried. It has a creamy, buttery aroma, which certainly is not what one would expect from a stout. Light tan head, dark body; at least it looked the part. The beer was sour and undrinkable. The other two beers I had there, IPA and Central Park Pale Ale, were both excellent. So, either they don't know how to make Stouts, or somebody screwed up badly on this one."
Streets of New York Central Park Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Streets of New York Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Slightly hazy orange color with a lasting white head that laced the glass. Attractive buttery caramel and flowery hop aroma. Flavor was dominated by flowery hop and was accompanied by mild hop bitterness.
Streets of New York Central Park Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Streets of New York Brewery;12 oz glass at the brewery. Citric, fruity aroma with some cereal and grainy notes present. No hops really detected. Not much going on. Perhaps the ugliest beer I have EVER seen. Opaque, murky, orange-yellow color with no head at all. This seriously looks REALLY wrong. Sweet, sugary, fruity start with some graininess and faint hops to finish. There is absolutley no carbonation present. I think they fucked up and served me some wort.
Streets of New York Central Park Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Streets of New York Brewery;"This beer is quite clear with a pretty copper color and a wispy pale tan colored head. The aroma is lightly citrusy with a hint of diacetyl that slowly becomes more evident with time. The taste is a mix of flavors dominated by the diacetyl and a weird phenolic, sharp flavor that is sort of like burnt plastic. Oh yeah, there are some beer-like notes too; I get a hint of malty caramel, a wisp of spicy, citrusy hops and a very light bitterness in the finish. The off flavors do not make this undrinkable, but this is certainly not worth having more of."
Streets of New York Central Park Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Streets of New York Brewery;A darker shade of gold. White head and some lacing. Not much to the aroma. Flavor was heavy on the palate and kind of bland. Didn’t have that hop bite.
Streets of New York Central Park Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Streets of New York Brewery;On tap at Streets of new york. Mesa Poured copper amber with small head an heavy sticky lacing. Light aroma of malt and hops. Body was a bit watery with the flavor of malt and hops. Refreshing summer beer.
Streets of New York Central Park Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Streets of New York Brewery;"No aroma to speak of. Thinnish head, deep amber. Good lace. Nothing special about the appearance. Strong malt hides behind the even stronger hops. Very good IPA; strong and satisfying."
Streets of New York India Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Streets of New York Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Clear orange color with an off white head that laced the glass. Smelled of malty caramel and light flowery hops. Mild hop bitterness, but not much hop flavor. Minimal malty caramel flavor with a woody hickory note.
Streets of New York India Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Streets of New York Brewery;Medium amber color with no foam. Light sweet grassy, grainy nose. Light sweet caramel start with a light citrus hop bitterness in the finish. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Pretty tame for an IPA.
Streets of New York India Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Streets of New York Brewery;Small 2 ounce sample at the brewpub--see my place rating for you to realize why. More of an earthy/floral bitter aroma with a little sweet maltiness with some pine aroma as well. Mildly hazy honey-orangeish color with frothy off-yellowish head and nice lacing. Citrus hoppiness to start with grapefruit notes. Malts are very light. Just a grapefruit monster with lingering hopped dryness. Needs more malt backbone.
Streets of New York India Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Streets of New York Brewery;This beer is lightly hazy and is a full copper color with amber hints to it. The head is wispy and wan with a pale tan color to it. The aroma is strangely lacking, perhaps a bit of herbal hops, plus a subtle note of grapefruit. The taste has quite a bit more bitterness than I was expecting from the bland nose. The bitterness and the carbonation combine to give this beer a spritzy quality. There is a bit of caramel like maltiness here, as well as a hint of spicy, citrus hop flavor and some fruitiness, but mostly the bitterness is noticeable. This is quaffable and clean, and I like this as a session brew.
Streets of New York India Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Streets of New York Brewery;Copper amber with a big thick head and lacing that hangs on the pint glass. Aroma is all hops and citrus with a good hops and citrus flavor that stayed long on the palate. A good medium strength, easy drinking IPA
Streets of New York India Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Streets of New York Brewery;2005 Great Arizona Beer Festival sample 8oz. Nice amber color to the body. Hoppy aroma. Had detected a citrus flavor in this beer. Good easy finish.
Streets of New York India Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Streets of New York Brewery;I had this at the Great Arizona Beer Festival in Phoenix. A very nicely hopped IPA.
Streets of New York India Pale Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;IPA;Streets of New York Brewery;"Floral and malty aroma. Thin head, dark amber body, good lace. Somehow it was lacking that ""drink me"" look, however. Very hoppy. Rich and full-bodied. A very solid pale ale. I would drink it all night, but based upon the sketchy service at the Scottsdale (Shea) location, it might have taken me all night just to catch a buzz!"
Colorado Brewing Vienna Lager;Danbury, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Colorado Brewing and Trading Co.;Clear amber with a thin light tan head. Light carbonation. Clean, crisp smooth and malty sweet. Some citrus elements as well. Medium light body. Sharp and tingly. Well lagered. Toasted caramel coated popcorn flavors emerge as it warms. Good session brew.
Colorado Brewing Wheat Me;Danbury, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Colorado Brewing and Trading Co.;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. Undated review: This was a golden beer with a white head (actual name was slightly different). The beer smelled like dust and sweet. It tasted very hoppy in a good way.
Colorado Brewing Wheat Me;Danbury, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Colorado Brewing and Trading Co.;Hazy amber with a sticky light tan head. Slow carbonation. Huge hop nose. Hoppy, citric and lush with bushy hop notes. Mellow body. Medium natured. Alcohol tasted in wisps. Dangerous with loads of Cascade hops and wheat malts for supreme drinkability. Surprised me with the amount of hops in this one.
Bulldog Double Chocolate Porter;Fresno, California, United States;Porter;Bulldog Brewing Company (CA);GABF 2003. Poured very dark red with nice tan head. Aromas of coffee and chocolate. Sweet and warm mouthfeel. Very nice.
Bulldog Double Chocolate Porter;Fresno, California, United States;Porter;Bulldog Brewing Company (CA);Nice dark brown color. Way too much chocolate in the aroma and flavor for me, but a nice beer in general. The feel was too watery, thin. I think the strong aroma had me expecting the body of a stout instead of a porter.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;A clearish orange-yellow, white cover. Aroma is lemony, borderline citrus, and crackery malt with a crystal twang. Taste is similar, solid malt backing and a good hop taste, light bittering finish.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Pours amber with white head. Nice caramel nose. Same for flavor with a mild bitter and some grassy notes.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Draft. Pours golden orange with a white head. Sweet malty aroma with floral hops. Similar flavor, sweet malts, floral hops, and a very light buttery notes. Not awful, but not great either.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;This one pour a clear amber color with an off white head. Aroma was some stale malt, and fresh triple C hops. Flavor was nice fresh hops but extremely watered down. Tasted like water with hops crushed in it. If this had some body too it, it would be pretty decent.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Medium gold, thin white chainmail head. Faint classic aroma. Lemony, not bitter, a bit briny. Not outstanding or distinctive, but a servicable session beer.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;On tap at the Pittsburgh Rock Bottom. Has some hoppy aroma and a slight hint of vinegar smell. It is a bit floral and fruity too. Has the ubiquitous appearance of american pale yellow lager. This tries to come on like an IPA but it never quite gets there. More well behaved and mannered. Easier to drink and appreciate compared to an IPA. This stuff is OK considering I don’t like hopped brews and it is not offensive. If you like hops, this may be less than you would expect for the style. Taste is as mild as the lumpy dog, pretty fruity and flowery. They also offer a cask edition that is dry hopped. and you can tell it is.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;A blah pale ale. My first ever visit to this place, I was expecting a lot more. Aroma was weak hops. Pour was a clear orange with no head. Taste was malty and syrupy with hops in the background. Not much of an aftertaste.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;On tap in Pittsburgh. Yellow amber with white head. Aroma is faint citrus and floral. Flavor is apricot, hops, floral, and wheat. On the mild side.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Not that great. I’ve had a lot of the rock bottom beers, most of which I dont see listed here. but this was certainly one of the better ones. this place really just doesnt seem to make beer that well for a restaurant who’s entire marketing scheme is targeted toward their beer making ability. The first time I went to this restuarant I could tell i was getting ripped off. I still go there cause they have great food, a lot of which is made with their beer. I just suggest saving your money and getting a water instead of an overpriced and unfulfilling homebrewed beer. The pesto pizza and sausage soaked beer pizza is highly recommended.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Stacks Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;A good balance of malt and hops. A bit on the citrus/grapefruit side, which is where an APA should be. Appeals to the Rock Bottom crowd.
Titletown Weizen Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Titletown Brewing Company;This is a *huge* beer in every way - flavor, appearance, ABV. Might be the best Titletown offering yet.
Golden Valley Indian Trail IPA;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA;Golden Valley Brewery;RAM Restaurant. Clear yellow, white lacing foam head. Barley aroma, bitter taste with citrus tones. Taste is staying quite long. (Chicago 201510)
Golden Valley Indian Trail IPA;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA;Golden Valley Brewery;"Aroma is very light with hoppy/lemon tones. Color is a hazy copper with an average but ""busy"" head. Flavor features a fruity/hop character with very light malt support--light citrus accent in the medium-dry finish...Body is moderately light, as is the carbonation, which makes for a nice overall smoothness...In sum, this is a tasty brew but lacking some balance and body due to the light malt influence."
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;"Better Kölsch than in Cologne. On tap at Bryce Canyon Lodge; refreshing with some bitterness as added bonus."
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;12 oz. can, poured into a frosted mug at the Bryce Canyon Pines Restaurant. Pale yellow color, with a big, frothy, white head. The nose is hay, lemon peel, white bread, light pine, and dust. Sweet and malty, with a bit of bitterness. Light body, with a watery, thin, lightly acidic mouthfeel. This is a weak and thin kölsch. Refreshing, but not that tasty.
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;Another great and refreshing beer from Uinta Brewing Co. Pours a clear golden and has a slightly bitter taste. Overall, very good.
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Pours clear pale gold with a creamy white head and lots of lacing. Tastes like sweet corn, grassy hops, straw, creamy wheat, and some lemon. Light body and low/medium carbonation. Smells like citrus creamy wheat, corn, lemon, get grassy hops, and straw.
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;Bottle. Yellow pour, with a white head. Watery, light, biscuity/bready, mild grassiness, and a bit sweet. Boring, but drinkable.
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;Not much aroma. Light and refreshing. Great Caramel notes. Just something I can’t describe that I really like. First kolsch. Beautiful glass a beer. Upgrading my sample to a pint
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;Cloudy and murky golden with a medium rocky white head. Bready and toasty German blonde grains on the nose with a wee kiss of grassy dry bitterness. Smooth and lasting delightful flavor that’s German blonde and grainy, a were touch grassy, crisp and dry yet lingering with just the right amount of lightly toasted bread.
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;This brew was highly carbonated and of a peach tea hue, with small islands of head. Sweet, toasty cereal grain nose that creates and enticing presence. The body is likewise toasty and of sweet cereal grains and caramel/crystal malting. Not a hop cone to be sensed anywhere. The flavor is much like fresh wort--as it seems rather underattenuated. It’s almost like drinking Kellogs Corn Flakes.
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;On tap @ Uinta. Dark golden pour with a nice white head. There’s a nice biscuity and almost doughy/cake batter thing to it. Perhaps a bit sweeter than I’d normally like in a Kolsch, but not bad. Some light grassy hop character, a touch of apple esters, and lemon peel. Light bitterness on the back end. Decent enough.
Uinta Hoodoo Kölsch;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Uinta Brewing Company;Golden pour with 1-finger white head and lacing. Bready/cereal, bit of a lemon note. Not very good, pretty bland. Disappointing.

Ryburn Numpty Bitter;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ryburn Brewery;Cask handpull at County Hotel, JDW, Ashford. Reddish brown colour with thick lasting cream head. Rich biscuity caramel throughout. Hop finish kind of balances the sweetness of the caramel and there is some green apple as well. There is nothing to hold the whole thing together it lacks cohesiveness.
Ryburn Numpty Bitter;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ryburn Brewery;Beer Engine: Dark brown orange with minimal head. . . deep malty aroma - reminds me of Kalamazoo Bells malt. . . soft sweet, chewy caramel.

Ryburn Numpty Bitter;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ryburn Brewery;Plain bitter. Pretty standard amber-red appearance with a bit of an irregular head. Mild aroma, slightly buttery with a suggestion of popcorn. Watery palate, relieved by only a faint hint of life later in the finish. Lacking support, some maltiness but weak. (on tap, Willow Walk [Weatherspoons], London)

Mammoth Gold;Mammoth Lakes, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mammoth Brewing Company;12oz bottle @Ole Bridge Bar Reno-pours a white head and gold color. Aroma is grassy, light/medium malt. Taste is grassy/spice hops, light/medium malt with some sweet.
Mammoth Gold;Mammoth Lakes, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mammoth Brewing Company;I’m not really a fan of lighter beers, and this certainly falls into that category. The aroma was practically non-existent as well, which was disappointing.
Mammoth Gold;Mammoth Lakes, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mammoth Brewing Company;Bottle. Very light citrus aroma. Thin to medium body with mild carbonation. Flavor is light malt and mild citrus and grassy hop. The finish is actually grassy in a dry way. It’s mild, but flavorful. The grassiness gets a bit over the edge, but it is flavorful. I doubt that Mammoth can make an unpleasant product. The grassiness makes this a substantial, compared to most Kolsches, ale. Very drinkable.

Mammoth Gold;Mammoth Lakes, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mammoth Brewing Company;White head on top of a clear yellow. Not a whole lot of aroma. Some malt sweetness and mild hoppiness. Carbonated on the palate. Pleasant after a day of boarding but nothing special.
Mammoth Gold;Mammoth Lakes, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mammoth Brewing Company;Aroma is slightly sweet bready malt, similar to a pilsner more or less. Pours yellow gold with a small velvetty head. Flavor is sweet bready and mildly fruity malt. There is some citrus hop presence, but it is mild. A malty sugary mouthfeel lingers, as well as some gentle spiciness. Definitley smooth and drinkable, but like the last rater said, it does seem a little heavy for the style. Definitley the heaviest beer I have had tonight.
Mammoth Gold;Mammoth Lakes, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Mammoth Brewing Company;Light aroma, a little funk. Has a spice taste to it but I can’t quite place it. A bit heavy for the style, but mostly pretty decent.

Black Isle Organic Scotch Ale (4.5%);Munlochy, Ross & Cromarty, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Black Isle Brewing;330ml bottle. A nice Scotch ale, but there are better examples like Traquair. Aroma has a very slight lemon-like freshness to it which may be from late addition hops. Colour is a reddish chestnut brown. Taste has a reasonable amount of malt for the ABV, but I would prefer it to be more viscous as some are. Sweetness is about right and the hoppiness too. Maybe this bottle could benefit from a little ageing. Overall quite enjoyable.

Elle est ainsi une bière à deux brasseurs, comme pas mal de belges … Niveau abv de 6,5 %, définie comme une ambrée naturelle avec épices. Mon exemplaire était à 17 mois avant sa date. Couleur ambré cuivré, avec un léger voile. Bulles fines, en fontaine centrale, virevoltantes. Mousse beige, soyeuse, stable à 3 mm.

Smaak is licht zoet en licht bitter, met wat caramel. Valt echter wat tegen omdat er weinig nuances overheersen, zeker na de eerste visuele indruk.

La Ferme Au Chene Marckloff;Durbuy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brasserie La Ferme Au Chene;(Bottle, 0.75 l, at One Pint Pub, 20150516) The beer poured deep amber and cloudy.

Flavours were malts, sweetness, spiciness, clove, Belgian style yeast and bitterness. Aftertaste was sweet and bitter. A clean, sweet and spicy brew. Nothing impressive though.

Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;"***REVIEW FROM JAN 20, 2007*** This is a bit run on, but I thought this to be humorous enough to share. From the website: ""Alfa Brouwerij is the only Dutch brewery to extract its brewing water from a spring certified by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport"" .....there’s more..... ""Aunt Wies, who has been living at the brewery since 1913, is still tasting the filled beer every morning. No bottle leaves our brewery without her approval!"" bahahhha killer! My beer has been approved by someone who can only taste food if it is covered in salt.....here’s my review: Expect nothing but your average Euro brew. Beer is weak pee gold with so much crap floating in in you’d swear that you got a pint poured out of terribly mouldy lines. Instantly created a monster rocky white cap that managed to dissipate to near to nothing. Every swish does produce lots of spotty lacing. Aroma is quite refreshing actually. Lemon hits first and then is followed by dry grass and yeast. The lemon is pretty good actually! Taste is off a bit, but nothing bad - just something a bit different. You’ll still find the usual yeast and dryness with grass and an odd strong bitterness that does not quite fit in but does distinguish this beer as not totally run of the mill...maybe I should check the bottom of the bottle for Aunt Wies’s dentures...... I’m not sure if I should give this a 7 or a 5 for taste. Mouthfeel is ok with lots of carbonation. Light bodied obviously. Touch sour (very tiny ammount). Varying levels of bitterness. Oxydized. I’m not sure if this is a clone of Alfa Brummen or if it’s just an export only version but it will do. If I have to look at all the garbage floating around in my glass anymore I might puke. Looks like it’s half frozen. Beer is good though."
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Bottle 35cl. Pours a clear golden colour with a normal size head and good carbonation. Just like the Eindhoven Reserva, this was only brewn for export and is not brewn anymore as far as I know. Smell is very hoppy and grassy. Taste is also about the same but has a nice bit of bitterness.
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;355ml bottle. Grassy and hoppy aroma. Pours with a light golden colour and good frothy head. Biscuity, grassy and hoppy flavour with a lot of sweetness in the flavour. Not great, but better than a lot.
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Aroma of corn and perhaps some hop. Perhaps not. Light golden color with a non-lacing white head that didn’t stay long. Starts corny sweet. Nearly medium mouthfeel. The good news is that there is a reasonable amount of hop in the finish. Arguably this deserves the label pilsener, and definitely deserves a much higher rating than mass-Bud.
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Bright yellow, initially tall white head that fades quickly. Corny-grainy aroma, not a lot in the hops department. A disappointing and bland pale lager, not worthy of pilsener status.
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Amber/golden color, thin head, like a pils/pale-lager, nice grainy but less hops,...good to drink
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Green bottle. Pale yellow. Cornfield aptly described the odor as mineral water. Depsite the snow outside, this is a lawnmower beer. Fair sweetness. No real hops. Almost no taste. Wouldn’t suprise me if it also had no alcohol.
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Bought a 12 pack of this junk the other day. Not sure if mine had seen the light or what but it’s horrible. Rotten tasting - a drainpour. This is why I should try beers before buying large quantities.
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;"Bottle: Pours a pale yellow with a huge head that last about a minute then dissapates to 1/8"" with some lacing. Extremely clear beer with very few small bubbles rising from the bottom. Aroma is faint, but slightly grassy. Flavor is mostly hops and slightly malty, a bit grassy, with a slightly bitter, metallic aftertaste. Tastes more carbonated than it looks or acts, which is good. Metallic aftertaste hangs on for a while. Still, not a bad beer at all. I find it more palatable than Heineken, but not as smooth as Grolsch."
Alfa Brummen;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Despite the obvious fact that Dutch Royalty has selected this lager...I must most respectfully, politely and humbly decline their selection, as it is sucky.
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Bottle 30cl. Pours a clear golden colour with a normal size head and good carbonation. Smell is very hoppy and grassy, nice fresh smell. Taste is alot like many other mass-produce pilseners, but this was only brewed for export to the USA and is not brewn anymore at the moment.
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;"Beware of beer sales. Got a 6-pack for $3.99 ""club card price"" - figured, at 4 bucks, its cheaper than budweiser and anything’s better than Bud. I was wrong. This smells and tastes very musky, dusty, copwebby arm pit-like. Fizzy urine yellow with an astringent finish."
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Bottle. Poured light yellow with small head. Grassy nose and average palate. Clean to the end. Overall an average brew. Drank one cool, and the other ice cold. The colder it is better it tastes.
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;A very refreshing, well-balanced summertime beer from the Netherlands. Not overpowering, not dry, a clean taste with little bite. Not the best from the region by any means, but better than most crap they market from that area (see Heineken & Oranjeboom).
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Green bottled Dutch beer. Pours light yellow in color. Smell kind of skunky. Has a sort of grassy aroma as well. Flavor is kind of malty. Decent taste. Has a hint of skunkiness. Not enough to really bother me though. Nice full mouthfeel for a beer of this type. Better than some other Dutch beers I won’t mention.
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;This junk smells like it was made with skunk cabbage. I forced my way through the 6 pack, as I refuse to waste beer no matter how bad. This was that bad. Typical yellow color, and feel of a lighter lager. Tastes grassy, hay-like, anyway you put it, this stuff tastes more like somebody threw a houseplant in a Juice Tiger and Wallah. Jack LeLane would be spitting this mess out.
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Pours a medium amber color with a big and quickly dissipating head. Aroma is earth and metallic. Flavor is yeasty and bready. It finishes dry and quick. An average pils.
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;A good solid lager with bready and cookie flavors. Not too much hop flavor to get in the way either. A palate point for not being too fizzy on the palate.
Alfa Eindhoven Special Reserve;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Lots of grassy scent assaults your nose as soon as you pour it. Even before I could focus my attention on this beer for a review, I noticed it's scent spewing forth from the glass. Nice white head fades into a soapy layer. Slight bitterness up front. There was some sort of sweetness in the beer, very light and candy like. It may have been from a soda I had drunk immediately before trying this beer, and I didn't cleanse my palate right. Anyhow, this sweetness, there or not) fades to tart dryness. Really didn’t think this beer was that good. I usually drink it straight out of the bottle as my drinking buddy likes this beer but never has glasses for us when we partake of it.

Si tratta di una birra leggera, dalla carbonazione quasi assente. It looks of a pale yellow colour, with a head of foam persistent on average, with medium-thin grain.

Mighty Oak IPA;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask@Southampton Arms, London. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is fruits, wood, mild herbs and some slight maltyness. Flavour is fruits, wood and mild notes of crystal crispyness.

Mighty Oak IPA;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask conditioned handpump Victoria Inn Northampton. A bright gold coloured beer with a whitish head and lacing. A fusty aroma with a bit of stale citrus hop. The hops are better in the mouth with nice orange notes. Served a little warm.
Mighty Oak IPA;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask at the Southampton Arms, London on 11th February 2010. Crystal clear gold with small, thickly lacing off-white head. Slight yeasty aroma, soon hoppy with grassy bitterness. A lingering, tickling bitterness on the roof of the mouth with a bitter, but rather short-lived finish.
Mighty Oak IPA;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask conditioned at Far from the Madding Crowd, Oxford. Pale amber with white head. Gentle little session bitter, nicely balanced with a sweetish biscuity malt, a touch of peach in the background then a gentle fragrant, bittersweet hop. An enjoyable start to the days festivities.
Mighty Oak IPA;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Aug 07 Cask conditioned @ Yorkshire Terrier, York. Biscuity malt and slight caramel sweetness. Peppery hops to start but they are quite restrained in the finish. Light and refreshing
Mighty Oak IPA;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask (handpump) at Chelmsford Winter Beer Festival 2005. Pale amber colour. Distinct diacetyl notes on the aroma, which I found off-putting. Otherwise, it’s a reasonably well balanced, moderately hoppy, but unremarkable session bitter. Too delicate to cope with the intrusive butterscotch. Sadly, not in peak condition methinks. [4/3/6/3/12 = 2.8] RE-RATE. Cask (handpump) at the Cask Pub & Kitchen on 17 January 2011 - meet the brewer night, with 10 Mighty Oak beers on tap. Looks good - bright darkish amber with sparkling condition and a thin white head. Much fresher and cleaner than when I tasted it before. However, tasted next to a lot of ebullient golden ales it came over as a rather staid traditional English session bitter. Solid but not too exciting. Score updated [6/4/6/3/12 = 3.1]

Hinterland Barley Wine;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hinterland Brewery;An acceptable libation, but it did not knock my socks off in the way I expect a barley wine to do. Lacks a certain je ne sais quoi.
Island City Pale Ale;Minocqua, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minocqua Brewing Company;The other reviews on this site are quite a bit less recent than my own, and while I thought this beer was OK, I htink it was decidely less hoppy than the previous two reviews from 2004. This beer looked like a very serious IPA...a hazy dark straw color with a minimal soapy head that appeared as if it could be skimmed off and used to blow bubles in the yard. IMO, this appearance often foretells a pretty serious blast of hops, and I was a bit disappointed by the actual flavor of this beer. This pale ale is noticeably hoppy but not decidely so, and has some malt balance to it. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, flat, and watery. I would say this beer is just OK...not sure how it stacks up to Minocqua’s other offerings, but I was neither impressed nor offended by this beer.
Island City Pale Ale;Minocqua, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minocqua Brewing Company;Redish-orange body, fizzy/soapy off-white head. Dry and peppery bubblegum dominates aroma the aroma. In fact, I normally like a bit of bubblegum, but this was too much. But, it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless. Sweet grapefruit, caramel, and spruce in the flavor. It had a slight resiny feel to it and a nice bitter grapefruit peel finish. Not too bad overall.
Island City Pale Ale;Minocqua, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minocqua Brewing Company;Clear amber body, off-white ring of bubbles around the top. The aroma has purple grape, taffy and a touch of spicy, piney hops. Buckwheat pancake malt, caramel, more pepper-spruce hops, and grilled grapefruit comprise the flavor. I enjoyed this pale because it did a good job of differentiating itself from other run-of-the-mill pales.
Founders Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Serving: from tap at Pit Stop Taproom & Pub. Aroma: lightly sweet.

Aromas of coffee and roasted malts muted by nitro. Flavors of black coffee, acidic roasted malts, a bit of dark chocolate and cream.
Founders Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);I'm not sure I've met a beer on nitro that I haven't liked. I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal stouts, but this one from Founders on nitro at the Railroad was outstanding! The beer poured a black color with a beautiful, cascading body that settled softly, but firmly at the top of the glass. The nose was semi-sweet, with notes of chocolate, malts, a touch of cream and oats. The body was silky-smooth and so enjoyable. I could have sat there all night and enjoyed pint after pint of this delicious stout. The flavors were well-balanced and tasty, with notes of milk chocolate, cream, oats, light hops and a hint of sugar. This was one outstanding stout!
Founders Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Black with a creamy nitro tan head. Roasted malt, cocoa, earth, light caramel. Medium smooth body. Finish has light bitter but mostly sweet roasted malt. Nice.
Foundry Grand Cru;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Foundry Ale Works;copper color, frothy head. aroma of fruit. sweet malty taste with a tart fruity overtone. several spicy nuances , coriander and orange flavors come through strongly. interesting brew.

Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Bottle. Had this beer many years ago, just adding it to my records. All I remember was that I didn't enjoy it. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);375ml bottle. I didn’t klnow they still made this, found it on the shelf atr First Choice on the Sunshine Coast. I remeber drinking this stuff back in the day before decent craft beer was available. Bit of colour for a low alcohol beer and carries a whiff of white foam. Cereal in the aroma is no surprise.
Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);This is horrible stuff, tastes soapy, and not like beer at all. Stay away....you have been warned!
Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);"2.5% and tastes it. In fact it hides this 2.5% very well in that you can’t tell it’s alcoholic at all. Clear orange gold with a head that disappeared virtually instantaneously. Cold metal aroma, with a bit of sweet sugary adjunct. Slightest hint of bitter and sweet on tasting, but only slight. As much as these low abv beers keep professing to be ""full flavour"", it really is just a crock of shit. As to be expected there is no depth at all. Tastes like beer cordial really."
Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);well it is a light beer, so gone is any depth and it is carlton so gone are any hops or character. I’d rather have 1 nice heavy than 20 light beers, but i guess this isn’t aimed at me!
Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);At the risk of sounding like a tool, I actually enjoyed a longneck of this. Really easy to drink, although nothing spectacular. Shame about the low alcohol.
Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);"Pale golden, clear, medium head. I wouldn’t go so far as calling this ""foul"", but it is pretty boring (even allowing for it being a light beer). A whiff of hops, but nothing on the palate. Watery."
Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);POints for $$$ cheapness. however when fresh, it really tasts like a crown larger only much less alcoholic kick.... sign the things i do for money
Carlton Sterling;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Draught at Irish Murphy, Ballarat. Pale yellow. A hint of Pride of Ringwood hops. After that sweetness, fizz and emptiness. Hello? Anybody in there?
B.O.B. Vanderbobs Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;This really funny because I was given this beer at the brewing company and they tried to pass it off as if it were an Oberon. Really not funny but gave me another beer to rate. It wasn't very good.
B.O.B. Vanderbobs Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Slightly hazy light golden appearance. Nose is fruity with a touch of citrusy hops and sweet malt. Body is smooth, big hop presence, little roast. The thing about this beer is that it has no wheat beer qualities, no hints of wheat at all. Too hopped for the style. The description says hefeweizen, hefeweizen''s are unfiltered, this beer was transparent. Not a good example.
B.O.B. Festive Amber;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Draft at brewpub. Pours clear dark copper color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate toasted malt and leather aroma. Medium body with with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of an average duration. My expectation where met.
B.O.B. Festive Amber;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;copper with a small beige head. Sweet malt aroma. taste is of some slight caramel malt sweetness, incredibly thin. boring.
B.O.B. Festive Amber;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;This beer wasn't too bad, I enjoyed it with my jambalaya. This beer had a great taste, but isn't that great with spicy food!
B.O.B. Festive Amber;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Bright copper appearance, lttle head. Nose is butterscotch - Lifesaver-esque, sweet, light hops. Body is of slightly roasty hops. Mouthfeel is oily. Finishes thin, dry and short. All and all a one-sided brew, nose is quite unpleasant, like an artificial butterscotchiness.
B.O.B. Festive Amber;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Caramel toasted flavors ... hmmm ... well, it has some sweet edges that might seem caramelly, if you have a lot of imagination, but any toast here is obscured by some cheap, banal marmalade. Pretty basic amber.
B.O.B. Festive Amber;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Thin. Bland. Boring. ......................................................
B.O.B. Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;On tap at the BOB. Light golden body, thin/medium off-white head. Rather nondescript aroma and flavor of bitter, lightly citric hops, with a light toasty, biscuity malt body. Thin-bodied. Not a terrible beer, but certainly a hackneyed attempt. Still, it’s neat to have a microbrewery designed to serve a variety of restaurants and clientele in one building with local beers.
B.O.B. Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;golden color with a medium sized white head. slight aroma of citrus hops. slight citrus hop taste, but overall bland and boring.
B.O.B. Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Slightly cloudy light golden appearance. Sweet malty nose with citrusy hops present. Body is fairly hoppy and it seems as if the hops change to piney hops here. Hmm. Light malt presence as well. not enough malt to be interesting.
B.O.B. Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;If you alternatively suck on soggy sweetened cardboard and some old homebrewing hop pellets you had forgotten about, you'd approximate the taste of this stuff. OK, maybe it's not that bad, but it definitely is mediocre enough to arouse a little ire from this APA lover.
B.O.B. Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Sample at the B.O.B. as Fahrenheit Porter. Dark brown pour with a medium tan head. Roasted malt nose with a bit of coffee. Roasty and creamy flavor, but it’s kinda thin. Doesn’t know whether it’s a brown porter or a robust. My guess is that it’s an attempt at the latter, but could use some more body.
B.O.B. Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Draft sample at B.O.B.. Poured clear dark brown color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate toasted chocolate malt aroma. Medium body and smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium roasted sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. This beer met my expectations.
B.O.B. Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Dark brown color. Weak roast in the nose, light hints of chocolate. Body is lightly roasty, soft mouthfeel, finishing bitter and drying at the end. A fairly boring porter, needs a lot of work to stand up to the vast amount of porters out there nowadays.
B.O.B. Summer Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;On tap at Michigan Summer Beer Fest. At one of the food stands. Went well with my pulled pork sandwich. Quenching and clean.
B.O.B. Das Dortmunder;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Golden color. Fresh malt and hops (Cascades) on the nose. Body is sweetish malt with an organic hop bitterness. Finished bitter and oily.
B.O.B. Das Dortmunder;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Tastes mostly of honey, in the tradition of breakfast cereals marketed to kids. Sweet, pale, and limp.
B.O.B. Saaz Pilsener;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;On tap as B.O.B. Happy Pils. This was a light, bready pilsener with more malt depth than I expected, pairing grassy, snappy hops with sweet, bready malt and a hint of light fruit. It’s interesting that the previous reviewer mentions not picking up Saaz hops, as I didn’t pick up a significant contribution of this classic Pilsener standard, either. That’s not to say the hops weren’t used, but this was a bit unusual.
B.O.B. Saaz Pilsener;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Light golden color. Fruity and hoppy aroma. Body is smooth, big, long hops and drying in the finish. A bit one sided and could stand for a bit more malt. I seriously doubt that this is saaz hops in here, tastes more like cascades to me and has similar tasting hops to their other brews. i don''t know, maybe they use saaz in most of their beers. All in all, one of this breweries better beers.
B.O.B. Saaz Pilsener;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Pretty much the only BOB brew with guts. That is, they dared to go beyond sweet, thin mass market brewpub fare and put some real Saaz tang and decent body together.
B.O.B. IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Golden. Nose is piney hops, slight roast and a touch of malt. Body is very hoppy with a little bit of sweet malt but not nearly enough to round off the unpleasant, long one-sided hoppiness.
B.O.B. IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;The hops are definitely there but the thing is so dang sweet that the result is a confrontation in the trenches which neither side really wins, much like the Great War. Still, it does have big flavor, and the only real sustained head in the brewery, so it fares better than most BOB brews.
B.O.B. Smoky Scotch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Sample at the B.O.B. as Eve Isle Scotch Ale, but I’m assuming this is the same beer. Pours a light brown with a thin tan head. Nose of sweet malt, caramel and peat. Smoky and peaty flavor up front with some caramelly sweetness on the back end. Pretty solid, and definitely the best beer of theirs I had.
B.O.B. Smoky Scotch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;Draft sample at The B.O.B. Poured clear brown color with an average frothy light brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Good toasted caramel malt and nutty aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium toasted sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Good beer.
B.O.B. Smoky Scotch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;"Very dark red appearance. Sweet malty, light choclatey and somewhat organic nose. Body is sweet, organic, very lightly smoked. Finishes hoppy. Not enough smoke to merit the label ""smoky"". Sweet, unbalanced and uninteresting."
B.O.B. Smoky Scotch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The B.O.B.s House of Brews;The B.O.B. is a great old building in Grand Rapids, Michigan, converted into a series of upscale dining rooms. The basement boasts the Monkey Bar, featuring great tapas and the house brew, not so great. This one, at least, is interesting, with a pleasant smoky aroma. It's typically thin, sweet brewpub fare, though and the smoke seems a touch artificial, like the liquid smoke stuff on the wrong end of a marketing assault on true barbeque.

Huttenkloas Witbier;Hengelo, Netherlands;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Huttenkloas;Bottle looks simple but strange. Beer in the glass terrible, ugly head. Starts mild but awful, sourish, unbalanced, malty-moldy. Almost undrinkable.

ABV 5.2% Deep golden orange colour on the body, quite clear, with two fingers of white head on top.

Yeast, sugars but also quite fruity, like a tripel, with peaches, apricots, bubblegum. Taste is also fruity although not so intense as the aroma. There is apricot, there are some grains too and yeast, with a nice and strong bitterness on the aftertaste, with long duration. A little bit on the body, with low carbonation, but without being watery. Overall more than decent one, quite good actually.

Morgan Street Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Morgan Street Brewery;It poured a clear amber color with a small tan head. The aroma was mild and clean with faint apple notes. The taste was sweet with some spicy, floral hops. It was medium-bodied, lightly carbonated and smooth. A decent Altbier.
Morgan Street Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Morgan Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, pours a light brown with no head, the aroma is of slight caramel and a little malt, the flavor is pretty bland with a metallic finish, ugh, still have samples left.

Morgan Street Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Morgan Street Brewery;This was just bad. It looked fine, had a decent aroma, but the flavor said the beer was either off or they need to clean their lines. Didn’t like it. Didn’t really care to finish it.
Morgan Street Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Morgan Street Brewery;I am not really sure what they were going for here, but this does not really seem very true to style. Just a little hoppier than I would expect for the style and I know that typically these are generally the hoppiest beers in Germany, but this was not what I was expecting. Lightly roasted malt, butterscotch and caramel, with hints of dried fruit. This is not of the better beers I have tried today.
Morgan Street Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Morgan Street Brewery;Draught at Morgan St. Pours clear amber with a small, frothy, white head, somewhat lasting with good lacing.

Average duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.
Morgan Street Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Morgan Street Brewery;On draught at the brewpub. This beer is a clear reddish-amber color with a thin off-white head that diminishes quickly. Spotty lacing. Lightly toasted malt and hops in the nose. Light-bodied and moderately bitter (moreso than I am used to for an Alt) with hops and some roasted malt. The finish is hoppy with a bit of malt and fruit in the aftertaste. Barely average overall.
Morgan Street Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Morgan Street Brewery;From the brewery on 12/4/07. I liked this one, but not as much as the Vienna. Poured coppery color with a lacy head. Finally, HOPS from this brewery!

Wisconsin Dells Light Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;(Tap) Pours yellow with little head. Slightly hoppy from start to finish. Not bad for a light beer, but not too impressive.

Wisconsin Dells Light Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Lager aroma with some diacetyl notes. Like some of City Brewing (La Crosse) beers in that regard. Hint of hops in the nose. Light gold in color with no carbonation. Thin white head with not much lace. Bland flavor, but not that bad for a light. More flavor than some. No glairing flaws.
Wisconsin Dells Light Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Clear pale gold with a short ice sheet of white for the head. Aroma is croissants, lemons and laundry detergent. A little watery with a hop profile of an APA. Clean, bready finish and a sour lemon aftertaste.
Wisconsin Dells Light Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Golden with a thin white head. Carbonation present with bubbles here and there. Nose is thin with some hops but barely. The taste is mostly grains with just a bit of hops. For a light beer this is very drinkable and actually kind of pleasant.
Wisconsin Dells Light Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Very light gold color with a fizzy head. No real aroma with just a slight taste of grains. Nothing off about it, so it’s better than most light beers.
Wisconsin Dells Light Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Light Gold With Small White Head. Lemon, Sweet and Malty Aroma. Lemon Dies Out on the Tongue...Malt Underlining the Brew and Hop Ending.. Grainy Taste to it Overall and Makes This one Hard to be Very Drinkable.
Wisconsin Dells Light Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Sample at the brewpub. Very very light, bit hazy. Only the faintest of aromas, clean, thin, bit of malt evident towards the end. Average for a light I suppose.

Wisconsin Dells Schmitz Pale Ale #5;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Slighty hazy amber with a light beige head. Light orange citrus aroma. Light malt and acidic citric bitterness. Fizzy, I think the serving pressure is to high, all the beers seem fizzy.
Wisconsin Dells Schmitz Pale Ale #5;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;A nice APA. Good balance of bitterness and roasted malts...................
Wisconsin Dells Schmitz Pale Ale #5;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Hops are definitely there, but not in a form I can enjoy. Simply bitter, without any of the herbal, citrus, or pine notes that come from using quality ingredients. Very dry, lacking in sweet maltiness. They would do better to copy a popular APA than to keep brewing this stuff. If this is number 5, I'd hate to have been around for 1,2,3, and 4!
Wisconsin Dells Schmitz Pale Ale #5;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Unfortunately this beer does not live up to the glory of the Schmitz name to which I am proud to carry myself. If I brewed it I wouldn''t have put my name on it. Not a strong pale ale, not hoppy enough, plain, unentertaining, just not as exciting as I hoped a beer bearing my name would be.
Wisconsin Dells Schmitz Pale Ale #5;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;I was also excited for this brewery after a long day of playing in the sun and water at Noah's Ark. I was pretty disappointed though. First of all the restaurant itself is covered with dead animals. Not my style when I'm trying to eat... Then there was the beer. They weren't all bad but there was not much going for this ale. Do they even know what hops are? I sure didn't taste any.
Wisconsin Dells Schmitz Pale Ale #5;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;"After a hard day spent with the family ""enjoying"" the Dells, we headed over to the Moosejaw for some eats...and yeehaw, we find out this place has its own brewery!! I was very pleased with the Pale Ale. Looked nice in a glass, head stuck around until the bitter end (pun intended). The flavor of this beer was long on hops, just the way I like it. Yum."

This is a good, hoppy pils from Murauer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Murauer Hopfengold;Murau, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Murau;0.5 l bottle Doggythedog brought from Graz, thanks for sharing! It poured pale golden body with medium sized head. Malty aroma, some hay and grass hops. Fine, slightly herbal bitterish flavor, malty in fruity apple or similar way. Medium bodied with shorter, bittersweet finish. Yes, it needs a bit more hops for its name, but it’s an interesting and nice austrian macro beer anyway.
Murauer Hopfengold;Murau, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Murau;Poured a pale yellow-golden body with a medium sized white head. Oily nose, light vegetables, some malt. The taste is oily again, some apples, some alcohol?! Dry, sweet, not far away from the typical Austrian macro lager, even if I haven’t mentioned meny pleasant tastes here. I expected more hops. Way more hops.
Murauer Hopfengold;Murau, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Murau;Pours golden with medium white head. Raisins and caramell in nose with herbal hops and fruity peach with maltiness in flavor. Rather intense bitter finish, (a bit unbalanced towards the bitter side).

Clear golden color with a medium sized, frothy, white head. Flavor is medium sweet and light bitter. It tastes like white bread, grain, biscuit with some nutty notes. Body is medium, mouthfeel is thin to creamy. Finish is first sweet then light bitter. It's more like a traditional Austrian Märzen to me. 0,33l bottle from Amersin Vienna.

Schleppe Märzen;Klagenfurt, Austria;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schleppe Brauerei (Villacher);Während das Villacher bei den Leuten in Kärnten recht beliebt ist, so wird auch unglaublich gerne über das Schleppe geschimpft -vor allem über das Schleppe Märzen (besonders wenn man es in der verruchten Schleppe-Alm trinkt). Was man bekommt ist zwar nicht so schlimm wie es viele Kärnter beschreiben, aber auch keine Welt. Ein klassisches Helles mit wenig Hopfen und einem unangenehmen pickig-süßlichen Abgang. Bei großen Durst ok, aber kein Genuss.

What’s a ticker to do!"
Tugboat I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewery pours out a copper color topped with a white head. Nose is not much better than hop gold pine yeast some grain. Taste is more of the funky bitter hops and a grain end.
Tugboat I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Cloidy orange with foamy white head. Nose is wierd...sour. palate is full- bodied and hoppy. Flavor is not good. Very bitter grapefruit and that sour smell again. This beer tastes off.
Tugboat I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;"On tap at Tugboat. Pours a cloudy copper color with a small white head. A sweet hoppy nose, very light. The flavor is very odd; initial fruity and biscuit, then a huge finish of bitter grapefruit. It burns the palate, I can’t say much else. Very odd, medicinal. Perhaps no late kettle additions? Something is amiss. I tried in vain to question the server who said people come from all around for this beer. I hope that is not correct."
Tugboat I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;From a really old tasting note on our pacific nw trip from a few years back - pine hop, grainy yeast, citrus, lemon and grass.
Tugboat I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;On tap at the tugboat location. Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a nice frothy head. the taste, however, is of plastic and stale hops. not a beer that i am a fan of. goes down nicely though, but the plastic....

Tugboat I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Tap at their brewpub... came out an unfiltered honey hue with a thin white head that dissipate to nothing on the surface. I enjoy the hazy look in an IPA sometimes. Aroma was too yeasty with some hoppy notes, I couldn’t get too good of a sniff though because of the smoking there. Really dry palate which accentuated the hops with other flavors of pine/grass and grainy yeast. A dry hop finish with a touch of malt.
Tugboat I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Nice orange, but a bit cloudy. Taste is pretty typical....not as hoppy as other IPA in the area, but good....more grassy than citrus. Average.
Tugboat I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;This was the first brewpub I visited on my trip to Portland last October, but I forgot to submit the rating. The smell is very distincly citrus, almost lemon drop. The appearance was cloudy orange, almost like a wheat beer, but was a little hard to tell since it’s so damn dark in this place. Decent head and lacing. I didn’t think this was too bitter. However, I don’t think I could drink this for hours, even though I could hang out here for hours.
Tugboat German Alt Bier;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Not like any other Alt I have ever had, this was very strongly hopped, and had a strong hop aroma as well. Poured a murky brown, with a off-white head that diminished after a bit. Then the hoppy/fruity flavors take over, and were very pleasant. Not quite true to the traditional style perhaps, but still a great beer.
Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Half pint on July 1, 2015. At the brewpub in Portland. Hazy brown color, tan head. Acidic, malty taste. Acidic, bitter aftertaste. Medium thin mouthfeel, very low bitterness. Acidic, fruity scent. Feels like an infection going on here, or just very bad cleaning of the lines at the bar. All in all not a pleasant beer the way I had it served.
Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Draught at brewpub. Tugboat was the real letdown of the trip. Very little of their own beer on tap. This ESB had an odd but strong fruit flavor I liked. Maybe too much grape, but not bad.
Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Draft. An unclear amber beer with no head. The aroma is sweet malty with primary notes of caramel as well as lighter notes of citrus. The flavor is sweet matly with notes of citrus, grass, and hops. Way above their pay- grade?
Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Nice, pleasant beer. Cloudy amber colour with ruby. Nice white head. A bit watery but very nice.

Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Foggy copper color (at least that is how it appeared in the darkness of Tugboat’s tap house). Strong floral hops in the nose. Body a little washed in the finish. Hoped for more bitterness. A little homebrewy and under carbonated. Overall a decent drinkable beer, but nothing to write about (oh wait I am). Try it at least once. Maybe mine was slightly off.
Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;By far the best of the tugboat beers I had today. Strong hop taste with an almost equally full malt body. Smells of pine and caramel and taste is similar. Aftertaste coats the mouth quite well.
Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Cloudy amber colour, a bit of ruby tint as well. Pale malt, light caramel, spice/resiny hop aroma. Falvour shows light fruity malt, a bit of yeast. Spicy and resiny hop flavour. A touch of citrus in the finish. Comes across a bit muddled, but is drinkable.
Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Hazy orange-brown color. Fruity, apple like aroma. Moderate bitterness, some notes of grape skins and toast. An alright bitter, but something just seemed off about it.
Tugboat E.S.B.;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Slightly murky dark red color. A weird off-flavor in here... bland and stale metallic flavors. the nose is a mild hopped citrus fruit experience, like a fruity orange juice/IPA nose.
Tugboat Hop Red;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;All of Tugboats beers are brewed quite strong. Hazy red, overly hopped, goes down good. High ABV. i can only handle one or two of these in a sitting.
Tugboat Hop Red;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tugboat Brewing Co.;"On tap at Tugboat, described on their chalkboard as a ""hoppy ESB"". Clear deep red with a quickly fading white head. Some caramel and hops in the aroma. Flavor starts of with notes of caramel, toasted malt and then comes a big burst of piney hop bitterness. Lingering bitter hop finish. Medium to full body, smooth texture and moderate carbonation. Nice beer."
West Brothers Honey Orange Wheat;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Brothers Brewery;"Well the most accurate discription of this brew was when someone said, ""this tastes like a mimosa"", they were correct. This brew pours a light yellow/orange with a normal wheat haze to it. Aroma is very tropicana. Taste is very thin and watery with a very light yeast taste, light on the wheat. The only major flavor in this brew was a big dose of orange juice."
West Brothers Honey Orange Wheat;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Brothers Brewery;A great summer beer. The aroma is light floral, and the flavor is nicely fruity, with a very present honey sweetness, and toasted malts, the finish has just a taste of mandarin orange. Perfectly balanced, could have gone completely the opposite direction, but instead it came out just right.
West Brothers Honey Orange Wheat;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Brothers Brewery;This is definitely an easy-drinking summer beer. The honey is clear in the flavor, nicely complementing what is really just a hint of orange. There's just enough sweetness to be refreshing instead of cloying and the wheat in the mash makes for a nice palate on which the honey and orange to work.
West Brothers Honey Orange Wheat;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Brothers Brewery;A pleasant surprise for the tasting, just not for drinking more than a single pint or even a taster. Nice cloudy pale yellow body. Crisp with hints of orange zest& plenty citrucyness. Lots of honey sweetness as well.
West Brothers Amber;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;West Brothers Brewery;I tried a dry hopped red ale, so I am assuming this is the same beer, with the wrong name. Anyhoo, this was very nice, lots of rich toasted malty notes, with a great almost esb like bitter hops bite. Great color and aroma, with a very well balanced finish.
West Brothers Amber;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;West Brothers Brewery;Looks more like an Irish red. Very nice lace. A really malty brew, more congruent with those Wisconsin beers back home. Caramel, of course. A decent floral hoppy bite too. Great balance.
West Brothers IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;West Brothers Brewery;Pours a hazy dark orange with a tall white head. Aroma had a good hoppiness to it with a citrus fruit thing goin on. This brew was very smooth and crisp with a good light maltiness up front followed by a mildly bitter end to balance it out. Good citrus hops in the aftertaste.
West Brothers IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;West Brothers Brewery;This brewery is really good at what they do, so far I have been nothing but impressed. This is a really great IPA. Pours a deep amberish brown color which was surprising and the nose, is floral and fruity, and the flavor is rich and powerful and just slap you upside the face. Great fruit flavors with a sweetness from the hops and the malt, but again a nice dry finish. Wonderful.
West Brothers IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;West Brothers Brewery;"Slightly darker than most IPA""s around here. A very nice, tight head. Tons of cascade and Mt. Hood hops, but followed up by a caramely, well balanced experience. I""d be interested to see is the brewers used a direct flame kettle to get that carmely malt presence. This is definitely highly complex stuff. The 90 IBU are definitely countered well."
West Brothers IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;West Brothers Brewery;"Nice fruity-hoppy aroma...Color a copper/amber--a little bit darker than most IPAs---head on light side, but still a pretty brew...Flavor is suitably hoppy, but with distinct fruity countenance and healthy malt base...Body is in the medium range, so this is quaffable stuff as well...Finish is medium-dry, again with slight fruit overtones...very tasty...This is a ""toned-down"" West Coast IPA in the hop sense, but has the other ingredients to compensate...Robust and bright...A very good IPA."
West Brothers Porter;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Porter;West Brothers Brewery;nice soft mocha aroma, dark choclate brown, robust dry choclate with hints of smokiness
West Brothers Porter;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Porter;West Brothers Brewery;"Ruby hued, VERY dark body with a nice chocolatey brown head. Well roasted barley malts. Lots of chocolate, milk and dark. Diddn""""t linger worth a damn, but nice while it lasted. Tasty, but thin, watery mouthfeel is tought o overcome."
West Brothers Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;West Brothers Brewery;On tap @ Bier Steinm - Another one that I am amazed has held up so well. Found this keg in the bottom of Eugene City, formely West Brothers. Starting to get kind of weak, but still tastes great! Lots of rich chocolate, black tea, and creamy coffee. Extremely well balanced for the style.
West Brothers Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;West Brothers Brewery;Had this on tap at the new westbrothers off franklin blvd, i think its called the river lodge or something. Black with a nice tan head. Very thick and very smooth. Taste was kinda bitter with hints of coffee with a small amount of hops to back it up. A little to bitter of a stout for my taste but great non the less.
West Brothers Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;West Brothers Brewery;Black as midnight. Good roasted nose & taste. Just a bit sweeter than the porter. Not a ton of hops, more subdued perhaps. Good stuff, just not remarkable. Does have that nice coffe finish though.
West Brothers Hop Breath Pale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;West Brothers Brewery;Color is a hazy glowing copper--creamy pock-marked head that leaves rings of lace---very attractive indeed...Aroma is citrus-hoppy with slight floral overtones...Flavor features a measured but snappy hop profile that comes forth immediately---a slight fruitiness accompanies the main body and lingers through to the lovely finish that fills the back of the palate with a fog of hop vapors...Body is medium-light, very appropriate for such a brightly-flavored ale. Overall, this is most stimulating to the senses...This has flavor and olfactory qualities that one only obtains fresh from the source.
West Brothers Imperial IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;West Brothers Brewery;(gabf 2003) Pours a rich amber color. Given the high ABV of this IPA, I was really surprised at the light taste. This is a very smooth IPA with caramel flavors. Little hops but a lemon/orange zip to the taste.
West Brothers Imperial IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;West Brothers Brewery;Color is a rich copper-amber with a thinnish head and wispy lace--no doubt the influence of the high ABV rating...Aroma is fairly light balance of malts and hops and also a bit estery. This has an assertive hop top-end---nice bloom---with a firm malt bottom and brandy-like fruit accents. Finish is also fruity-dry. Carbonation is moderate and substantial enough to provide a buoyancy to this powerhouse ale--this is amazingly quaffable stuff, but watch out! That Demon Alcohol sneaks up on you in a hurry!
Tugboat Rye Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Tugboat Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewery pours out a amber color topped with a sand head. Nose is rye malts some citrus fruit notes. Taste is more of the rye malts some grain spice and citrus hops.
Tugboat Rye Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Tugboat Brewing Co.;On tap as the Rye Pale Ale. Perhaps a new beer, but the descriptions match what I had. Pours a clear copper color with a medium white head. A sweet nose of grains and light fruit. The flavor was a nice mix of spicy rye and fruity hops, light bitterness, very clean. Good.
Tugboat Rye Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Great sheets of lace. Very pleasant, light yeasty and sweet. Hints of lemon too. An almost minty clean finish, perhaps as result of some Mt. Hood hops??
Tugboat Rye Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Tugboat Brewing Co.;fruity hops then serious berriness and serious rye, a one two punch.........
Tugboat Rye Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Tugboat Brewing Co.;"This was very nice...reddish amber color with an off-white head, and a pleasant if slightly less hoppy aroma than their IPA or German Alt that I tried. The flavors were more mild as well. Wish I could get specific ABV numbers on their beers, but except for their stout, I was told ""between 5 and 13 percent"". This was a very pleasant drinking beer."

Aromat pszeniczny. W smaku pełen dobry hefeweizen, czuć dodatkowo cytrynkę (którą kelner dorzucił do piwa!). Piwo smaczne, warte polecenia.
Pegas Pšeničné 12°;Brno, Czech Republic;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Minipivovar Pegas;Tap (Pegas, Brno) Pale straw, clear, and served with a lemon slice. Bland wheaty taste, as was the aroma post-lemon. Flat palate, a bit sweet and sticky. A very dull wheatbeer.

Zlatni Lav Svijetlo Pivo;Jastrebarsko, Croatia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bavarska Pivovara Jastrebarsko;05/04 On tap at the brewpub. Clear, darker golden bodied beer with rich medium white head. Flower malty and mild hoppy aroma, sourish, as unpasteurized. Quite bitter, but nice flavor, grainy, some notes of fruits, interesting and for the style full bodied. Finish is long, follows the flavor well, bitterish, pretty simple but still very nice. This beer is very well brewed and obviously fully matured. Tasty.
Zlatni Lav Svijetlo Pivo;Jastrebarsko, Croatia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bavarska Pivovara Jastrebarsko;"0.5l at the brewpub Poured a nice golden body with lively carbonation (big bubbles too)... a medium sized thick white head that went away at a medium pace.A very nice peachy and malty nose with a hint of hops. The taste was nicely balanced; the hopiness was mild but pleasant, it was grainy, malty/fruity with a dry hoppy aftertaste. Like the wheat, quality stuff."
Zlatni Lav Svijetlo Pivo;Jastrebarsko, Croatia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bavarska Pivovara Jastrebarsko;Sampled draught at Bavarska Pivnica, Jastrebarsko, Croatia. -nice gold color, little to sweet,refreshing
Zlatni Lav Pšenično Pivo;Jastrebarsko, Croatia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bavarska Pivovara Jastrebarsko;"05/04 On tap at the brewpub. Murky darker golden bodied with medium white head that lived really long. Strong weizen yeast aroma, meaning banana, some orange, cloves and some other spices. As it’s unpasteurized aroma is also sourish, which gave me impression of a very ""natural"" beer. Flavor is very nice as well, slight bitterish though, but yeast is still dominating along with wheat malt sweetness. Full bodied, not nearly watery as most beers of this style, perfectly balanced and tasty. Of course, finish is nice as well, really long sweetness which follows the flavor. Nothing complex of course, but a great Weizen indeed, probably the best I’ve ever had!"
Zlatni Lav Pšenično Pivo;Jastrebarsko, Croatia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bavarska Pivovara Jastrebarsko;"0.5l draught at the brewpub. Poured a murky dark apricot/orange colour with a medium sized thick off white head that went away at a slow pace. The nose started off quite nice and quite by the book, with notes of banana, cloves, and bubblegum, but was ruined a bit by some odd sourish aroma. I was afraid that it’d be spoiled, but it turned out not to be. A somewhat light, pleasant, refreshing taste. Lactic, banana, quite yeasty, a bit bready taste with just a touch of hop bitterness near the end. The mouthfeel was lovely, pleasantly smooth. Surprisingly nice, and the better of the two Croatian wheats. Better than almost every other Hefeweissbiers that I’ve head, but that might be because of the freshness. All in all, worth the long wait. (from what I know, this brewpub started brewing again this year again after 3 years of ""pause"")."
Zlatni Lav Pšenično Pivo;Jastrebarsko, Croatia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bavarska Pivovara Jastrebarsko;Sampled draught at Bavarska Pivnica, Jastrebarsko, Croatia. - the best Jastrebarsko beer, very rich head, fruity aroma, refreshing
Zlatni Lav Tamno Pivo;Jastrebarsko, Croatia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Bavarska Pivovara Jastrebarsko;Sampled draught at Bavarska Pivnica, Jastrebarsko, Croatia. - not so good as other two beers, to much bitter, small head
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;Pint glass at the joint- served a transparent golden/orange color, creamy head that laced upon the vessel, light carbonation, Very faint aroma consisting of malt, caramel, hops, and fresh grass. Hits the mouth with a light medium body, malt isn’t overly sweet- ’bout time, medium holds up well, finish is slightly creamy and lightly bittering. Not shabby, could have knocked back about a dozen of them and I’d be happy for the day!
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;Had as just ESB, so i’m assuming this is the right spot .. . pours a maple gold .. mild head, low spotty lacing .. . medium bitterness .. . light hoppy wood .. . a nice simple straight shooter of a beer .. . . Look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out!
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;Translucent amber with a clearance nice white head. Malty nose. Flavor is more malty like an amber, not esb. Cool and crisp. Just too malty for me. I wanted something bitter.
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;(Draught) Pours a clear amber body with a moderate white head. Aroma of caramel, apple, melon, and grass. Flavor of caramel, toffee, grass, and biscuit.
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub under the name Excalibur ESB. I assume this is the same beer. The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is fairly faint. I get a little bit of toffee and grass, but overall the beer doesn’t have much of an aroma. The flavor is more prominent. I get a lot of toffee malt with some grassy hop notes. As the beer warms I also get some pine notes from the hops. Very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;Orangey, thin white head. Interesting nose of sourdough bread, tea, and light florals. Flavor was earthy, bready, and floral with a good bitterness that lasts the whole way through. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, soft bitter finish. A good session ale...
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;Pour is hazed golden amber with a thin off white head...smell is sweet and bready malty with some caramel...taste is nicely malty up front with some nice sourdough bread flavor and slightly subtle bitterness rounding out the finish...
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;Light straw color with a white head. Very subtle hop taste to the point of almost not being there. I was not impressed with this beer.
North By Northwest Excalibur E.S.B.;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;Very average appearance, little head. Pretty good bitter though...nice maltiness throughout with a pleasant hop finish. What an ESB should taste like.
Villacher Dunkel;Villach, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Vereinigte Kärntner Brauereien;"Better than expected, and not as ""dark taste"" as expected. High sweetness, but not too sweet. Neither too dense. Goes well with pork dishes."
Villacher Dunkel;Villach, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Vereinigte Kärntner Brauereien;Ein klassisches dunkles Bier, bei dem die Malzsüße über den gesamten Geschmack bestimmt. Es ist mir einfach viel zu süß und hat kaum andere Aromen zu bieten.
Villacher Dunkel;Villach, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Vereinigte Kärntner Brauereien;0,5 l Flasche. Dunkelbraunes Bier, cremefarbener, flacher Schaum, schöne Gardine. Schmeckt fast wie en Malzbier, Karamell, dezente Röstaromen.
Villacher Dunkel;Villach, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Vereinigte Kärntner Brauereien;Donkerbruin/zwart, lichtdoorlatend, donker beige schuimkraag, weinig koolzuur. Aroma: zacht Roasty, Mout, karamel, iets nootachtig. Smaak: Niet heel roasty, vrij zoet, karamel zoet,  iets spicy, zachte bitter. Lichte body, wat waterig, zoetige en licht bittere afdronk. Matig!
Villacher Dunkel;Villach, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Vereinigte Kärntner Brauereien;Aroma is malty. It smells like roasted malt, caramel and chocolate. Dark brown to black color with a medium sized, good lasting, off-white head. Flavor is heavy sweet. There's a dominant caramel note escorted by roasted malt, milkchocolate, milk and some herbal notes. Body is light to medium, mouthfeel is thin to creamy. Finish is medium sweet and short. It's very sweet. I like it. 0,5l bottle.

Villacher Dunkel;Villach, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Vereinigte Kärntner Brauereien;Draught. Dark brown colored with a medium sized beige head Sweet and malty aroma of caramel and cane sugar. Sweet and malty flavor of caramel and bread. Sweet finish.
Schleppe Dunkel;Klagenfurt, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schleppe Brauerei (Villacher);[on tap] Deep brown body, thin beige head. Mild caramel, burnt sugar and chocolate aroma. Nutty and roasty flavors are covered by an overwhelming caramel sweetness. Enjoyable but not too balanced.
Schleppe Dunkel;Klagenfurt, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schleppe Brauerei (Villacher);"Wow, I finally found some information about this beer. I first had this one when visiting friends in Austria. This was one of the first ""good"" beers I ever had, and it has stuck with me. Probably more nostalgia than anything wrapped up in it. Decent selection."
Schleppe Dunkel;Klagenfurt, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schleppe Brauerei (Villacher);"Red-black color, brown head. Aroma is sweet and malty. Tast is very sweet, some acid, light alcoholic. Dry aftertaste with som roaste malt aromas. I don't like ""Dunkle"""

Orchard Street Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Orchard Street Brewery;"Had this on tap at the brewery and is was much better. Still a bit watery but the body was much rounder and there were very nice hints of coffee. 10/17/02 - 2.6: The Incipient Stout is still under construction. The first impression I got from this beer was that it was way too sweet. At first sip you encounter a small hop presence, followed by what at first may seem to be a pleasant chocolate malt but then there is an overwhelming sweetness reminiscent of flat soda. This could definitely use a bit more balance, not to mention some carbonation. After the sweet [mostly] subsides there is a hint of espresso, although not enough to balance out the flat Pepsi taste (not even Pepsi...maybe shasta?; RC Cola...wait RC Cola is good - not RC Cola)."
Orchard Street Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Orchard Street Brewery;Lasting brown head. Great roasted carmel nose.Very sweet malt/espresso profile throughout. Cloyinginly sweet
Orchard Street Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Orchard Street Brewery;Great aroma that catches you and reals you in. Strong beginning taste but fades a little too quickly.
Orchard Street Stout;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Orchard Street Brewery;This is a beauty. I was in love with their porter because great flavor, but it seemed to lack something. This brew takes off where it left off. The color is almost opaque and the the flavor is much stronger and the palate is much thicker than the porter. reccommended to all.
Copper Tank Fire House Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Bit of head and some lacing. Nice flavors in this, with a light body. Seemed thin for a stout, but still enjoyable. Smooth going down, my second favorite at this brewery.
Copper Tank Fire House Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Thinnish and a touch roasty. Lighter than most stouts, perhaps bordering on what us Northerners would call a thick porter.
Copper Tank Fire House Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Dry, coffee flavors, lovely attractive colors...an excellent glass of beer and my favorite at the brewery. (on tap at Austin location)
Copper Tank Fire House Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Great for a brewpub stout....had all the right things about a stout and none of the wrong. Nice head, full of body and flavor....yum
Copper Tank Fire House Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Decent for a brewpub stout, nothing too good or bad except for a slightly unappealing and lasting finish. Coffee flavors, hints of woodiness, smoke? Not bad at all for a buck a pint.
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Slight aroma of bread, grains....almost non existent. Decent dark gold color. Thin white head. Off-sweet tasting malt up front....synthetic. Bitterness creeps in..mild and no complexity. Finishes with the same off-tasting sweetness. Thin mouthfeel. I’ve had better cheap beer.
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);used to drink this as an underage teenager. a dirt cheap lager that the price reflects but i must say ive had plenty of good memories drinking this shit.
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);(drain pour and ticks’ night) pours clear yellow with a very small white head, little retention, no lacing. honeyed corn, faint and sugary malts, herbal blandness for a very short finish. almost aggressive carbonation, light body - seems to have a slightly better texture than water.. drinkable (read not a horrid brew)
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Bottle [12oz]. No idea how it looks because I drank it out of the bottle, I imagine it’s a pale gold though. Aroma and flavour are sweet and grainy along with a hint of artificial honey. Thin bodied. It was handed to me at a yard party so I drank it, but I would never pay for one, it’s not good. -- Rated via Beer Buddy.
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);"I used to drink this all the time. If you closed your eyes and sipped it, you might not know there’s honey in there, just that it’s a sweet lager. I wish I could comment on the appearance, but I don’t recall ever seeing this outside of the can, so I’ll just give that an ""average"" score to be fair. Smells of sweet vomit. Women like it. Just kidding, if you serve it they’ll think you’re cheap."
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Originally rated September 2004. First of two reviews on Ontario, Canada brewed honey lagers. This one from Lakeport poured a golden-orange colour with a decent head that had little retention. Aromas were of malt with sweet hints. Had medium carbonation. Started off slightly bitter, and then finished on a mild honey note. This brew had lots of marketing behind it, being a buck a bottle (canadian funds) which is cheap here. This resulted in being in the top 10 sellers in Ontario (The Beer Store). O.K. That doesn’t say much, but this beer is pretty good for summer.
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);473ml can pours a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves no lacing. Aroma is cheap grains and hops. Taste is malty sweet with a terrible bitter aftertaste. Not good and not recommended.
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Pretty much as you’d expect from a discount brewer. Not much here but it is my preference of the macro honey lagers.
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);"341ml bottle. Had this one ages ago. Old notes say ""drinkable."" It doesn’t really stand out amongst the other buck-a-beers."
Lakeport Honey Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);341ml bottle. Served very cold - probably helped, and really its gota be from the bottle. Its cheap and not terrible. Its very sweet, not terribly great, not complex, off after taste. But all that being said its still better then some of the swill out there (and its brewed in my old hometown so...)
Old Market Mr. Toads Wild Red Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Market Pub and Brewery;A decent red, better then most of their beers. Pours a very nice deep red with a tan head. Not much of any smell, a tad nutty. Taste is smooth and malty, with caramel and a nutty finish. Had on tap at the brewery. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Old Market Mr. Toads Wild Red Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Market Pub and Brewery;On tap at Old Market, pours a deep dark red with a small white head.

Old Market Old Granny Smith Green Apple Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Old Market Pub and Brewery;On tap at the Old Market. This was an interesting brew, but the thing I don’t like about Old Market’s fruit beers is the artificial/candy sweetening taste that they get. This brew had an apple taste that only really reminded me of apple jollyrancher, I wish they would use real fruit instead of whatever artificial stuff they use. Overly sweet and candy taste leaves this brew tasting like one of those sweet green apple icicle pops.

Very hop-forward initial / more hops in mid, and then some balance takes hold / strong, dirty hop trails in the finish. Medium body. Some good mouthfeel/texture from hops. Perhaps too much hopping for the light O.G. Tastes much more like a hopped-up pale ale than an amber. Solid stuff.

Nose is floral, light pine, bitter orange, tangerine, mineral notes. Taste comprises sweet tunes, chalky minerals, orange pith, hint of tropical fruits. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close with a whisper of tropicana. So so IPA, wouldn’t call it British though, too much new world hop and not enough malt to replicate a Burton style IPA.
Old Market British Bombay I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Old Market Pub and Brewery;On tap at Old Market Pub in Portland, OR. Aroma was perfectly floral and hoppy, but had a slight hint of dishwater. Palate was pleasing. Taste was piney, but very bitter. Too bitter even. Not a great balance. Not a favorite, but would drink on occasion.
Old Market British Bombay I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Old Market Pub and Brewery;Nice aroma, appearance was a bit cloudy. Taste had a nice up front grapefruity flavor, which I enjoyed! Finish was nothing special. Overall it was tasty and I would drink again!
Old Market British Bombay I.P.A.;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Old Market Pub and Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Decent but fairly average. Bitterness really sticks with you. A little bit of a dry finish....kind of wierd.

Old Market Hot Tamale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Old Market Pub and Brewery;On tap at Old Market, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma doesn’t really show much of the hot peppers, with straw and biscuity malt. Flavour is extended intense, with burning hot peppers. The flavour isn’t really of anything other than throat-destroying spiciness. If that’s your thing, you might like it, but this isn’t well-crafted IMO.
Old Market Hot Tamale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Old Market Pub and Brewery;On tap at OMP. Holy shit is this hot. Pours a clear straw color with a small white head. A light grainy nose. Man, this is nuts, a smooth lager flavor for 3 seconds then massive burn of Habanero. This is super hot. Couldn’t finish a sampler.
Old Market Hot Tamale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Old Market Pub and Brewery;Keg at the brewpub, 11/11/14. Clear pale golden with a moderate off white head. Nose is bland, pale malt, light spice, straw. Taste takes off but in a bad way, big chilli kick, green pepper, chilli heat - 1 trick pony and a shit trick at that. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, semi drying close. Dum de dum de dum ....... WHY ?

Old Market Hot Tamale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Old Market Pub and Brewery;For what this is, this was exceptionally tasty. Although it is somewhat vegetal and earthy, with some inherent spiciness, but it never overdoes itself, it is not extremely overpowering. It does however have a couple of levels of spiciness, the first spiciness hits you right in the nose and burns a little bit, and then the second wave rushs over your palate and then fades away.
Old Market Hot Tamale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Old Market Pub and Brewery;Tap. Lightly opaque. Medium to light amber in color with a decent white head and fail lacing. Aroma is malty and somewhat vegetal. Light bodied. Flavor is Cave Creek Redux. Not quite as harsh and painful as Crazy Ed’s elixir but still this is a pepper dominated beer in flavor. A very quick malt sweetness is erased quickly by the capsaicin. Long medium hot burn. Fair, but you are better off having food with this one.
Old Market Hot Tamale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Old Market Pub and Brewery;On tap at the Old Market. Pours golden with a medium white head. Aroma is sweet, lots of pepper, hint of lime and some other fruitiness. Taste starts quickly sweet, then the pepper burn starts, really hot and long lasting. Quite a nice pepper beer.

Bohemian Brewery 1842 Czech Pilsener;Midvale, Utah, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;(En fût à la source): Base malté miellée frôlant le générique avec une couche de verdure craquante. Rien de fou, rien de déplaisant.
Bohemian Brewery 1842 Czech Pilsener;Midvale, Utah, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Draft at the brewery. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, fully lasting. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain, cracker), lightly to moderately hoppy (herbs), with notes of minerals and straw/hay. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Well, shucks. I’ve had three draft samples of this now and the quality is all over the place...3.9 at the brewpub on Friday, 2.2 garbage at Beerhive over the weekend, and 3.4 at the brewpub today. This seems to jive with overall impressions from their other beers...e.g., my friend Jeff had a very solid sample of the Dort, but mine (bought at the brewpub) was horrible. As with so many breweries in the world (including Germany), this place just doesn’t have the consistency factor (yet?). You may luck out with a great sample of this, or it might just be ok, or it might be terrible.
Bohemian Brewery 1842 Czech Pilsener;Midvale, Utah, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;"From can it’s filtered gold with a lasting white head. Clean, floral-citric noble hop aroma comes across as honeysuckle, lemon, apricot nectar, spicy touches of black fennel; clean fermentation provides clarity for hop and malt (which imparts a baked baguette toastiness), while the yeast imparts a subtle sulfur-mineral quality. Off-dry, hoppy and bitter, light-bodied but fluffy with a fun bounce of carbonation, finishing fruity and juicy with a small bit of pineapple twang that I didn’t get from tap (better carbonation and balance than the cans, going from memory). Canned 6/29/16, so age may be a factor, but even so it’s still in fine shape."

Bohemian Brewery Bavarian Weiss;Midvale, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Draft. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, fully lasting. Body is hazy light yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (cracker, light bread), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with a light note of lemon zest. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Little to no German Weissbier yeast character, but if they’re still making this with Czech lager yeast, that explains that. And indeed, it is mostly a malty affair (and pretty nice malt at that), with a little yeast and lemony character. Simple and light, but better than usual from this very inconsistent brewery.
Bohemian Brewery Bavarian Weiss;Midvale, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Tap. Pours light hazy straw, medium white head, nice lacing. Aroma is wheat, lacking traditional hef esters, citrus. Flavor is light sweet, no bitterness, twinge of tartness. Light body. Let it tart up a bit and call it a Berliner.
Bohemian Brewery Bavarian Weiss;Midvale, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;On tap @ Bohemian. Mostly clear golden pour with white foam. Somewhat crackery, but a lot of bread, some apple, and an oddly floral and grassy character. Slight grain husk bitterness to the finish. A little watery as well. Not my favorite.
Bohemian Brewery Bavarian Weiss;Midvale, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Had on draft at the brewery. Very light straw color, slightly cloudy. Nightshift esters, soft doughy maltiness. This is a restrained beer.

Bohemian Brewery Bavarian Weiss;Midvale, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Nice enough, though if I’m grabbing a hefe, I thin I’d prefer the more fruity and spicy hefe yeast. This was refreshing with hints of lemon and wheat. Easy drinking.
Bohemian Brewery Bavarian Weiss;Midvale, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Best weis beer I've had In a long time. The checz yeast makes a real winner. Nice balance very enjoyable. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bohemian Brewery Bavarian Weiss;Midvale, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;On tap at the brewpub pouring pale opaque gold with white head. The modest aroma offers up some grainy malts and echoes of citrus from the lemon wedge that they put in the beer. The taste has a nice yummy grainy maltiness laced with mild sweet fruity esters and a touch of malt or caramel or butterscotch or something sweet into the finish.
Bohemian Brewery Bavarian Weiss;Midvale, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;on tap 7/22/10... hefe? hazy very pale yellow color... it looks a lot like lemonade with a soft white head. it smells very similar to sprite soda???... lemony refreshing and calcium mixed with wheat, flowers and some grass. the flavor is a mix of wet wheat and a spicy dry finish along with the notes from the aroma. it is crisp, medium bodied and ridiculously quaffable. neat-o. 7/3/7/3/15/3.5

Bohemian Brewery 1841 Viennese Amber Lager;Midvale, Utah, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Pours golden/Amber. Earthy aroma with a decent light and yeasty bitter flavor.
Bohemian Brewery 1841 Viennese Amber Lager;Midvale, Utah, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Draft at the brewery. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, fully lasting. Body is medium to dark yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, cookie), lightly hoppy (flowers). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. At first I thought I was given the wrong beer because the color was so much paler than expected, but that’s partly because this was a sample in a narrow glass. Great head retention, as usual. Whereas the Czech pils aroma leaped from the same sort of glass, this seems to hide and say nothing at all. And just sweet and flabby in the mouth. Not as bad as the Schwarz, but very dull. I’m really pleased they got the pils dialed in, but it sure would be nice if their other brews were closer to that level.
Bohemian Brewery 1841 Viennese Amber Lager;Midvale, Utah, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Toast and honey, fall leaves and paper, sweet pastries and artificial apricot hoppiness. Light bodied, sweet with low bitterness, kind of unremarkable and plain but it is clean and the carbonation suits the sweetness and body.

Bohemian Brewery 1841 Viennese Amber Lager;Midvale, Utah, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Some copper and some malt. Amber pour with ok head. Tangy metallic finish. Shared at tasting.
Bohemian Brewery 1841 Viennese Amber Lager;Midvale, Utah, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Packaged on 4/14/16, consumed on 5/8/16. Golden orange. Fleeting white head settles into the wispiest collar. Pleasant nose of marmalade-kissed toast, vanilla cookie, creamed coffee, and hay dust. Trace of melanoidins is marred by hints of marzipan and fruit chews. Light tickle of loose-bubbled carbonation. Fluffy malt textures inundate the palate, backed by a gripping contrast of toasted pumpernickel bread and softer tobacco. Hint of sweet pecan accentuates the earthy medley of flavors. Subtle tartness and a slippery orangey fruitiness quickly emerge and hamper the drinkability as the body takes on a distracting limpness and sugary sweetness. A smattering of dusty melanoidins pokes through at times as the malt is thoroughly extracted. Well integrated hops show a fairly high level of oily flowery petal notes as well as an elegant and rustic tealike effect, although the sweetness is unassuaged. Rich, but wet, maltcentric finish is dabbed with an aniseed-like hoppiness and lingering spicy tobacco. I’m a bit surprised by the mediocrity of this, after having consumed several cans of the superlative pils. The malt does boast moderate depth from this having been decocted, but it’s too sweet and unclean to drink much of. Nice aroma, but that’s about it. Okay. Thanks for the can, Sledutah.

Bready, toasty malts dominate. Some mild floral hops and a bit of fruity ester qualities. Slight caramel to it, too. A bit more bitter than I’d normally expect.

Bohemian Brewery Cherny Bock;Midvale, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Draft at the brewery. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (malt syrup, wort, roasted grain, husks). Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, unclean, husky. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Shockingly poor compared to the wonderful Czech pils. How does the same brewery make both? Raw and dirty and rather sour too...couldn’t even stomach a 2oz sample.
Bohemian Brewery Cherny Bock;Midvale, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;They are calling this a Schwarzbier now on their menu, FWIW. Tap. Pours deep clear Ruby black, medium beige head, good lacing. Aroma is super roasty, lactose, a bit ashy. Flavor has a touch too much sweetness, light bitterness. A bit odd. Stale coffee? Light plus body.
Bohemian Brewery Cherny Bock;Midvale, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bohemian Brewery & Grill;Can from sledutah who helped me gather a bunch of these strange brews I was after.

Luo Yang Gong Beer 11º;China;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Luoyang Asia Brewery;A surprisingly decent beer, especially out of a green bottle. No skunkiness to it at all and a crisp, slightly sweet taste. Far and away beter than any of the major American beers. Too bad Ithink you can only get it in Henan Province of China.
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);OLD NOTES OCT 21, 2003 Very similar to the full strength. Good amount of flavour for a light beer. Sweet malt, probably better that most Aussie macro light beers on offer, and better price. But the fact remains...why?
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);330ml. bottle. Clear and amber in colour with a large white head that settles quickly. Good carbonation with a grassy aroma that has a hint of soapy water mixed with it. Mlat flavour with a dry texture and light bitter finish.
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Deep orange and alot of bitterness for a light beer. I did not think this was too bad for its class. Not much of a head though but alot of bitterness.
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);I must admit I cringe at even the thought of drinking a ’free’ light beer from a mates house, which played on me when I bought this, myself, from ’Con’s case place’ in Balcatta. Poured a clear pale straw with a thin soapy white head. Aroma of lightly sour grassy hops and husky gritty malt, quickly lost its pizazz as I quaffed my first mouthful. Flavour seemed balanced, malt driven with a light bitterness in the back and feint fruity esters across the palate. Slightly yeasty with a light body and a short dry aftertaste. Little complexity, but not a bad beer overall for a ’Light’.
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Pale orange/golden colour witha compact short lasting white head. Slight malt aroma. Pleasant bitterness but a bit watery and a touch of lemon. Overall not a lot flavour but I like the bitterness for a light beer.
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);I admit I overpraised the full strength version of this because it was sweet and malty and suited my palate at the time. This light also smells sweet but has no flavour at all. A dry finish like club soda. A waste even at 98 cents, like other light beers.
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Geez, the full strength version got a 1.5. This is half as good. What's 50% of crap?
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);This beer has a light yellow body - hue with a bitter initial flavor and a light body.
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);german style my butt. i'm astonished how many flavours ol_juntan got out of this, he mustve been concentrating very hard. i put this with some 11% grandridge supershine and it improved both beers considerably.
Haägen Premium Light;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Well, er, imagine regular Haagen and then water it down a bit, sweetish and bland, thats about all i can say.

Belle-Vue Kriek Primeur;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);Spring version of the regular Belle-Vue Kriek, presented as being made with fresh fruit, but it’s just the same industrial, sugary ’fake lambic’ as the original. I never did a side by side tasting of this with that original, but I remember it as being fruitier, rounder and sweeter, with less acidity. I’m note sure if this is still made, but I for one will not miss it.

Belle-Vue Kriek Primeur;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);Please note: this review is based on a bottle that has been properly stored for 16 years (vintage 1995) so it might not taste the same as a new one. Clear body, spongy pink/grey head. Amazing aroma, dried plums, cherry. After tasting... this beer makes you happy! Taste like Polish Christmas plum soup. Super!
Belle-Vue Kriek Primeur;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);When fresh even sweeter than the normal Belle-Vue kriek. Clear cherry red colour, pinkish white head.

Bitter mouthful, balanced out to some extent by some sweetish malts. Carries no hop flavour or good malt characteristics, which is hardly suprising. Alcohol is well hidden in the finish, and in all its not too bad to drink.

Batemans Summer Swallow (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;(Bottled) . its not golden ,yet is called a golden ale on the bottle , resembling more an APA - you know customary glowing bronze SNPA lookin kinda resemblance thing , i reckon, resting in the flute . drinking this isn’t as floral or zesty as you expect either for the style . rather malty driven , caramel , mild orange notes , wood, lemon bitterness , some mango ..... but these fruits and the overall character is rather subdued . Not bad though despite my moanng through most of the rating .....
Batemans Summer Swallow (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;Clear 500ml bottle (4.2%), best before mid July 2008, drank early May 2008. Poured into a Batemans half pint tumbler (twice). It was a light amber colour, clear and sparkling, with a good formed white head which sadly soon fell away to a thin wispy covering. Fairly sweet aroma, toffee apples and malted milk biscuits came to my mind. This is the 13th Batemans beer I have reviewed on this site. I obviously like their beers and this is no exception. It has a sweetish feel to it, although there is a dryness in the finish. I also detected spices (pepper, cumin and tumeric?), but the wife was cooking mushrooms in the room next door. Lovely summer brew and another fine beer from a wonderful brewery set in a smashing part of Great Britain.

Wieselburger Spezial;Wieselburg, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wieselburger Brauerei (Brau Union);On tap at the Krahvogel in Innsbruck. Can’t really go wrong with this one. Standard pilsener. Never revolting, never great. Aftertaste is slightly dusty and not the best. Goes down fast.
Wieselburger Spezial;Wieselburg, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wieselburger Brauerei (Brau Union);On tap at Elferhaus Innsbruck. Pours golden clear with large white head. Mild noble hop aroma confused by smoking establishment. Tastes like a hoppy helles, bready malt and noble hops. Finishes dry with subtle bitterness.
Wieselburger Spezial;Wieselburg, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wieselburger Brauerei (Brau Union);On bottle in the last trip in Vienna. It is a little bit hoppy and few malt feelings. A typical golden Austrian pilsner. Nothing very special but refreshing!

Michigan Brewing Barley Wine;Webberville, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Michigan Brewing Company;On tap at MBC Lansing. Deep translucent red body, medium tight buff head. Sweet nose with brown sugar, berries, toast, and alcohol. Aggressive body dominated by hot alcohol and sweet candy, with notes of brown sugar, caramel, and berries. Hot, dry, and a bit medicinal, with none of the flabby citrus/pine hops or oxidized caramels that I have come to dread in barleywines.
Michigan Brewing Barley Wine;Webberville, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Michigan Brewing Company;This was an interesting barley wine. Much sweeter than any barley wine I've had. It had a sort of syrupiness too it that I didn't particularly enjoy. It seemed out of place somehow. It was very drinkable, and it tastes quite alright. I don't think they quite hit the mark on this one though.
Duff Lager;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Niagara Falls Brewing (Moosehead);Expensive 350ml brown bottle at Cruzat in B.A. Labeled 4.5%. Pours a dense dark gold color with a slight head of fime bubbles and perfumy aroma. A full mouthfeel from the big carbonation. slightly sweet flavor balance, slight pale malt flavor and slight hop bitterness. Fruity notes and not very clean.
Duff Lager;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Niagara Falls Brewing (Moosehead);[bottle from FireWater] Fizzy yellow, quickly diminishing head. Stale, bready aroma. thin, watery body. Barely detectable dryness in the finish.
Duff Lager;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Niagara Falls Brewing (Moosehead);They told me i wasnt aloud the bottle and had to drink this out a plastic cup. Aroma is skunked cornish. Taste is terrible also, a seriousl rubbish beer, which i struggled to finish.
Duff Lager;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Niagara Falls Brewing (Moosehead);Had this at Castro’s, another Toronto bar owned by the same people as Sarah’s. Clear golden colour with a creamy white head. Slightly fruity aroma and flavour. Clean, crisp finish with a pleasant bit of hoppiness. A very well-made mainstream lager.
Duff Lager;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Niagara Falls Brewing (Moosehead);Had it at Castro's Lounge in the Beaches. Not much head on mine, bit of fruit in the aroma and the finish. Nice clean lager with a bit of hops. Not fantastic but at $2.99 a pint it was the best value I have got for my beer money in a while!
Duff Lager;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Niagara Falls Brewing (Moosehead);This is available at Sarah's Cafe & Bar as their House Draught. Sweet fruit aroma, golden creamy head. Apricot and citrus(lemon?) flavour. Sweet, smooth, clean with a crisp finish. A well done lager, nice draught on their patio.
Three Needs Doppelpils;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Little head but good lacing, nice medium golden hue. Good solid deeply flavored pils taste and typical beery/grainy aroma. I was a bit impressed.
Three Needs Doppelpils;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pretty heady. Not quite heady enough to call it a doppelpils, but it is a good pilsener.
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;"This ""Special Draft"" poured a very light yellow with a non-existant white head, even after a vigorous pour. To the nose it is very much like they’re Stone Hammer Pils. Doughy with very small slioght scent of citrus and a bit of hopps thrown in. It is smoother/ watery and doesn’t have much flavour. It smells much more than it tastes. The palate is doughy like the nose and dissipates quickly."
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;Just as pootzboy says freshness makes a big difference with this beer just like most F&M beers. Aroma is of light bread, slightly hoppy with floral notes. Appearance needs improvement: small mostly-to-fully diminishing white head with fair lacing, and light yellow colour. Flavour is malty with some sweetness and little bitterness. Body is light to medium with soft carbonation.
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;Tasted in Toronto. Obtained from LCBO. Tasted in pint glass. Appearance is golden yellow, clear with moderate white head. Aroma is faint, slight hint of bitterness. Taste was similar to very cheap corn syrupy macros.
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;"I disagree with the Canadian raters that put this brew in the Macro fizzy weak category...it’s not. What it is; is a fairly decent drinkable draft lager with better than average malt delivery in it’s smooth dinking character. Bought mine fresh from the brewery....that’s the key sales point on this draft...it's sold fresh and meant to be consumed fresh and that is the fact with most of F&M brews. Age never improves the character as it isn’t pasturized in bottles...they aren’t date coded, so I’m not surprised there are bad reviews from people who buy this at the LCBO out of date. The pour reveals a yellow-gold semi hazy liquid with a small head that reduces quickly to a light ring....carbonation is pronounced..the glass is lively. Light aroma of sweet malts and a musty hay smell. Starts crisp and peppers the tongue with effervescence as the main (light) body comes through with the balance definately on malts, light on the grassy hops... then the finish is nice...full malt departure with a long finish that has a lingering sour biscuit dough after taste. A nice drinkable draft. I will definately look at getting a pony keg for a patio get together with non beer geek friends...a good way to turn them on to fresh beer."
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;I bought it fresh and it tasted so 10 days later. Crisp with higher than average carbonation. Satisfying all purpose beer. Better than the national brands. Like the fresh brasserie beers I would have at college in Montreal.
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;Co-rated by Scraff... Very pale, amber lager. Aroma is very light... some straw and hay. No flavor. Not offensive, not good. Canada's version of Rolling Rock Extra Pale. Very thin. Light-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Well-balanced, but so is Evian bottled water. Short, crisp, clean finish.
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;"(Bottle) It appears by the ratings that this beer has been improved for 2003. F&M Special Draft shouldn't be a 1.2 - 1.8 rating; those can be saved for the Mols/batt's. Pours a thin, white head and a amber body. Pleasant nose of sweet malt that tranferred over to the flavour. There is some moss in there as well. Average."
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;Malty sweet aroma that was really powerful even when still in the bottle. Gold in colour thin head and little carbonation. Flavour is sweet the first few sips were okay but after awhile it got boring. It's interesting though. Creamy in the finish.
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;Sparkling gold with white head.Faintly sweet nose.A light bodied sweet lager
F & M Special Draft;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;Golden yellowish, malty, acidic notes. In short NASTY. I have to admit that it was a bit to warm.

Nodding Head 700 Level;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nodding Head Brewery;This is a tribute to the 700 level at old Veterans Stadium. It tastes like the beer they served up there during Eagles games. As close as a small brewer can get to MillerCoorsBud.

F & M Royal City Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;Pours gold with a thin white head. Not much of an aroma other than a slight citrus scent. Dull carbonation. Thin. Apples and grape flavours. Some bready malts. It has some good flavours but it’s so unpronounced.
F & M Royal City Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;Bought fresh from the brewery. Poured a pale gold color with a 3 CM white head that reduced fast to a surface covering thin light lace. Medium-low carbonation. Very faint odors of grassy fruity sweetness. Light and thin up front then the light body releases a faint apple/pear fruityness and suble tartness...like a weak malty cider. Finishes fast, thin and cleanly with very little aftertaste (just a slight metallic effect). An average tasting beer...a bit thin and flat for my tastes.
F & M Royal City Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;there is a bit of cream balanced with hops. A bit sweet. Not offensive but an average beer. Bit of head. Attractive golden yellow colour.

F & M Royal City Lager;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;Pale yellow color, very little white head. THe nose is really quite fruity with hints of apple. Spritzy body with a light fruitiness and very light touch of hops towards the end.

F & M Royal City Lager;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stonehammer Brewery;It had very average aroma, plain sweet. What it hit me was how sweet this beer it was. It had creamy texture ,yes but lack of other flavours makes this palate boring. Some more complexity would be interesting. Did not appeal to me and I do believe will not appeal to most.
Bitter End Trench Town Brown;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Dark appearance, minimal head. Bad mouthfeel, like wet cardboard. There was a definite off-flavor that made it seem like the hops and malt weren't matched up very well, and there was minimal carbonation. Kind of hard to describe, not one of Bitter End's better selections. But at least they're still experimenting with new beers, even when they already have proven winners.
Bitter End Trench Town Brown;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;typical brown ale, yet not as flat as most brown ales. the head was very short lived.
Bitter End Trench Town Brown;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Looked like coke, had a rather weak head. Better than most browns. Sweet aroma, went down very smooth with a crispness that most browns dont match.
Red Star Weizenbock;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Red Star Agave Grille;This is one of the few beers from the Red Star that I have really not liked. Sampled on draft at the brewery the beer poured a dark brown color with only a trace of a white head. The aroma was sour malt but nothing else. The flavor was sour and tangy. I could not detect any wheat or much flavor of any sort other than the sharp sour and maybe a hint of banana.
Red Star Weizenbock;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Red Star Agave Grille;This rating is going to be exactly the same for my rating for the Red Star Belgian Dubbel. That said the two beers taste exactly like a weizenbock with good flavors of cider, banana, and smoke. The weizenbock is a good beer and it fits its style.
Red Star Belgian Dubbel;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Red Star Agave Grille;A good version of a Dubbel. Very nice nose and a lingering pleasant taste.
Red Star Belgian Dubbel;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Red Star Agave Grille;This rating is going to be exactly the same for my rating for the Red Star Weizenbock.

Red Star Iron Horse Stout;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Red Star Agave Grille;Draft sample at brewpub. Pours dark black with dark khaki head. Sweet, smoky and roasty nose. Flavors of coffee, mild lactose sweetness and mild smokiness. Notes of chocolate and caramel. Tasty
Red Star Iron Horse Stout;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Red Star Agave Grille;Pretty decent stout. They usually have this. It is a local favorite definately worth trying. not too much aroma and can be unagreeable with the stomache.
Red Star Iron Horse Stout;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Red Star Agave Grille;Sample at the brewpub. Jet black color with medium and frothy khaki head. Thin, spotty lacing. Roasted coffee aroma, with hints of malt in the background. On the thin side and very smooth-bodied. Coffee and malt flavors are there but not very pronounced. The finish is dry and mildly bitter with a coffee aftertaste. Not bad, but could definitely use some more flavor and maybe a higher ABV.
Red Star Iron Horse Stout;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Red Star Agave Grille;Chocolate and coffee bitter smokiness. Good dry bitter hop notes, with roasted malts, dry and toasty. Dark black clear with light tan creamy lacing head. Medium to light bodied with smooth carbonation, under nitro. Starts dry and roasty with bittersweet chocolate and burnt coffee. Light sweetness of malt, malted chocolate milk and dry nuttiness. Finish is smooth bitter and mildly sweet. Bit of carbonic acidity but smooth overall, almost milky. Nice dry stout.
Red Star Iron Horse Stout;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Red Star Agave Grille;Nothing too special for a stoudt. this beer could use more body. It does have a smoothness to it from the nitrogen.
Red Star Iron Horse Stout;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Red Star Agave Grille;I really tend not to go much for this style of beer, but It mixes well for Black & Tan purposes.Draft only. This is the usual dry Irish stout that is almost always on their menu. It is very typical of the style. Dark black and thick. Large tan head that lasts quite a while. Roasted malt aroma with a hint of chocolate. Dry from start to finish with decent roasted malt and hints of chocolate and coffee.

Schladminger Dunkel;Schladming, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schladminger Brau (Brau Union);1/2 litre at a restaurant in the Planai resort. Malty aroma, brown with an off white head. Coffee and chocolate flavour, creamy texture. Pleasant

Free State Tazza Nera Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout;Free State Brewing Company;I didn''t know the etymology of Tazza Nera when I took my notes...but I noted that the coffee flavors are clearly here. Buttery flavors, too. Caramel head, more of a pitch black body than the Oatmeal Stout, with only bits of brown around the edges. Dusty aroma. My wife preferred this to the Oatmeal, but I don''t agree. Still tasty, partly because I like coffee stouts.
Free State Tazza Nera Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout;Free State Brewing Company;Not really to my taste, but respectable nonetheless. Like a shot of expresso (see if you can find the joke). The coffee flavors just flat out overbear the beer flavors, which is ok if that's what you're into. I like coffee, but... I think I'd have this again but only once in great while.
Free State Tazza Nera Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout;Free State Brewing Company;I liked the brew at first but why would you blend coffee with beer? I'm not going to rehash the previous rating, just keep the whole depressant/caffeine paradox in mind.
Free State Tazza Nera Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout;Free State Brewing Company;Somewhat light aroma, what is there is lightly roasty coffee and malt. Dark brown-black appearance, with a light but persistent head. Flavor is very coffeeish, with some lightly fruity hops (citrus? this doesn't sound like it would work, but it's really an okay blend) and highly roasted malt. Dry, grainy finish. Body is on the light side of medium, mouthfeel is a bit thin as this beer has a more watery consistency than most stouts. Tasty but overall a bit light. Interesting piney-coffee aftertaste.
Big River Grille Vienna Lager;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Starts sweet and keeps getting sweeter. Apple-like English yeast overpowers the bland malts, and the finish is virtually hop-free. Shoulda stuck with the Rocket Red.
Big River Grille Vienna Lager;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);"On tap at BRG in Chattanooga.

Sudds Lager;Chippawa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sudds Brewery Ltd.;I really liked this beer!...................................................
Sudds Lager;Chippawa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sudds Brewery Ltd.;"So I walk in the front door and there's a cooler filled with sixpacks, the brewery hidden in the back and the guy's living room off to the left. I ask what kind of beer he's got, and at least he's honest about it being mainstream lager, unlike many local ""microbreweries"". It's pale yellow with large bubbles but no head - there's a reason for this which I'll get to in a moment - the aroma of a mix of corn on the cob, herbaceous hops and fusels (I don't think this is high-gravity brewed, so that's a bit odd, really). Light, quick palate, heavy on the corn and cider notes. It's available in cans, which is crazy for such a small brewery. But DO NOT lay them on their side, because they leak (guess who's getting the half-empty can to taste, Paul?)"
Tsingtao Five Star Light;Beijing, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Beijing Five Star Tsingtao Brewing Co.;very nondescript, clear light yellow and very effervescent, almost tasteless. at least you know it will not give you the green apple two-step.
Tsingtao Five Star Light;Beijing, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Beijing Five Star Tsingtao Brewing Co.;Interesting, being from China, but a poor substitute for a real beer. I honestly only tried it because it was cheap and contained alcohol, and it served only a very basic purpose. Kind of a strangely sweet, fruity flavor. Not at all hoppy and not something I particularly cared for. But hey, did I mention it was on sale?
Tsingtao Five Star Light;Beijing, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Beijing Five Star Tsingtao Brewing Co.;"Hell yeah, brother. ""China''s State Banquet Beer"". What exactly is a banquet beer? I expected a lite beer flavor, which is a contradiction of terms, but this was pretty tasteful, maybe not really tasty, but it did have flavor. It''s reminiscent of a pilsener, with a decidedly german flavor. I''d bet they used Saaz hops. The beer is a beautiful bright gold color. I was expecting absolutely nothing, and I guess i was pleasantly surprised. Drink out of a pilsen or hefe glass."
Tsingtao Five Star Light;Beijing, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Beijing Five Star Tsingtao Brewing Co.;"The label says that this is ""China's State Banquet Beer"" - oh I feel so sorry for them! This stuff is thin, watery, weak, full of sugary fakeness, lacking hops, no head, no lace, and for an extra kick of krappy-ness, it's packaged in a green bottle! It gets a ""3"" for impression only because I will never forget it!"
Rock Bottom Cleveland Dawg Pound Brown;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);Draft sample at Cleveland brewpub. Poured clear brown color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate toasted nutty malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium roasted sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met with another solid drinkable beer.
Rock Bottom Cleveland Dawg Pound Brown;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);Dark brown, small white head. Aroma is coffee. Flavor is subtle coffee followed by chocolate and crystal malts and an almost nutty roasty taste. This was bigger than most brown ales and was pretty good.
Rock Bottom Cleveland Dawg Pound Brown;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);Nearly opaque dark coffee brown. Milde chocolate cakey aroma. SOme green nut tones on a cocoa spine. Some off flavors at times. Medium light nutty sweetness. Some floral tones in the aftertaste. Finishes off chalky and roasty.

Rock Bottom Cleveland Dawg Pound Brown;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);On tap in Cleveland - Poured very dark brown with a mocha head. Aroma is of roasted malts, nuts, caramel, and some coffee. I was impressed with the appearance of this. Looked almost porterlike. Flavor was malty, roasted malts, coffee, nuts, caramel. Palate was a little thin but quite smooth. For a brown I have to say this wasn’t bad. Just not real exciting.
Rock Bottom Cleveland Dawg Pound Brown;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);Had this at the brewpub while visiting Cleveland last weekend for the Disturbed concert. Light and floral nose, hard to pick up much in a smokey bar. The brew is a dark brown with a creamy brown head that doesn't stick around long. The flavor is bland and mild, the finish is long and slightly bitter. The medium to full body is fizzy and dry. Not much exciting happening here.
Rock Bottom Cleveland Dawg Pound Brown;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);Named after the Cleveland Browns famous fans (obviously), this nutbrown has a nice nutty sweetness to it that is almost ruined by the watery, thin texture. Now, I'm not expecting motor oil thickness, but this really needed some body to back up the flavors. Tasty, but could ues much improvement.

Aromas of Caramel and roasted malts as well as some floral hops. Flavor is quite malty and sweet. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, and a little fruit. Nice hoppy finish.

Golden yellow pour, snow white head, that did not last long. Hops just about outplay the light malt content in both the aroma and flavour stakes, decent enough blend with a hay/grassy nature to the whole brew, even though it has a semi-sweetness throughout before the hops produce a slightly bitter and dry finish to each sip or gulp.
EKU Festbier;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Pour golden color that starts with a nice and fluffy white head and last for awhile.

Švyturys Ekstra Light;Klaipeda, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Švyturys (Carlsberg);Gold appearance with a slightly clingy sweetness that comes close to but isn't sickly. Not one I would try again but certainly not one to avoid.

Lui Lui IPA;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;IPA;Long Trail Brewery;Long Trail brews this beer for Lui Lui restaurants, which is where I was last night and thought I’d give it a try. Tastes a lot like a typical Long Trail Ale, or maybe closer to their IPA. Pretty good. A dark copper color, pouring a moderate off white head and a pretty good amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is slightly sweet and hoppy but not overpowering. It’s a good tasting beer but not at all a strong IPA. A strong Pale Ale or a weak IPA if that makes sense. Hoppy and sweet, slightly bitter and pretty smooth. Easy to drink. I’d get it again.
Lui Lui IPA;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;IPA;Long Trail Brewery;This is does not look like a regular IPA as it has a dark bronze color. It tastes typical with a strong hops flavor. Overall it was an average IPA with a different look. I wish they had it in draft. I figured they would seeing as it is their brand on it...
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;light golden with a small white head,large loose bubbles that quickly disapate. Sweet malt aroma with a licorice flavor. I did not enjoy this one bit.
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;Bottle, cloudy light orange with a thin large bubbled white head. Corn-like aroma, with some sweetness. Dry ending. Watery weak mouthfeel. The best part about this beer was when I finished it and didn’t have to drink it anymore.
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;Good straw color,small foamy white head that managed to stay around for awhile.The aroma was malty and fairly fruity berryish but hard to describe exactly what berry it could be,I guess blueberry is what i'm coming up with.The taste was very diffrent,yah there was a fruit presence But again what kind is hard to put a finger on,it also is coming off as sort of tangy or sourish.Light malt flavor with an after taste that is fruity and very faint hops.It's a fairly smooth and watery brew with a unique flavor but over all nothing special.I wouldn't get in a twist trying to find this brew other then for a one time trial.
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;Floral, chemical prune aroma, like something rotting in a field of flowers. Standard gold with pithy white head. Lousy label, looks like 70's Celtics socks. Vegetable brothy, somewhat metallic, lightly sweet and tart. Badly hopped. If it were February, and I was stranded in Siberia, and I was out of vodka, I might buy another.
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;This had quite a hoppy flavor. I'm not accustomed to foreign beers that are this hoppy. Not great, but maybe worth a try.
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;Upon opening, has a wet paper bag aroma - not pleasant. Soapy, white head with clingy lacing. Very light golden in appearance - almost see though. Alcohol is the the prominent flavor. A cloyingly sweet boiled corn flavor is also prominent. This beer is not.....good. Difficult to finish the whole 500 ml - reminds me of a low-alcohol malt liquor.
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;Thin head which does not last long. Dissipates into a chunky unappealing foam. Smells like buttery mashed potatoes to me. Who knows. Color is yellow/gold with very little carbonation. Flavor is a little weak and watery with some malt. Finish is a little sour but goes down easy. Not a very good pilsner.
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;I actualy think this is pretty good. Murky color, medium sized head initally but fades to chunky white lumps. Aroma is somewhat spicey and medicinal. Rarher low carbonation, smooth tastes that is hard to nail down. You could drink a lot of this at a social event as it is refreshing and clean.
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;You pour yourself a tall pint of mild lager but you carry it into the bathroom cuz you''ve gotta take a leak. Leaving it near the medicine cabinet, you relieve yourself. Suddenly the medicine cabinet comes unhinged, causing lozenges, medicinal herbs, bitter homeopathic roots and assorted cough suppressant tablets to land squarely in your pint. After they dissolve you take a sip of your newly-created Frankenstein brew (thanks to MartinT for the inspiration for this rating).
Zolotaya Pena;Moscow, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium yellow, dense tiny particles, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (grain), lightly hoppy (herbs), with a note of solvent. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately bitter, moderately acidic. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Dull yeasty sourness with an industrial grainy and medicinal aroma.
Compass Creek Pale Ale;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Compass Creek Steakhouse & Brewing Company;Cloudy. Sweet fruity, floral nose. Flavor has plenty of hops, some orangey sweetness and a fine balancing malt. I was pretty impressed with the beers here after reading bad comments at pubcrawler.
Compass Creek Pale Ale;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Compass Creek Steakhouse & Brewing Company;This beer was bad. It was heavily oxidized. I could hardly finish my glass without wretching. It appeared okay with a hazy light amber body and a nice creamy looking head. I guess I should have sampled this before I bought a growler of it. Harsh cardboard taste dominated this beer's flavor. It was truly a disturbing experience. There were some hops in the background but they didn't do a thing for flavor. This was wretched.
Compass Creek Black Balled Stout;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Stout;Compass Creek Steakhouse & Brewing Company;Fruity malt and roastiness very well defined in both flavor and aroma. Nice chocolaty coffee nuances and a well rounded hop citric bitterness make this a first rate stout. Slight sourness just spoils a little in the aftertaste, but doesn''t take away the enjoyment.
Compass Creek Black Balled Stout;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Stout;Compass Creek Steakhouse & Brewing Company;Black body with a nice off-white head atop it. Toasted coffee notes in the nose. Chocolate and cocoa on the tongue with a bitterness that is noticable on the sides of the tongue. Some bittersweetness toward the back of the tongue that leaves a bit of dryness. Tasty brew.
Royal Duffer Golf Society Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;What the fuck is this shit and how is it from gilroy when my can says monroe, WI. Tastes horrible, one of the worst, most flat, most skunked flavors ever. And it doesn't even have the wide mouth on the can. Brutal at best.
Royal Duffer Golf Society Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Straw color, heavy haze. Clean bubble gum malt aroma, faint herb spice. Fizzy palate, sweet, sourness in latter half, grainy dry finish. Bud or Corona alternative.
Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Picked up a can at Family Mart in Naha. Golden ale color with white head and a bit of lacing. Smooth mouth feel with nice tones of malt and just a touch of hops.
Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Pale yellow. White head. Slightly malty aroma. Initial taste is sweetish with a bitter modestly hoppy aftertaste From can so highly carbonated. It’s an average beer

Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);2018, drunk from can. Coarse carb and bitter front before biscuit malt sweetness kicks in. Adjunct grain flavour and feel unbalance what could’ve been a nice malty brew. In the end it’s a fizzy ricey miss that sits somewhere in the middle of macro output.
Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);7-11 Wuxing junction. Light orange in colour. Foamy head that leaves fairly quick. Nose is very feint sweet malt. Perhaps I drank this one too cold but the flavour was cleaner and not as cloying as other efforts. That said often in these seasonals if you leave them the flavour opens up. This one was sharper and cleaner and more like a standard lager. Light grain and corn malt. Dry finish. I like it as a standard lager but don't get why it's an Autumn brew. More like they had a stab at a new beer and thought.....'heck we'll keep that recipe for the future'. Overall clean and refreshing but not a 'speciality' beer.
Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);I drink this every year because I love the can design and I can’t resist. It’s a Japanese macro lager and goes well with food, even fish. A little on the heavy side and if drunk quickly retains a thin head near the finish. Session beer for me, not a sipper and that’s the way I likes this one.
Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Can bought at Family Mart in Suzhou, CN. Nose has nicely fruity hop notes, even some mild mango or passionfruit - something similar to what i pick up from sorachi ace, but really muted. Flavor is good, but a little less exciting than the nose - some light barley and adjunct (mildly sweet flaked corn). Finish is very good with a good punch of fruity hop resin bitterness that lingers for a few minutes on the palate. Good use of hops elevates an otherwise mundane strong lager.
Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);light aroma, gold pour. light flavor with a hint of citrus. good session beer.
Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Aroma: 4 skunky ordinary Appearance: 3 good for a pale lager. Not creamy enough Taste: 6 metallic, somehwhat bitter, malty sweetness, flat, not complex Palate: 3 watery Overall: 11 There’s no limit to how beautiful these cans can be. The photo here does no justice to this fabulous presentation. I wish they could be as dedicated to making better beer.
Kirin Aki Aji (Autumn Brew);Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Aroma: malt. Golden with little white head. Flavor of hops and bread. Light body. Dry finish.
Suntory Aki-Nama (Autumn Draft);Osaka, Japan;Pilsener - Imperial;Suntory Liquors Limited;Bought it at seven eleven in Taiwan as the end of summer harks the start of seasonal beer. Pours a dark golden orange with a nice head which settles after a few seconds. Nose is sweet with traces of sacharin and boiled candy. It has a fairly strong taste compared to most Suntory and is more apparent the warmer the lager. Given this is an Autumn beer maybe it isnt meant to be drunk ice cold as it changed during my tasting. On first drinking it was mild with a slightly malty edge. There is less carbonation in these autumn brews I think. As the beer grew warmer the malt became more obvious. Finish is light and quick. This beer is 6% yet doesn’t taste overly strong. A nice change from the usual Japanese beer and a success for Suntory in my eyes who often fall behing Asahi and Kirin in the regard to the best beers of Japan.
Suntory Aki-Nama (Autumn Draft);Osaka, Japan;Pilsener - Imperial;Suntory Liquors Limited;Pours a clear golden orange. Nose is slightly spicy with hints of candi sugar. Taste is off putting, sweet candi sugar, anise, stale caramel body. I’d drink it only if i had aids and it was the only known cure.
Suntory Aki-Nama (Autumn Draft);Osaka, Japan;Pilsener - Imperial;Suntory Liquors Limited;Clear Golden with a medium White head. Corn starch scented. An adjunct flavored treat with some malty sweetness in the middle. At least the 6.5 ABV gives it some character to stand it apart from the dozens of other macros on the shelf.
Suntory Aki-Nama (Autumn Draft);Osaka, Japan;Pilsener - Imperial;Suntory Liquors Limited;Can. One of my first beers upon arriving in Kyoto, Japan. A pale yellow with a white head. Crisp and full body with high carbonation and slightly tangy.
Ginga Kogen White;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Can from Yamaya. Cloudy light gold, big frothy head. Aroma has wheat and corriander with some orange peel. Smooth, almost creamy. The citrus does enough so the corriander isn’t to dominant.
Ginga Kogen White;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Bottle... Poured cloudy yellow with a thin head.

Ginga Kogen White;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Has orange peel, smoke and cloves in the nose. Nice light body, slightly sour and yeasty and then a refreshing orange peel finish. Still too watery for me.
Ginga Kogen White;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;12 ounce can. Thanks to IslandHaole for this one. Hazy straw pour with big, white head.

Raccoon Lodge Ring Tail Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cascade Brewing;Tap at Horsebrass. Pale amber to golden colored, sparse white head. Pissy aroma and flavor. Sadly disappointing, certainly nowhere near an APA in character, this would even struggle if classified as a mild.

Clarks Traditional Bitter;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Two hand-pulled pints of this Traditional Bitter: Swan Hotel, Wellington (Shropshire) on 29th Sept 2012. Mid-amber body, clean and clear: an off-white head sat on top of each pour. The nose was more malty than hoppy: some semi-sweet molasses (toffee and caramel) hid the fruity, nut esters of the hops until the beer began to warm in the glass a little. The taste followed the smells: malts ruling the flavours with the hops just providing a slight bittering towards the end of each sip. It was fairly well balanced and not as malty as I might have described to be honest, lets just say it leads with the malts. An OK session beer but not one I’d seek out.

Fantôme dÉté;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Poured from a 750 ml bottle of one of the recent batches, 2014 I believe. Aroma is malty with toasted bread, nuts and caramel. Some fruity esters with red apple, pear and banana being most prevalent. Light citrus notes. Some phenolic notes with pepper and clove. Slightly woody note as well. Pours a slightly hazy, amber brown with a large, moderately thick and frothy, tan head that recedes fairly quickly. No lacing or legs. Flavor is slightly acidic with a medium light sweetness. Malt notes of toasted bread, caramel and nuts. Medium light fruit notes with pear, red apple and stone fruit as well as some lighter banana and raisin notes. Medium light bitterness. Light woody note. Light pepper and clove phenolic notes.

Fantôme dÉté;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;750 ml capped and corked bottle, label says best before end 2017. Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy brown color with pretty much no head whatsoever. No lacing, either. Aroma is subtle at first but gets stronger as the beer warms, it smells like red apples, caramel and woodiness. Luckily the flavors are stronger in comparison to the aroma. It tastes like red apple, cherries, caramel, vinegar, stone fruit, earthiness, oak and some light spiciness. The tartness is subtle. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with very low carbonation. I thought this was OK overall, it’s not my favorite Fantôme brew but still an interesting one. I’d like to try a different batch of this in the future.

Three Needs Old Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Draught pint at the brewery, 11/4/05 with Muzzlehatch. Three Needs beers have a very odd appearance. They’re quite hazy and unfiltered, which is encouraging, but past that there’s a small head that quickly fizzles away to nothing, with no lacing and looking rather still in the glass. This one has a slightly beige-off-white head, with a dull amber to dry-hay colored body. Nose shows lightly fruity yeast (apples, cherries, dates), a round, clean caramel and toffee malt, with some expressive base malts as well. Strong floral/grassiness in the nose, with light chocolate on end. Flavor is lightly sugary dough, with more fruitiness and a touch of raisins and white grapes. Dates and almonds, with lightly grassy, hay-like hops and just a touch of toasted malts. Soft, creamy, low carbonation, no alcohol apparency. Maybe a touch of wateriness, but very minor on the end.
Three Needs Old Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Deep red brown ale with little off-white head. Light burned caramel aroma. Grassy notes in nose. Strong nuttyness with sweet malts, and harsh bitterness in finish. Medium bodied.
Three Needs Old Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Looks like Dr. Pepper pouring out of the tape; no head. Nose weak, slightly malty. Chocolate, slight grapiness in the flavor; excellent creamy/winey mouthfeel; hops very subdued. A caramel sweetness grows with warmth. Not great as barley wines go, and rather low on the ABV I think, but drinkable. Sept 03. Earthier, heavier, richer this time. I like it. Leathery and smoky."
Three Needs St. James Stout;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;on nitro-pours a creamy light tan head that laces and black color. Aroma is dark malt-coffee. Taste is slightly sweet, dark malt-coffee, secondary bitter hops. Mild carbonation.
Three Needs St. James Stout;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours rich and opaque with a thick nitro head. Dry roasted malt aroma.

Three Needs St. James Stout;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Sept 02: Pours nice, good thick stout look with a small but everlasting head. Downhill after that I'm afraid; too carbonated, thinnish mouthfeel, flavor very mild with chocolate and wine (white zinfandel most likely) dominating. Very little nose. Why bother? Feb 03: Vastly better 2nd time around. Carbonation at a decent level, roasty effects stronger, incredibly rich and smooth mouthfeel, slight thinness at the end is the only real problem. Not distinctive enough to be great, but delicious enough to have again."

Sly Fox Whitehorse Wit;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served a lightly hazed yellowish amber color with a one finger head of fizzy looking white foam. The head fades very fast leaving a rather tiny bit of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell The aroma is heaviest of a citrus smell of tangerine and grapefruit as well as a strong showing of a wheaty and yeasty smell. Aromas of banana and a bit of a grassy and slightly funky smell are there as well, giving a rather nice sweeter and yeasty wit smell overall. Taste – The taste begins with a nice sweeter citrus and wheat flavor with a good deal of tangerine and orange and some nice wheat bread tastes. Upfront there are also some nice notes of banana and candied sugar which add to the overall sweet flavor of the brew. As the taste advances some of the sweeter candied sugar tastes and fruitiness of banana and tangerine decrease a bit, but all the while are replaced by some more yeasty and slightly sour lemon flavors. The yeasty tastes bring with them some lighter spice flavors of coriander and clove and with a hint of a grassy and hay like taste, one is left with a rather present, moderately sweet lemonade like and very tasty wit taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thinner to average side with a carbonation level that is rather average. The average body is great for the mix of yeast, fruit and wheat, all while the average carbonation keeps it very easy drinking, but yet does not hide any of the wheat, yeasty, or spiced flavors of the brew. Overall, it is rather well done. Overall – A quite tasty wit overall, with a great level of flavor and balance for a brew of only 5.3 %. A nice one to try if you get a chance.

Wachusett Octoberfest;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wachusett Brewing Company;12oz in Boston. Warm and rich autumnal beer, heavier malting and sweet earthiness. better than a ’premium’ lager with richer caramel-copper malting and a little spice. Rich and tasty.
Wachusett Octoberfest;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wachusett Brewing Company;Not a lot of fragerance but has a wonderfuly crisp fall taste. A sharp, well balanced, yet wonderfuly light beer.
Wachusett Octoberfest;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wachusett Brewing Company;Bottle from Harvest Market Pours a clear copper color with a smallish off white head that hangs around for a bit. Light toffee and earthy floral hops in the aroma along with a hint of mineral water. The flavor is light toffee and sweet malts with a light fruity twang. Light earthy hop provides some balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick watery mouthfeel. Nothing horribly exciting here, pretty poor excuse for an Oktoberfest, I wouldn’t buy this again.
Wachusett Octoberfest;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wachusett Brewing Company;From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Brass-amber colored pour with a swiftly fading white head and busy carbonation. Nice aroma of toasted biscuit malts, caramel, butter, and general sweetness. The body is medium. The taste also has an upfront maltiness with a slightly more bitter bite but not in a floral, earthy hopped up fashion. Just a slight lingering finish. I enjoyed it.
Wachusett Octoberfest;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wachusett Brewing Company;Light musty caramel aroma. Copper orange color. Starchy malt flavor, light enough to have some bitter hops evident. Crisp like a pils, overall too light though.
Wachusett Octoberfest;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wachusett Brewing Company;Bottle from Half Time. Pours light copper with a slight, transient beige head. Mild caramel/roast aroma. Flavor starts toffee, moving to a bit bready, picking up some grassy? hop, and ending a little papery. Balanced, but rather bland.
Berkshire Bobs Half Wit Hefeweizen;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Berkshire Brewing Company;On draft: Nice sweet wheat and herbal aroma. Golden yellow hue. Clean white head. Sweet maltiness and citrus flavors, some spice and clean crisp dry finish. A very enjoyable, quaffable brew. Always love the BBC's.
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Draft: Foggy garnet. Microscopic bubbles slowly surface to form a small head. Unrefined aroma of spent hops, tobacco, red berries, and smoky molasses. Condensed carbonation. Heavily dense body, but equally slick. Spent hops prevail in the flavor over a shadow of tealeaves. Gritty with an earthy mulch texture and overbearing mineral and leathery astringency. Masked melon note lends much-needed softness to the body, but only somewhat compensates for its utter lack of finesse. Wet paper abounds, but, interestingly, there’s no sign of oxidation. Harsh, overexerted 2-row pungency runs rampant and compounds the overall wreck of flavors. Softly hoppy finish, but clamorously firm in body, as the more-vivid hop elements fail to blossom. While this showed no signs of overaging, the fact that it was virtually unpalatable, is quite puzzling.
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Thanks to Tom Nickel for sharing this stuff with us. This stuff had some age but still had plenty of legs left. Heavy malt aroma and taste up front with flavors of dried fruits, toffee, caramel and sugary sweetness. Still had a nice hop bite to it along with a nice alcohol punch. I think this stuff was on the downside of what was a great life but still very enjoyable.
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Pitcher. A poorly balanced beer that may have gone south, considering the lack of carbonation and the meek hop activity. Brown. Hints of caramel, apples, chocolate, resinous hops and a huge scent of wood in the aroma. Caramel and chocolate in the flavor, but above all this was served nearly flat and the flavor was just not there.
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;This beer was had on tap at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival 2004. This beer poured a dark mahogany and reddish mixture color with a thin tanned head and a good degree of lacing. Ahhhhh, the aroma... you can tell right away that this is a barleywine. Sweet malts, caramels and fruits clash with a sea of centennial hops. Sweet candy, caramel, cinnamon and brown sugar aroma with a hint of citrusy hops. The flavor develops into a long-lasting full bodied array of sweetness upfront followed by a bittering hoppy and cocoa, coffee bean clean finish. Slightly dry brown sugar in the finish as well. Very little alcohol presence, but just enough to pick it up in the finish. Sweet, but very well balanced and extremely full bodied...this could be a scary beer if bottled or aged!
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Tasted at the 2004 Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest Amber brown color. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is cinnamon, caramel and malts. A medium to full bodied barley wine. Malts are fruity and sweet, touches of cinnamon and a little oak. There is also some nice spiciness going on here as well. Slightly bitter hops. Very smooth. Touch of molasses. An excellent sipping beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Very nice barley wine! Very rich brown and gold pour w/ a yellowish hue. Great head, and great lacing. Roasty, hazelnuts, and soury fermented fruit w/ hints of coffee in the mouth, and piney, soury fermented fruit and slight gym socks appeal on the nose. Creamy and yet aggresive w/ a full body.
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;(Draft: 2004 Strong Ale Festival, Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA. Day 1, Beer 5) The nose is freshly hoppy and quite malty, with an odd woody aroma, perhaps some wild, brown mushrooms. The flavor follows suit, very earthy, woody and mushroomy, and also some moderate smoke. These are all the dominant flavors. It’s also moderately hoppy and malty, but it’s the funky flavors that really draw your attention. Maintains excellent balance from start to finish. Medium body, somewhat dense and coating on the palate, but the hops keeps the palate somewhat clean in the finish. Ruddy, light brown color, fairly cloudy in appearance. Very large tan head shrinks to but retains a thin layer, leaving some patchy lace. Deserves a controlled tasting session out of a real glass, and where the barleywine can warm to room temperature. The nuances are probably lost because the beers are too cold (it’s a cold night here in San Diego).
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;"12/4/04. On draft at Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest in Carlsbad, CA 12/4/04. 2001 Vintage. Dark caramel brown with medium haziness. Deep orange outline on the glass. Awesome lacing. Funky cinnamon nutmeg aroma with a bit of a ""foot"" character. I’m not a foot fetishist, but I like it. Extremely interesting for a barleywine without completely abandoning the style. Big twigginess and aged malt. Cool mouthfeel with a sharp finish. Big woody flavors and bitter, seltzery soda. Nutty, citrusy with something lime-like beneath all the glory. Strange transformation in your mouth between the initial taste and the very nice finish. The flavor isn’t quite as strong as I’d like, but it’s very drinkable for the size and style. Probably the highlight of the Strong Ale Fest for me. I must’ve told 20-25 people that they HAVE to try the Tricentennial, and not a single one came back to me with a word of disappointment or complaint. I almost feel bad for giving this beer *only* a 4.3, but it was really a lovely, wonderful treat that I went back to time and again over the two days of the insane fest. I don’t know if or when I’ll ever be able to try this beer again, but I anxiously await that glorious day."
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;This barley wine pours with a deep amber body topped by a thick head with tons of lacing. The aroma is bitter and hoppy with alcohol esters, a strong pine note, some cinamon, and an underlying foot note. The flavor is slightly sweet yet bitter with piney notes, slight caramel notes and a touch of alcohol. Full bodied, tingly on the tongue and slightly dry.
Oggis 1701 Tricentennial Barleywine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;2001 bottle from Tom himself. Yummy... POurs a dark, deep brown in color with aromas of fruit and brown sugar. Flavors of evergreens and brown sugar again, with a slight chocolate feel. Maybe the best barleywine i've had yet.
Port Brewing Hop 15;San Marcos, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;September 19th, 2015 - Port's 15 Double Hop is a no frills, no thrills Double IPA. Clean and consistent, this is like the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale of DIPA's, and I love it. The color is a nice orange marmalade shade, with a generic IPA smell, and it's not even especially hoppy. But the flavor is where that brilliant familiarity lies. Balanced, good hops and a clean taste balanced on a comfortable body, this is a great beer to pair with food.
Port Brewing Hop 15;San Marcos, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;Taste pour from can as part of blind taste test from One Stop Market. Appearance is clear gold with gorgeous lazy sparkle with finger-width foamy off-white head with good retention and no lacing. Aroma is citrus pine and malty. Taste is strong caramel and bready malts with medicine-y alcohol not much hops except bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium side of light-to-medium bodied with smooth texture frothy carbonation and finish as taste. Overall nice mouthfeel but taste is more APA than IPA and IPA mostly for bitterness. High ratings seem to be from when bitter West-coast IPA's were king. Not feeling it in 2019.

Umiddelbart lækker delikat lidt sødlig humle, efter lidt tid bliver den lidt mere tung, sprittet og lidt maltet. Smagen er meget fyldig, medium/høj bitter som rundes af af noget malt sødme, forholdsvis meget sprit, efter lidt tid i glasset er der næste lidt Barley Wine over den, lidt sødlig bitter eftersmag.

Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Thanks Jon! Pours a clear honey brown with very little head. Smells of leather, rich fruit, caramel. The taste is rich fruit, caramel, tangy, strange ending...dry. The body is light/medium without much carbonation.
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);2002 Bottle at Monks after the cellar dinner. This bottle was totally grimed out from being in Tom’s cellar for the past 10 years. Poured a slightly hazy amber color, with thin off white head and a little bit of lacing. Aromas of wood, vinegar, dark grapes, plum, malts, pine, citrus. Taste was filled with delicious crystal malts and dark fruits, other notes of fig, pinot noir. Lots of vinous notes coming through with soft oak mouthfeel. Warming in the upper chest. Excellent beer, in my top 3 of the night.
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);A fairly old bottle. This beer was killer. Almost clear amber color with an off-white head. The aroma was fairly complex and not too oxidized. The aroma had a good sweetness to it with notes of Chardonnay, wood, and fruity malt. The flavor was malty with some vinous character as well. Hops really weren’t around but there was a bitterness at the finish that could have been from hops, the wood, or even the alcohol. There was enough flavor to cover it and any alcohol taste. Great warmth in the chest. Medium to full bodied. I didn’t even know this stuff existed. Yum
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Tap @ 2004 Toronado Barley Wine Festival. Hazy amber color with a foamy white head. Light vinous flavors with a tiny bit of fruit in the flavor.
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);2/21/04. On draft at Toronado Barley Wine Festival ’04 in San Francisco, CA 2/21/04. Dark copper-bronze color, almost like a plum wine. Scarlet edge. Not much head, but it's a rocky, very dark tan with slow and spotty lacing. Looks quite nice. But it isn’t. Not even close. Aroma is vinegary and vinous and holy shit. Flavor is grapey and vinegary, totally off-balance like I thought the beer was spoiled and off. A little leather pokes through, but doesn’t make it go down easier. This guy is a monster. But somehow, the body is surprisingly thin, also silky in texture. Finish is ridiculously hot and darkly malty beneath it all. Big grape flavors into wine with a sharp woodiness and balance like a one-man seesaw. What a disappointment.
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);This brew pours with a cloudy ddep amber body topped by a thin head with little lacing. The aroma is bitter, malty and oakey with lots of alcohol and a touch of fruit. The flavor is sweet yet bitter, woody and malty with a touch of friut and alcohol. Full bodied, smooth and warming.
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);I can't help but think it was not right (Toronado Barley Wine Fest '04) but because I was assured by several people that it was as it was supposed to be, I'll rate it. Where do I start? A dull, unenlightened brown. It is SOUR, but not in that good lambic-y way we're all familiar with. Aroma is actually quite nice--quite reminiscent of a good port, but perhaps a bit more treacly--lots of big fat red grape notes with smooth brown sugar/molasses malts. But flavor is surprisingly uncomplex, and bafflingly thin for such a big beer. Just sour with little or no malt complexity. Fetid. I did not find this complex or enjoyable in any way. Sorry.
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Murky, no head, burgandy colored. Interesting beer. Reminds me of Levitation by Fish Tales. Wine character to it. Wood comes through quite clear, I'm not sure I pick up any of the hops. Sour finish. Well done and interesting.
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Dark brown, flecks of red cranberry at the edges. . . Aroma of cherry malt, very good brown ale flavours, kicked up with undertones of the sour cherries, white grapes and green apples. Pretty good flavour, but a bit too 'winey' in the finish. Doesn't linger well for me.
Pizza Port Late Harvest 15 Year Anniversary Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Little head, immediately disapearing. Yeast in suspension. Deep brown beer with a reddish shine troughout. Nose: alcoholic - and a lot! Prunes - maybe slivovitch. Just tasted after 'Cuvée de Tomme', and the parentage is obvious. Taste gives wood & tannines, dark malt, prunes again, liquourish. Sourish tinge,and then: RAISINS in the way of the Flemish 'boerejongens' (=cherries or raisins preserved in jenever). Adstringent mouthfeel, alcohol (oh surprise!). No new aftertaste, unless you count the way your throat reacts after a triple brandy. This beer presented me some problems, finding the right descriptions. But Tomme is a magician, no doubt.
Fuller's Pale Ale;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);4/4/2018. Bottle at the Cricketers, Dorking.

Fuller's Pale Ale;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Thanks to Scopey for sharing a bottle with Finn and me at Fullers Builders Arms in Croydon. Pours a crystal clear golden-brown body with a tiny head and faint lacing. Malt-fruity aroma. Fresh fruity taste of noble hops and malty sweetness beneath. Short malt-fruity ending.

Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;Flight draft in Ludington. Dark brown pour with a white ring. Still looking. No real aroma. Nice flavor though with caramel malt and a hint of earth. Nice.
Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;5 oz. sample on 5-20-12 (Flight 2)-served a very dark brown with a ruby tint color, very sugary nose. Hits the mouth hard with a medium body, malt was strong, sugar in the middle was strong, and the finish of alcohol was strong. Whew!
Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours murky brown with a mahogany beige thin head. Light aromas of fruit and malts. Malty fruity flavors. Dried fruits, peat, and a touch of alcohol with a pleasant earthiness. Not bad.
Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;had this at the third annual MBG winter beer festival...the numbers are reflective of the sampling, however i added no notes. my apologies.
Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;Part of a sampler at the restaurant. I note that I had a cold when I visited and could not get a great sample of the aroma of the beers that I sampled. Not bad beer. Good hop flavor.
Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;Had this one on draught as part of the sampler at the brewpub in Ludington, Michigan. Best scotch ale I’ve ever had. Cloudy, dark brown pour with a foamy tan head. Almost bizzare cedar nose and taste, with an awesome smooth maltiness, no alcoholic aftertaste. Wow.
Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Muddy orang-brown body, thick cream head. Earthy, toasty aroma with nice sweetness. Creamy palate, with lots of brown sugar and toast, accentuated by light peat. Long, bitter, earthy hops finish. I detected a hint of apple, too. Alcohol is warming but not overbearing. Average complexity. This beer sipped nicely after a long day in a bog and cedar swamp.
Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;Pours a clear brown color with ruby highlights and a ring of offwhite lace. Weak aroma of toffee and earthy malts. Mild flavor of toffee and earthy malts, the flavor is stronger than the aroma but still the malt feels weak and thin. Light to medium body with a liquorous texture and gentle carbonation.
Jamesport Scottish Strong Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;All the brews were here were served really cold, so I ordered this one and let it sit for a while to warm up. This may have caused the aroma to be a little flat as I could just get a little dark caramel, but it was good. Great mahogany brown color with just a little light showing through the edges. Diminishing, creamy, off-white head. Brown-sugar, caramel, some peat malt (smoke?). Initially good flavor, thin middle and a warming finish with lots of good flavor: brown sugar and another hint of that peat/smoke flavor. Medium body, alcohol in the finish.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;Draft. Banana, clove and wheat malt aroma. Cloudy pale yellow with moderate head. Sweet orange/banana, clove and wheat malt flavor. Nice body. Very pleasant - nice maltiness.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;5 oz. sample on 5-20-12 (Flight 2)-served a murky dulled orange/yellow color, light clove and banana on the nose. Hits the mouth with a light medium body, malt is slightly stronger as opposed to other’s in a similar style, clove on the tongue with banana on the finish with yeast thrown in for good measure. Pleasant.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the pub: Decent hefeweizen. Pours yellow with a decent thick head. Aroma of bananas and cloves. Pretty tasty.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;Had this one on draught as part of the sampler at the brewpub in Ludington, Michigan. An outstanding hefe. Cloudy, opaque light yellow pour, served with an orange. Wispy white head with lots of banana, orange and cloves. Simply awesome.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;Pours a hazy yellow color with a thin white head. Mild aroma of cloves and banana. Bland flavor of cloves and bananas. The body is light with an oily texture and lively carbonation. The yeast and ester presence is not strong enough to make this beer interesting.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;Banana, clove and a hint of sulfer. The sulfer fades after the initial sniff. Cloudy yellow with a thin, white head. Nice flavor with a bit of the banana and wheat twang, but the spiciness (clove, black pepper) is most prominent. Sweet, but not candy-like. Thin body, watery palate.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;Pretty much what I expected and was looking for in a Hefe. Smooth and refreshing, with just the right amount of fruit aftertaste.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;Based on my ratings, it was a good visit to this pub. Another brew that was strong on style. Wheat beer with light body cloudy appearance wtih aroma and flavor that was good balance of wheat and banana. Each of the brews I tried had a very distinct pleasent finish.
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;"A little acidic flavor components; otherwise a standard, fair-quality banana-laden hefe - looks the part. TOO cold!"
Jamesport Hefeweizen;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jamesport Brewing Company;On the estery side of the weisse world, though a sumberged citric tang does surface now and again to duel with the banana.
Jamesport Reds Black Cherry Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Being so close to the cherry trees of Michigan, I was looking forward to this. But I’m pretty sure they got this syrup shipped in. Red black color with a soapy head. Strong cherry aromas that are too much machino cherry. Artificial cherry flavors that are syruppy and begin to remind me a little of cough syrup. Oh and that just gets worse, change that little into a lot. The syrup just kills it.
Jamesport Reds Black Cherry Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap. Pours dark brown with some ruby highlights. No head. Aroma is cherry and chocolate. Flavor is sweet cherry, almost artificial, some dark chocolate. Palate is medium bodied, mildly carbonated, finished sweet and tangy. Again nothing special.
Jamesport Reds Black Cherry Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter;Jamesport Brewing Company;Draft at Jamesport. Dark reddish/brown color with a small off-white head. Moderate cherry and chocolate aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture. Moderate cherry, chocolate malt flavor with a medium tart bitter finish.
Jamesport Reds Black Cherry Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter;Jamesport Brewing Company;Definitely a battleground beer as some remarkable bitters - hard, edgy, graveyard herbal tones - take on the decent cherry essence. Red battles black in the color, too. Interesting.
Jamesport Golden Cream Ale;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Cream Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;Clear golden color with scant foam. Slightly oily, creamy palate. This ale has a very slight sweetness, but is really rather boring. And it was served altogether too cold - I couldn't catch the aroma. It almost froze the glass when poured!

Pizza Port Frank Double IPA;Carlsbad, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);I know way past its prime. All hops nose is gone. Just big malty back bone. But I can still taste how great this beer was when it was fresh. I’m sure amazing.
Pizza Port Frank Double IPA;Carlsbad, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Sehr süßer und würziger Geruch, der Hopfen ist zwar erkennbar, geht aber zwischen den anderen Tönen fast unter. Süßlicher Antrunk, wie im Geruch ist der Hopfen erkennbar, wirkt aber fast schon schwach, stärker im Vordergrund steht die Malzigkeit und der leicht würzige Unterton. Zum Ende hin wird das Bier kurz alkoholisch, kann sich durch den stärker werdenen Gewürzton doch noch beherrschen und gefällt hier durch die stärkere Hopfigkeit. Zum Ende prickelnd, eher mild und mit wenig Hopfen. Vielen Dank an den Doppelbock für das Teilen des Bieres! Test vom 1.10.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 10,13,11,12,11,10 - 10,95
Pizza Port Frank Double IPA;Carlsbad, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Sampled at the Double IPA fest. Really nice big sweet hop bomb. Port Brewing always delivers when it comes to hoppy beers.
Pizza Port Frank Double IPA;Carlsbad, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"12oz bottle. Pours a bright, clear golden orange color; perimeter of white bubbles at the edges of the glass; patchy lacing. Solid presence of candy sugar, dried caramel (some oxidation at this point), and residual citrus and earthy bitterness in the aroma; despite having certainly lost a ton of hops, the malt core remaining in the nose is quite nice; like an aged, light-bodied barley wine. Loads of sweet dried caramel, candy sugar, dried oranges upfront; good levels of carbonation; decent amount of viscosity in the mouth, a touch of warmth, and solid levels of bitterness (earthy, citrus, some floral notes); soft edges, good depth in the malt character, still balanced, though certainly not the hop bomb it once was (this is my only experience with the beer); I imagine this to be remarkable fresh; it’s still very enjoyable and pleasantly composed with age behind it. Lengthy finish, with relaxed bitterness: earthiness, candy sugar, and some dry toasty malts."
Pizza Port Frank Double IPA;Carlsbad, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);First taste GABF in 2004. Second taste from an aged bottle. Mostly clear orange copper colored body with a small white/tan head. Nose has a big, stinky, dank, wet orange hop note, no doubt tempered by age, and moving more towards a nutty, old orange and cardboard/bran character, dampened hops on top of some chewy malt. Flavor is resinous, old oranges, little to no apparent oxidation noticed, not the typical wet cardboard at least, but some sort of wet, nutty, orange fruit and honey flavor. Texture is resinous, oily and properly thick, and there’s little to no bitterness left after all this time. Sweet, sugared oranges and pine needles in the finish, it’s still quite delicious. I have to compare back to 2003 when I had Frank on draft at the GABF (too far gone for a proper rating), and I remember it being unbelievably dank, vibrant and thick, with a smooth-but-rough bitterness throughout. Quite different now, but still really good.
Pizza Port Frank Double IPA;Carlsbad, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Courtesy of kmweaver. Cloudy amber body with a small beige head. The nose is rich caramels and toffee, citrus and floral hops. The flavor is moderately sweet, moderately bitter with grapefruit, tangerine, lots of caramel and honey. Medium/full body is soft with light carbonation.
Pizza Port Frank Double IPA;Carlsbad, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Bottle, courtesy of Dr. Bill. First 2/3 of the bottle pours pretty clear. The bottom one-third is sludgey. My sample came from that 1/3 so that’s most likely affecting my rating. Aroma is soapy. Also basil, mint tea, and forest smells. My sample is phenolic and slightly acrid in the back of the tongue. Not in its best form.

Millstream Oktoberfest;Amana, Iowa, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Millstream Brewing Company;"Very crisp amber and light copper coloured body with a nice, three to four centimetre tall off-white head that leaves a pretty lace on the side of the glass. Aroma of light nuts, metal and a relatively astringent scent with some alcohol and biscuity malt, but ending with some light caramelised sugars. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong grassy and malty flavours up front with some light nuts, caramel and earthier notes that show some herbal characteristics, a dose of biscuits, but ending with a spicey quality that shows some malts and drier flavours and a hint of caramel and toffee at the end. Aftertaste shows some grass and sweetness from pitted fruits like prunes and apricots with a caramelised sugar and toffee note at the end, but relatively balanced throughout. Overall, a nice and enjoyable beer with a good quality throughout, especially on the sweet side of things. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Hy-Vee in Omaha (Papillion), Nebraska on 07-October-2019 for US$1,99 sampled in my hotel room here in Omaha, Nebraska on 09-October-2019."
Millstream Oktoberfest;Amana, Iowa, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Millstream Brewing Company;Deep, dark, clear amber topped with a tall, thick off-white head that leaves nice-looking strings and loops of lacing. The head has good retention, with a thick domed top. Bready malt aroma with sweet caramel. Very malty taste, freshly baked bread and sweet caramel. Excellent lingering taste throughout, great flavor depth, finishing just a bit on the sweet side. Malty with no bitterness. The aftertaste remains on the tongue for quite some time, as with the intitial taste, bready, thick, and slightly sweet caramel. Mouth feel is moderate to thick, like bread dough. Overall, an excellent, well-done Märzen for those that like the darker, maltier, earlier Oktoberfest style (and I do).
Millstream Oktoberfest;Amana, Iowa, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Millstream Brewing Company;Millstream regularly puts out good German-style beer, and there's a lot to like about their Oktoberfest.

Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);FTA: extremely thin pale lager. Served in huge bottles. Flat, rancid and not to be considered beer.
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Man kann grade noch so schmacken, das Hopfen verwendet wurde. Aber nicht viel, ähnelt der Geschmaak dem von Wasser doch sehr. Bochkarev Barreled: Bleib in Russland. Test vom 25.9.2004, Gebinde: Dose Noten: 8,6,7,4,6,7 - 6,45
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);This beer does have some properties of yeast and good carbonation, but the rest of taste falls flat with vegetal overtones. not really worth the time.
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);The aroma has some water, yeast, and cheap malt but thats about it. The appearance is milky pale gold with a two finger head. The flavor is watery with some malt and paper. The palate is very watery. Yet another Russian flop.
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Bottle at Fort Wayne Tasting. White small head that mostly diminished, sparse lacing, minimal carbonation, transparent, and a pale yellow hue. Nose was malt, some corn and some breadiness. Flavor was some corn and metallic. Tingly mouthfeel. Light body. Not impressed with this brew. Nothing that will knock your socks off.
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of frothy bubbles that were and left behind a semi-hazy softly carbonated yellow-white colored body and a poor lacing. The aroma was malty and mildly grassy. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt and mildly grassy. An OK brew just nothing special.
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);From a bottle shared at thedm’s. Straw colored with fizzy white head. Light bready nose. Some biscuit and citrus, but mostly just thin and like every other imported Eastern European lager.
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);bottle at the fort wayne tasting - Pours yellow with a thin medium sized head. It has a light malt and grain aroma. It tastes mildly sweet with corn adjuncts and has a thin, watery mouthfeel. Fizzy and weak... did we really need to import another bad pale lager?
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Sweetish corn, malt and corn starch aroma. Dirty yellow with a fluffy off white head that is somewhat lasting. Honey, corn starch flavors with steeped grains and almost no hops. Not at all as bad as eating glass or getting caned in Singapore. It does have a very nice mouthfeel for a pale lager.
Bochkarev Bochkovoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Bottle. Light amber beer with a big white head. Light grainy/malt aroma. Sweet grainy flavor with light fruitiness. Blah. Easy to drink. Could have been much worse.
CooperSmiths Dunkel Munich;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Draught. Head is mostly lasting. Body is light amber. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie, caramel), lightly hoppy (flowers, herbs). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately bitter, husky. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Pretty dang light and bland for a dunkel. Grainy.
CooperSmiths Dunkel Munich;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Pours hazy bronze with a small off-white frothy head, lined lacing. Yeast (leather, sweat) and malt (husky, corn) aroma, not very appetizing or inviting, kind of lacking in the aroma department. Flavor is sweet corn, burnt butter and malt, sweaty yeast, tart and medium acidity, low sweetness. Light bodied and slightly fizzy with a dry finish.
CooperSmiths Dunkel Munich;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Had this at the brewery. Beer was a hazy, light brown color with a small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing head that left behind neat-looking points of lacing. I think the color was a bit timid for a Dunkel, and the aroma was pretty shy, too. All I could detect was a trace malty aroma of toasted grain and a trace ester of honey. The flavor was moderately sweet with an average-length, moderatly bitter, lightly sour finish. The body was light-to-medium, the texture was watery and the carbonation was lively. Not bad, but not really that engaging, either. Didn’t seem to fit the Dunkel description that well.
CooperSmiths Dunkel Munich;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Amber. Light malty, grainy aroma. Taste is dark, grainy malts. Balanced spiciness, ginger and maybe licorice root. Evident German malts, slight bitter hopping. Well made, but too fizzy and light bodied as many Coops beers are.
CooperSmiths Dunkel Munich;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Brown. Delicate, lively and lovely aroma with hints of sticky fruits, clove, coffee and toffee. Caramel and toasted maltiness with a nice coffee flavor. Dark, roasted flavor. Very fruity for a lager. Lovely for the style and probably my favorite Coop’s beer to date, besides that monstrous barley wine.
CooperSmiths Dunkel Munich;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;One of my favorites at Coopersmith's. Dark and roasty, great on a cold Colorado night.
CooperSmiths Dunkel Munich;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Clean and very easy to drink. Had a curious, clear-copper color. Excellent roast flavors. Hints of burnt toast. Light in body, yet not compromising in flavor. A good rep of the style, IMO.
Oasis American Rye;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Oasis Brewing Co. & Restaurant;Draught. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (grapefruit). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter, lightly acidic. Finish is moderately bitter, lightly acidic, lightly sweet. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Not much going on in the aroma department, but the flavor balance is good.
Oasis American Rye;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Oasis Brewing Co. & Restaurant;Bready, biscuit-like malt flavors. High carbonation with a VERY dry finish. Didn't seem to exhibit classical rye flavors... or, it didn't have a good hop presence to complement the rye additives. Most rye beers I've had have a curious and tasty fruity-malt flavor, which this beer didn't have. Actually, this beer didn't have a whole lot of flavor at all. It was just light, clean, and dry.

Van Pur Extra;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;"Hazy amber with a small, off-white head that faded to scum and a good deal of carbonation. Aromas were musty caramel malt, sour grass, Bit O’Honey and Lemon Pledge (is this ""Polish"" or ""polish""?) Flavor was honey-sweet with fusels and light bitterness to end. Metallic finish-flavor/feel with a somewhat syrupy consistency. All-in-all, barely better than average. Bridgeview Liquors, Bridgeview, IL"
Van Pur Extra;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;Awfully full of corn syrup to be much of a pilsener. Gold and headless, its aroma is a mix of caramel sweetness and lighter fluid. It’s sweet and grassy with a light herbal hop finish. And it’s not worth repeating. Bridgeview Liquors, Bridgeview, IL
Van Pur Extra;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;Big off-white head atop lightly hazed amber body. Aroma is mild sweet, somewhat astringent, grassy/herbal, light bread, light caramel. Taste is sweet, caramel, light alcohol, light herbal. Watery medium-full body, somewhat sticky.
Van Pur Extra;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;Dry musky malt aroma that I didn't particularly enjoy. That said, almost everything else about the beer surpassed my expectations. Whiskey-colored beer. Bocky, malty bare-knuckled lager with a whole grain character and a smidge of honey. Tangy finish. Very good, except for the smell.
Van Pur Extra;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;Pleasantly surprised - expected a dusty, boring lager from Poland. This ranks up there with Pilsener Urquell in my subtle opinion. Nice white heavy duty head with a bit of lacing. Honey-like aroma is rather pleasant. The appearance is light orange and rather refreshing looking. Flavor has some honey sweetness to it and has a good thick mouthfeel. Overall, an excellent Pils.
Van Pur Extra;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;"Not a bad Pilsner, but doesn't have the distinctive taste I like. Very light aroma; washed-out golden color."
Van Pur Extra;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;Sweet scented, nicely topped clear golden beer. Exceptionally smooth, lightly flavored with hint of a citrus aftertaste. Excellent choice for a hot summer day.
Van Pur Extra;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;"Clear gold in color, the head is adequate, white and nice lace to coat the glass. Nose is malt, fresh and clean. Front is malt, and sweet, the top light, the finish is quite dry, acidic, lightly hopped. A ""Pilsener"", what do I expect?""Does not make my current 1000 beer master list."""

Craftsman IPA;Pasadena, California, United States;IPA;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap, Lucky Baldwin’s. This will be an uncharacteristically short review for me. To be honest, it is befitting of this brew. This IPA pours a standard gold orange, with a clear body and small white head. The aroma and flavor were both hoppy, though not particularly assertive or inviting to me. The malt character was subdued, and contributed little. Finish was bitter and clean. OK, but nothing exciting.
Craftsman IPA;Pasadena, California, United States;IPA;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap. Decent IPA, about average. Pours a pale color with a hoppy scent with a thin head.
Craftsman IPA;Pasadena, California, United States;IPA;Craftsman Brewing Company;Re-rating the cask version at The York. Saved my perception of this beer. What I took was that this is maltier than most - caramel malt at that. I don’t think it gets to diacetyl, just caramel. Thick texture. The hops are peppery and remind me very much of Hallertau. Really a treat.
Craftsman IPA;Pasadena, California, United States;IPA;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap at Lucky Baldwin’s. Hoppy up front flavor with a clean, dry finish. Not a hop bomb, but not trying to be.
Craftsman IPA;Pasadena, California, United States;IPA;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft at Lucky Baldwins. A hazy amber beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of caramel, flowers, and grass. The flavor is sweet malty with strong notes of grass as well as citrusy notes of lime, leading to a very bitter and dry finish.
Craftsman IPA;Pasadena, California, United States;IPA;Craftsman Brewing Company;From tap at Lucky Baldwin, Pasadena. Pours clear and golden orange with a lacing white head. Camomille like hops aroma. Flavour is dry and hoppy with a distinct fruity hops presence. Ends dry and bitter, yet with a lasting fruity aroma hops note.
Craftsman IPA;Pasadena, California, United States;IPA;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft - This IPA was more reliant on the malt than the hops. Quite hoppy, but really overwhelmed by the extreme malt flavor. This beer was good, but very heavy. I prefer the Two hearted style IPA’s a bit more.
Craftsman Smoked Black Lager;Pasadena, California, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft. Aroma of faint smoke. Flavors are of chewy, roasty weak coffee and cocoa. Finishes dry. The smoke is tentative, too tentative (hence the low score here), and mostly exists as that chewy mouthfeel. Abundantly drinkable.

This smoked beer pours a dark black color from the tap. Medium to small sized white foamy head, with good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is malt, smoke, fruit and coffee. A medium bodied smoked beer. The malts are fruity, caramel, chocolate and coffee. The hops are earthy and herbal. Nice balance. Decent carbonation. Nice mild smoky flavor throughout. More smoke in the aroma than in the taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Craftsman Smoked Black Lager;Pasadena, California, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft at Beer Revolution, bartender recommended... quaffable light smoked beer, lots of chocolate but has an overall very malty character that gets in the way a bit, worth trying

Daves Electric Beer;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;On tap at DE. Pale yellow. Light yeast, spent grain, cereal, bread, light butter aroma. Flavor is light and crisp, some butter notes, grainy...meh.
Daves Electric Beer;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Poured up on tap at Dave’s Electric brewpub with deep clear gold and a white head. The aroma is sweet with a mix of biscuit malts, some lagery yeast, a touch of grainy malts and a sense of sweet raspberry. Hmmm. The taste has spicy hops mixing with a raspberry like esteriness and faint earthy hops. It stays on the hop spicy side into the finish.

Daves Electric Beer;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Enjoyed on tap at new Tempe brewpub location. Pours very pale golden color with medium sized white head. Nose is somewhat faint with a cereal/malt grainy nose. On the palate it is light in flavor, and could easily pass for a macro lager. A little thin and watery as well, but very easy to drink.

Daves Electric Beer;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Is there corn in here? Crazy corn aroma here. Slight haze to the pale gold. One sip, unsure. Sharp, funky, drainpour.
Daves Electric Beer;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;"Thanks to cbkschubert for this one - pours a fizzy, semi-cloudy pale gold - frothy head - very muted aroma, with some faint grassy hops and weak malts - starts off a little fruity, with some apricot and peach notes - gets moderately bitter through the middle, with a floral/rosewater character, which is odd for the style, but welcome - some strange, almost phenolic character near the finish (gets almost rubbery) - this makes it less enjoyable - in fact, it makes it hard to drink after the first few sips - finish is of corn and grain - actually kind of lame - we need a picture of the label on the site, though; it’s so cheesy that it’s awesome."
Daves Electric Beer;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;"At Oregon Brewers Festival 2008 Pours out a ligth yellow topped with a tall white head.

Celis White;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;Light sweet wheat aroma with some spices. Looks great but could have more head. Slightly watery, but the essentials are there. Citrus, light spiciness, vanilla, wheat malts. Tastes nice just a bit too mild for me. I really like a flavorful wit beer and this one is just too weak (in flavor). Similar to Hoegaarden, just less pronounced. Nevertheless a nice one.
Celis White;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;0.355l bottle. Hazy golden body, thin white head. Aroma of biscuit, honey, orange zest, peach and spices. Taste of bread, honey, coriander and some hops. Less fruity and more bready than the Hoegaarden, but still fine.

Birrificio Italiano Fleurette;Lurago Marinone (CO), Italy;Flavored - Other;Birrificio Italiano;Draft - Almost strawberry and yeasty note. Cloudy copper with a decent white head. A touch sweet and fruity, again with the strawberries and a touch of pepper.
Birrificio Italiano Fleurette;Lurago Marinone (CO), Italy;Flavored - Other;Birrificio Italiano;Tap at BrewDog Tallinn, a while ago, didn't take notes. I liked it despite it being a bit too sweet and flowery for my liking and the light body. Otherwise a pretty nice refreshing brew. Can't recall it being notably spicy/peppery though. Wouldn't mind having it again.
Birrificio Italiano Fleurette;Lurago Marinone (CO), Italy;Flavored - Other;Birrificio Italiano;Tap (Brewdog, Tallinn) (4:3:4:2:7=2.0) Slightly farty grainy aroma, some hint of sourness and flowers maybe once or twice, but served so cold there really is nothing worth mentioning there. Watery palate, crisp carbonation in combination with some minerally aspects makes it quite soda watery. Yeah, lime-scaley water taste, some yeasty home brew, some weak apple pie hint. Sweetish, finish leaves me with a hint of rose syrup, and a bit of minerally water. Weak sauce, dirty water with a few rose petals floating on it. The few aspects it has are generally flawed.

Castlemaine Sovereign Superior Lager;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Nothing much going on here. Pours a pale gold, clear, with a Houdini-head. Little aroma bar some ’tinny’ dank liquor and a little malt. Similar in the mouth, watery thin, gassy and marred by cardboard malt tones. I don’t think Lion Nathan care much for the level of intelligence the beer drinking public in Australia possess, because this was awful. Bland and forgettable.

Terrapin Rye Pale Ale;Athens, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Terrapin Beer Company (Tenth and Blake - Molson Coors);Backlog, bottle that pours a hazy straw golden with a medium sized creamy white head. Nose and flavor of ashy rye, lemons, bitter grass, and a touch of malt but the sweetness is minimal. Light to medium bodied with Dry and bitter finish
Terrapin Rye Pale Ale;Athens, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Terrapin Beer Company (Tenth and Blake - Molson Coors);Very tasty beer. The rye character does balance the hops nicely. Very enjoyable.
Terrapin Rye Pale Ale;Athens, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Terrapin Beer Company (Tenth and Blake - Molson Coors);I rounded the flavor rating up to 8 on this one, but in all reality, I found it to be about a 7.5. I also rounded overall down to 7, in order to give a final rating of 3.7, but overall is probably more like a 7.5. I just found 3.8 too high but 3.6 too low for this one and didn't feel like adjusting the other categories. I see a lot of reviews giving this brew no love, but I don't think a rating from 2.0-3 is giving this beer justice, because I thought it was better than that. Nothing great, but I would say has to be above average?? Typical pale ale appearance of a light goldish to light orange color. Tastes of various malts, sweetness from the rye, a little citrus, and mild hops. I didn't find the rye to be overwhelming at all. Although I probably won't be buying this again with so many other and better beers out there, it was worth the try.

Grainy malts, hay, floral notes of hopbells, grassiness, soft fruitiness and dry yoghurt yeastiness. Soft sweet and grainy, medium to quite strong earthy herbal bitter. Medium body and soft carbonation. Regular Orval is much better but this is also a very nice beer to drink fresh, very tasteful, refreshing and a nice rural herbal grassy vibe to it.

The flavor is sweet malty with fruity notes and a good bitterness. A little thin - but it is a 5% ABV Flemish Sour ale - which could explain that.
Roman Oudenaards;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Roman;"(Actual bottle I'm having is called 'Adriaen Brouwer'. But everything points at labelbeer of Oudenaards) Deep brown with reddish shine. Good yellow-brown head, irregular. Nose with chaff, moccha, (wet) brown bread. Nutty taste, brown bread/malt; sweet - nearly German in character. No acids detectable. Tastes more as a Münich than as a Flemish Oud bruin. Bit thin, mouthfeel as if suspension of sweet flour in watery liquid. Not only untrue to style, it's not very exciting neither. Unremarkable."

JW Dundees Classic Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"For three years now i have been imagining if this beer was a figment of my imagination or actually existed. A distributor in State College, Pa was giving out free samples of the beer one week and my friends and i got one, split it amongst ourselves, and decided to go back and get a case. When we tried to go back and get another case, the stuff had vanished and the people at the store acted like they had never heard of the stuff. I know this because when I asked a guy at the store about it he replied, ""Never heard of the stuff."" So now, many years later (3), i finally learn the stuff exists. I no longer have to wonder if i am crazy or not. ... Oh, And it was pretty damn good back then too."
JW Dundees Classic Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Slightly more flavorful than an ordinary lager. I well remember the inexplicable Dundee's Honey Lager craze of 1996 - which I never understood. If this beer takes off in popularity, it would be equally inexplicable. ha ha
St. Erlin Blonde;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Du Bocq;Cloudy apricot swirling with soupy chunks of sediment. Fruity caramel aroma, fragrant peachy-coriander flavour. Sweet, thick and subtly perfumey. Gave me the shits for about a week. The palate is minestrone soup. There are things floating in this beer I dare not drink. But considering they have emerged from a 3L bottle I’ve ’laid down’ (forgotten about) for several years, this beer has pleasantly exceeded my expectations.
St. Erlin Blonde;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Du Bocq;lots of koriander and malt in the aroma. sweet malty, spicy taste with a bit bitter finish which is not so long. body is a bit thin althought it looks rather oily. looks dark yellow with a huge head. lacks some character but is certainly not bad, just a little average. (reminds me of ice tea).
St. Erlin Blonde;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Du Bocq;"(Bottle 33 cl) I bought this in a French supermarket, thinking that it was a French beer. But no, it’s a ""Bière Belge"". Information about the brewery is nowhere to be found on the label, except that it’s produced for the Auchan-supermarkets. Very orange/amber-colored, unclear with a very creamy and lively head. The style is very close to a Tripel, sweet with a bit of sharp hops. But it’s not exactly a ""Big Belgian"". 051003"

St. Erlin Blonde;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Du Bocq;This has a gold colour and not as much head as I expected. The aroma is fresh a wheat beer like. Flavours also remind me of a wheat - coriander, banana and spices are present. Quite an amalgamation of styles and not bad for it.
St. Erlin Blonde;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Du Bocq;Auchan private label prodcut, which, I guess, means two things: a) should be good enough to be worth of the Auchan name, and b) shouldn't be too expensive or complex. All considered, the goals are accomplished. Dark golden, opaque in colour. Pours a good head. Smells of malt with a hint of lemon. A bit thin in the mouth, tastes good even if seems to lack some character. Decent aftertaste that won't last long.
St. Erlin Blonde;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Du Bocq;Blond colour, generous head, nice perlage. Light malt, a bit metallic aroma. Not completely mature, but quite nice balance of malt and hop, again somehow metallic. Ordinary palate.

Very very light but fairly fine and subtle. That’s not beer (which explains the low mark here) but that’s something interesting anyway, as a ""beginning of beer"". But, well, I must admit I’m pleased with just a beginning, owing to the fact that I don’t enjoy Moulin des moines’ beers..."
Riedenburger Alkoholfrei Dinkelbier;Riedenburg/Altmühltal, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Riedenburger Brauhaus;Review based on personal notes. Bottle 33 cl - Batch unknown. AROMA: slight hop aroma mixed with the characteristic low alcohol notes. APPEARANCE: very pale straw color and hazy. thin white head with poor retention. TASTE: watered down flavour with some faint malty notes. low bitterness with an almost sweet finish. PALATE: thin body with low carbonation. OVERALL: its a low alcohol beer, thats it. watered down flavour and poor aroma.
Riedenburger Alkoholfrei Dinkelbier;Riedenburg/Altmühltal, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Riedenburger Brauhaus;"330 ml bottle as “Moulin des Moines Blondy Free” bought at Organic Bliss in Causeway Bay. Translucent dull golden yellow colour with layer of yeast sediments; Razor-thin head and residual soapy white foam which fades in 5 seconds; Moderate sticky lacing and near zero carbonation; Sweet aroma of water chestnut juice, with sugarcane, perotis and barley; Near zero sweet taste of thin malt, with light wood chips, non-sweet water chestnut, perotis and tapioca; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is lightened low-alco beer: no sweetness at all, woody taste is light. No awful AL-related off tastes, but it pretty much reduced to something akin to a mix of water chestnut juice and sugarcane-perotis drink so common in Southern China. Okay… Hoppiness is zero in nose and taste. No bitterness, just herbal perotis finish; Wet after taste. Very easy to mouth. Comments: This is perhaps the most palatable low-alcohol beer I’ve had so far, probably because it was watered down so much to rid of any harsh LA elements. It really tastes like water chestnut juice and nothing beery. Sounds bad, but actually quite refreshing. LA-wise, this one is pretty good."

Bierigkeit rechnen, daher wlll ich dieses Bier mal nicht schlechter machen, als es sein sollte. Das Bier schmeckt primär nämlich nach Wasser. Besondere Aromen, besonders aus der ""Frucht-Ecke"" sind gar nicht auszumachen, weil es einfach nicht stark genug nach Weißbier schmeckt. Es drängt sich der Verdacht auf, dass man das hauseigene Weißbier einfach mit Wasser gestreckt hat. Vielleicht als Erfrischung nach dem Sport denkbar, aber mehr wohl eher nicht."

Marston's Firestoker;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Clear 500ml bottle, best before Feb 09, drank in Aug 08. The label claims it is a ’Pale Ale’. Poured into a straight pint sleeve glass. Light amber in colour, with a good foam blanket of white bubbles sat on top. Slight haze, but not cloudly. Aroma of candy-floss, but not sickly, just sweet. There is some vanilla in there, but not sure I’d have picked that up without the label leading me to it! The taste is sweet as well, but a bitterness fights back as you sip the beer and it becomes harsher as the beer warms in the mouth and throat. There is a good hop presence too. The beer has a drying effect on your mouth, and it made me burp a bit, so plenty of carbonisation I suppose. Can’t call it refreshing, but it is a decent beer and one with a different feel and taste to it compared with most other British Brews.

Roman Blanche;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Roman;"Hazy golden blonde coloured body with a smallish, single centimetre tall pure white head. Aroma of corn, grain, light yeast, bread, coriander seed and a bit of funky stale sugar. Medium-bodied; Assertive funky, bready, yeastie, corn-y and stale malt dominate this one with a very overtly funky flavour that doesn’t show spice, but does show an odd malt element and little else - some light sugars and a bit of yeast, but that’s it. Aftertaste shows more of the same with some light coriander seed and perhaps a bit of curacao or full oranges, but nothing great. Overall, a pretty bad beer that doesn’t show well and has very funky flavours. Sadly, that said - I’m glad I sampled this and will never have it again, but i’m not happy that I carted this thing across the Atlantic when much better options were easily found, but I am happy that it was just a 25cL bottle. I sampled this 25 cL bottle purchased from Beer Mania in Bruxelles, Belgium on 19-August-2013 for €1,99 sampled at home in Washington on 14-September-2016 after lugging this thing across the pond."

Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Pours dark copper, some beige foam on top. Lots of sweet caramel in the nose, caramel jam. Taste is heavy, sweet but not really cloying, just heavy. Hops are coming out in the finish. Sweet wavy hoppy Oktoberfest beer, I can imagine this style to be a predecessor for IPA styles according to old stories (if I remember them correctly that is).
Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Bottle. Red brown with off white head and decent lacing. Strong caramel and biscuit aromas with baked apple and grassy notes. On the sweetener side, but not over powering and has a slight dryness in the finish. Slight sticky feel. Tasty Oktoberfest offering.
Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Pours chestnut with a slight head with nearly no lacing. Aroma is plum and a hint of toffee. Taste is sweet raisin that adds a smidge of cinnamon. Aftertaste is smooth and without hoppiness. A great marzen, one of the best around.
Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;bottle. deep amber with one finger head. somehow i've missed this one the last several years, so i was excited to pick this one up given the very high ratings. strongly malty body with sweet caramel and toffee. toasty, a bit of dark fruit. surprisingly underhopped for the style. was a bit underwhelmed -- it's just a beer, and doesn't have a lot of marzen character.
Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;"Bottle undated. Deep unfiltered garnet. Fat cap of custard foam holds well. Sloppy aroma of concord grape jelly, wet dark break, concrete, raisin, Twizzlers candy, molasses, and cola. Hints of DMS and chalky roast. Soft carbonation. Full bodied. Initially fuzzy and heavily sugary, with faint DMS swirled with cola-like sugars and strong concord jelly notes. Starchy malt and unrefined wet bread flavors unfold amid sharper char notes which dispel any malt purity that might arise. Clash of roast and sugar, along with the unchecked esters of rum-soaked plums which reach medicinal levels, only add unnecessary girth to the overcrowded body. Alcohol punishes the tongue as the sugars continually escalate. Candy apple notes and papery malt exacerbate the impurities, and the malt is one dimensional, overly kilned and sharp with zero nuance or texture. Wet and incessantly sugary finish is medicinal and tangy, with plums and candy apples lingering alongside fuzzy DMS notes. Upon first whiff this had ""drain pour"" written all over it, and sure enough in the mouth it’s all sugar and the obligatory malt purity is nowhere to be found. Hardly a märzen, but even by bock standards, which this certainly is stylistically closer to, this is severely under attenuated and just really difficult to stomach. An aimless monstrosity."
Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Bottle. Deep amber/light brown body. Frothy, light beige head, lasting. Aroma of caramel, toasted grain, candy sugar, overripe dark fruit. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/lightly sticky texture, lively carbonation. A dark, malty beer. Taste of roast, caramel, toffee. Light plastic and raw graininess in the finish. Unlike any fest beer I've had. The roast really throws this off. And then there's untamed sweetness that lasts through the finish.
Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Brown liquid with a hint of orange when held to the light. Moderate sized light tan colored head. Sweet grainy scents, with some dark corn syrup and sorghum. Smells a bit more like a hearty brown ale than a clean Oktoberfest. Sweet flavors from the start with some prunes and dark fruit. Herbal/woody bitterness. Not much of an Oktoberfest and too sweet and nearly cloying to be a crisp fall quaff.
Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours a clear dark amber/brown with a large khaki head. Aroma is very fruity berries, strawberries and raspberries, with underlying caramel and toffee malt.

Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Twelve ounce bottle from Party Town, tasted on September 29, 2017. Dark amber color, good toasted malt aroma, pungent malty taste--maybe a bit too pungent but a good beer overall. Not quite worth the $11.99 six pack price but relatively few beers are.
Dark Horse Oktoberfest Beer;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dark Horse Brewing Company;On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. served as a 5 oz. taster showing a clear, brown/amber color, with a presentable layer of light tan froth that reduced to a persistent ring, with ribbons & spots of lacing. The nose was toasted, almost roasted, touches of cocoa & vanilla, and caramel & toffee sweetness. The taste was similar, better than medium bodied, with good carbonation, a roasted & earthy bitterness that lingered, and slightly parched on the finish. Not so much a Marzen, but I appreciated the subtle warmth and bold nature.

Pump House Hefe Weizen;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pump House Brewery;My Bottom Line: Honeyed bananas are bothered by green peppers in this sweet and muddled Weizen. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam surrounds the opaque beige yellow. -Wheat stands out by doesn’t work that well with the ample residual sugars (for the style). -The mouthfeel is not that refreshing due to these dextrins. -Herbal hops are tasted alongside these green peppers. On tap at Artisan Café and Brewpub, in Dalhousie

Pump House Hefe Weizen;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pump House Brewery;On tap at the brewpub (they listed their seasonal as a wheat beer... I’m assuming it’s this one). Nice, orange color, quite hazy, with a small head and no lacing. Very nice aroma... the wheat is there, but citrus as well and something else pleasant that I can’t distinguish. Smooth on the palate - nice carbonation. Flavor fell a little short of what I expected, but it’s still a fairly good wheat beer whose flavor doesn’t diminish too quickly.
Pump House Hefe Weizen;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pump House Brewery;"The other seasonal available at the brewhouse (the first being the Oktoberfest)-- and this is the better choice IMHO. On the board, this is titled ""Weizen Wheat"". It appears as a deep bronzy golden, hazy, with a big dense white head leving plenty of lace. Huge estery banana and spice aroma. The palate is bursting with estery wheatiness, banana, cloves-- all the things you look forward to in an excellent hefe. This beer was the standout of the night by a longshot!"

Brewer's Art Cerberus Tripel;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Tripel;The Brewer's Art;Probably the third or fourth tripel I’ve tried called Cerberus. (get original). Pours a clear yellow with a thin white head that leaves very good lacing. I’m conflicted by the nose. It is complex and interesting, but not the nose of a tripel: Big white wine and champagne, massive chardonnay grapes, some fusel alcohol, big artifical candies in the nose, Jagermeister, licorice or something in the nose (help me out here), dried light fruits, marachino cherries, overly sweet cherry frosting. Taste is white wine, champagne, vinous, tart and boozy. Misses a bunch of tripel notes I’d like to see. Unreal how much this tastes like white wine. It’s really cool but not what a tripel is about. If they soured this and aged it in oak- you could get something out of this world.
Brewer's Art Cerberus Tripel;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Tripel;The Brewer's Art;Straight from the tap at Brewer’s Art &#40the greatest bar ever&#41. Looks like a typical Tripel. Big fluffy head, golden body. Smells like malt, spiciness too. Flavor is a little less in your face than most Tripels. That being said, this beer goes down SMOOTH for 9.5% Could be a session beer, but you’d be on your ass sooner, rather than later.
Brewer's Art Cerberus Tripel;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Tripel;The Brewer's Art;I was able to sample this on cask at Max’s Taphouse during Max’s Belgian Fest. Pours a pale yellow with a thin white head. Smells grassy, a tad herby with a touch of clove. Flavor is astringent with grassy hops, some light candy and plenty of Belgian yeast. Chalky on the end with no hint of the alcohol. Eh.
Brewer's Art Cerberus Tripel;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Tripel;The Brewer's Art;On cask at Max’s Belgian Fest: Pours a hazy deep goldenrod with a spotty-lacing white head. Aroma of lightly sweet biscuity pale Belgian malt with lots of earthy grassy character and some bittering sulfur. Starts with a light caramely sweetness and earthy bittering hops before a drier bittersweet finish. Not much of a tripel, but an interesting brew nonetheless.
Brewer's Art Cerberus Tripel;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Tripel;The Brewer's Art;Draught in a small chalice at the brewpub. Straw yellow without much of a head (they did pour it almost to the rim though...). Not a huge aroma, but a nice spicy, herbal hops note, with a touch of pale malt and light fruity yeast character. The flavor is dry and hoppy, with light malt and yeast. Fruity hints of banana and grape. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. Simple and dangerously smooth and drinkable. I could session this, but that would be a short session indeed.

Beer Works American Light Lager;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Beer Works;"On tap at BeerWorks Fenway, 7/2/2005. Listed as ""Millar Lite"" but I can’t imagine that was much different than their generic brewpub light lager. Appears a golden-straw, very light-toned, with a lightly foamy/bubbly film on the top. Moderate amount of bubbles rising. Aroma has some light soap and sugar, hints of lager yeast and a touch of sweet corn. Flavor begins with a clean, dry pale malt, not exactly honey-sweet, but decidedly clean and inoffensive. Body, for a light lager, was respectable, being crisp and refreshing, not heavy or sluggish and not overcarbonated. Little variation from sip to sip, but no stale or adjuncty flavors on the finish. Perhaps a bit of salt and seltzer water suggestions, but mainly just pale grains. No one expected much out of this one, but everyone was impressed. But then, I knew Jodie is a talented brewer, so I’m not surprised afterall. Why don’t they just call it Mueller Lite?"

Beer Works Bakers Island Blonde;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Beer Works;A: The beer pours an extremely pale yellow color with a small white head. S: The aroma is very sweet, far more than expected for a Helles. Definitely a bit of corn and straw. Maybe a bit of grass and bread in there, too. Not much aroma to this. T: Similar to the aroma in terms of flavor. It’s a bit watery and very light bread/malt and just little hop flavor. There’s a touch of corn and straw, maybe some grass and a faint bitterness.

Beer Works Bakers Island Blonde;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Beer Works;Draught pint at Fenway on 5/25/07 I’ll admit to not knowing this was supposed to be a helles and knowing that now, I’m a little less impressed. Dosent have nearly the malt flavor or yeast character I would expect. Rather, it’s quite dry and attenuated with a floral hop aroma and flavor that seems more like EKGs than any more exciting German hop. Still, taken as a session blonde ale (or lager, as they say), the crispness is there, with a little bit of yeast bite (though I never once mistook this for a real munich yeast). Some light honey, a bit of seltzer water (lots of carbonation) and light toastiness on the finish. Clear, pale-gold body with a small white head that shows moderate retention and little/no lacing. More like DAB (so I guess it works as a dortmunder).

Beer Works Allston Mild;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Beer Works;Cask version: This was a lot different than the kegged version, and I generally agree with Nutfield, that it was a much creamier and smoother beer. However, the drastic temperature difference between the two might make it hard to make a complete side by side comparison (cask beers generally being warm). Keg version: Good as far as mild's go I suppose, something which my lower than normal rating might reflect. I find it hard to objectively judge styles that I generally don't care for though. My suggestion is to try it yourself, perhaps do what I did and get it in a 4oz sampler. (keg rating 3.0)
Beer Works Allston Mild;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Beer Works;Cask version: It was nice to have this side-by-side with the non-cask version: there ARE differences between these two. Much smoother, creamier, with a frothy and substantial head. Although, the carbonation is too intrusive here. Still, some nice flavors emerging (as with the non-cask Mild). Keg version: Little aroma (true to form for a mild) but on tasting there's something nice going on here. I wouldn't call it maltiness, but there are caramel overtones. Served too cold. Hint of red in the color. Keg rating 2.7

Barleys Casino Blue Diamond;Henderson, Nevada, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Barley's Casino and Brewing;Transfer from BA review on 6-14-13- Served on tap in a 20 oz mug Appearance – The beer is served a medium golden color with a two finger white head. The head fades relatively quickly leaving only a light level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is heaviest of a bready and caramel smell mixed with a very light grassy hop smell. Taste – The taste begins with a malty and slightly sweet flavor of caramel. As the flavor advances the caramel sweetness fades slightly with a bit of the grassy and citrus hop coming to the tongue. In the end a crisp and clean flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel-The body of the beer is on the thinner to medium side for a lager of its strength with a carbonation level that is normal to slightly above average. Both are quite nice for making one easy drinking brew. Overall- A refreshing and rather easy drinking pale lager.

Barleys Casino Black Mountain Dark Lager;Henderson, Nevada, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Barley's Casino and Brewing;Transfer from BA review on 6-14-13- Served on tap in a 20 oz mug Appearance – Served a deep brown colored brew with a two finger tan colored head. The head fades relatively quickly leaving only spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is a mix of sweet and roasted malt. The roasted malt smells have hints of chocolate and coffee mixed within with the sweeter smells being of a caramel and light brown sugar aroma. Taste – The taste begins with a sweet roasted malt taste comprised of a mix of roasted barely and caramel. As the flavor advances further the caramel dries a bit with a light more brown sugar like taste coming to the tongue in its place. At this time so to comes some cocoa flavors adding to the more dark flavor profile of the brew. In the end with the sweetness getting lighter a rather crisp and moderately roasted flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner side for a darker brew with a carbonation level that is on the slightly higher side. While not ideal for the more roasted flavors of the brew as it gave it a bit more of a watery feel, it did make for a more refreshing style dark lager and overall worked for the warmer weather in which it was enjoyed. Overall- A little thin and too sweet up front, but it dries out some at the end making for a more crisp and easy drinking black lager. Not bad.

The color was a good looking brown but from there the experience went downhill. it was lighter than water in the mouth, no body. The flavor was in the same boat. there was very little to talk about, just a touch of toastiness underneath the water. The bartender described it as ""a bit of a lady's drink."" well no ladies i would know because those ladies have no taste."
Krajan Czarny Kon Pils;Nakło nad Notecią, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browary Kujawsko Pomorskie Krajan;Small polish brewery mad not bad pilsner. It reminds me old times, with that black horse logo. Light gold, white average head. Light malty flavours, soft feel. Maybe a bit to light for pilsner. One of better polish micros.
Singha Draft;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;33cl bottle from Malta. It is a good lager with low co2, but long lasting medium foam. Taste is also OK. Sweet malt, some smoke, some hop and hint of citric yeast. Surprisingly good in its own category.

Singha Draft;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;light golden ale broasted corn with a malted broom straw and some light vegetation. a little sweet for balance and finishes short and watery after a touch of hop in the fizz. a bit of spring water type freshness.
Singha Draft;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;W pierwszej nucie zadziwiająca nuta migdałowa. Później wychodzi typowa słodowość. W smaku słodowe, z nutami kwaskowymi. Nie smakuje jak typowy eurolager. Jest nawet trochę lepszy.

Singha Draft;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;On draught in Bangkok. Clear yellow with bright white head 1cm thick. Aroma of grass and hay. Tastes grassy but of fresh hops. Not too bad but ultimately too watery and tasteless. So good when really hot and thirsty.
Singha Draft;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;On tap at the Bangkok airport. Aroma has a light malt character with light adjunct and a light hop character of floral and slightly fruity hops along with some grass. No diacetyl or sulfur. Pours a clear, very pale yellow gold with a small, moderately thick white head that recedes to a thin film that lingers. Faint lacing and no legs. Flavor is similar to the aroma, but with a slightly stronger adjunct character. Light bitterness an the hop character is more grassy than it was in the aroma. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall pretty indistinguishable from the regular Singha. I suppose its slightly cleaner and has a better mouthfeel, but otherwise about the same. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Boon Rawd Super Lion;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Strong;Boon Rawd;this was the third malt liquor beer i had in thailand...do these boys want to get drunk or what. too thick for this climate imo. slight grainy feel with a bit of alcohol kick. probably the better of the three i had. but that aint saying much.
Boon Rawd Super Lion;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Strong;Boon Rawd;It is a bit odd really. This is a climate where it is normally always hot and huid. You would therefore expect a demand for cleanly hopped beers with reasonable ABV. Instead we get a lot of these malt liquors (actually the most common alcoholic drinks are undrinkable whiskeys and other offensive spirits). Anyway, off balance and unacceptably coarse.
Boon Rawd Super Lion;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Strong;Boon Rawd;better than singha, not as good as chang. a simple, well made beer. much smoother than you would expect for a strong malt liquor.
Boon Rawd Super Lion;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Strong;Boon Rawd;Can bought in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It said it was brewed by the Khon Kaen Brewery which is owned by Boon Rawd. A darker yellow with a slight orange tint. This beer actually has some aroma and flavor, much to my surprise. It had a slight brandy, fruity, sweet and grape aroma and flavor.
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;Its funny how the name of a small German town is supposed to lend this Lager some sense of quality. It ranks a bit above average in the region, ok, still it cannot compare to real good beer on a global scale.
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;Golden color, crisp flavour, light grassy aroma, nothing new just another pale lager
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;Even in Mexico this beer was bad. Bottled 090707. BB4 090109 so it should be in good condition. Bubbly yellow. Soft white sinking head. Sharp nose of grassy hops followed by dirt and a trace of garbage. Flavour makes you ask why you would be Thai beer in a Mexican supermarket! Too sweet and just bad.
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;this beer is everywhere lately, but it is nothing special, a little strong, and that is it. Somewhat like Canadian stron one.
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;Bottle: Label reads German Style Beer if that means a slight resemblance to a pils than it’s a decent try. Hoppy and herbal, with citric notes.
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;Can (330ml) at our two-story-room in Seam Reap (www.Goldenbanana.info) Clear yellow - white head. Citrus, wet hay, straw, white bread, bitter citrus finish.
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;Golden colour. Light grassy aroma. Grassy-hay taste with a faint hint of malt backing it up. Slightly sour finish.
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;From the bottle in the Radisson in Bangkok. So what? Perhaps I just wanted to say I was in Thailand. This is probably the closest you will get to a Euro style in this country. Like a lot of beers it is better in its homeland context and so I would consider this to be up there with a good beer of its intended style. Light coloured body with a crisp white head and a distinctive hint of Euro noble hops. Look it is a better attempt than a lot of breweries at this style, Australia included.
Mittweida;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;Bottle. I had a big bottle of this at the Good View restaurant in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Mittweida was much more common in the North than in Bangkok or the South of Thailand. The lager was light yellow with rising bubbles and a crisp flavor. Better than most, but maybe that is related to its German roots.

Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;Tap at the Brewpub. Poured a hazy dark amber with a thin off-white head. The aroma is malt, floral metallic hop. The flavour is medium bitter with a light malt, hop bitter palate and a short bitter finish. Served a little too cool to be honest. Nice enough for a BKK brewed beer and I’d be happy to drink it if I lived here, but it doesn’t really compete with too many bitters brewed in Blighty.
Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;Drought. Dark brown with small beige creamy head, caramel aroma, bit of a chocolate-caramel taste with slight bitterness at the end, longish finish. Not bad for Thai microbrew.
Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;very homebrew-esque. malty and yeasty, no trace of hops, really disappointing and not the taste relief I was hoping for after several days of yellow water with bubbles...
Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;didn’t get much aroma from this beer medium body, thin feel, average carbonation, lacking in hops. Guessing that acquiring a decent range of hops can be difficult in Thailand. This beer would really benefit from some better/more hops. An acceptable drink after 3 weeks of nothing but Thai lagers, but not close to a decent British bitter. Was soon back on Thai lagers in another establishment.
Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;"Pours light brown. Nose of biscuit and toast. licorice and caramel flavour with a trace of bitterness that lasts in the finish. Approaching a brown. Achievement unlocked; definitely a British-style beer. I think this place has everything down except the hops (and service, but that doesn’t factor in on my beer reviews)."
Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;"Tap at Londoners in Bangkok. Hazy, darker amber pour is a bit dark for style with soapy lacing and lower foam. Muted nose with mild metal and dark bread. Taste is thin, no bitterness really, slight metallic bite, again more wheat toast and pumpernickel. Not so great, but after months in Thailand of only Chang, Leo, and Tiger; it tastes like heaven."
Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;Half a pint from tap at the brewpub. Slightly hazy brown with a small off-white head. Aroma of slighlty roasted malt with caramel and hops. Sweet, malty and creamy with a nice bitterness. Finishes slightly dry with a nice bitterness. Roasted and bitter aftertaste. Taste and refreshing. Nice with some bitterness after lots of SEA pale lagers. (2012-05-15)
Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;Muddy brown/red color. Somewhat transparent between the visible particles in the beer. A thin head stays for only a couple of minutes. Zero lacing. Low carbonation. Smells of biscuity malts, some grass and a faintly note of caramel. Taste is nutty and salty/astringent. A herbal tone of tea. Aftertaste is biscuity and with tons of sour salmiak and salt. Mouth-feel is thin and watery. Low carbonation. I hope there was something wrong with my pour. Will try to make another review. ABV must be about 4 - 4,5. Serving type: on-tap
Londoner Pride Cream Bitter;Bangkok, Thailand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Londoner Brew Pub;on draught at the brew-pub.Amber cloudy colour. Bitter aftertaste. A decent bitter. Nice to have after so much bland lager here

Aromas of lightly roasted malt, some coffee, nuts and caramel. Nutty flavour with notes of caramel and roasted malt. After fourteen days with Chang Draught and Leo this beer is really tasty treat to find in a very air-conditioned basement in the middle of busy Bangkok.
Londoner Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Londoner Brew Pub;Oct 2019 keg at the brewpub in Bangkok. Pretty standard pale lager. Soft, bland and inoffensive. Easy drinking and easily forgotten.
Londoner Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Londoner Brew Pub;On tap at The Londoner Brewpub, pours a clear pale blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out crisp crackery malt, straw and light grass. Flavour is vegetal, with grassy and herbal, and dry biscuity malt. Too herbaceous and vegetal. Not convincing.

Londoner Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Londoner Brew Pub;Tap at the Brewpub. Poured a hazy medium amber with a thin broken white head. The aroma is light yeast/malt.

Londoner Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Londoner Brew Pub;Drought. Pale yellow with small white foamy head, yeasty aroma, slightly sour taste, high carbonation, abrupt finish. Not really inspiring.
Londoner Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Londoner Brew Pub;"golden, clear, thin feel, average carbonation, tasted like a Thai brewed lager but to be fair, not as good as the mainstream Thai lagers, but then nowhere near as poor as mainstream UK ""lagers"" for example. Was no reason to keep drinking this instead of a Chang Classic. If you’re looking for a good pilsner, this isn’t it."
Londoner Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Londoner Brew Pub;Pours deep straw. Nose of lemon and malt. Flavour is quite sweet. Finish has some lemon. I’m having trouble picking up the noble hops here.
Londoner Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Londoner Brew Pub;Tap at the brewpub back when I lived in Thailand. Hazy golden pour, not very bright for lager. Weak foam and poor retention. Soapy lacing. Nose is DMS at times with corn and some frozen vegetables. Taste is fairly bland, mild biscuit, low hop balance with a metallic twang. Again, really nice after months of Chang, Leo, and Tiger (never pay double the price for Singha like a newb).
Londoner Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Londoner Brew Pub;Pint from tap at the brewpub. Golden with a white head. Light fruity and malty aroma. Sweet with a slightly bitter finish and a slightly metallic taste. Somewhat bitter aftertaste. Nice enough, but nothing special, could have been better with more hops and bitterness. Still a nice break from the domestic pale lagers of Thailand. (2012-05-15)

Brew Pavilion Wiezen;Bangkok, Thailand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brew Pavilion Microbrewery Pub & Restaurant;Sampled draught at the brewpub. Huge place! When going here just remember that Ratchadaphisek Rd. is split in two, and that this is on the northern side of Sukhumvit. Pours murky dark orange with average head. Estery bubblegum aaroma. Sweet and rounded, but near thin. Mild and fruity. Authentic, but unspectacular.
Brew Pavilion Wiezen;Bangkok, Thailand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brew Pavilion Microbrewery Pub & Restaurant;Tap. Stop two on my brewpub hunt in Bangkok. This place did not open until 6pm, so I found an internet cafe to start getting beers into the database. It is a great place with a huge concert stage. I left before the band hit the stage to find the Tawandang German Brewery. This beer was a hazy dark yellow with a foamy white head and rising bubbles. A nice coriander aroma with citrus, orange and spice flavors.
Brew Pavilion Lager;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brew Pavilion Microbrewery Pub & Restaurant;Sampled draught at the brewpub. Quite funny spelling here... Cloudy golden with small, creamy head. Sweet and bready, softly malty. Mild and honeyish with lightly hoppy finish.

Tawandang Weizen;Bangkok, Thailand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Tawandang German Brewery;On draught at the Phnom Penh branch. Not sure if they brew on site or if the beers come from Thailand. If the latter, perhaps this hadn’t travelled too well. If the former, I just wasn’t too impressed. Hazy yellowish amber pour. Aroma was quite skunky and eggy. Granted, a little wheat and citrus in it too. Taste was much the same. Fruity and citrussy with wheat but ultimately it was quite stale unfortunately.

Bochkarev Krepkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Malt Liquor;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);"My bottle (not the one pictured: see frankenkitty’s review) was entirely in Russian. My attempt to translate it using a Cyrillic alphabet and a Russian-English, English-Russian dictionary from 1961 (several pages missing throughout) follows: From Russia with loving! Much enjoyment to ensue from the drinking! Inferior ingredients have pleased to have been discouraged from useage. Decandent Western brewers use Noble hops...Proudly we are to use only most glorious former- Soviet Republic Chernobyl Hops! Nasdrovya! (A crude image of a bald man pounding what appears to be a shoe on a table, under which this apparent motto, ""We will BURY you, one sip at a time!!!) The following appeared to be issued as a warning: NOT TO BE USING AS DIESEL ADDITIVE FOR TO MAKE WINTER TRUCK EASIER START-UP...UNLESS STAND WELL BACK!"
Bochkarev Krepkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Malt Liquor;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Staying with my Russian theme for this Sunday evening, I gave this one a try and it was quite below average. Aroma was very metallic, some alcohol, but suprisingly (thankfully) no skunk. I couldn’t pick up much else because the metallic scent was really overpowering. Appearance was a lightl yellow in color, a little haze and decent ivory white head. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied, and a little harsh with the alcohol. Flavor was metal (think licking a dirty penny), a little hoppy and some malty sweetness. But like the nose, the flavor of this beer was squahsed by the prominent metallic flavor going on. Overall, not a very good beer and since it came in a pint bottle pretty tough to drink the whole thing.

Lots of malts and not very much in the hop department. Taste is very sweet and malty with some metallic hints and tons of alcohol at the end. Very harsh, watery, and metallic.

La Lunar Twister Wheat;Bangkok, Thailand;Wheat Ale;La Lunar BrewHouse (formerly Taurus);Brewed in American tradition????? Uh oh, I was hoping for a Belgian or German tradition. Anyway, let's look past that and concentrate on the beer at hand. It certainly looks like a wheat beer, agreeably pale yellow and hazy. The flavour immeidately suggests an ale yeast though, as there are fruity overtones but not the big ones provided by a wit/wiezen. You know, landing at Bangkok airport you really want something like this to begin with. It's okay but doesn't make me jump up and down.

It had a hazy yellow color with a white head. It was very light and understated for a wheat with a somewhat sweet flavor."

La Lunar Mama Bull Pilsner;Bangkok, Thailand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;La Lunar BrewHouse (formerly Taurus);Mama, give me the hop aroma I crave for and good mouthfeel from a fine pilsner. Damn, mama, you just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled a trigger now he's dead. Mama, life had just begun, now you've gone and blown it all away by not putting enough noble saaz into this beer which started so well but fell over.

La Lunar Killer Bee Lager;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;La Lunar BrewHouse (formerly Taurus);Mama without the aroma. While it is best that some mamas don't have too much of an odor about them this is not one of those occasions. This bee should be called Eric, coz he's only got half the sting expected.

La Lunar Head Butt Strong Ale;Bangkok, Thailand;Strong Ale - American;La Lunar BrewHouse (formerly Taurus);more of a fat tire esque beer here, amber orange color, with sweet fruit hop nose. full bodied with a bit more umph then the others. still not great but good enough to drink here in thailand.
La Lunar Head Butt Strong Ale;Bangkok, Thailand;Strong Ale - American;La Lunar BrewHouse (formerly Taurus);27 Jun 2005 - (Bangkok Airport, Terminal 2, Brewpub - last beer before going home) - Floral and stone fruit malt aroma.

La Lunar Head Butt Strong Ale;Bangkok, Thailand;Strong Ale - American;La Lunar BrewHouse (formerly Taurus);Orange-tinged light brown colour. Slightly browned head. Oh my god - hops! I remember those! Piney with a hint of pommelo, wood and tobacco. If this were cigar I’d be loving this. Woody tasting palate , slight citrus and bitterness. Oooo. Underneath is chewy caramel. Despite shocking my palate with flavours unknown in months, I have to be realistic. It’s not that good.
La Lunar Head Butt Strong Ale;Bangkok, Thailand;Strong Ale - American;La Lunar BrewHouse (formerly Taurus);Well, given the lack of grunt provided by the others I decided to splurge and pay 145baht for the biggun. This is still only less than $5 Aussie so if good it will be worth it. well it is an OK beer. There are disctinct malty notes and good mouthfeel which is backed up by a good coppery colour and malty/hop aroma. At least there is evidence that this was brewed with an ale yeast as some of the necessary characters come through. Perhaps the palate for this beer is not one of a typical ratebeerian. Most of the visitors don't seem to care what they order from my brief observation. They are here for a bite to eat and a drink before they board a flight to be offered a bite to eat and a drink an hour later. Discerning.
La Lunar Head Butt Strong Ale;Bangkok, Thailand;Strong Ale - American;La Lunar BrewHouse (formerly Taurus);Sampled draught at the brewpub (Location at airport, terminal 2). The address given here directs you to a dubious night club called Orbit. To enter Orbit you either have to pay for a very expensive bottle of whiskey, or pay a n extremely steep entry fee. Also there is no mention anywhere by the entrance of a brewery inside. As it is much cheaper, even for one person, to grab a taxi and go to the airport I'd recommend the airport location. Funnily this is still called Taurus. This beer is their showpiece: an orange-brown, cloudy ale with small creamy head. It is sweet and toffeeish with traces of almondsa nd butterscotch. There are some citrusy hops up front, It is medium bodied with a clean, simple malt profile and finishes with some pleasant hoppy bitterness. Much like a decent standard amber ale on a US brewpub chain.

Okhota (Oxota) Krepkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Malt Liquor;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);"05-07-2017; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Moscow, Russia). The looks of the beer are simple, yet good. It looks like a typical lager/pilsener. The colour of the beer is a lovely golden yellow, a bit darker golden than most lagers. The beer is absolutely crystal clear. On top of the beer a thick layer of rough white foam is formed. The bulk of the foam collapses very fast, leaving a very thin and rough drape. The smell ain’t bad, I even like it. There is a nice sweet maltiness, giving also some slight fruity touches to the smell. You can also clearly smell the alcohol. The sweetness of the malts and the fruitiness also contains a slight aroma of some honey and a slight bread-like aroma. It isn’t bad. There are also clear and nice bitters of hops. There isn’t a lot of hop in here, it is merely a bitter touch. The taste is pretty much the same. Nice strong malty sweets, with a touch of fruit and honey, and nice bitter touch. The alcohol flavour is strong. The beer lacks some hop strength. It is a bit out of balance, towards the sweet side. The palate of the beer is average. Light body, rather smooth and also rather light carbonation. The finish mainly consists of sweet malt and alcohol. All in all, not a bad beer, but it is mainly sweet malts and alcohol. It is a typical malt liquor, but form time to time that ain’t bad."

I’m just curious.

Left Hand Widdershins;Longmont, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bottle from Total Wine in Boca Raton. Poured into a snifter at home. Pours an orange brown with a medium thick head. Head gone in 30 seconds. No real lacing. Aroma of dark fruits, barrel, heavy carmelized malts, and mild peat. The taste is malty, caramel, oak barrel, and fresh earthy hops. There was a weird medicinal taste however that was a big turnoff. I found it to be a very hoppy barleywine. I tend to like them more malty. Medium body, bitter mouth with the hops.
Left Hand Widdershins;Longmont, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Left Hand Brewing Company;Draft @ Sunset. The bartender couldn’t tell me if it was an aged keg. And it doesn’t taste of me it so.... They must have started brewing this again. Anyhow, ruby color with lasting tan head. Aroma is sweet malt, leather and English roasted malts. Flavor is English malt forward. Shoe leather, English toffee, light caramel and mild spice. 8% is covered up with a sweet finish. Overall super easy to drink and not syurpy or over sweet at all.
Kanga Brew;Yenda, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Beer Company (Coca-Cola Amatil);Cloudy golden with a rocky white head, the aroma on this beer was grainy and sweet. The flavor was very much full of honey. Little in the way of hop character, but smooth and quenching. Average.
Kanga Brew;Yenda, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Beer Company (Coca-Cola Amatil);Golden and still with a poofy head. This smells like Waldorf salad!? The taste is got the essence of Granny apples, with an almost soapy flavor. Sweet and yechy.

Brenham Lager;Brenham, Texas, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brenham Brewing Company;"Decent beer, but not much like a real lager to me. Very fruity taste, but not much hops presence like I would expect. Decent, easyto-drink beer but not really what I expect from a beer labeled ""lager."" Dissapointing."
Brenham Lager;Brenham, Texas, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brenham Brewing Company;Assuming that my brother wasn't drinking his at the tail end of a drinking session, this brewery needs some quality control. The beginning was innocent enough, but rice and corn seemed to take over halfway into the taste and didn't give up. Pale, yellow, halfway between clear and cloudy.
Brenham Lager;Brenham, Texas, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brenham Brewing Company;I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Given the proximity to College Station that this brewery is, I was not expecting much. This lager had a nice malty taste, wasnt overly crisp or skunky like many lagers tend to be. The finish was great, crisp apples.
Augustiner Oktoberfest Bier;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Augustiner-Bräu;Pours an unknown color from the traditional wooden beer barrel, with a fluffy cap of white foam that dissipates fairly quickly in the opaque ceramic glass. Aroma of clean pilsner and melanoidin malts, herbal and earthy hops, and a traditional German lager yeast. Taste follows, a light metallic note develops the more you drink which is unfortunate. Not sure if it was from the cleaning method of the glasses or the ceramic was actually leaching iron, but it got almost unbearable by the end of the liter. I guess that is Oktoberfest in Bayern for you.

Augustiner Oktoberfest Bier;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Augustiner-Bräu;500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 6.3%. Rich yellow gold colour. Small, short-lasting head. Slight citrus and bready, corny aroma. Moderate-medium carbonation. Taste does not follow the aroma thankfully, there's a mild nondescript citrus bittersweet kick but then a rich dark-bread malt makes itself known, much better than weedy reedy lagery white-bread malts, and really carries this beer. It's sweet, even verging on caramely, but it's anything but sickly, and the flavours mesh very well, giving the brewer quite an accomplished impression - something most Augustiner beers tend to do. If it takes 6.3% ABV to have a lager with this level of flavour, go for it I say.

Traditional Scottish Ales Stirling Bitter;Stirling, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Black Wolf Brewery;Cask (handpump), Market Porter, Southwark. Seemed a fairly typical Scottish bitter to me.

Bitter End Wits End;Austin, Texas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"This should be called ""wheat's end"" because it tastes more like a wheat than a wit. It lacks the coriander and spice punch needed to make it a credible copy of most top wits."
Bitter End Wits End;Austin, Texas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This is said to have been modeled after Celis White, it was a decent try, but came up a bit short. Tasted almost like a wheat beer, notes of clove and sweet celery. Not enough punch to it.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;Only Jamesport beer I’ve ever had. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a slight hazy orange to slight burnt brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds. Light lacing was there. The smell had a light grainy apricot to wheat breadiness going on. The taste was exactly the same. On the palate,this one sat about a light to medium in body. There’s a light sessionability about this one. Overall, good beer worthy of having again.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;Draft. Apricot and lemon wheat malt aroma. Hazy pale yellow with minimal head. Tart apricot and wheat malt flavor. Nice balance. A very nice fruit beer.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;Flight draft in Ludington. Hazey yellow-orange color with a white ring. Dusty fruit aroma. Nice peachy flavor mixed with the wheat. Pleasant.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;5 oz. sample on 5-20-12 (Flight 1)- served a nontransparent, appearing very much like unfiltered freshly made oj. Slight nose of apricots up front. Hits the mouth with a light body, malt is buried by apricots, but it’s alright in this case. Went down way to easy...
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;Had this one on draught as part of the sampler at the brewpub in Ludington, Michigan. Cloudy medium yellow pour with some flowery hoppiness, very fruity, pronounced apricot and peach with some apple sweetness, clean finish. Good.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Hazy golden amber hue with a small white head that diminished slowly. Sweet wheat and apricot aroma. Full apricot flavor with a good wheat finish. Took a growler with me.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewery. Not much aroma, just a slight hint of wheatish malt. Cloudy straw yellow with a very thin white head. Wow, candy-like peach or apricot flavor. Medicinal, caugh syrup finish. Thin body, water dry finish.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;Sample at brewery and growler fill. Cloudy yellow and thin head. Wonderful apricot and hop aroma, which does a pretty good job of indicating the overall flavor as well. As others have indicated, the apricot, while assertive, isn’t sickly sweet or cloying. Will glady return to Ludington for another growler fill of this.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;Nice foam floating on pretty lemony-orange hues. Creamy palate. At least the apricot flavor is bitter, not sickly sweet, and seems relatively authentic. In all, nice flavor, zingy finish. Good.
Jamesport Apricot Wheat;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jamesport Brewing Company;So here's the thing. I've carried a ferocious anti-fruit beer chip on my shoulder for a long time but recently have had some decent fruit brews and have to wonder. Either my palate has been broadened with experience or the breweries have figured out how to actually fold fruit into the process more adeptly. In any event, I find this brew to be beautifully apricot - not so much that cloying cheap artificialty sends me raging into that good barbaric night that damned so many fruit beers heretofore, and not so little that it seems only a whispered afterthought. No, there is apricot AND some malty substance both to this brew and if I wish for more hop balance it is still in recognition of what is, after all, there.
Zwarte Flesch (Van Den Bossche);St. Lievens-Esse/Herzele, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Van Den Bossche;"Clean golden colour, frothy head, disappearing in a few minutes; too much yeast deposit. Simple aroma, with just some malt and white sugar. Good body structure, not too strong, pretty sweet; some alcohol, malt, sugar; too simple. Ordinary palate, rather poor hop. Nothing more than pleasant and drinkable."
Sonoran First Anniversary Alt;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Sonoran Brewing Company;NOT ON THE CASK.The best of the day. Nice red color. Good white head. Well balanced flavor with floral and spice notes. Slightly dry finish.
Sonoran First Anniversary Alt;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Sonoran Brewing Company;CASK Deep amber color, the head is creamy white, the lace in thick sheets.

KClingers Brown Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On tap at Otto’s in State College, PA. Pours a clear, deeper brown colored body with a finger-width, creamy, light tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is light with some nutty grains, a hint of caramel and fruit, and a light earth. Flavor is a bit better. Lightly sweetened caramel and a touch of toast up front with a bit of a fruity, nuttiness. Light, but noticeable earthy hopping comes in as the toast kicks up a bit. Finishes dry with a light bitterness and a touch of sweetness to balance. Fairly lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a decent brown ale. Nice grainy sweetness and a balanced earthy hopping and toast. Nothing special, but easy drinking and sessionable.
KClingers Brown Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Sampled on draft at Otto’s this beer poured a dark brown color with orange highlights and a huge foamy orange-white head that lingered and left good lacing. The aroma was smoky, woody and had a faint fruity presence. The finish was dry and woody. Medium body. Eh.
KClingers Brown Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On tap at brewpub. On the fence for this one. There are some mushy cereal, rotten grain flavors, but then some decent hop balance. Really, it’s not my style of Brown. A little sweet, rather plain, and with a slight off flavor.
KClingers Brown Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Pours brown from tap with a big brown head. A hint of caramel malt on the nose. Pretty plain on the tongue. Clean finisher. Nothing too exciting.
KClingers Brown Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Clear garnet appearance with a medium sized cream colored head and good lacing. Subtle, caramel malt aroma with some nuttiness just beneath the surface. Hazelnuts, toffee and toasty malts accent the gently hopped taste. Smooth, mild, moderately carbonated mouthfeel leading to a medium length finish. A nice session beer. On tap at the tavern.

KClingers Brown Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Courtesy of Juart from growler. Pours a dark brown color with a slight reddish hue. Has a slight beige foamy head, but not really that much. The growler was a little old though. The aroma is a sweet butterscotch with a slight cream and grainyness. The flavor has a dark toffee with some roasted coffee notes, a little bit of black cherry, and a nice bitterness to balance out the heavy malt sweetness. A bittersweet chocolate flavor that lingers on the tongue. A good oily texture with a very light carbonation.
KClingers Brown Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Clear brown body with a small tan head, fading. The nose is light with clean yeast, herbs and caramel.

Tawny brown colored body, moderately hazy, with a medium to small sized tan head. Sweet bready toffee malt nose, with a mildly starchy bread and cracker flavor, with mild use of hops. Some toasted maple and bread in the finish, and it dries a little bit as well. A good brown ale overall.
KClingers Brown Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Had all the qualities of a nut brown ale. Had a dark brown coloring with a small head and a very slight hop aroma. Taste was smooth, but was a little too watery for my tastes.
Robinson Red;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Red in colour, as advertised. Quiet, malty aroma could use more punch but seems fairly inviting. Nice, round malt flavour feels good in the mouth and good going down. Some cherry traces add a welcome second dimension to the aroma and flavour. Not stunning by any means, but a nice, average, red-coloured ale.
Robinson Red;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Robinson Brewing (Canada);I think that I must’ve gotten an off pint of this (which doesn’t completely surprise me, as I had it in a less reputable bar than C’est What), ’cause I didn’t like it nearly as much as most of the other raters. It looked OK, with a reddish color and a small white head. But there wasn’t much aroma to it, and the body was watery and not very flavourful. I just got a hint of fruitiness in the finish once it had warned up a bit. Not repulsive, just pretty bland.
Robinson Red;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Draught at C'est What. Reddish body with a white head. Decent red beer with a lot more hops in the flavour than I remember, almost citrusy in the finish now. Intriguingly pleasant.

Robinson Red;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Roasted malt aroma, clear ruby, very little head. Malt and nutty flavours, some bitterness, good after taste of malts. Nice tongue tingle, full bodied. Rich texture, a fine hardy amber!
Iron City Oktoberfest;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;This is a special brew made by Iron City (at least for this Oktoberfest), and I had it on tap at a bar. I've had much better oktoberfests... actually i thought it was fairly similar to the Augustiner Lager. Far superior than IC and IC Light but still nothing special.
Puntigamer Radler;Graz, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Puntigamer (Brau Union);I drank this beer in a restaurant in Vienna, Erdbergstrasse 111. After the good meal, this beer is find but there is nothing extraordinary. The body is yellow and gold, thin and white foam.

Puntigamer Radler;Graz, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Puntigamer (Brau Union);Typical euro radler. Pale yellow, small white head. Lemony citric aroma, malty. Sweet taste, some soury feel from citric lemon. Ok when ice cold. Drinkable if nothing better.

Northwoods White Weasel Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;12 oz bottle purchased at Four Firkins in St Louis Park, Minnesota. Pour is a dirty golden, hazed, with a foamy two inch white head. Some fine carbonation bubbles and floaties appear in the glass. Aroma is cracker grain, and sort of a dull earthiness - not aggressively dirty, but not real clean either. Taste is the malt and grains, along with light lemon sweet citrus, and followed by the earthy dirt of the nose. Nice and refreshing until the finish. Palate is light to medium bodied, active scrubbing carbonation and the unfortunate dirt aftertaste. Overall, still a decent enough beer.
Northwoods White Weasel Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;"Appearance: Pours a thin, clear yellow body with a small white head. Smell: Lactic, soured wheat aroma. Ugh, everything’s all messed up! Taste: Good grief. Extremely lactic taste overall, a hint of adjuncts here and there, but it’s simply unfinishable. Lord knows I tried! Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Mild carbonation. Drinkability: ""White weasel"" has since become sort of a colloquial saying around these parts."

Northwoods White Weasel Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Pours a transparent pale golden with a thin, spotty-lacing white head.

Northwoods White Weasel Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Picked up a single 12-oz bottle from the brewpub. Pours a very light blonde pale brew with no head. Only a few bubbles on edge of glass. Aroma of multi-grain, steamed rice, with some flowery hops. Taste is highly carbonated, watered down orange peel, some corn flake character and light sweet flowery finish. Palate is too clean and very watered down.

Northwoods White Weasel Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Hazy Yellow Coloring with White Ring. Faint Wheat Aroma. Wheat, Lemon Notes on the Tongue...Faint Hops as Well. Very Drinkable. Agreeably Not a Cream as Much as an American Wheat Style Brew. Actually one of Their Tastier / Non-Offending Brews, if Not the Best So Far.
Northwoods White Weasel Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Yellow color with a thin head. A little wheat for the aroma. The taste is a passable rendition of a wheat with some citrus as well. Disturbingly enough, not a bad little beer. Oh... it’s a cream ale? Um, no... but it’s drinkable.
Northwoods White Weasel Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Actually one of the best brews of the night even though I was rushed out of the bar at 11:00 (slow night). Light hazy straw color with a wispy white head. Light cotton candy aromas. Mild wheat and light citrus flavors. Now I see the description as a cream ale. Seemed more like a a wit. This place really has to decide on its style and how they are going to brew.
Northwoods Lil Bandit Brown;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;The Aromas are toffee, herbal, dark malt and a hint of roast. Flavors are like nose, on the sweet side. Slightly thin body yet strong carbonation. I just cannot imagine how this recipe won an award at gabf

Northwoods Lil Bandit Brown;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Had it on tap at Northwoods BrewPub in Eau Claire Wisconsin. What can I say, the score says it all. I will say it is hazy brown in color low hop aroma and slightly sweet.

Northwoods Lil Bandit Brown;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Bottle from Skyview, thanks! Clear chestnut with a thin tan head. Aroma is faint yet malty with nuts and light breadiness. Taste is meh with nuts, malt, toffee and malt. Thin bodied and par for their course.
Northwoods Lil Bandit Brown;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Shared 12 oz. bottle at a monthly geek tasting. Poured to a sampler with a ruby highlighted, dark brown color, modest off white/light tan head foam, and light, streaks & spots of lacing. The nose was a very light, uneventful aroma expression of the flavor, which was light nuttiness, and cloying sweetness of caramel, molasses, and toffee. Toasty malt, hop bitterness, and carbonation were soft, the body was fairly light, and the texture was watery. Nice potential in the variety of notes, but basically came off as an average, homebrew entry.
Harviestoun Navigator;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in May 2006. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Floral hops present in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts gives a slight digestive biscuit flavour in the mouth.

Not sure that its made any more and this was a couple of months past its best before date, but I picked it up anyway in case I can’t get it again. Deep red/brown colour with scant head. Cardboard and caramel malt aroma. Very heavy toffee flavour, with more caramel and hints of treacle. Dry malty finish but not a lot of bitterness. Definitely 80/- in style. Didn’t really go a bundle on it, but I’m not a great fan of the style anyway, so I haven’t marked it down too much.
Forth Puffer Ale;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);A brown beer with a small beige head. The aroma is sweet with notes of caramel and hops. The flavor is of roasted bread, hops, and burnt caramel, leading to a dry roasted end.

Forth Puffer Ale;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Bottled. Amber with a reddish tinge, stable white head. Roasted malt aroma, amidst good servings of honey and maple syrup. The sweetness transfers to the flavour and stops abruptly on the palate.
Forth Puffer Ale;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Forth Brewery was founded by partners in the Maclay Brewery which stopped brewing in 1999 passing production to Belhaven. Output and range are still limited at the moment, but if this Puffer Ale is an example of what is to come they should do well. This is a good example of an 80/- Ale: rust, blood, pregnant fruit and toffee apples. This was the bottled version and, though fresh up front, did have a metallic, stewed hops finish.
Forth Puffer Ale;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Sampled cask conditioned at Akkurat, Stockholm, Sweden. Deep ruby. No head. Fruity and somewhat chocolatey. Medium bodied, sweet. Clean finish with low bitterness.

La Barberie Rousse au Miel de Sarrasin;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Bottle (500ml). Via trade with Lubiere. Reddish-brown, hazy, with a huge tan foamy-fizzy head. Aroma of slightly vegetal malt, honey, light spice, maybe a hint of toffee - a touch sour. Taste is odd - watery sour red table wine, light molasses, a little earthy and a strange almost chemical aftertaste that lingers a long time. Mouthfeel is acidic, watery, harshly ... something, only slightly carbonated. Not my favourite - is it supposed to be sour and peppery like this?

La Barberie Rousse au Miel de Sarrasin;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;(5oo ml bottle) Pours a large, almond head and a cloudy mahogany body. Very pretty to look at... but looks can be deceiving! Nose is slight honey and vinegar with undertones of whiskey. Most sour beer EVER. La Barberie and Schoune must have the same brewmaster becase the consistency for spoiled beer is an ALARMING rate!
La Barberie Rousse au Miel de Sarrasin;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Cloudy indian red color. The nose is yeasty and fruity. Some tartness in the body, light fruitiness and a light hoppiness. Pretty straighforward.
La Barberie Rousse au Miel de Sarrasin;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Hazy dark reddish amber. Slightly medicianl in the nose with honeyish notes and foresty hops. Palate is stale wood, dust and decrepit fences on old farm roads....yeast ferments mildew into a dry fizzy finish. Aroma is a good start but this one got away from the brewer at some point.
La Barberie Rousse au Miel de Sarrasin;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Dark murky brown in colour. Aroma was a bit metalic but at the same time still had some citrus notes. Flavour was tart, acidic and a little metallic. Overall, not very interesting.

Solstice d'Été aux Bleuets;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Wonderful acidity of a berliner weisse which transforms into a sweet blueberry juice at the halfway point and finishes that way...From one end of the spectrum to the other, this weisse is well-done, but its sweetness gets tiring...I prefer their berliner with raspberries...

DuClaw Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;Nice malty aroma, with an even better mixed malt taste with just a little bit of smoke. A big win for Duclaw with this one!
DuClaw Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;This beer is amazing, not to much of a smoke flavor, but there is a large caramel sweetness but it is well balanced, pours a deep mahoghany, delicious.
DuClaw Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;"Sweet sassy Jesus! I go on this website to see some beer reviews and I get a bunch of namby pamby pretention about aromas of raisins and boozy aftertastes (with yanni playing in the background). Holy smokes people, this Isnt how you rate beer! I’ll show you how to rate twisted kilt. First, you put on some Amon Amarth. Then you open up your growler and pour a half liter of brown gold into a freezer chilled ceramic 0.5L mug. Appearance? Unnecessary. Give it a sniff, you will find it stinks a little, its probably the only thing that sucks about this beer. Then you tilt er back, and take a nice frosty pull. Its a good smokey red all right, with just a bit too much sugar. They kept off the hops like no one seems to be able to do or understand. DuClaw is usually good at that; laying off the hops. Take that first mug in about 7 swills. Pour out another 0.5L, new mug, just as frozen as the first. Let that tan head overflow a little. This is humanity right here. Letting that tan head overflow, going a bit farther than necessary. Now take another swig. The sugar is starting to get to you. You think: ""just a little less sugar and it would be so damn perfect"". Oh well, finish this one. People have been tortured to death for multiple days on end, you can handle a second beer with a bit of stink and too much sugar. Pour a third beer. If you are out of frozen mugs, you are a loser. This one starts to teach you. That sugar is still a bit much, but that stink is gone. This is a good pint. Feel free to air guitar. Finish the growler in the last of your pints. Does it matter anymore? Life is great. This is a good beer, and we are free to enjoy it."
DuClaw Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Pours a very dark brown with a tan head that recedes fairly quickly. The nose is roasted malt, dark fruits, sweet malt, and a bit of smoke. Taste brings light smoke and some dark malt. A bit of dark fruit. Fairly hefty body with a bit of alcohol. Drinkability i okay, but it’s fairly run of the mill. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 11-10-2010

DuClaw Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;Draft at Bowie location. Arrived at the table a reddish amber color with a thin tan head. A sweet aroma of caramel, vanilla extract, burnt malts, and wet cardboard. Thin to medium-bodied. Very sweet taste throughout. Lots of caramel, burnt maltiness, chocolate, and some vanilla extract upfront. Roasty coffee follows. Some weird smokiness and a touch of alcohol warmth at the end.
DuClaw Twisted Kilt;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;DuClaw Brewing Company;Not bad. Im not a fan of scotch ales but this one was pretty good and worth a try. Smokey, caramel, sweet. Good, but not great.

Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;Bottle. Golden colour with a white head. A very standard lager beer. How many of this boring lagers with different labels do Aass bother to make?
Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;A not too bad rendition of pale european lager. Not much can be said. Slightly malty. Serving: Can

Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;Pours a nice light golden yellow. Aromas of hops, grass, and maybe corn. Taste is crisp with a nice mellow hop flavor. Still better than Bud/Coors/Miller light products.
Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;"(Can 50 cl) Golden with a nice head - yet surprisingly hazy. Fresh, slightly bitter with an odd tartness coming close to Swedish ""Färsk-öl"". Canned for the American market. 221203"
Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;When I sampled this for the first time, 2 years ago, I declared that I could drink it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Now. I was probably trying to get on the good side of the pretty girl who poured it for me, but I was impressed, though I'm an ale man, and I really coouldn't down too many lagers in a row, unless forced to do so... Thin, white bubbly head forms a small ivory ring over a typical lager hue, pale yellow. Aroma greets the nose happily, with dry, floral, citrusy notes, lots of lemon. Highly aromatic from the moment the can is opened. Mouthfeel is straightforward, unintrusive, clean, pleasant. A sweet and happy finish that walks along your tongue, taking it's time. Light body, very tasty. Just what you need in a lager.Excellent on draft, too
Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;From a can, beer pours (in Chimay glass) a very light applejuice (piss, read 'urine')-golden color with virgin-white, small-bubbled head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is of burned wood citrus with straw. Flavor is a slight citrus coverup to straw, and generally bland tasting liquid. Heard great things about this drainpour of yucky yellow beer. So much for celebrating #50. Sampled at 71 degrees Fahrenheit.
Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;Light yellow/straw color. Tiny white head fizzes away. Almost no aroma. After thourougly enjoying the Aass Classic, I was disappointed by this watered down version. Had some straw flavor with some malt, but was too thin. Not much to write this beer just didnt have enough there (wasnt overly carbonated though!). Get Aass Classic if you want a real treat from this brewery.
Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;Color is clear golden yellow with a creamy-like head that was just over a finger high leaving nice sheets of light lacing as it settled. Smell is faintly of a grainy malt thats a tad sweet and has a floral grassy/hay like hop note in the back. Taste is clean and sweet of a lightly roasted malt, held back, tamed crispness thats balanced in well with a hop thats a floral, bittering, piney dryness. Feels smooth and clean, slightly acidic, light to medium bodied with a good hold of light sweetness and piney tang dryness thats very easy to handle. Everything about this beer states balance, balance between sweet, crisp, dry, with smooth, tart, clean, just about all this beer emcompasses in its flavor and feel just makes it a very easy, smooth, and good drinker.
Aass Lager;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;"I tasted a full-alcoholic version, so, I cannot call it ""watery"". It's rather very ordinary lager but quite drinkable with some hops in the finish."

Delafield Oktoberfest;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Delafield Brewhaus;Deep amber. Mostly caramel malts and herbal/earthy hops. Brief caramel malt sweetness that is ultimately taken over by the hops. A strange herbal-like hop bitterness that lingers a bit. Not a good match.

Deep solid amber with a touch of head...malty, sweet, a bit raisiny in the body, just a hint of toastiness, and a fairly large smack of alcohol...body reminds me of caramel-apples, but with rum injected into them..syrupy, a bit too boozy, some nice toasty malts are present but for me the alcohol is just too much for this session style. Rather harsh finish.
Delafield Oktoberfest;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Delafield Brewhaus;Magnifying bright orange in color with a thin and creamy peach colored head. Squeezable plastic toys register first for aroma, anteceded by honey roasted almonds, fading Nutella, caramel, butterscotch and autumnal potpourri. Nice sweet and nutty flavor profile. A delectable mix of brown sugar sprinkled pecans and pistachio, complimented by a maple and honey one-two combo. Carbonation levels are nearly perfect, and the oaken and nutty sweetness derived from patience in lagering is greatly appreciated. Just enough spiciness to seal the deal, protruding with pepper and rye. Therein lies the finish, along with a sweetened brand flake cereal aftertaste. Very well done.
Delafield Oktoberfest;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Delafield Brewhaus;Amber color with no head. Sweet alcohol aroma. Light malt flavor with some honey to sweeten the mix. Very drinkable and a nice example for the style.
Delafield Oktoberfest;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at the Brewhaus. Very light, very short-lived head. Yes, it looks like the amber, maybe a little deeper red. The alcohol this year is 6.9, and it is noticeable but not in your face. Very malty and sweet, but not cloyingly so, this is dangerously drinkable. Similar in style, but bolder in flavor, than the Pschorr Brau Octoberfest.

Pours a near clear amber with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a strong malt note of hay, bread and grain without much else.

Delafield Amber;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Draft at the brewery. Filtered orange-tan with a thin, steady off-white head. I’m not really an Amber fan in the first place, but this is pretty sub-par stuff. Dull malt tones, somewhat rancid and butterscotchy. Off flavors galore, no hop presence. Belongs at Calumet. Gross.

Mishawaka Umphreys Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle at MBC after band concert brewing. Dark amber color with a moderate white head that diminished slowly with small lacing. Moderate sweet hop aroma. Medium body with creamy texture. Medium flavor with small bitter finish.
Mishawaka Umphreys Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;They really went wrong with this beer. I believe it is one of the other beer lines with just a slight variation of flavoring added.
Mishawaka Umphreys Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;I thought I was drinking plastic for a moment. Something must have gone astray in the fermenter, because the off-flavors were not acceptable. Perhaps it is the hops, but these hops taste like they were grown in my asshole. A good bargain...
Mishawaka Umphreys Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Picked up two cases for $30 at the brewery. Tastes a bit cidery and uses hops to cover the higher than average alcohol content. It goes down smooth, but the flavors don't mesh together all that well. An average beer, but definitely worth it at that price.
Mishawaka Umphreys Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottled version. Unimpressive, cloudy golden body and an instantly fading head. There's a definite citrus aroma, orange, some pinapple and hop resin. I'm not quite sure what they were aiming for here. I think it's supposed to be an APA, but the result is sort of twisted. This beer reminds me of the not-quite-premium from concentrate orange juice, which tastes a little stale and has an awkward bitterness to it. MBC's Lake Effect Pale Ale is much better.

Aass Fatøl Light;Drammen, Norway;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Aass Bryggeri;"Norwegian ""light"" beer always means low alcohol (<2,5% ABV).

I asked the waiter if they had cleaned their lines lately. He looked at me strangely. I stated that I thought that it was off a bit. He stated that it wasn’t. My first thought was then...""so you regularly serve sub par beer"" I asked for the Oktoberfest.....While they didn’t blink when I asked to exchange the beer. They did come back and ask if I liked the Oktoberfest. I stated that it was ""OK"", and the waiter replied ""yes it is truly excellent isn’t it?"" I nearly threw a fork at his face."

Pyramid Beatnik White;Seattle, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Poured from tap at Berkeley Pyramid ale house, labeled as Belgian style white, a cloudy blonde with small white head. The nose was very soft with a little citrus and something like corriander and cinnamon. Flavor was mostly sweet honey, light spice of cinnamon, and sweet citrus. Very little carbonation, tang or malt-feel to this one. Palate is mostly sweet with a very small tartness, and the spice is very subdued. Overall the flavor is ok but the beer lack spiciness and carbonation as well as being too sweet. I would skip this one next time.

Pyramid Beatnik White;Seattle, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);The menu card said this was a Belgian style white that included spices like coriander. Fine, I thought, so this is supposed to taste like Hoegaarden. I took a sniff and sip and said: apricots?!?!?!, a Belgian wit isn't supposed to taste like apricots! Then my dinner companion pointed out that I had also ordered Pyramid apricot ale and the ditzy waitress probably put the tasters on improper places on the laminated beer menu. Sure enough, that's what happened. Cloudy, light orange color. Citrusy smell with a hint of yeast. Bitter, watery, with a hit of wit yeastyness. Some spice, but without strong coriander flavor or fullness of most wits.

Very metallic, slightly acidic aroma with some malt hints. Strongly acidic, slightly buttery-malty and sweetish flavor with a strong metallic feel. Light to medium-bodied palate with medium carbonation. There can be no excuse for a beer as metallic as this one. A hint for the brewer: An oktoberfest should be sweetish-malty - not acidic-metallic.

Pyramid Black Fog Nitro Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Tasted at Pyramid’s Berkeley brewpub as a taster set w/5 other beers. Beautiful in the glass- Cappucino-like thick head contrasting with dark brew below. Scent, though was of instant coffee-thin, unpleasant, almost medicinal. best part of the beer is how it feels in the mouth- as smooth as cream, with tiny nitogen bubbles accentuating the deep roasts. The beer then goes downhill. Sour at the end, with no more depth. A quick flavor. I kept sipping just for the wondrously smooth mouthfeel.
Pyramid Black Fog Nitro Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);(Draught) Brown bubbly head with an opaque body. Coffee and caramel nose.

St. Louis Premium Kriek;Emelgem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Tried this recently in a beer bar in Berlin, typical of the style, but very intense cherry flavour, and pleasant hint of almondy bitterness from the stones. Rich and fruity ( we ordered it instead of dessert) and perhaps rather too sweet to drink in large quantities but lovely with food . Liked this more than some of the other Kriek lambic beers have tried
St. Louis Premium Kriek;Emelgem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Mørk rød klar med lavt rosa skum. Lukter mandelkjærnepudding med rød saus. Søt. Uten bitterhet. Smaker lett syrlig kirsebær. Kort
St. Louis Premium Kriek;Emelgem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Very sweet, surprisingly so for a lambic with a just a hint of sourness. Deep cherry flavours. I would re purchase. A very easy drink low in abv.

St. Louis Premium Kriek;Emelgem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Najmniej lambikowy i najbardziej słodki Kriek, jakiego piłem. Dobry, słodko-kwaśny, ale to już nie piwo raczej.
St. Louis Premium Kriek;Emelgem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;It pours a pink color and has a sweet taste with a smooth cherry , sugar aroma.
St. Louis Premium Kriek;Emelgem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Ich finde dieses Kriek, das doch recht verbreitet ist, eigentlich ganz gut. Mit klassischem Bier hat das Getränk natürlich wenig zu tun. Aber es hat den klassischen Kriek-Geschmack, auch wenn es ein bisschen zu süß erscheint.
St. Louis Premium Kriek;Emelgem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Slušný sladký kriek, chutnající jako třešňová limonáda. Neříkám podle hodnocení, že průměrné nebo tak, ale víc jsem si oblíbil lambiky čisté, kyselé a bez přidaného cukru. Na posezení, či do horkých letních dnů ale toto pivo určitě sedne.

St. Louis Premium Kriek;Emelgem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Sweet Jesus that's good. Perfectly balanced, velvety, sweet, tart, delicious, in short. Slightly lower abv and a smidgeon too thin for 5.0 but am struggling to criticize here

Angelic Sinners Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Angelic Brewing Company;Festival tap:Massive cascade, deep black with tan head, very sweet and strong malt nose, big chocolatey taste, very rich and thick. Dry coffee notes at the finish, peaty and sweet aftertaste. This is a rich one!
Angelic Sinners Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Angelic Brewing Company;"Black body, wispy tan head. Nice strong flavor on this one. Starts with a deep dark fruit flavor, like a ""gourmet"" chocolate filled with a sweet, syrupy cherry filling. Also, it has a rice krispie dryness. Dark chocolate and light coffee aroma. A satisfying oatmeal stout! Could have used a bit more mouthfeel, however."
Angelic Sinners Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Angelic Brewing Company;Glass at the brewpub. Deep dark charcoal...light smoky-roasty chocolate-grape nose. Gorgeous milky chocolate initial flavor, cafe latte in the middle/end. Could be a bit fuller, but really just a terrific flavor...leaves massive, intricate lacing. Nice little finishing bite.
Angelic Sinners Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Angelic Brewing Company;Black body with brown head. Aroma is roasty, medium sweet, caramel. Flavor is mild -- coffee/roasty, slightly sweet. Medium/full body. Pleasant, but that's the best you can say.
Angelic Sinners Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Angelic Brewing Company;This was a dark black beer with a tan head. It had a subtle coffee malt scent. It tasted of coffee, only slightly sweeter. Pleasamt aftertaste.
Angelic Sinners Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Angelic Brewing Company;ehhh...this is strictly a minor sin, say undertipping at a restaurant, as opposed to something big like murder. A beer that plays it too safe and has little character beyond a hint of smokiness and a pretty head.
Angelic Sinners Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark brown, near opaque with a small bubbled tan head. Aroma of sweet malt with a touch of mild roasted barley. Very smooth in mouthfeel. Light malt flavors. A very mild stout.
Angelic Big Red Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Angelic Brewing Company;Amber Coloring. Not a Bad Ale Per Se, but Not Much to Offer the Tastebuds. Sweet, Easy Going Down.. Slightly Malty. Boring.
Angelic Big Red Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark amber color with minimal head. Slightly sweet all around with a bit of malt. Eh, just not much to offer.
Angelic Big Red Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Angelic Brewing Company;I'm one of the few people on here who likes looking for a good red, and unfortunately, I was dissapointed by this one. It had a sweet scent, but a touch of caramel was the only noticable flavor. Balanced to the point of being bland.
Angelic Big Red Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Angelic Brewing Company;Leinie''s Red with a bit of a hop bite. Pretty bland.......................
Angelic Big Red Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Angelic Brewing Company;Ambered color ale. A full, malty mouthfeel which leads to a crisp hop bitter finish. Nice!

Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;This smoky beer is one of the best scotch ale’s in Madison. It hits your nose as you tip your glass to drink and the flavor rocks!
Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;Pretty garnet in color, like a glowing rose. Oily, web-cast head and similar lacing tracts. We’ve still got some laundromat aroma, along with some wafts of sweet caramel and grenadine syrup. Sweet, bing cherry flavor couple with rye. Some caramel, butterscotch and cedar. I’m beginning to believe that their beers are very conservative so they don’t offend. I think they could make the flavor leap and go all out, but I have yet to see a committed effort from these guys. Indistinguishable malt monster clusterf*ck finish.
Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;Brown Coloring with White Skin. Malty Aroma. Sweet Taste...Malty and a Bit Stale as Well. Tart and Dry Ending.
Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;"Dark copper color with a thin head. Mutty malt aroma. Sweet malt taste with a bit of an alcohol zing. Some kind of nut is lurking in the background; walnut? Very smooth. Tasty, but if it’s going to be a 99 shilling brew it should land a knockout punch."
Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;Festival tap: Very creamy and thick bodied beer with big notes of scotch malts and a nice firey alcoholic finish. A bit over the top, but the malts do make their presence known.
Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;"Yes, it looks the part, but if you’re in Madison, I’d recommend the Great Dane’s Scottish Ale over Angelic’s. Hell, just go to the Great Dane instead of Angelic. RERATE: I’ve had this beer three or four times and every time it has been of decent quality. I gave it an overall rate of ""3"" before. Last night, however, I had a pint that was awful. There was a big taste of grape cough syrup, insipid aroma, drank like a soda pop...I’m not sure if it was the batch or the lines, but I’ve never had a beer that tasted like this before. Because of this, I _have_ to rate it down a few notches."
Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;deep ruby body, sweet ripe and a bit fruity. carmel, noticeable alcohol content. somewhat scotchy
Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark brown with a tan thin head. Aroma of heavy malt, light peat and alcohol. Heavy malt sweetness starts the sip with roasted malt and light peat later. The darker malt and alcohol dominate in the finish. I do prefer the balance of a good 80.
Angelic 99 Shilling Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Angelic Brewing Company;It looks the part sure, but the aroma is awfully faint and the beer itself is pretty insipid - sweet, but not enough nuttiness.

Print directly on the bottle. Silhouette of a Raven flapping it's wings. Pours opaque dark brown with medium-sized beige head. Settles as thin layer of foam struggling to cover the surface of the beer. Moderate lacing. Aroma is intense, sweet and with a notable alcoholic presence. Brown sugar, molasses, chocolate of the bitter variety, vanilla. A little boozy brandy odor. Light carbonation. Medium thick, oily, soft sticky texture. Flavor has a heavy sweetness followed by a more moderate cofffee bitterness. Aftertaste has a stronger bitterness - but still with a prominent underlying sweetness. Lingering. What use you have for beer who holds the cold Russian winters in mind in California, I can't say. But it is a an fine concentration of sugar, coffee and alcohol.
Eel River Raven's Eye Imperial Stout;Fortuna, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Eel River Brewing Company;Bottle from BevMo! in Willow Glen, CA. Aroma is vanilla, caramel, chocolate, anise, some leather / tobacco. Taste is tangy dark fruit, vanilla extract, tobacco.

Saftig aroma og smak i en perfekt balansert kombo med kaffe, sjokolade, røde bær. Rund, fyldig, og med lett delikat bitterhet som gjør det til en fornøyelse å helle den innenfor snippen. Saftig og passe tørr på samme tid. En vennlig avslutning på en super aften. Tnx Sigmund!
Eel River Raven's Eye Imperial Stout;Fortuna, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Eel River Brewing Company;Et typisk imperial Stout. Meget bitter og stor smag af lakrids og en fed smag af mørke malte. Heldigvis også en del sødme.

Aroma is faint medium/dark malt-caramel. Taste is medium/dark malt-smoky/roasty/caramel/chocolate. Faint/secondary hops bite. OK carbonation. Occasional.
Mash House Schwarzbier;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;draught. Pours a dark brown, a little reddish, with a fading white head akin to that on a glass of cola. The aroma is mild and malty, non-descript. Flavor is of a little chocolate, flat hops which are almost papery, small chalk. This is semi-thin and kind of boring, but drinkable.
Mash House Schwarzbier;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Draught. Pours a clear dark burnt red with off-white head. The aroma is clean and, erm, lager-y, with sweet malt, some chocolate, a faint leafy note, and some pepper. The flavor is bitter chocolate, some moderately bitter roastiness, and an ashy finish. A little bit of cardboard comes out in the aftertaste. It gets nuttier as I get down the glass. The body is thinner than I would like.
Mash House Schwarzbier;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Balck, or really dark brown. Virtually no head. Peppery, faintly coffee-ish aroma, with maybe a touch of honey, perhaps? Palate seems rather rich at first, but kind of disappears as you finish it. Flavor is coffee, and Oreo cookies with a mildly hoppy finish. Draft at Barley’s Knoxville
Mash House Schwarzbier;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Clear dark brown color with foamy white head. No lace. Roasty brown sugar nose with brown sugar again in the flavor along with subtle chocolate. Roasty finish. Not a big fan of Schwarzbiers, in general, but this one is decent.
Mash House Schwarzbier;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Slightly off-white head with good retention. Black color lets a little ruby through. Not much aroma-what is there is faint malty, chocolate. Flavor is malty with smoke and caramel-chocolate. Medium body with soft finish and not nearly as dry as the standard German counterpart.
Mash House Schwarzbier;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;A nice head over an appropriately dark body, but the head dissipates a bit too quickly. The aroma is satisfyingly smoky. Nothing really to note about the mouth-feel. Flavor-wise, this was a pleasant beer, not ruined with hops (especially Cascade) the way so many recent beers are. Overall, this was a nice drinkable beer, but not really much above average.
Mash House Oktoberfest;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Orangish in color. Not much head at all. Fairly malty color. Malt, caramel flavor. Not bad. Just put it on tap yesterday.

Nice toffee and caramel aroma. Tas is malty smooth, with he same notes of caramel and toffee, but also a hint of cardboard. Gently sweet finish.
Mash House Oktoberfest;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;"Huge, blossoming white head--imagine an albino mushroom cloud!--stands over a dark orange brew. Intensely aromatic from far-off: principally citrus, flowers and honey. Perfectly fits the Bavarian wheat style as I understand it, but where does the ""winter"" part come in? The brewery specializes in wheats, or should I say ""weisbier specialitaten"", as it says on the label, but no further information is given about this ""winter wheat"" business, or what the heck a ""Schneewalter"" is. Thirst-quenching, delicious, substantial, and sweet. Quite good, but I can’t find what ought to set it apart from other Bavarian wheats."
Mash House Oktoberfest;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Aracauna pretty much nails this one. Nothing exciting, too bland for an Oktoberfest. I did find the hops a hair too strong for an Oktoberfest, and the head dissipated entirely too quickly.
Mash House Oktoberfest;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Pale spice in the aroma and flavor with some caramel. This isn't one of the overhopped O'fests, but like the other two beers from the Mash House I tried, it's thin and bland.

I've never tasted anything like it but it's a very simple taste of nature. The taste of weeds we chewed on as kids. It shows some fortitude by the brewer. Glad for it.
Outer Banks Lemongrass Wheat Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;This has a full flavour profile that really shows off the wheatgrass. It’s probably an acquired taste for some. But it’s worth trying once. I wish I had access to more this I would buy by the case for summer.
Outer Banks Lemongrass Wheat Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Can: Poured a clear golden color ale with a medium size foamy head with light retention and minimal lacing.

Outer Banks Lemongrass Wheat Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Draft at the brewpub. Pours clear yellow with a small white head. The aroma has a nice lemon zest, a bit of yeasty esters. The taste has a touch of tartness before the creaminess of the ale comes through. The flavor is fairly typical of the style but this is refreshing.
Outer Banks Blackstrap Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Outer Banks Brewing Station;A thick tan head that just won't quit atop a jet body. The aroma is fairly typical of the style, except for a few notes of sweetness from the molasses. This is quite possibly the smoothest, creamiest beer I've come across this side of something that has been N2 dispensed. The flavor was nice, without the espresso notes that some brewers feel compelled to insert, with a surprisingly buttery finish. Overall, this is on of the better porters I've had recently.
Outer Banks Blackstrap Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Starts off with a huge, everlasting tan head. Nice creamy, velvety mouthfeel. Average porter malt but interesting butter flavor that I'm assuming comes from the molasses.

Blue Ridge (SC) XXX Total Eclipse Stout;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Stout;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);Enjoyed a pint of this at the brew-pub in Greenville SC. I was very impressed with this brew, and despite not usually being a fan of stouts i declared this to be a newfound local favorite. Other than the initial impression of a weak roasty aroma, this beer was phenomenal. Had a great strong flavor intensity of roasted malt, coffee, caramel, etc. I suppose a relatively standard flavor profile for a stout, but it was the fullness of the flavor that distinguished this beer. Finished smooth with an aftertaste of coffee. Had a pitch black color with off white head. Strongly recommended! Also paired incredibly well with smoked gouda and bleu cheese of my entree that evening. ---Rated via Beer Buddy

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Carolina Beer Company;Tastes more like a pumpkin spice cake than a beer. That being said it tastes like a good pumpkin spice cake haha. A bit of yeasty breafiness but not Mich else besides the pumpkin. Succeed s at least in that regard
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Carolina Beer Company;Draft: This is good, but nothing spectacular... lots spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, very pumpkin pie-like. Body is lacking a bit, it’s a bit thin.

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Carolina Beer Company;From 12oz bottle. Pours a dark amber with little head. Cinnamon and slight nutmeg aroma. Touch-o-hops basically waters down the spiciness of the beer. Kinda weak. Dogfish Head Punkin Ale is a much better example of a spiced pumpkin ale.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Carolina Beer Company;Poured from the bottle. Aroma is full of nutmeg, with some hints of clove. No real sweetness or hop presence to speak of. Color is a nice orange-amber hue, with small white head. Flavor is strong clove, with just enough malt sweetness to balance the spices. Again, not much from the hops. Overall, this is not my favorite style, but this is a nice pumpkin beer.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Carolina Beer Company;Usually the one I reach for at a party, when it’s down to this or non-local pumpkins. Like most, this one’s basically a perfunctory amber ale with just enough hop bite in there to provide some relief from the overwhelmingly sweet additions. Just never a style I’ve warmed to, but this one’s better than some.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Carolina Beer Company;Bottle. Pours an amber color with almost no head. A fair amount of clove smell to this. Not as heavy on the spices as many other pumpkin beers, but still not great.

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Carolina Beer Company;Originally reviewed: 10/27/10. This is the old version, pre-Foothills takeover. 12oz bottle, part of an autumn-themed mixed sixer. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a very thick, cloudy dark rusty amber. The thinnest of heads rests atop. Disappears quickly. Not even a ring around the edge. No lace. The nose is weak and underwhelming. The spices are muted, pumpkin is absent. I’m finding sour fruits, and syrup. Not what I expected. The mouth is decent. Good carbonation play, and a slightly heavy finish. I don’t know. This has some mild pumpkin in the flavor, but it’s pretty weak. It’s more cider-y, with notes of apples and light spices. I’m not sure I would or could have another one of these. I expected more, but it was found lacking. Too bad. I wanted to like this.

W aromacie nuty opiekane, razowca, karmelowe, winne, dzikiej róży oraz alkoholowe na sposób lekko gorzelniany.

Beer Factory Santa Fe;Mexico DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Factory Restaurant & Wood Grill;Some rust and a little caramel. Rusty red pour with good head and lacing. Slight tang in finish but pretty clean. Tap at brewery.
Beer Factory Santa Fe;Mexico DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Factory Restaurant & Wood Grill;My Bottom Line: Underhopped or very sweet, it doesn’t matter. Dust covers this brew’s toasted cereals and the creamy sugars get unpalatable quickly. Further Personal Perceptions: -A slice of foam stays atop the dark amber. -The hefty body reduces drinkability considerably. -Fruity caramel flavors reach dominance soon enough. -Yet another Mexican artisanal brew that over-the-top sugary... On tap at Fiebre de Malta, Mexico City.

Beer Factory Santa Fe;Mexico DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Factory Restaurant & Wood Grill;Had it at the Santa Fe shopping mall in Mexico city. I felt a very artificial taste in this, watered down with a caramel and smokey taste. Its better than other Mexican Viennas but maybe i dont like the style too much. I dont know why there are so many viennas in Mexico.
Beer Factory Santa Fe;Mexico DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Factory Restaurant & Wood Grill;I went to the Beer Factory in Puebla and ordered this while watching a baseball game. The appearance is typical of a vienna-style beer, and the flavor and aroma are very pleasing. No bitterness, and in my opinion a better alternative to the stout they also offer. If you are in Mexico City or Puebla, make it a point to go to a Beer Factory.

Beer Factory Coronel;Mexico DF, Mexico;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Beer Factory Restaurant & Wood Grill;My Bottom Line: Stale hops and wet biscuits try to muster the courage to build a Pils together. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the honeyed golden. -There is no crispness, no hop zip, no clarity at all in this one. -Carbonation is low, which doesn’t work with this particular profile. -This is quite fruity for a lager... -Dusty edges bore quickly. On tap at Fiebre de Malta, Mexico City.

Snoqualmie Falls Harvest Moon Festbier;Snoqualmie, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Snoqualmie Falls Brewing Company;"From a growler fresh from the brewpub. Pours cloudy copper-amber with head and lace. Aroma of brown malts and old fruit juice. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Flavors of amber malts, minerals, grains, wet rag, caramel. Overall rich and flavorful but a tad more sweet with malts than BJCP guidelines, not clean, bready, or with a dry finish and not something I totally crave after a glass. Here's the overall BJCP guidelines: ""An elegant, malty German amber lager with a clean, rich, toasty and bready malt flavor, restrained bitterness, and a dry finish that encourages another drink. The overall malt impression is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich aftertaste that is never cloying or heavy."""

Modelo Obscura;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);"This is available in bottles now for a limited time, marketed as ""Edition Especial"" with a fancy plastic label. Purchased in the mini-market in the plaza near the convention center. Truthfully, I found this identical to Negra Modelo in every respect (I had one right after the other, so I’m pretty set on this). Here is my rating for Negra Modelo: Dark amber, brown sugary aroma. Sweeter palate than the pale lager, a little metallic though. Not bad considering its origins. Ditto for Modelo Obscura."
Modelo Obscura;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);While staying at Barcelo Premium Colonial Resort in the Mayan Riviera this was one of two beers available on draft.

Selins Grove St. Fillans Wee Heavy;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Had this on cask at the Selin’s Grove 14th anniversary party. It was the ’09 and it was served into a goblet. A - Pours deep dark brown with a strong one finger white head, dissipating to a light film, leaving minimal lacing down the glass. S - Lots of toffee and caramel sweetness up front. Some dark fruits, most noticeably raisins and figs, begin to come out as it warms up a bit. It looks like the extra cellar time has killed most of the boozy aroma’s giving this one a sweet roasty nose. T - Plenty of sweet toffee and caramel up front giving way quickly to a mixture of dark fruits, raisins and figs, and bit of earthy hops. Finish has some strong sweetness that lingers for some time after consumption. Booze is ever present offering a light warming feeling but it is hidden well. Very sweet but not to the point of being overpowering. Very nice wee heavy. M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Quite the creamy feel with a lingering sweet finish. Not too much heat from the booze in this one. D - Good not great. I really liked this one but I liked the barrel aged version better. I am not sure I could have more than one of these at a time. Definitely a sipper at 12% ABV.
Selins Grove St. Fillans Wee Heavy;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;On cask at the brewpub. Reviewed from notes. I was told this was a wee heavy, but given the taste of it and the reviews from here, I’m sure it’s the same beer. I believe this was the 2009 edition. Pours dark brown with a thin off white head with some staying power, leaving a bit of lace as it does recede. The nose brings dark fruits, caramel, a touch of booze, and some sweetened malt. The taste adds in a bit of chocolate and brown sugar. A bit more alcohol. Definitely a dark, earthy version of the style. I suppose this really is more like a wee heavy. Good caramel and toffee throughout. The feel is fairly heavy though not overly so. Drinks quite well and was a nice sipper. Serving type: cask Reviewed on: 10-24-2010

Arrived at the table a deep clear ruby with a moderate linen white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace. Pleasant aroma of rich sweet malt with toffee along with a few vapors of alcohol.

The downside here is that when a beer is ""common"" or hard to really mess up that folks stop trying to make a beer interesting or unique and you rarely taste a Scottish ale that makes you stop and say... mmmm. Well Selins Grove you made me stop to say... mmmm. Soft, Carmely, smooth, with absolutely no bitterness. This is the kind of Scottish ale that sets standards."

Selins Grove The Phoenix Kriek;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer - Flavored;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Very old rating found on a loose page while cleaning, possibly from 2010. Notes are from a tasting, possibly RB gathering in Grand Rapids - Reddish pour. It smells of cherries and spice (cinnamon, I think). The flavor is full of tart cherries along with some cinnamon. Very good.

Selins Grove The Phoenix Kriek;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer - Flavored;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Growler shared 6/10/16. Definitely a very unexpected surprise, as I never ended up trying this stuff back in the day (that I remember). Good clarity to this black cherry liquid with some brighter hues on the edges. Pink-flecked, off-white head is initially large but fully falls to cover/ring rather quickly. Huge cherry nose has light glue, medicines, all sorts of phenols and definitely some wood/vegetal-like cherryskin notes. Despite the slight medicinal/phenolic character, which I believe is actually quite natural/authentic, it’s bursting with huge aromatics and bright fruit flavors but yet retains a funky, fermented/macerated feel to it as well. Honey and vanilla show through, from the malts, packing the aroma even more full. No alcohol or flaw. Just like the 2 Roads Framboise Noir was ultra jammy, this thing is super medicinal, but in a mostly good way. Lots of cherry pit, cherry flesh and light cellar qualities, with huge black pepper phenols and a sweet, lightly syrupy at times (but for the engaging carbonation which helps clear it) texture. Definitely on the sweeter side of things, relative to Belgian fruit beers, much like New Glarus. But just like them, the fruit is done so well that it’s easy to forgive a lot.

Selins Grove The Phoenix Kriek;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer - Flavored;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;"Aroma - tart cherry, cherry pie like filling and associated sugary nature, some crumb and sugar. Appearance - body is a hazy garnet. The head is a soft pink, and around 3/4"" of an inch and settles slowly. Scattered lacing. Taste - has a rich black cherry - you can taste the skin and flesh of the cherry - at the same time you can taste a rich pie filling like flavor. There is a tart quality to the cherries, some sugary crumb like flavor. This is essentially a cherry pie in a glass. Quite incredible. Palate - medium bodied, sticky and slightly slick texture, average carbonation, tart and slightly alcoholic finish."
Selins Grove Apricot Wheat;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;This is more a fruit-accented saison with some funkiness than a fruit wheat. The apricot is front and center and provides a tartness that complements the slight musty funk and turns this into more of a dessert-like treat than a beer. It isn’t super-complex, and it’s definitely a ’girly’ fruit beer, but damn it’s fresh and tasty.
Selins Grove Apricot Wheat;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Very nice, had a slight amount of sourness that brought out the fruit well.

Beaver Street English Pale Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - English;Beaver Street Brewery;Traveling drank this @ Beaver Street Brewery and Restaurant Flagstaff,AZ - Poured light yellow color - I had to really stick my nose in to smell any hop presence! Very watery and lacking real taste? Almost tasted like a commercial grade mexican brew? Overall very unsatisfying! Not recommended!
Beaver Street English Pale Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - English;Beaver Street Brewery;On draft at Beaver Street. Pour was full amber colored body with some copper hues. Head was nice off-white, provided excellent almost continuous lacing all the way down with some ring patterns in there. The aroma was caramel, toffee, some piney-citrusey notes, but certainly not strong. Flavor followed the aroma, nice bitter resinous bite at the end of each sip, only gentle floral and citrusey touches behind it all, more bittering hops than any flavors. The mouthfeel was quite nice, slightly creamy for the style, a decent sipper (in a somewhat unimpressive style for me) on a beautiful sunny afternoon in Flagstaff.
Beaver Street English Pale Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - English;Beaver Street Brewery;Smell is citrus, hops, and malts. Look is clear straw colored with a nice white head. Taste is sweet, caramel, smooth, with a good balance of malts and hops. Good overall.

Nice refreshing &#8216;summer&#8217; beer."
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;Big thanks to Hairofthedog for sending this one my way, doesn’t look like many more people will ever have the chance! Medium orange amber, slight head, faint bread aroma. Some hop bitterness mixed with an odd roasted note and some slight sour flavors. Odd. Not bad, just strange. In the end, the sourness just doesn’t hang.
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;"(12 oz bottle: Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) This is one bizarre smelling AND tasting beer. It’s both pleasant and unpleasant at the same time, testament to the fact that I like some aspects of this beer and hate others. It tastes very vegetal to me, but also very sweet and malty like ""raw"", yet-to-be-boiled wort for a dark beer. Mild bitterness adds very little to this beer. I think it’s the finish that is very vegetal, and unfortunately that finish really hangs on the palate. The nose is also very malty and ""raw"". Medium bodied with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Medium amber in color, fully clear in appearance, with a small off-white head that recedes to a rim around the edge of the glass. Some patchy lacing. In summation, this is yet another oddball beer from Gem Of The Sea, a beer that certainly falls outside the boundaries of the style, just like their other beers. Maybe it’s like their pilsner and is better on tap? Who knows, and now they’re out of business? No real loss there in my opinion.(12 oz bottle: Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) Okay, so I saw another bottle in the beer cooler at Hi-Time Wine Cellars and figured I should give this another try. This is a totally different beer this time around, and obviously a fresher bottle. The nose is pleasant, mostly sweet caramel, and minimally hoppy. I get a moderate amount of sugary sweet caramel in the flavor too, well, more sugary than caramel. Fairly mild on the hops, even in the finish. But it’s not vegetal and it’s definitely not like raw wort like the first bottle. This is just a simple, pleasant, easy drinking amber."
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;"Marketed as ""Jarhead Red"", but there wasn’t any red in the pour. Poured clear and gold with a chunky white head. Sweet aroma. Not much going on. Light hop spice, balanced with light malt. Nothing stands out. Short aftertaste was mellow and sweet."
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;"Cloudy peach color with a small quickly subsiding off white head. Aroma is flowery, yeasty, spicy. Flavor starts with a hint of sweetness abruptly put aside by a sharp grassy, spicy bitterness. Light on the palate with a long dry bitter aftertaste. Not consistant with most other ratings; bad batch??? Guess I'll never know, I won't buy it again."
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;Orange amber with smallish head, malty sweet aroma, hint of spice. Begins with a sweet caramel maltiness, slightly thin body and finishes with hops that have a spiced taint. I found this to be somewhat interesting with the spiced hops being it’s distinctive characteristic, though not overdone. No too bad, but I had this one after a Red Nectar which was much better.
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;Weird peanut shell color to it with maybe a touch of sunset and a salt water wash on the top. Has a very sweet, malty molasses maybe aroma backed up with some hopiness. Starts off watery then shows some malt body and then goes back to watery hops. Nothing special.
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;Clear amber color, decent head formation. Light malty caramel aroma. Bitterness from start to finish, caramel flavor is light, slightly grainy, finishes with a nice bitter bite.
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;This ale pours with an amber orange body topped by a thin white head with a decent amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet and rich with malt with a very slight hoppy bitterness. Smells a lot like a dopplebock. The flavor is very similar however the hops step forward and show themselves more. Not a real prominent flavor but not bad. Medium bodied and relatively smooth.
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;Red amber color with a thin head. Oddly sweet aroma, honey, oatmeal and brown sugar. Flavor was also oddly sweet, rich malts, a little hoppiness and a citrus finish - somewhat unbalanced. Smooth, medium body, lightly carbonated and easy drinking.
Gem of the Sea Solomons Ale;Vista, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gem of the Sea Brewing;(bottle) A light amber color. A nice pleasent aroma. The first taste of it didn't appeal to me at all, but after that it became a nice red ale.

Brewerkz Spore Pale Ale;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Ale - English;Brewerkz;Finally found this rating from a year ago. After so many ho hum lagers this is a good respite. The fact that well hopped beers are popular in hotter climates seems to be lost to most, but this is a welcome departure from the mould. A good orange/amber colour with fine head, the fuggles become evident quite quickly. Good body and mouthfeel and a fine finish in this beer makes it a solid and honest beer

Brewerkz Dunkel Weizen;Singapore, Singapore;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brewerkz;Suffice to say, when I compare an Erdinger Dunkel or a Paulaner Dunkel to this brew, its pales utterly in comparison. In all fairness though, it’s an alright interpretation of a dark wheat beer. Well, it’s been a fair amount of time since I last drank it and, I am rating from memory. Maybe it has improved.
Brewerkz Dunkel Weizen;Singapore, Singapore;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brewerkz;"Draught at the brewpub, January 2007 Muddy dark-amber color; thin creamy head.

The final is too short. Not enough body/malt, but bitter enough."
Brewerkz Dunkel Weizen;Singapore, Singapore;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brewerkz;This will be interesting as I have an Erdinger Dunkel to compare this with. Good colour and head when poured, the latter actually lasting for a good while. There is a typical estery presence of apple which seems to be caramelised by the presence of the malt and chocolate. Good dry finish and a refreshing beer for the climate

Davidson Brothers IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a dark copper color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipated within several seconds. The aroma had a fairly big malt character to it with some earthiness, grass and butterscotch. The flavor blended lightly between the malts and the earthy and grassy hops. Cues a nicely blended aftertaste rolling into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine. Overall, decent as an English styled IPA as the brewer suggests or brewers as I see this is brewed at Shipyard. Do-able.
Davidson Brothers IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;English style, and they invented the IPA, I enjoyed this, thanks for sharing Ron! Malt heavy, caramel, toffee. I don’t recall the notes added by the hops, but they were muted.
Davidson Brothers IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;The low reviews seem to be from this being rated as an American IPA when it is definitely an English IPA. Pours Dark copper with a thin white head. Aroma is dominated by malt: caramel and some butterscotch. The flavor is also very malt driven. Caramel, butterscotch, and it finishes off with an earthy, bitter bite. A decent English IPA. Quite drinkable, but definitely a shock if you want an aggressive hop-forward American IPA.
Davidson Brothers IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Bottle. Pours a golden amber with a thin white head. Light pine and citrus notes.

French Broad Flanders Field Brown Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;French Broad Brewing;My first dissapointment is that despite the name this wasn't a Flanders brown ale. Instead it was more of the typical brown ale most micros have. It was thin for style and bigger than typical hops. I like my browns to have low hop and heavy malt, but this was reversed. I could have forgiven it if it had just had more malt, but it didn't.
French Broad Laurel Country White;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;French Broad Brewing;On tap at the brewery, Asheville NC, 7 July 2006 at 5.0%. Fairly pale colour with a modest haze. Mainly citric with less of the banana ester and spice feel than usual. Quite fizzy with a sort of soda water / Alka-Seltzer feel.

French Broad Laurel Country White;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;French Broad Brewing;Draught at the brewpub. Pours hazy yellow with almost non-existant white head. The aroma is banana, zest, and, erm, meadow. The flavor is more zesty than anything. The malts manifest themselves as crackers, and the finish is kinda dry. Definitely nothing special.
French Broad Laurel Country White;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;French Broad Brewing;Draught. Pours light gold, just ever so slightly cloudy with no real head. The aroma is pretty sweet with hints of pear, banana, and perfume. It’s quite weak in the mouth, but has faint suggestions of banana, cereal, cork, and apple peels. Even given the warm weather, this wasn’t even that refreshing. One should expect just a bit more flavor and complexity from this style.
French Broad Laurel Country White;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;French Broad Brewing;Pale yellow, no head. Aroma of orange (they put a twist of range peel in the glass before pouring, which may explain that) and a slight herbal note. Flavor is orange again, with coriander and um, cedar, maybe?Has a funky lambic character, as well. Sampled at 2005 Knoxville Brewer’s Jam.
French Broad Laurel Country White;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;French Broad Brewing;A pale yellow color with a light spicy nose. Good mellow flavor that goes down smooth. Otherwise, not much interesting about this.
French Broad Laurel Country White;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;French Broad Brewing;This Witbier is right down the middle. Nothing wrong here - nothing complelling. It is sweeter, fruitier than its dry and spicy cousins, but only slightly.
French Broad Laurel Country White;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;French Broad Brewing;The appearance was only average, being the good cloudy yellow but lacking the glow of some. It was a bit low on the coriander and couldn't compete with the spicier wits like Wittekerke or even Allagash's. More orange than coriander. Otherwise a nice mild take on the style.
Sophisticated Otter Porter;Johnson City, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Sophisticated Otter Restaurant & Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. Hey, this is a nice place for Johnson City! Outdoor beer garden in East Tennessee? Maybe there’s hope for civilization yet! This is not a bad porter. Dark black in appearance, with great head retention. Subtle roasted malt flavor, but mostly chocholate and black patent I suspect. Good hop balance and a less-than-stout body. Great when it warms up. Don’t start with this one at the Otter, finish with it.
Sophisticated Otter Porter;Johnson City, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Sophisticated Otter Restaurant & Brewing Co.;This was a surprisingly bold beer for a brewpub. Brewpubs on the average seem to be a bit timid on the flavor front. Nice black appearance with good brown, big-bubbled head. Big coffee flavor, some chocolate. Very stoutish porter.
Sophisticated Otter Pale Ale;Johnson City, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Sophisticated Otter Restaurant & Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. This would be the ale they make for the UN-sophisticated otters. Mine arrived flat. Kind of a dark-gold to amber color. Body was a little thin for me and the hops were very absent for the style. I think the brewer can do better.
Sophisticated Otter Pale Ale;Johnson City, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Sophisticated Otter Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Fairly citric beer with surprisingly low bitterness. A bit thin, but not too much so for style. This beer can't quite compare to the boldness of their porter, but it's not a bad beer, either.
Cantillon Loerik;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;Bottle. Pours a hazy orange gold with some carb and no head. The aroma is strong funk, rubber, floral, oak. Medium body, strong funk, nice tartness, glad to finally try this.

Aroma of deep dank cellar funk, basement, cobwebs, light mushroom, citric notes, mineral and slight mint notes. Flavour is light moderate sour. Light medium bodied with soft carbonation.

Cantillon Loerik;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;@ A day to sink all seasheppards, Thnx for sharing !!! Pours unclear blonde, very small ring of white foam. Smell is super intense on funk and oak. taste is intense, funk, oak, brett. Typical cantillon, in all the foog ways. Funky grainyness, but in a super-complex balance. Good MF . Has gotten soft carbo at this time. Very nice !
Cantillon Loerik;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;Pours a nice golden straw color and most bottles I’ve had have been nicely carbonated. It’s an interesting beer and is quite different from a regular gueuze. Worth tracking this one down but there is definitely some bottle variation at this point.
Cantillon Loerik;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;Bottle @ Pat’s. Thanks, Jer! Hazed golden-orange pour with a white head. Really citric and lemony. Funky mushroom and library books. Some damp straw, orange peel, and golden apple. Nice sourness to the flavor. A slight sweetness of orange marmalade and apple. Sour lemon and green grapes. A sort of musty funkiness and slight earthy quality. Sort of zesty.
Cantillon Loerik;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;Bottle thanks to Lulu, Shelton label. A very elegant beer. Nose is complex although a little oxidized. Beer the same.
Cantillon Loerik;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;This beer is so moderately acidic, and i dont find that in old lambic if it is not Cantillon. Perhaps above all on should speak of the elegance in the sourness that only comes with old Cantillon! An oxidation that makes one think of dusty cellar! The taste of green apple peel but a flavor the meat from red apples, complex is the least one can say!
Cantillon Loerik;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;Danke Lulu. Musky aroma with nice sourness. Slight oxidation which gives depth and keeps aromas of citrus and hay. Really an aroma you want to come back to and sit and smell for a while. Lovely complex flavor, simple but wow what a mouthfeel, in the beginning. Apples, citrus and lots of murky barnyard cellars. Long finish with a sour almost bitter finish. Although there is something in the after taste I dont really dig.
Cantillon Loerik;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;"Considering Cantillon’s quality, it would be a shame to throw away geuze bottles that show a fermentation going to slowly, so those bottles were cleverly marketed as ’Loerik’, meaning something like ’lazybones’. A geuze Cantillon ""in development"", so to speak. Due to the slower than expected refermentation, this one stays softer and ’flatter’ than the fully developed geuze Cantillon, but otherwise the main character is the same. Great, in other words. Which probably partially explains why this has become something of a ’white whale’ now that it is no longer produced, I suppose."

Benskins Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Cask-Conditioned. Light brown colour, sour flavour. In previous years Benskins was a large local brewery, Benskins Bitter developed a reputation locally of being unpleasantly sour. Now the beer is brewed hundreds of miles away, but it still retains the sour flavour.
Rebellion Lions Pride;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask-Conditioned. Much like many of the other Rebellion brews, slightly bitter and rather sweet. Rebellion could probably use making more beers which are distinctly different from each other.

Musty and dry aroma of apples, other citrus and toffee with a certain comfortable home smell. Initial sweet and apple taste that dries out and fades into a slightly bitter, tart finish with a dry mouthfeel and a lingering taste of apples and sugar. The first true cider I’ve ever had and I definitely enjoyed it.

Hopdaemon Leviathan;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;500ml bottle (Ales By Mail) (6:4:7:3:13=3.3) Sweet watery lemony malty aroma. Lovely resiny toffee malts and nuts in the taste. Watery palate, a bit dead, but a pleasant sweetening heft, some roast, chocolate hints. Finish of resiny strong English ale, some nuttiness and wood. Seems like a great 8% beer that's been watered down to 6%. Decent enough, though.

Hopdaemon Leviathan;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Flaska på Nya Tröls. En riktigt malttung pjäs, Mahognyfärgad med drag åt rött, i princip inget skum och bara en månad till bäst föredatumet och serverad alldeles för kall. Mycket söta maltsmaker. Russin, honung, mörkt bröd, treacle. Fina smaknyanser men också lite platt, aningen syrlig. Trevligt öl som nog drack under fel omständigheter. En höstkväll hade den nog fått högrre betyg.
Tyranena Ya Hey Der Honey Wheat;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Honey aroma with some citrus. Golden color with a thin, white head. Sweet, honey, floral, slight grass in the finish. Water and thin. Had some flavor, just not my favorite style at all.
Tyranena Ya Hey Der Honey Wheat;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Tyranena Brewing;Clear yellow with thin white head. No aroma of malt or honey. Taste is pure malt, no wheat character or honey flavor. Overall a nice refreshing beer for a summer’s day but not for fans of wheat beer.
Tyranena Ya Hey Der Honey Wheat;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Clear orange-golden body with a minimal white bubbly head. Cream of wheat-grainy aroma with a touch fo watermelon and banana. The flavor has wet papery cardboard notes, orange, and a dry papery finish. Wasn’t a big fan of this stuff.

Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;Probably the best pumpkin ale ever created. Has a great taste and it's not too overpowering. Good light aftermath and easy smooth feel to it.
Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;Golden orange color, small off white head. Caramel malt, spice aroma. Light body. Mildly sweet, yeast, spices, pretty straightforward pumpkin beer.
Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;Huge thanks to Erzengel for sharing. Bottle looks good. Beer in the glass zippy, small head. Malty-fruity aroma. Starts mild, a lot of herbal notes, some spekulatius, some peaches. Finish a bit washy. Okay.
Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;Shared with Erzengel! A clear deep golden beer with a small white lacing. Aroma of pumpkin spices, cinnamon, soft hoppy reddish malt. Taste of mild sweet pumpkin spices, cinnamon, reddish malt.
Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;Many thanks to Peter for this bottle. Great fantastic smooth pumpkin-spice beginning.

Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;10/31/18 Had just before midnight on Halloween with A after a date night. Poured from bottle. Very clear with only a slight head. Label is awesome! Nose is a bit subdued but caramel malt and nice pumpkin spice come through. Taste is crisp with nutmeg and pumpkin spice dominating an almost lager-like malt profile. Very spicy with some good sweetness and no discernible bitterness. Palate is crisp and light but decently full with better carbonation than I expected from the anemic head on the pour. Leaves behind some nice nutmeg/pumpkin spice flavors. Overall, a crisp and enjoyable beer that's tasty but definitely unremarkable for arguably my favorite style of beer.
Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;This is probably the best beer I've had with pumpkin in it. A perfect beverage for the fall. Always reminds me of growing up in Maine too!
Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;Pours a clear amber with little head. Aroma reminiscent of pumpkin pie. Taste is initially like a wheat beer, gradually fades to the palate. Palate is very similar to pumpkin pie, gradually fades to some light hops influences on the back of the tongue. Drinkable.
Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Shipyard Brewing Company;Pumpkin pie spice aroma light amber color. Taste ofvpumpkin pie spice with a hop bitterness finish.
Harviestoun Full Moon;Alva, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Harviestoun Brewery;"Usually producers of fine bottled ales, Harviestoun have let themselves down with this rather run of the mill bitter. The picture on the label is a moon behind a church spire which gives the impression of a slightly risque ""moon"". Sigh! Is it true that the quality of a beer is in inverse proportion to the rudeness of the label? The hops are Willamette, a rather soft, gentle breed, and Liberty, typically found in German lagers. The mildness of these hops may account for the lack of character in the beer."
Harviestoun Trumpet Ale;Alva, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Harviestoun Brewery;Bottled, pasteurised, 275ml, courtesy of Derek. Amber, carbonated white head. Sweet and thin beer, pasteurised beyond reason into a drab cardboardy, malty affair. Really not too good.
Harviestoun Trumpet Ale;Alva, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Harviestoun Brewery;"Subtitled ""a truly flatulent brew"" this is surprisingly good. Ken Brooker, founder and owner of Harviestoun, seems to enjoy producing ales with a range of hops and this is no exception. The hops used in the brew are Hersbrucker and Challenger, then Styrian Goldings are added for aroma. The result is a very clean, refreshing and citric beer with a subtle play of the citric fruits. An ideal summer session beer."
Kelham Island Fat Cat Pale Ale;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kelham Island Brewery;I was given this by one of my clients - it has no brewery name on the label, but he also gave me Pale Rider and told me it was the same brewery. This is a 20th birthday ale, and appears to be one of a series of anniversary ales that the Kelham Island Brewery in Sheffield produces. As the brewery started in the back room of The Fat Cat pub they have a number of beers with this title. The brewery itself was founded in 1990. Slightly hoppy nose, and the light hops continue into the taste. Thin body, but clean and refreshing. The hops becoming more pronounced into the aftertaste. A light and agreeable drink.

Valley Forge Rasberry Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Pours turbid deep golden with a strawberry blonde thing going on. Super aroma of raspberries, wheat, yeast, citrus, and hops. Has a delicious, full raspberry flavor, with citrus, yeast, hops, and wheat overtones. Finishes sweet, with raspberries, malt, yeast, and some citrus at the finish. I'm not a huge fruit beer guy, but this one is masterfully complex, super tasty, and extraordinarily refreshing. Bravo!
Valley Forge Rasberry Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Lots of rasberries in the aroma, cloudy & hazy appearance, the rasberry flavors were way too overpowering, way too much rasberries in this brew all together
Valley Forge Oktoberfest;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Draft at the brewpub. Solid copper, with malt, caramel, toffee. Smooth finish with a brown sugar element at culmination.
Valley Forge Oktoberfest;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Valley Forge Brewing Co;On tap at the Valley Forge Brew Pub. Poured a medium to dark orange/amber color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas and tastes of malts and caramel. Lightly sweet. Light hops.
Valley Forge Oktoberfest;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Valley Forge Brewing Co;"Like many other VFBC beers, there's nothing wrong with this brew - it's just that there's nothing remarkable about it either. Classic Oktoberfest burnt orange color, mildly sweet malt flavor with a nice nut finish. Hop profile was present, but, subtle. IMHO, they need to crank up the ""flavor"" volume on this brew."
Valley Forge Oktoberfest;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Valley Forge Brewing Co;...........................................................................
Valley Forge Oktoberfest;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Deep copper in color, didn't keep all that great of a head, a bit bland & watery, I've certainly had better marzen-style brews
Salopian Firefly;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Smoked - Rauchbier;Salopian Brewery;A nice malt whiskey aroma but the body is thin, sour and slightly redolent of vomit.
Salopian Minsterley;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Salopian Brewery;A fairly run of the mill pale beer with some nice orange fruit, but an imbalance of hops and malt leading to a feeling that this is too bitter. Quite freshing though, and the orange fruit is juicy.
Hop Back 15/50 Anniversary Ale;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich (JDW) 09/06/2002 Clear golden coloured and slightly pale. Some bitterness in a dry hop finish.
Hop Back 15/50 Anniversary Ale;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;The 15/50 of the name refers to Hop Back's 15th and the Queen's 50th anniversaries. This is a very pale summer ale with a refreshing and very fruity flavour. There's plenty of light tang from the soft but aromatic hops. The fruits keep returning in different combinations of citric flavours, and there's enough sweetness to stop the fruits from becoming sharp. A very good bottle-conditioned beer. 'Hoppy Anniversary' indeed!
Meantime Meridian Lager;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Van tap. Hopbittertje, vlak, koriander, witbiertonen, korte nadronk, fris. (6-2017).

Light sweet flavour with grainy malts, more lemon peel, straw, cereal. Light bodied with average carbonation. Finishes with touches of grassy bitterness, more citrus rind, cereal, biscuits. Not bad.
Meantime Meridian Lager;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Not bad, nothing to write home about really. A standard lager really, a bit of hops, but lacks any real bite - I prefer Meantime’s Wheat Beer.
Meantime Meridian Lager;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottle (from Sainsburys, BBE Aug 06). Grassy hops and sweetish malt aromas with an unusual but not unpleasant sellotape aroma. Fairly sweet but quite freshly refreshing. Not bad.

Nursery Old Mother Hubbard;Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Wessex Brewery;First tasted this in the Fat Cat, Norwich in June 2002. Cask, handpump dispense. Ruby black in colour with a thin creamy white head. Strong fruit dumpling flavours present in the long intense aroma. Thin but lovely creamy texture to the mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malts give a rich moist maltloaf base with molasses, plum jam, dates and sultanas. There is a slight earthy note in the brief aftertaste but sweetness returns rather quickly. The finish is malty and fruity with strong vinous cask notes and alcoholic sherry flavours evident in the throat. This is a cracking Old Ale does not taste like a stout though? Highly recommended.
Nursery Old Mother Hubbard;Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Wessex Brewery;1. Cask Stillage at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Oldham 23/03/2002 Black and strong in alcohol with some fruit aroma. Hint of rum flavour. Smooth slightly hoppy finish. 2. Cask Handpump at the Ship & Mitre, Liverpool 13/06/2002 Dark red coloure with big roast aroma. Bitter lasting finish. 3. Cask Handpump at Wilkie’s Tavern, Warrington 21/04/2003 Dark red coloured with some alcohol present. Fruity aroma. Slightly bitter hop finish.
Nursery Old Mother Hubbard;Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Wessex Brewery;"(pretty aged sample) Colour of extremely strong, nearly black tea; light brown, creamy head. Whiff of vinegar over grain, scorched grain and coffee. Again preserving vinegar in the taste, short lived but unmistakably, and returning with every sip. Coffee, but restrained; corn flakes and something faint cheesy - smoked cheese rookkaas . Well bodied, slick, slightly oily MF, thinner because of age & acidity. Thanks for this forgotten beer, MatW. As our mutual friend Ian Garrett would say, ""Interesting"" rather than really great."
Nursery Old Mother Hubbard;Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Wessex Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Deep red colour almost black, good cream coloured rocky head but slightly overcarbonated. Peppery aromas with hints of coffee powder, more coffee in the mouth with a fruity sour note developing but keeping itself in check without detracting from the flavour. Finish is dry and tinged with roast barley. More of a porter than a stout.Website suggests brewery is no more but beers being produced elsewhere.
Nursery Old Mother Hubbard;Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Wessex Brewery;Nursery Brewing is a new venture by Malcolm Shipp the owner of Shipping Beer who specialise in importing Irish Ales and various stouts, so it's no surprise that this bottle conditioned beer is a handome stout. The head brewer is Steve Cheeseright who won Supreme Champion with Knickadroppa Glory whilst brewing for the Sutton Brewing Co in Plymouth. This is a warm and smooth stout with bags of soft dark fruit and licorice malt flavours with sufficent fizz to make the whole thing taste quite light and refreshing. As a lover of well made dark beers I rate this quite highly. Strongly recommended.
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);yeah is some brew fellar! all we can get up here in top end apart from xxxx but that rubbish to dam expensive. you can dilute blacksmith with some paint thinner and you won’t tell the difference fellar. Great drink fellar i strongly recomend it if you want a life changing hangover you will never forget if you survive it.
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);This would have to be one of the top 3 beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Along with Regal, and Tooheys Red, this beer offers a wide variety of sensations to the palette along with a crisp array of fresh tastes and flavours. Both going down, and coming up. I couldn’t think of a reason why I wouldn’t buy this beer. Why you poofs are whining is a mystery to me. TWO THUMBS UP!
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Despite the ’bitter’ name it looks like a lager, smells like a lager and tastes... of not very much. Golden syrup in colour. English-style lager nose, light and hoppy. Malty notes in the mouth but it lacks body. Something floral but chemical and a bit nasty in the middle. Keep walking. (Can - doesn’t help with the flavour)
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);not to bad. a bit watery, but better than I expected. is everybody sure this is a pale lager?
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Bought a carton of this when me and a mate were hitting the piss (At 25bux a carton of 440ml cans). Its not good at all but its just like any other mainstream aussie shit, so my mate can pertend his other aussie mainstream beers rip it up, but they just dont. You could tell this was made of poor quality hops and malt - poor, poor, poor. cheers
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Independent Breweries eh? From what? Craftsmanship? A cheap swilling beer that has the positive going for it that it should never be skunked, simply because it is only in a can. Typical taste of thin Aussie macro swill.
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Thought this one was a bit thin ,slight bitterness with no flavour to go with it and couldn't tell the colour as I had it straight from the can.
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);Virtually no aroma. Sweetish and only mildly bitter taste. It is very watery. The only thing separating this from other Aussie standard lagers is a slightly darker colour.
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);i couldn't be too critical of this, it's like an aussie version of german supermarket beer, dirt cheap and bigger cans than normal. and even tastes okay, some bitterness, the sweetness is never overwhelming, not too metallic
Blacksmith Bitter;Laverton, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Independent Breweries (Australia);dark in appearance, watery with a sort of malty taste, good for the price (24 bucks for a carton of 440ml cans)

Three Needs Bohemian Pilsener;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Crisp, very hoppy, ok body, little in the malt department; seemed more like an IPA than a pils to me, and I didn't get much of the traditional lager/pils aroma, of course the pub IS super-smoky what the hell can you do in a smoky atmosphere about tasting beer I ask you?"

Larkins Traditional;Edenbridge, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Larkins Brewery;Cask at Ragged Trousers, Tunbridge Wells. - Earthy, even slightly cheesy green tealeaf and cracker, some sweet lemon in the nose. Dry zesty lemonade with a sweetish stonefruit ring and again some cheesy hop and/or slightly earthy yeast character not at odds with the mineral palate. Maybe this is basic for a bitter, but i could drink this kind of pumped up earthy goodness all day like Zoigl...
Larkins Traditional;Edenbridge, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Larkins Brewery;Draught at the Gallipot Inn. Slightly citrusy but not overly coming through in the taste. Classic cask ale task yet gentle on the palate. Very light / watery. Could go the distance for a good session (but not sure you’d want to..)
Larkins Traditional;Edenbridge, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Larkins Brewery;Sipped at a pub in Groombridge, food was utterly forgettable but this beer saved the evening. Taste of utterly pure ingredients with a subtle Kentish hop that lingers but does not overstay its welcome like some of these new fangled dolly-Parton beers.
Larkins Traditional;Edenbridge, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Larkins Brewery;An excellent session beer due to the sensible strength,smooth flavour and easy drinkability. Hop and malt are well balanced with no overall dominance of either so the second will go down as easily as the first (and so on). It is refreshing for a hot afternoon and there is little danger of a sore head even after several. It is unspectacular but that is entirely the point, it doesn’t aim to be. This is a good one to introduce people to traditional English beers.

Larkins Traditional;Edenbridge, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Larkins Brewery;"Cask @ ""The Man Of Kent"" Rochester. Simple eazy to sink old man type of beer, this 28 year old digged it too. Dusty hops are spicy and floral. Toffee malts ..some fruity orange..earth ..pine and lemon zest. This beer ,despite being floral-does taste a bit like its got cobwebs all over it. Dusty yeast or something. Nice brew anyway bozo."
Larkins Traditional;Edenbridge, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Larkins Brewery;A Mes rate. Cask at GBBF. Copper colour with thin off white head. Slightly oaky, some toffee, dull and slightly astringent citric bitterness. Boring.

Old Kent Opener;Sevenoaks, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Kent;Cask Conditioned. Mid brown beer with thin disappearing head. Overwheming tea, ash flavours, dry but thin and watery, little mouthfeel.
Old Kent Opener;Sevenoaks, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Kent;"Kent's newest brewery, Old Kent, opened in 2000 in Borough Green with a range of five beers; their names based on cricket: Fine Edge, Full Pitch, etc. The blurb on the bottles puts an emphasis on the traditional and hopes to evoke a long past country atmosphere. All the beers are bottle conditioned. The Opener is a disappointing start - thin and lifeless, this is like a weedy old man in stained and faded cardigan shuffling up to the wicket to be bowled out for a duck."
Old Kent Top Score;Sevenoaks, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Kent;The name on this bottle refers to a record-breaking test match score by Brian Lara in 1994. This is the best of the Old Kent beers I've tried, but is perhaps impressionist rather than traditional in style. The flavours are dotted around, and sometimes seem out of place - it's interesting and tasty enough, but doesn't quite work as a team. Worth another innings though.

Poured into a pint glass, fridge cold. Best before 01/08/19. The beer pours a deep dark amber with cherry red tinting where the light bleeds through. A slight haze with two fingers of uniform compact head. The colour of the head resembles the yellowness that a heavy smoker with a greyed moustache might experience(my roundabout way of saying yellow tinged white). The aroma is sweet and malty, reminisced of a bock. Caramel and cereal grains. A hint of corn. Simple but inviting. The taste follows exactly. Sweet, caramel, malt, grains. Clean and very tasty. All lager-pilsner-dortmuner-hells beers should be like this. Medium-low carbonation in the mouth. Clean, slightly sweet aftertaste. A very simple, very well made, very tasty beer. I think you’d have trouble finding a better beer in the style. I’d love to try this one on tap.

Han Red Ginseng Beer;Pulborough, West Sussex, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hepworth Brewery;Brewed by an unspecified brewery in Warwick trading under the name the Han Red Ginseng Beer Co Ltd, this is a light tasting lager flavoured with ginger and ginseng. There is another beer flavoured with ginseng called Cupid Ale by the Robert Cain brewery, so this is not especially unique. The flavour is very much that of a ginger beer shandy. Light and resonably refreshing, though the sweet ginger flavour can stick to the mouth a bit. One to give a miss really.

Heavyweight Stickenjab Alt Bier;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle @ The WWGT2D? Tasting. I hope travlr doesn’t rate this. Amber with a small head. The nose is oxidized, as you’d expect. SOme sherry and rotting cherry. Cardboard sprinkled with cocoa powder. The taste is a great advertisement for the benefits of cellaring. Nasty cardboard. Mildly soured cherries. Bear claw donut. Light body, soft carbonation.

Heavyweight Stickenjab Alt Bier;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Join me, as I enjoy a Taste of History! Appearance: Cautiously poured a deep amber-hued body, quite clear, due to the yeast packed into the bottom of the bottle due to years of quiet solitude. No head beyond a few, large stray bottles. Smell: Toasted breadcrusts, some cooked honey, and aged-derived notes of cardboard and a hint of metal. Some dark fruitiness, some dirty socks. Taste: Toasted breadcrusts, forgotten grains, and a low, supporting honeyesque sweetness. Raisins, loose change, and some water-logged cardboard. Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. No remaining carbonation. Overall: This had been another installment of... a Taste of History!

Pours a dull amber with ring of near white head. Nose is sweet caramel, biscuit, and some oxidation. Flavor is a little cardboard, sweet apples. Medium palate. Decent for the style i suppose? Easy drinker.
Heavyweight Stickenjab Alt Bier;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle from kp. Served into a snifter. Pour is hazy nut brown with a small ring of sticky white head. Aromas of rasins, caramel, faded hops, and sweet fruit. Flavor is mellow and smooth with caramel, rasin, and plum. Past its prime but still enjoyable.
Heavyweight Stickenjab Alt Bier;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle (3 years old?), courtesy GodOfThunder. Pours a hazy, reddish amber color with a dense, foamy, khaki colored head. Minimal, spotty lacing. The aroma is mostly sweet, light caramel and bready yeast dominating lesser notes of toffee, floral hops, and peppery spice. Flavors follow suit, sweet biscuit and toasted bread showing in the forefront, with staunch floral hops following through. Dark fruits emerge at the mid point, mostly figgy, but reaching as far as sweet-tart strawberry. Medium-plus bodied and well carbonated, the mouthfeel doesn’t impress, but doesn’t disappoint either. As others have noted, it’s certainly not at its best, but it is still solid even at this age.
Huber Weisses Fresh;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);Bottle. Darker golden in color with a whitish head. Sweet fruity banana and wheat in aroma. Ripe banana and notes of wheat in taste. Quite sweet.

Sweet taste, low bitterness. Malty, somewhat estery aftertaste, but tastes light. Low carbonation, decent mouthfeel. As a light Weißbier to drink from the bottle ok, but not a fully fledged one.

Huber Weisses Fresh;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);Ein schnelles Flaschenweizen was auch aus der Flasche wohl genossen werden kann. Das gehört sich einfach nicht für Weizen... wie ein Pils aus einem Masskrug. Dieses Bier riecht nur bedingt nach Weizen. Es sieht noch einigermassen aus wie ein Weissbier aber schon im Einstieg wird deutlich es handelt sich um eine geschmackliche lite Version von Weizenbier. Es ist recht Süss und geschmacklich uneinheitlich. Zwar ist der Weizengeschmack erkennbar aber zu Schwach und zu Süß. Fazit: Vielleicht in der Gattung Flaschenweizen noch standard, im Bieruniversum mangelhaft.

Dogfish Head Punkin Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Dogfish Head Brewery;12 oz bottle, pours clear orange amber. Nutmeg and pumpkin dominate the aroma. Strongly spiced taste and finish, with pumpkin overpowered. Finish is somewhat unpleasant.
Dogfish Head Punkin Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Dogfish Head Brewery;12 oz bottle from Trader Joe's in Short Pump, VA The ale poured an almost clear rich amber color with and off-white head and lacing. A good looking ale. Your nose is attacked by clove, cinnamon, and hints of vanilla. Your taste buds are assaulted as well with more cinnamon and earthy chocolate. The pumpkin taste is very muted by the other spices. The ale has a medium body and average carbonation. Not bad for a seasonal ale. I like the ABV at 7%.
Dogfish Head Punkin Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottle. Pours brown. Vanilla, clove, cinnamon, biscuit, little earthy, touch of milk chocolate, dryish finish. Medium body. Not bad.

Amber in color with light white head. Taste soft cinnamon and nutmeg. Pumpkin also. Spice aftertaste. Delightful pumpkin and really drinkable. Cheers!
Dogfish Head Punkin Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours up a clear dark amber color in the glass, with a tan head. Pumpkin flavor is detectable amidst a cocktail of spices, including cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Where this ale excels the most is it's body as a brown ale, which creates a naturally rich platform for pumpkin without the overbearing muddiness of some. A little heavy on the spices, but good.
Great Dane Verruckte Stadt German Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap in Fitchburg, WI The third of four regulars that I tried on this particular visit provided another benchmark experience for the Great Dane's line up of regular and seasonal drafts. Much like Crop Circle Wheat it will not challenge your assumptions about the state of pilsners but will be easy to finish. AROMA / APPEARANCE Lemon crisp, buttered toast, and a tease of cereal grains compose the core of this balanced session driven bouquet. A clear golden body lightens the mood as it reflects back much of the active light. FLAVOR / PALATE Wheat, lemon crisps, and semisweet hay packed down by dozens of feet enrich the tongue with a fluid texture. The refreshing profile is otherwise unremarkable though not without its strengths. For those times when you just want a basic pils it does everything one would expect. This is another fine choice for any starter flight to calibrate your own preferences.
Great Dane Verruckte Stadt German Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;This pours a clear, dark yellow color with a slight white head. The aroma is slightly malty. The flavor is mild and good for a pils. Lots of grain and hints of citrus.

Clear pale yellow-gold color with a thin white head that evaporates quickly to a sparse film. Spotty lacing. Grassy hops and bready malt in the nose. LIght body with flavors of herbal hops, yeast and malt. The finish is mildly bitter with a short spiced hops aftertaste. Barely average overall.

Great Dane Verruckte Stadt German Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;A snappy pils with more hoppy bitterness than malty sweetness.

Nothing offensive, just not very interesting.
Great Dane Verruckte Stadt German Pils;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;A golden lager with a thin lacing white head.

Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;2/9/19. On tap at the brewpub. Clear amber red pour with a small khaki head that fades to a ring. Light fruity aroma, biscuit and caramel. Sweet malty entry, caramel, a touch of fruitiness, some bitterness and chalkiness. Eh.
Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;[Tap] On tap at the brewpub in Wausau. Pour is amber/orange in color. NOt much head on top. Cocoa powder and grain are the only things I could pick out of the aroma. Sweet toffee, caramel, noticeable alcohol and biscuity notes. A tad syrupy, with a sweet finish. An OK beer, but wish there was some better balance.
Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at downtown location. Pours a clear reddish color. Nose is of light fruit and sweet malt with some floral notes. This beer tastes nice and sweet, hints if molasses, caramel, roasted malt, and floral hops. The hops have more presence and flavor in this beer than the typical bock, but still in a subdued way. Very, very smooth and drinkable. Slightly warming. Medium body. Very well balanced with a hint of fizz in the tongue. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at downtown location, pours a clear dark amberish red with a thin white head, the aroma has a little bit of fruit that comes through with just a little bit of malt as well, the flavor has a lot of malt with a little bit of caramel and some spices as well, the abv burns just a little, mouthfeel is decent, not terrible by any means.
Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at brewpub Sitting in the quiet basement area I started out with a well made bock. Balanced, inviting, and a good deal at $3.00 during Happy Hour it was one of many good choices available on a cold winter evening. Aroma / Appearance - Soft ruby red and radiant the body looked like a warm hearth after a long fire. A radiant ebony head graced the top like a layer of packing foam. Butterscotch, caramel, and a primarily malt driven experience drives home a sweet experience from start to finish. Flavor / Palate - Caramel, cotton candy, powdered sugar, and peanut butter were not the combination I was expecting. Even so it seemed to be satisfying and reasonably gentle on the palate. While perhaps not a great release it is well enough done that I don’t feel like my time was wasted.
Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;good medium bodied and colored beer. nothing outstanding but good and solid performer overall lightly bitter,
Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Sampler. It poured a deep reddish caramel color and had a huge malty aroma. There was a small amount of hops and tons of caramelized malt with some fruity flavors. Not a bad bock brew.
Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Caramel-amber pour with a dense, creamy off-white head that leaves a sticky lacing. Faintish aroma, honey and alcohol. Initial flavor is sweet malts, cream soda and caramel, vanilla sweetness, offset by a minty spiciness and a sharp alcohol bite. Becomes significantly more bready towards the finish, becoming almost crusty on the linger. Full bodied, thick and quite smooth on the palate.
Great Dane Velvet Hammer Bock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Poured with a light tan head and a little lace. Nice brown color with red highlights.

Poured clear coppery-brown with a tall, creamy cap of beige head.. beautiful! The aroma was very strong with aged caramel and chocolatey notes present.. singed the nose hairs a bit on the back. The flavor found sweeter caramel at the core with strong peppery, boozy notes around and through the finish.. some nice earthy and fruity character joined in as well.. grainy and strong on the finish. Medium-plus bodied and spicy on the palate with a decent flow.

Mack Høst-Øl;Tromsø, Norway;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mack Ølbryggeri;This is not my kin dof beer. Way too much honey, and where there’s a lack of bitterness, there’s too much sweetness and overripe malts.
Mack Høst-Øl;Tromsø, Norway;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mack Ølbryggeri;500ml can from Rune and Finn from Tromso. Now I have never really looked at a map of Norway, and bugger me they live a long way away from just about anywhere. It’s only really when you look at these guys who live on an island in the arctic circle who have terrific numbers of rates especially as the price of beer there is so astronomical and then they come to London and must have the best time ever. Especially now. Anyway, this rating is dedicated to 2 beer lovers from a wintery island that is Tromso and for the great hour or so I spent with them in The Pakenham Arms on an autumnal Thursday late afternoon. This beer is clear orange gold with a lasting cream coloured head. The aroma I can say is not great. The flavour too isn’t the best in the world. It’s an ok, slightly cardboardy lager. It’s not terrible nor is it particularly good. But as I say the fact this comes from the edge of northern europe fills my heart with a sense of well being. Cheers guys and hope to see you next time you are in the UK.
Mack Høst-Øl;Tromsø, Norway;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mack Ølbryggeri;Can at home. The colour is clear light amber with a small white head. Aromas of pale malt, grass, berries and gooseberry, and hints of spices. The flavour follows with apricot and grassy hops in addition. Light and slick mouth feel, and light bitterness. A surprisingly okay beer.
Mack Høst-Øl;Tromsø, Norway;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mack Ølbryggeri;The last can of the northern Norwegian macro collection provided to me by Foffern, thanks a lot for these missing ticks man! :-) Pours a deep, near-brown golden orange with a medium, foamy white retention. Nose is light caramel and pale malt tones with hints of red berries and wet paper. Taste is pale malts, hints of caramel and some quite hideous metallic hints in the finish. Watery palate. Not good, I know Mack can to much better than this.
Mack Høst-Øl;Tromsø, Norway;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mack Ølbryggeri;(Can, 0.5 l, courtesy of Rune - thanks) The beer poured pale copper coloured and clear. Its head was medium sized, fizzy and white and it disappeared quickly. Aroma had caramell, toffee and mildly grass. Palate was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Flavours were sweetness, toffee, caramell, malts, mildly grass at the background and lowish bitterness. Aftertaste had caramell and bitterness. A bit unbalanced beer: flavours left the middle of my tongue completely deserted.
Mack Høst-Øl;Tromsø, Norway;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mack Ølbryggeri;Light brown and clear. Has a white head, mostly diminishing. Moderate malty aroma, toasted. Flavor is moderate sweet and finish light bitter. Lively carbonation.

Oskar Blues G'Knight Imperial Red IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA - Red;Oskar Blues Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);355ml can from LCBO.Pours an opaque red ale with two fingers of off white head. Layered lacing clinging to the side of glass. Delicious sweet fruity aroma with a whiff of grapefruit bitterness. Taste matches the aroma. Sweet honey and toffee notes. Little bit of pumpkin??

Oskar Blues G'Knight Imperial Red IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA - Red;Oskar Blues Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);"Not much aroma, but there is booze and dark fruit sugar upon close sniff. Smooth, caramel, candied, dark fruit, resinous boozy bitterness in the flavor. Finishes astringent. Nicely balanced; reminds me of Dogfish Head's legendary 90 Minute. Very good DIPA and certainly one of Oskar Blues' best beers. Easily the best stuff I've had from them along with their legendary Dale's Pale Ale."

You get a copper body, clear, ordinary carbonation, white foam. In my point of view, it is a generous IPA, delicious. You smell at the nose, a side of fresh pine tree and malt and I waa thinking of a typical resinous IPA, when you drink it, you a discreet side of pine tree, this IPA is well balanced, malty, smooth, pine tree and round, perfect bitterness and a beautiful harmony in the mouth.

Crooked River Light;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Far from impressive. This has a tangy and sour feel but is watery more than anything. Not worth it.
Crooked River Light;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);A beer that lacks character and is rather plain.In other words, nothing special stood out about this beer.It formed virtually no head and there were fine-sized bubbles observed.The body had some lively carbonation to it and it was just a bit cloudy.The hue was pale yellow and there was no lacing.The nose was malty and the flavor was slightly hoppy.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, watery and light bodied.
Crooked River Light;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);This brew poured a small head of quickly disappearing medium sized white bubbles that left very little lacing and a transparent softly carbonated orange colored body behind. Its aroma is a plesant malty one and its mouthfeel is quite bubbly. The flavor is a tad off and thin though. Otherwise, I was starting to like this one. That is until I tasted it.
Crooked River Light;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Relies on its light diacetyl for most of its flavor. Really not that bad for a lite beer. Not really unlike their basic lager.
Crooked River Light;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Nice light beer with good flavor. A tad fizzy and aggressive in the mouth but a nice clean and refreshing beer. Somewhat watery but what do you expect from a light beer?
Crooked River Light;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);This light beer is all malt and very clean. Body is light but not as light as the macros. This one is more in the category of Amstel Light in terms of body and flavor but it''s much better than Amstel. I find it clean, refreshing and very enjoyable. A good trade-up for macro and import light beer drinkers. Is this going to lure craft beer drinkers into drinking light beer? No, but it isn''t intended to. After all, what self-respecting craft beer drinker is going to buy light beer on a regular basis? This is a great beer for craft drinkers to keep in the fridge for their non-beer geek friends.
Crooked River Light;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);"light straw color. Palate was fizzy and ""mushy"". A very small step above most macros. This was very disappointing, knowing how much better this brewer can do."
Crooked River Light;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);"Almost approaching Coors light in the ""taste"" category, but not quite that bad. A weak attempt."

Stone Levitation Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Stone Brewing;From Jul 2007 Purchased as part of a mixed 6pack at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins. This pours from 12oz bottle a nice clear deep amber with a large head of foam that recedes slowly leaving a few small islands near the center and it has some lacing. The smell is hoppy. I get a lot of grapefruit but I also get some caramel malt. The taste on first sip is kind of strange. The initial flavour is rather empty of flavour, kind of watery but then, thankfully, the grapefruit hoppy goodness moves in near and through the finish though it's at a subdued level. Hey, this is only 4.4%abv so I expected some kind of reduction in what was going to hit my taste buds and it sure makes this Ale a good for sessioning candidate *if* the flavour that's there is enough to please. Imho, it passes that test. I'd buy it again.

Stone Levitation Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Stone Brewing;Punaisenruskea kirkas olut paksulla, höttöisellä ja pitsiä jättävällä vaahdolla. Kaunis olut. Tuoksu humalaa ja hedelmää. Maku hieman greippinen, mutta varsinkin jälkimaultaan enemmänkin greippisen katkera. Ulkonäkö tässä oluessa toimii ja maitokauppavahvuiseksi tietysti hieno tekele, mutta omaan makuuni turhan greippinen.

It was clearly at the Weltenburger booth labeled as an Octkoberfest beer and first time in Japan. I hope/assume its the same beer. GOlden amber color with a fair amount of malty sweetness, but really lacked much depth or character with a touch of buscuitiness. Mediocre at best.

Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;I am admittedly biased , having hailed from the Black Country. However this beer, as many on here know is something of a phenomenon. I have read many negative reviews regarding the bottled Bathams...and I couldn’t agree more! The bottles are in no way a proper representation of a well kept, well poured pint of the real stuff. On a good day it is a perfectly smooth, delicately hopped brew with a refreshingly sweet and malty finish. It is by far one of the areas best kept secrets and it is both a blessing and a curse that often the only stuff that reaches the outside world is the bottled version which is, in that particular format, a very average beer.
Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;This beer is my personal favourite. The comments regarding quality depending on location are correct. Bull and Bladder is the best place to drink it. The furthest I have found it on draft was Shrewsbury. The Great Weston in Wolverhampton serves a very good pint and worth a visit if you don’t know the place. Oh and the Unicorn in Wollaston.. I could go on. Basically anywhere that serves Bathams is worth a visit!
Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;This is a hell of a bitter. It is best drunk on draught. In a bottle it is unremarkable. But at the Bull and Bladder it is fantasit. Smooth, creamy, I sank 5 pints in an hour. Beutiful pint.
Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;Only drink on draught. It is a just such a wonderfully smooth beer. An afternoon drinking this in the Bull and Bladder is heaven.
Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;Batham's is a beer that tastes best when drunk as close to the brewery as possible. Beers from the bull and bladder are fantastic, and the exchange in Wollaston is possibly the best place to get it. Unfortunately the bottles are not representative of how it tastes draught and are best avoided, being too gassy and bland.
Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;Very easy drinking session beer. Amber colour with a hint of caramel Lovely smooth ale its my personal favorite I am very lucky that my local The Nags Head in Malvern has this as a permanent choice on tap.
Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;I was wrong the first time I had this - I didn't think that much of it. It's pretty much a perfect bitter.
Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;Many thanks to Erzengel for sharing! A clear golden beer with a mid-sized most good lasting off-white head. Aroma of mild grainy malt, soft sweet malt with hints of straw.

Bathams Best Bitter;Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bathams Brewery;Many thanks to Minutemat for this bottle. Smooth grainy nose. The beer starts grainy round, full bodied, grainy. Round and smooth, mild and moderate bitter. Great.

Golden Valley Geist Bock;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Golden Valley Brewery;On tap at golden Valley brewing. Pours out golden topped with a white head.

Golden Valley Geist Bock;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Golden Valley Brewery;Super hazy peachy orange colored beer with a good white head.

Not much of a finish to it.
Golden Valley Geist Bock;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Golden Valley Brewery;355ml bottle pours dark amber in color with a finger of off-white head that leaves a little lacing. Aroma is bready malts and caramel with mild hops. Taste is big malty sweetness with a little hop bitterness in the finish. Lacking a little in the balance of flavors, but still a drinkable brew, just not as good as it could be.
Golden Valley Geist Bock;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Golden Valley Brewery;Bottle: &nbsp Amberish, slight haze, a little fiery and dark, thin sudsy off-white head, dies quickly, sparce lacing. &nbsp Sweet mealy nose, slight breadiness, a bit of unripened melon. &nbsp Really mealy on the tongue. &nbsp Some biscuit and breadiness, pale fruitiness. &nbsp Seems a little heavy in its sweetness, but not really in body. &nbsp As it warms I get some alcohol coming out. &nbsp Somewhat sticky. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate, albeit its a bit sugary and clingy. &nbsp Its okay, but seems a little unrefined. &nbsp Not all that smooth, and certainly wouldnt reach for another after finishing this 22oz. &nbsp A little too sweet in my opinion.

Golden Valley Geist Bock;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Golden Valley Brewery;"From a 12 oz. bottle--a distinctive burnt sienna/copper colored lager with an outstanding malt taste and pleasing hop undertones. Though it is debatable whether this bock is a ""true lager"" as noted by the brewery, the hint of apple in this beer is far from overbearing. This bock finishes quite smooth though a little dull."
Golden Valley Geist Bock;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Golden Valley Brewery;12oz bottle. Poured a medium and hazy golden color with a small sized head. Aromas of grains, some caramel, toasted malts, and lightly nutty. Tastes of caramel, honey sweetness, bready, and citrus.
Golden Valley Geist Bock;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Golden Valley Brewery;Bottle Malty aroma with citrus tones. Poured pale brown with white head. Malty flavour, with an unpleasant big swath of molasses in the middle of it. Bready finish, with more molasses. I admit I’m not familiar with the Heiliges Geist bock style, but I would not seek this out. It could be I just don’t like the style.
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Aroma was like walking into a musty old bar. You can smell the fermantation. Beer held to light has a dark red tint to it. Decent head to the beer. Sweet malts gave it a licorice gave it a licorice flavor. Hops came though to. At the end I thought this beer was simular to a port wine.
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Bottle poured a nice dark brown with a good lasting head.

Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Dark Rust. Tame, barely existant aroma with mild fruit, heavy malt and subtle German hops. Fruity, mainly plums, but also a variety of German malt notes (chocolate, coffee, roased malts, bread). Noble hops. An odd range of flavors that worked, but isn’t really intune with the best of the style.
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;bottle-pours a crimson amber hue with a nice off-white head. big malts, spice, german hops and sage on the aroma. slightly smokey? Nice big vienna style flavors here. I would have thought this was a lager. nice malts and a noble hop backbone. slightly fizzy body, but nothing really that detracting. Very good brew!!!
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;A little dark for the style but was a hell of a lot better than last years version. Rio Salado appears to be back on track after a couple of years of declining quality due to the origional brewer making the beer again. I even bought a 6 pack to go.
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Appearance: lovely ruby red color, with a fine, fluffy, creamy head that fast fizzles down. Aroma: sweet and fruity, but largely clean and dry. Taste is clear and smooth, with a medium body, and great balance. Delicious hoppiness right up at first, followed by solid malt. All in all, this was a decent and quite drinkable ale!
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;A really nice brown ale (though it's labeled altbier)! I was annoyed that I couldn't get much of a head out of it. It's sort of like a light Porter with lots of malt and medium roastiness. Not overpowering with nuttiness or anything to differentiate it from a full-bodied English Brown Ale. Fairly sweet, too, but don't look here for hops.
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Deep dark roasted coffee color. Sweet malty aroma, a little nutty. The initial taste is sweet a little watery. Soft in the flavor, medium bodied. Has many different aspects to it. Brown, regular ale. Of a porter, stout even a dunkel. An interesting beer that requires more tastings.
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Pours a dark brown, with some deep red notes when held up to the light. A thin brown head with roasted aromas in the nose. Lightly fruity but predominantly roasted in character, like a roast porter actually. Taste is not quite so roasty as the aroma, but it is definitely there and a bit out of place in something called an Alt. This beer is lightly hoppy and finishes with some bitterness. If you take a step back from this beer and view it as something other than an Alt bier then it has some merit to it. Quite a tasty brown ale with interesting roasted notes. This is not what I expected from an Alt, it pushes the boundaries a bit much, but it is tasty. The roasted notes and the deep brown color are not really typical. It seems as though the recipe has been change recently. Still a good beer though, no longer the Alt that I remember and was hoping for.
Rio Salado Autumn Deluge Alt Bier Amber Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Big head from bottle pour. Awesome dark amber color. Nice sweet aroma to it. Nice balace of flavor to it, I even found a little sweet grape bubble gum taste to it when it finished.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;Draft sample @ Back Road festival. Hazy golden with a small white head. Sweet banana orange, clove, and bready wheat malt flavor. Orange wheat malt, clove, and grassy herbal hops flavor. Medium body, soft carbonation.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;Draft. Banana, orange, clove and wheat malt aroma. Hazy golden yellow with moderate head. Sweet orange/banana, wheat malt, and moderately bitter hay flavor. Very good - very hoppy for a hefeweizen.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;Light amber pour with no head at all. Aroma is heavy in citrus and malts. Medium body. The bitter flavor brings this beer down. Light on hops but a bitter palate.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;Orange pour. No head. Aroma of citrus. Flavor is bland with a weird bitterness. Dry finish.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;12 oz bottle. nothing too surprising. banana, orange body. i agree that flooding this beer with hops could be a nice addition.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;The appearance was a small sized white head with fine-small bubbles that completely dissipated during my rating. The body was uncarbonated, clear with a orange hue. The nose was malty, fruity, some spice with banana notes and the flavor was fruity and spicy. The mouthfeel was smooth and fruity. The lacing was very sparse.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized white colored mostly diminishing bubbles that left behind a softly carbonated yellow orange colored body. The aroma was a mild malt hop one and the mouthfeel was smooth with a lingering fruity finish. The flavor was a mild malt hop one with a balance of fruit.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;"Woo Doggy; I’m the 7th rater of the Back Road Weiss, thanks to the BigBadBear63 for the hook up! I should have gone with the straight pour into my Erdinger wizen glass for the frothy head effect. The body is a pale orange / bronzy color, little head due to my crappy pouring job. The aroma and flavor are very much in conjunction, BIG orange and tangerine peals, and coriander, absolute notes of banana, as well as a yeasty soft doughy sensation. If the palate were more abundant, maybe creamier or oilier it would certainly be getting higher marks. Thanks for the brew Mike; I enjoyed it!"
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;Clear yellow gold with no head (I could only get big bubbles even with a hard pour). Spicey banana yeast nose. Thin body with initial apricot,apple and banana fruit flavors. Lemon and spice try to come to the fore but fall short. Back Road has some much better beers.
Back Road Weiss;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;Orange smell, orange color and no head. Very thin even at the pour, hints of what could have been spice but not enough to make a differance.
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;Bottle from Tim. This was poured into a mug. The appearance was a soft pale yellow transparent color with a quickly dissipating foamy to fizzy head. No lace. The aroma had some sweet lemon pulp, light wheat, some white pepper, sweet grassiness, light citrus glossing and then a touch of coriander and light orange peel. The flavor had a crisp sweetness about it coming from the prior mentioned aromas. White pepper hit slightly and dissipated to allow a light tart nip right before the aftertaste which was somewhat citrusy and had the coriander. Finish was quick and had the orange peel with the white pepper. The palate was between light and medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine. Overall, decent little Americanized witbier that I wouldnt mind having again, maybe not one to seek out, but it does the trick in the warmer weather.
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;12oz, no date. Opened with only the faintest hiss. Clear golden orange with a 1/2 finger white head, quickly fading to a thin ring. Lots of orange in the aroma. Spicy coriander and light lemon are in the background with some sweet pale malts. Flavor is a little bit papery and adds some sour lemon pulp tang, stronger yeasty elements, and soft wheat. Minimal bitterness in the crisp wheaty finish. Low carbonation with a heavier body that what I usually get for the style--maybe the carbonation kept it from being lightened much. I also picked this up from Pat’s Liquors.
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;Orange, coriander, yeasty spiciness, some wheat grassiness, but all undercut by a faint, but persistent, off-tasting sour tartness that always makes me think of bottling-line problems...
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;"Nice looking pour, a hazy pale straw body with a tall fizzy white head. It’s got an aroma of tart wheat, oranges, and bitter lemon grass. According to the commercial description, it has a ""delicious taste described as citrus/celery like."" Thankfully, I perceived no unwanted (from a Wit’s style viewpoint) vegetables in the flavor. Wheat, a tart citric taste (orange with a squirt of lemon), and some coriander was what I encountered. Actually, not too bad. Pat’s Liquors, Porter, IN"
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;Bottle from BBB63. Hazy yellow beer with a substantial foamy white head. The aroma has tangerine, apricot and some yeast in it. Fruity orange and apricot flavors with subtle corriander spice and a tangy yeastiness. Spices and pepper take over in the finish. It is hot on the tongue with an almost distracting carbonation. I can hear the bubbles breaking in the glass.
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;Pours bright and yellow. Nice wheaty aroma. Mellow banana flavor with the corriander and orange nicely showcased. Great refreshing body. All flavors mellow and balanced. I would like to see this brew kicked up a notch. Nice refreshing taste, just not as bold as it could be.
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;Bottle. Strong banana and clove aroma. Cloudy amber color with no head. Slightly sweet banana/clove malt flavor - no carbonation. Very nice aroma and good taste but flatness may turn some off this beer.
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;"2006 bottle from BBB63, drunk on 8/20/06. Low-to-moderate haziness in this more traditionally colored copper colored beer with deep peachy-gold tints. White head shows very poor retention, and little/no lacing. Large bubbles rise listlessly in the liquid.... Wheat and spices collide in the nose, with moderate acidity being drawn from the yeast and perhaps the coriander. Strong, nutty wheat notes downplay the moderate phenolic character (white and black pepper, some clove-like notes), while the soft pils-malt seems ample, though certainly not assertive. I do get a good deal of fruitiness, mainly citric (lemons and oranges) with some softer fruits produced from the yeast. Aroma is medium strength, no alcohol apparent. Wet, somewhat slick texture immediately highlights the low carbonation. And what is there, is rather fizzy and large/loose-bubbled. Some wateriness on the end as well, but other than carbonation issues, a very simple, but well-done wit. Honey/dough from the pils malt, with light coriander bitterness, some touches of spicy phenols and an almost biscuity note through the middle. High attenuation, varied fruitiness; citric and mellower fruits. Moderate acidity helps keep interest. No alcohol/flaws, but a tighter carbonation would provide much more expressiveness for the flavors."
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;"Dirty gold haze. Dusty white head. Some foot was in first aroma. Some spicy orange follows. Not too bad, but typical aroma. ""Do I have to drink it?"" I asked BBB63. Its kind of odd tasting… like sour orange with some wheat. Its okay but not my thing."
Back Road Belgian-Style Witbier;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Back Road Brewery;Pale blond grapefruit color with bubble cloisters adhering to the sides of the glass, rising to the top and popping at the surface to form a tiny head. Lemons shaved and smashed on honey dough introduce the aroma, with spiced nodes of cardamom and referencing cola traits, and coriander, to foot the rest of the bill. Sweet honey and biscuit flavor characteristics are congealed with a searing lemon and coriander twangs. Wishy washy skew of a French bakery with exploding spice canisters. Wholesome kneaded dough with bitter orange peel makes a final attempt to keep this one in purgatory and halt the decent into hell. Lighter-bodied, semi-effervescent and keeling to broaching acidity. Green cardamom reverberations hug like fresh ginger cola in the finish. Thanks for the Indiana treat, BBB63!

Salopian Golden Thread;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salopian Brewery;Cask. A very rich and smooth golden ale. There was plenty of malt and this was balanced by good bitter hops. It’s not one to session because of the richness, but a good place to start the evening

Straw, hey and spruce and garden dew on aroma. Taste is hey, straw, herbs, mint tea like texture and oranges. An odd but well made and definitely underhopped golden ale.

Salopian Golden Thread;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salopian Brewery;It seems like buses, good beers for the Friday after work session come along in two’s. Having recently enjoyed Naylors 5% Snowstorm, this one kept me and Mai in the Tilley Stone Friday gone. Bright gold, white head grapefruit aroma, lovely tropical and grapefruit flavours, Pleasing floral hops. Lovely bitter-sweet balance, and a kind of perfect storm of the best elements of a blond, a quality pilsner, and a golden Belgian ale. Of the four hand pulls on in the pub, I would say a good 70% of quaffers were enjoying this. Salopian yet to put a foot wrong for me.

Alexander Keiths Celebration Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);473ml can. Had this one ages ago back in my dorm days. I don’t really remember it all that well, but I do recall only buying one. Mind you, if it had been horrible that would probably stand out, so there we are. Overall, it was unhorrible.
Alexander Keiths Celebration Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Je ne l’ai bu qu’une fois à Ottawa, elle est meilleur que la plus connu. Arome légèrement riche, saveur de caramel et de malt un peu roti et un peu amère.

Alexander Keiths Celebration Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Can... Surprisingly unhorrible. I really don’t know what to celebrate with a 5% ABV ale, but not at all bad. Pretty darn malty without being too sweet. I wouldn’t buy it again, but I’m glad I did this once. Found the can at a corner market while in Montreal. I didn’t know I could even get this stuff in Quebec.
Alexander Keiths Celebration Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);I have to go against the group here. I was really surprised how much I liked this ale. Beautiful copper colour and thick creamy head. Flavourful at the first impression, nice feel in the mouth and a good finish. Awfully good and amazingly better than the (OK) Keith’s regular product.
Alexander Keiths Celebration Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Somewhat thick, off white head. Darker golden colour body. Smells of ale yeast, malt and some kind of metalish scent. The can that I had this beer out of was probably guilty of this. Some sugary corn notes too. The flavour of this was much better than the smell. Slightly watery with hints of maple sugar and more malt. The palate was a little bitter to start and watery to finish. The malts saved it!
Alexander Keiths Celebration Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Amber in colour. Slight aroma of malts and tin. Flavour was really light, with a watery sweetness. Not to bad coming from this brewery.

Alexander Keiths Celebration Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);This one has a little more hop in the mouth and in the nose. Not a great beer, but the best from this producer.
Alexander Keiths Celebration Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Not much of a head, but not all that bad. Not that good, either, however. Easy drinking, with a good hop nose and taste, but its a bit light on the finish. Not enough oomph. Had at the brewery, on the tour.

Paulaner Brauhaus Munich Dark (Singapore);Singapore, Singapore;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Draught pint at the Mad Poet, Singapore on 19/03/15. Staff really didn’t know what they were selling - calling it ’dark lager’ - should have taken that as an omen. Appearance was fine. Aroma of liquorice and malt. Taste of caramel, chocolate malt. Fizzy, sweet and watery at the same time. Pretty poor.
Paulaner Brauhaus Munich Dark (Singapore);Singapore, Singapore;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Not really a Munchener or a dunkel. Wimpy nose, a bit caramel sugary, nothing much resembling a hop around the place. Disappointing but harmless.
