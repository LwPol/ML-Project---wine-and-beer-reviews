Modest final body with pleasant alcoholic content."
Kisoji Alt;Kiso-gun, Nagano-ken, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kisoji Barley House;Can. Pours a deep brown. Berry fruit on the nose. Plenty of fruit in the mouth as well. Quite a rich palate, some hints of wood. Quite suppable.
Kisoji Alt;Kiso-gun, Nagano-ken, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kisoji Barley House;Draught at the brewery. Shiny, glowing red-amber with a rock head. Bubbly. Faint aroma of cherry and minerals. Rich caramel flavor—sweet, with a bit of chocolate and a bitter finish. Caramel is a bit funky. Earthy, wit minerals and butter. Falls behind their other beers.
Kisoji Alt;Kiso-gun, Nagano-ken, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kisoji Barley House;Medium light beige shiny creamy head. Amber body. Metallic wooden caramel aroma. Taste is sweetish roasty caramel with floral notes. Dryish caramel aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit boring. (0.35l on draft.)
Azumino Pilsener;Azumino, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Azumino Brewery;Golden color with an outstanding lovely nose. I just love beer with raw sewage, cornstarch and unknown chemicals. Like a science experiment and who doesn’t like experiments? Light body and now I can taste these mysterious lovely adjuncts I smelt in the nose. AWESOME. Too bad the finish is tasteless, I was hoping for so much more.
Azumino Pilsener;Azumino, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Azumino Brewery;"My Bottom Line: Herbal hops and complacent cereals achieve balance in this simple and effective Pilsener which might lack crispness. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the clear golden. -A light whiff of diacetyl vanishes soon enough. -The herbal, spicy hop bitterness is subdued, but logically follows the flavor profile. -The prickly carbonation enlivens the svelte body. Bottle; best before July 10th (had on June 24th)."
Azumino Pilsener;Azumino, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Azumino Brewery;Medium shiny offwhite coarse head. Deep yellow body with carbonation. Vague, mealy apple aroma.

Aroma of sweet flowers and light malt. Flavor of crackery malt (very malty) and a bitter hops finish. Decent malty beer.

Willimantic Party Gyle Pale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Willimantic Brewing Company;A pale wheaty haze and a film of foam that looks like a cartographer had something to do with it. Very little aroma here bar some dusty cereals. Sweet with hints of deep fruit. Quite Belgian or BDG flavours. It has a nice spicy sweet finish. Quite still but with a good oily texture and nice residue. Sweet. Laid back and low down?
Willimantic Party Gyle Pale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Willimantic Brewing Company;A hazy golden ale with a thin creamy white head. A light sweet aroma with faint hops and honey. In mouth, a light yet pleasaing fruity ale with light notes of ginger. Rather light but interesting. On tap at brewpub, Inbièrenationale IV, May 2007.
Willimantic Party Gyle Pale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Definitely it’s own beast. Aroma not terribly strong, floral hops, a malt base most reminiscent of caramel malt, but somewhat more roasted. Flavor opens up more, bittering hops, charred/tar-like malt, bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, honey. Got a bit tiring by glass’s end with its weird second-running character exhibiting more and more of that tar aspect. Still, very interesting, and not half bad.
Willimantic Party Gyle Pale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Soft off-white head that leaves nice lacing, atop lightly hazed light amber body.

1809 Berliner Style Weisse;Friesing, Bavaria, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Professor Fritz Briem;Bottle in Seattle. Always a treat, and this bottle is a little over a year old. Clear pale yellow, very small head. Nose of chewy, sweet wheat and some lactic tartness. Exceptionally clean, delicious, lightly tart acidity on the first sip. Some creamy wheat character develops and rounds the body. Some lactic/diacetyl character persists but well in balance. Lovely balanced tartness at finish, and lingers as dry acidity. A very nice example of style, and delicate.

Ølgod Den Gode Hvede;Ølgod, Denmark;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ølgod Bryghus;Bottle. A slightly hazy, orange beer with a minimal-sized white head. Slightly sourish and chalky on the nose, with a sourish fruityness dominating. The aroma is also a bit too sourish, infected-style, with sourish fruits, a chalky touch and some hops to give bitterness. Medium body, quite low on carbonation, and with a lemony finish. Even though it’s a bit off, it’s sure drinkable, but I see no reason to buy it again. 090720

Sun Valley Belge Blanche;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;On tap at the brewery. This was the worst of the flight, ultra bland, watery. Not much taste or aroma, no body to speak of. Slice of orange added nothing to it either. Looking at the ratings, not sure if this batch was bad, but it was truly bad.
Sun Valley Belge Blanche;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;On tap at brewpub. Pours out a hazy light yellow topped with a nice tiny white head. Pretty good aroma of yeast. Not to bad.
Sun Valley Belge Blanche;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Tap (Belgian Wheat): Pours a hazy golden color, a little white head. The nose is bright with raw dough and light yeast, some citrus notes (maybe from the orange that was thrust unto my beverage) and some vanilla lotionish thing. The flavor is plenty balanced, nice light acidity. Overall and clean yeast example with not quite enough carbonation as desired. I liked this a lot better than the IIPA.
Sun Valley Belge Blanche;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;On Tap at the brewpub.

Sun Valley Imperial IPA;Hailey, Idaho, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sun Valley Brewing;On tap at brewpub. Pours out a nice amber color topped with a small head. Very little hop aroma on this one. But is followed up with a GREAT big Hop dissapointment. They call this a 2IPA. I think there normal IPA is much better.
Sun Valley Imperial IPA;Hailey, Idaho, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sun Valley Brewing;Tap: Poured an amber color with very little lacing. The nose is citrusy and musky with a bit of charcoal and a light malt note, some chemical, but very light, almost as if it weren’t even there. The nose otherwise though is a bit light for an Imperial IPA. The flavor isn’t even that malty either. It is stronger in gravity for sure, but it’s just lacking in intensity. Finishes clean and drinkable, but I want my double IPAs to be a bit more brash. I like em tough.
Sun Valley Imperial IPA;Hailey, Idaho, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sun Valley Brewing;"On Tap at the brewpub Medium clear golden amber witha coarse light tan head and spotty lacing. Average moderatly hoppy flavor fairly balanced I suppose but mediocre in all respects. Certainly not very ""Double"". Their regular IPA was tastier and much more hoppy."
Sun Valley Imperial IPA;Hailey, Idaho, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Sun Valley Brewing;Tap at brewpub: Clear gold with white head. It has a stuffy hop aroma that seems to be waiting to burst forth with exuberant delight, but is being held back. So that’s a bummer. You can also pick up on some grass clippings. I expected it to pack way more of a punch being an 2IPA, but it doesn’t. Needs a little work and it could be a good brew.

Trail Creek Bière de Garde;Twin Falls, Idaho, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Trail Creek Brewing Co.;Bomber from Brewforia. Pours very hazy orange with a strange layer of white bubbles. Aroma is rather yeasty. Medium body with very light carbonation. Flavor is sweetish citrus/toffee. Underlying funk? Hard to tell. Maybe this is diacetyl. Or maybe the honey is confusing me. It is certainly unlike any Biere de Garde I can recall. It takes some getting used to. Finishes toffee to me.
Trail Creek Bière de Garde;Twin Falls, Idaho, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Trail Creek Brewing Co.;This 22 oz bottle came from Paul’s Grocery in McCall, Idaho. It poured a hazy golden color with a really nice looking fat white head and good lacing. Nose of grainy malts and some unidentifiable spices and floral hops. Medium mouthfeel. Complex flavors with malts, yeasts, and an earthy touch. Dry finish with a touch of bitterness. Nice easy drinking beer with lots of character.
Trail Creek Bière de Garde;Twin Falls, Idaho, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Trail Creek Brewing Co.;Bomber courtesy of Jake65 - thanks!

Trail Creek Bière de Garde;Twin Falls, Idaho, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Trail Creek Brewing Co.;Bottle: Hazy yellow pour with a large off-white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is a bit obstrusive with some metallic notes and a funky malty feel. Some bits of floral and earthiness as well. Taste is more floral than malt... Just a little lingering earthy feel. Not quite right.
Trail Creek Bière de Garde;Twin Falls, Idaho, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Trail Creek Brewing Co.;Sampled 10/22/08. This Biere de Garde pours a medium yellow gold color from a 22oz bottle. Medium to large sized long lasting white foamy head, with good retention. The aroma is fruity and sweet, banana and yeast, with some honey. A medium bodied Biere de Garde. The malts are fruity and very sweet, lots of banana flavors. The hops are earthy and a touch floral. Lively carbonation. It’s a touch too sweet and seems to be missing some of the spiciness of a Biere de Garde. There are some interesting honey flavors going on here. Drinkable but a little too sweet for my tastes. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet.
Trail Creek Bière de Garde;Twin Falls, Idaho, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Trail Creek Brewing Co.;2008 Bottle - Pours pale yellow with a huge white head...aroma is grains, yeast, banana and spice, heavy malt...flavour follows, decent balance, coats the mouth but is short lasting...pretty nice
Trail Creek Bière de Garde;Twin Falls, Idaho, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Trail Creek Brewing Co.;NABA 08’: Pours a copper color with a white head. The nose is strong with esters and belgian yeast, quite a bit banana with some candi sugar, special b and lots of medicinal notes.

Therezópolis Gold;Teresópolis (RJ), Brazil;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervejaria St. Gallen;Melhor que a Witbier da cervejaria Theresópolis, mas ainda é bastante comum. Comprei na promoção e achei o preço justo, mas normalmente é muito cara para o que realmente entrega

Therezópolis Gold;Teresópolis (RJ), Brazil;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervejaria St. Gallen;600ml bottle. Clear pale yellow with white head. Aroma is sweet malts and some slight almost acidic bitterness. Taste is similar with the same light acidic bitterness and light sweet maltiness. Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation and fairly non-district aftertaste.
Therezópolis Gold;Teresópolis (RJ), Brazil;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cervejaria St. Gallen;A Therezópolis Gold é uma Premium Lager muito boa. Esta é uma cerveja refrescante e de fácil apreciação. A receita é de origem dinamarquesa e faz valer o título de Premium pois é perceptível a concentração superior de malte, mas bem equilibrado com o médio amargor.

Zuma Barrel and Vine;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Zuma Brewery;On cask at the 1/27/07 Atlanta Cask Ale Tasting: Clear golden bronze with thin frothy white head. Oaky, earthy noble hop aroma has some vanilla and diacetyl. Body starts lightly sweet and malty with a good, oaky balance toward a crisp, clean finish. A nicely-balanced and unique brew.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;I see a few other ratings mention the sour aspect, but not many, so I’m not sure if this is intentional or not, but there is a dominant sour note reminiscent of Belgian yeast. Dark brown with brown head. Malty and smokey flavour, with a sour barrel aged woody taste.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;Quite enjoyed this. Pours black with tan head. Smells faintly like smoke and some brett. Smoky flavours with a sour cherry and brett finish. Thin palate, but still really nice.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;Not smoky at all but rather sweet. Drinks alright but not smooth enough and unnecessary aftertaste.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;500ml bottle pours black in color with a small light brown head which leaves a thin ring on the surface but very little lacing. Aroma is quite smoky with some roasted grains and hints of chocolate. Taste is also smoky with a roasted malt bitterness and chocolate malty sweetness and mild hop bitterness that fades to more smoke and a little alcohol burn. A very nicely done smoked porter.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;Good solid beer from one of the better brewers in Japan. Light smoke, this more about the poter underneath. Lots of chocolate an oily flint like body and a coffee espresso lite finish. Well put together.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;A lovely smoked porter. Blackish body with minimal sixteenth of an inch of off-white head. Smokey aroma. Above average mouthfeel of peaty smoke, substantial smoke flavour and very porterish. Balanced, not over the top tasty stuff, malted backbone that makes it emminently drinkable.500 ml. from Presario.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;This... doesn’t smell like smoke... at first. I stuck my nose into my ginormous glass as I poured expecting to smell BBQ aromas but it was mostly tinny can and some decomposing fruits. A bit later on the smoke aroma does come through though, you have to wait for it to warm up to you a little. It looks like an imperial porter(double dark) but with just a bit of head on pour and then it clears up quickly. This does taste fine enough, but if you were blind tasting you wouldn’t put the word Imperial in the description. After sitting a bit it does seem a bit oily and the smoke is really evident in the nose and flavour,it’s not quite overpowering, but the oiliness sure pushes the smoke agenda down your mouth hole. The % lingers on the tongue for just a moment before slipping away beneath the smoky depths. This is going to go very well with my seasonal BBQ’d steak, thank goodness for the chinook winds that allows me to BBQ in winter! (and for chinook hops, I also give much thanks!)
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;The pre-open prediction on this one: this should be one of the worst things I’ve opened all year. Well, I was quite wrong. Pretty much black - came out oily with a small dark brown cap that is creamy leaving spotty lacing. Excellent smoke aroma! Damn. Chocolate beyond the smoke, light fruit, hint of herbal. This is not quite overpowering but it’s close but I dig it. Smoky flavour, a bit sweet with some nice fruit, chocolate, nuts. Smooth feel. A gagging cough produced a hard smoke belch and tears.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;My second smoked style beer. The pour is deep opaque black with a creamy everlasting beige head. Aroma is overly smoky with hints of caramel, nuts, huge roasted malts and alcohol. The taste is sweet, smooth malts with a not so subtle smoke taste on top. Nice alcohol burn (not that 7% is much of an Imperial style ABV) on the finish. Overall, a pretty solid beer.
Ise Kadoya Imperial Smoked Porter;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Porter - Smoked;Ise Kadoya;In short: A chocolaty smoked with a strong fresh mint and perfume flavor. This is fucked up. How: Bottle 500ml. Consumed when probably 6 months to 1 year of age. Sent to me by presario. Thanks a lot Trevor The look: Black body topped by a very small tan head In long: Strange smoky nose. Lots of smoked but also weird scented notes of fresh mint leafs. Taste is smoky, meaty, lots of fresh mint leafs, milk chocolate, soya sauce, perfume. Very sweet. A clash of stuff. I’m not saying that flavors of fresh mint leafs and perfume cannot work in a beer. But that really did not work here. This bottle was an absolute mess. No sign of infection or oxidation at all. So I’m assuming that what I got was a “normal” bottle. Holly crap, this was one of the weirdest thing I ever had. And I’ve had lots of weird shit. The blend of flavors in this beer is gross, that’s Lay’s making potatoes chips with flavors of Sour Cream and Onions!!! Can you imagine that?
Echigo Wit;Nishikanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Echigo Beer Company;Medium white head. Hazy pale yellow body. Acidic mealy citric spicy aroma. Citric mealy sweetish spicy coriander taste. Dryish mild aftertaste. Very, very nice. (0.25l draft.)
Sealux 2005 Scotch 10ème;Bouillon, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie de Bouillon;Bottle @ DeliIrium. Nice head with good duration. Color is brown. Aroma and taste are fruits, malt, nuts, hops and caramel.
Sealux 2005 Scotch 10ème;Bouillon, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie de Bouillon;33cl @ Delirium. No BB date, mored than likely brewed in 2005. Appears that for br. Bouillon beers to be enjoyed you need to drink them at least 3-4 years past expiration. All the beers I ahd from them that night gushed out. Brune claire, ambrée, col fin beige. Arôme est fruité rouge, fin aigreur indiquant un certain age, levure tjrs bien vivante avec un bouquet malt faible. En bouche, étonnamment bien carbonnée malgré l’age, pointe de caramel, malt avec une pointe aigre sans pour cela reflété une infection. Aspect fruits noirs/rouges, se termine sur un malt pâle/caramel sur un choco léger et une touche de biscuité. Houblon est tjrs bien là donnant un fini amer citronné, reste très faible dans son profile scotch. Pas mauvaise, même malgré l’age. Ma note reflète plus un profile qui manque un peu la marque au niveau du style et une carbonation qui malgré les années reste trop présente.
Sealux 2005 Scotch 10ème;Bouillon, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie de Bouillon;Bottle, bought @ Delirium, Brussels. Pours clear orange amber with a big, creamy, off-white head. Nice lacings. Aroma is sweet, malty, some caramel, soft walnuts, a bit of peach and strawberry and softly oxidised. High carbonation, a bit thin mouthfeel with some soft dryness. Flavour is malty, light Belgian sugar with a soft liqourice feel to it. Fairly dry and bitter really. A bit simple, but it held up amazingly.

Etwas trockener Antrunk, herb-malzig mit der Betonung auf die übermäßig trockene Herbe. Im Anschluss lässt sich eine kurze Hopfigkeit ausmachen, dann setzt der ebenfalls trockene Malzton ein.

Sealux 2005 Scotch 10ème;Bouillon, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie de Bouillon;"Bottle, 33 cl. (bought @ Willems) Darkgolden color, with medium white head. Aroma yeast and fruity. Medium body. Taste = a bit complex fro me; little sweet, fruity, spice and bitterness. But this is not a scotch ! Good."
Sealux 2005 Scotch 10ème;Bouillon, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie de Bouillon;Bottle. This beer is misleadingly called scotch, because it has a pinkish blonde color. Grapefruit and flowers in the aroma. Grapefruit, lemon, honey and a hint of toffee in the flavor. Traubenzucker and a hint of leak. Strongly resembling the 2006 Sealux version, but rated as a different beer because of the lower ABV (7% instead of 8%) and minor differences in flavor.

Evan Evans May Fly;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Giddy Bridge (JDW), Soton. Darkish golden. Floral perfumey hops on the nose which weren’t really to my taste - think pot pourri. Light malt and smooth bitterness. Not too bad.

Depot Street Whistlestop Wit;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Depot Street Brewing;"Draft. Lightly hazy, golden pear color, with a small ring of bubbles. Nose is coriander and citrus zest. Taste is the same with some grassy hop and light bready yeast. Near-medium body is smoothly carbonated and well balanced. Just a bit overdone with the additives; slightly overpowering the unique yeast flavors that are necessary to the style."
Depot Street Whistlestop Wit;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Depot Street Brewing;Cloudy yellow with a white foam. Aroma is lemon, citrus, coriander, bitter orange.

Depot Street Whistlestop Wit;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Depot Street Brewing;Draft sample at Knoxville Brew Jam. Poured a cloudy white color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate wheat citrus aroma. Light to medium body. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met.
Depot Street Whistlestop Wit;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Depot Street Brewing;pours a cloudy gold with mild white fluffy head, smooth, sweet wheaty aroma. spritzy mouthfeel, wheat finish that sticks. mild and light.
Depot Street Whistlestop Wit;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Depot Street Brewing;Pours a cloudy light gold, with a medium white head. Smells of musty wheat and lemon citrus. Quite mild and boring aroma. Very atringent flavor, tart wheat and citrus fruits, with a touch of that dishsoap flavor I get sometimes in wheats. Not very good at all. Flawed in most every aspect. Too tart, and not enough wheat and banana flavors. Disappointing.
Depot Street Whistlestop Wit;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Depot Street Brewing;Draught at Main Street Cafe. Pours a cloudy, very light, off-yellow with a creamy, persistent head. The nose is very mild and bready in nature with small hints at fruit. This beer is nicely clean and superbly refreshing on a hot day. The banana presence is very natural and the spiced character is appropriately proportionate. The finish is slightly sour. Now, here’s my biggest beef with this brew: it is incredibly light. Even for this style, it’s watery. Nice thirst quencher, nice with a hamburger, but not very gratifying as a beer experience.
Depot Street Whistlestop Wit;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Depot Street Brewing;Very Pale yellow, almost like the juice in canned pears, and a big white head. Very fruity aroma, maybe blueberry dominating? Flavor is Apricot and blueberry, with notes of cinnamon, coriander and nutmeg. Very tasty and insanely drinkable. Down right refreshing, I’d say. At the 2007 Hickory Hops.
Milestone St. Georges Legend;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Milestone Brewery;Tried at the horse and jockey. Waddington. Copper to amber colour with a foamy head. Very light aroma. A touch of malt and basement. Taste light and rough.
Milestone St. Georges Legend;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask @ Ship & Mitre, Liverpool. Copper with a small creamy head. More of a typical English bitter than a mild. Light malts, small to medium bitterness.
Milestone St. Georges Legend;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Milestone Brewery;Wouln’t describe this as a mild, more like a Scottish Heavy, Taste is of sweet malts and very moreish. Appearance is dark brown
Milestone St. Georges Legend;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask, Last Plantangent, Leicester. Amber with an off white head. Aromas are nutty and earthy with weetabix malts. Leafy and peppery with woody notes. Flavours are dry biscuit malt with a surprising amount of ginger. Nettle leaf prickliness with light apple fruitiness. Dry and slightly herbal to finish. A bit thin but fine.
Milestone St. Georges Legend;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Wellington, Birmingham. Amber with white head. Slightly sweet and fruity mild, easy light drinking with no challenges, but perhaps a little too thin. Pleasant with no carry through.
Milestone St. Georges Legend;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Milestone Brewery;"Cask at the Retreat, Reading. Reddish chestnut with a cream head; aroma of leafy hops and rich malts; good malty body with dry hops to finish. Simple, but very good."
Milestone St. Georges Legend;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask - The Murderers, Norwich. Pours a clear amber colour with a relatively loose, frothy off-white head. Base aromas a of a malty caramel tone with further hints of fruit and a dry hoppy character. Sweet and fruity flavour profile with a dry citrus-like bitterness. More caramel malts give it a foundation. A balance of sweetness with a bitter finishing aftertaste round it off. Body lets it down a bit, but otherwise an acceptable brew.
Milestone St. Georges Legend;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask at the Maltings, York. Amber-red with a one-finger soapy, dense off-white head from the sprinkler. Aroma is oranges, caramel, and a heavy dose of dusty hops as well as a faint bit of unrefined graininess. Taste is predominantly citrus upfront - oranges, lemon, maybe a bit of grapefruit. Light toffee malt backbone. Finish is malty and slightly sweet, with a pleasing moderately bitter aftertaste. Solid, complex in character but simple enough to enjoy. Palate is lackluster, a bit watery.

Selins Grove SNAFU IPA;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Served on-tap at the brewpub. I have been wanting to try this for almost two years now, glad to see it back on finally. A - Pours slightly hazy burnt orange with a nice one finger tall off white head leaving small trails of lace down parts of the glass. S - Smells of dulled tropical fruit, pungent citric hops and quite a bit of sugary sweetness. The sweetness begins to take over, making the other aromas almost disappear entirely. T - Starts off with a nice mix of fresh tropical fruit and sticky citric hop resin quickly giving way to a big dose of candied sugar sweetness, some pine needles and a touch of chewy malt. The sweetness really started to get to me toward the end of the glass. Finish is a mix of light hop bitterness and sticky sweetness, lingering on the palate for quite awhile after consumption. M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Pretty smooth feel with a decent amount of hop bitterness. The sweetness really started to take over the feel, making this one a touch hard to finish. O - Ehh I still like the regular IPA and Ol Frosty more than this. It kind of tastes like the IPA did when they were playing around with the recipe a few years back. Don’t get me wrong, it has some nice things going for it, but those other two are world class IPA’s. Give it a try if you can but the regular IPA is just better.
Selins Grove SNAFU IPA;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub 6/8/08: Pours a transparent copper bronze with a nicely-lacing froth of white head. Nice aroma of fresh resiny piny hops and sweet toasty dark caramel malts. Body starts fairly full and slightly sticky sweet with nice resiny bittering and flavor hops before a floral bittersweet caramel finish. A nice IPA.
Selins Grove SNAFU IPA;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Another gem from JW77. Johnathan you are just too generous my friend. Pours an amber color. Nice white head. Resin and citrus hops. Flavor is full of resin, citrus, spice and good bitterness.

Selins Grove SNAFU IPA;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;On cask at the brewpub. A glowing super-fresh hop juice pours out of the glass. Rich, orange sweet and piney. Nice aroma! Pours darker than average. A rich copper-orange tending sienna. A frothy soap in dark khaki rides the glass all the way down. Prickly cask carbonation. Flavor is just as rich as the aroma. A cask-bodied malt marries with cascade-like hops, very spicy, orange and fresh. Delicious! The cask is a good delivery for this example. A very nice IPA.
Selins Grove SNAFU IPA;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;On Handpull: aroma is big and piney with citrus spice and some biscuity malt. flavor was all hops, but in a very balanced way, this is a like a way better version of a Dogfish Head IPA. medium bodied. excellent ipa
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;316ml bottle. Green clear bottle. Not much aroma of flavors in this one, surprise, surprise. Some light hay and rice. No bitterness, no taste.
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;12oz can in a glass. Pours golden with a white head. Aroma of light malts and toast and water. Flavor the same. Lighter texture. A mediocre pale lager.
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;This one is a little odd. It’s yellow golden and headless in the glass. The aroma is a bit alcoholic with a pretty strong grainy character. This is a bit on the sweet side and medium bodied with prickly carbonation. There is a touch of citrus from the hops but also a slight metallic character. The finish is bitter enough to match the sweetness but all-in-all this just isn’t that great.
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;16.06.13: Bottle 0.66 l. Złote, mocno klarowne piwo o szybko znikającej pianie i świeżym aromacie. W smaku orzeźwiające, lekko kwaskowe z fajną goryczką na finiszu.
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;Buy it in bottles. That is my only advice. Metallic and tasteless in cans. If you can find the large bottles you’ll be rewarded with a German Pilsner style beer. Good with food very refreshing. If this was a can review it would have got 1.8 or so.
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;Can purchased at the 7-11. Pretty boring pour: pale yellow with a small white head that disappears quickly. Odd finish to the aroma that reminds me of vegetables and slightly acidic? Boring flavor. About what I expected though.
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;Bottle, or something. Pours a weak and uninspired yellow. Aroma is sweet and floral corn with bit of weak meal in the background. Flavor is watery corn and vegetal malt. Watery mouthfeel. No more.
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;Draft in Taipei. Yellow, little aroma, little character, industrial. Not much to distinguish it.
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;canned, many thanks to marie and jakub for bringing this back with them. pale yellow, corn syrup aroma, fizzy, no hop character, extremely dull
Tsingtao Beer Draft Pure Life (Taiwan);Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tsing Beer Co.;Well, in Taiwan this is the best beer that I could find. Actually has a decent nose from the lagering. Toured the brewery, people there knew what they were doing. Not a great beer, but in Taiwan I’d drink this over anything other than the Oolong.
Front Street Hannah's Smoked Lager;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Front Street Brewery (NC);Pours a dark translucent brown with a semi white head.

Front Street Hannah's Smoked Lager;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Front Street Brewery (NC);Smells like smoked ham, Like it should. Man, I love the aroma of smoked beers. Smoke melds with mildly sweet flavors throughout - some crisp peppery flavors in the finish, bot mostly smoke and sweet. Very entertaining. Sampled at Hickory Hops 2007.
Newton Court Perry - Medium Sweet (Draught);Leominster, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Newton Court Cider;At the Seven Stars, Bristol March 2012. Pale green and slightly hazy. Plenty of medium pear fruit, a spicy, yeasty edge and gentle finish. Good.
Newton Court Perry - Medium Sweet (Draught);Leominster, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Newton Court Cider;Cask at troon beer fest 07... very very pale yellow ... smokey iodine , again odd iodine in flavour with smokey fruit finish very odd but not unpleasent
Newton Court Perry - Medium Sweet (Draught);Leominster, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Newton Court Cider;From the barrel at Catford Beer Festival, June 2006. Hazy, typical Perry colour. Relatively soft and sweetish. Some light tannin but predominantly mellow and fruity. Quite nice.
Newton Court Perry - Medium Sweet (Draught);Leominster, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Newton Court Cider;Bottled bright from bag in the box at Planet Thanet BF 2007. Pale green gold colour.

Asheville Ninja Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Asheville Brewing Company;Heady mix of roast, bitter chocolate, and unexpected fruitiness, leading to a dry, espresso-laced fade and lingering cherry-chocolate notes. Good beer, better pizza.
Asheville Ninja Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Asheville Brewing Company;Amusing can. Oily pour, nice cascade to the head, light khaki foam. Weird aroma - maybe a little creosotic, sweet with unripe plums. The same impressions come through to the flavor - tarry, sweet, ambiguously fruity. Medium body, loose/mild carbonation. Improves markedly as it warms, in terms of balance and losing some of the off flavors. Harris Teeter, Boone.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Crème Drème Stout;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Mug Club served at a crowded bar on Valentines Day. Nitro pour, with a black/brown color, and a tan, billowy head that remained as long as there was liquid in the glass. Foamy lace followed the level of beer.

Town Hall Hope;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;It is indeed an orange colored beer. Flavor has light cherry. Well carbonated but light overall. The flavor has sweetness that tastes like sugar, but there is some sour cherry as well. There is more flavor from the sweetness than the actual fruit. Sour finish.
Town Hall Hope;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Autumn Orange with White Ring. Malty and Musty Sweet tart Cherry Aroma. Carbonated Light Bodied Brew. Sweet Malt and Tart Cherry Flavor...Cherries Add to the Body of the Beer...Tart and Dry Aftertaste...Wheaty Aftertaste. Overall a Nice Simple Beer to Enjoy in the Summer...Something in the Cherry Flavor Makes it Hard to Palate This as a Session Ale, but Enjoyable Nonetheless.
Town Hall Hope;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"About the beer: this is a light American ale infused with 100% pure cherry juice. ""Hope"" is brewed for a benefit we will host at the Town Hall May 1called Brew for a Cause. This is a benefit with the Peace House Foundation, a MN based nonprofit dedicated to educating and caring for Africa’s AIDS orphans. And my thoughts: Lightly hazed, apricot-ish appearance, under a solid slab of snowy foam, softly settling down. Sour nose at first, cherries chirp up, then the choir grows, and the fruity aroma builds, quite distinctive and pleasing. Taste: Cherry flavor continues this light, sour feel, all on top of a solid pale ale base, well-malance, not hoppy, really, and just enough malt. Sweet, and then sour, and ridiculously drinkable. Only drawback for me is, ...hell, it’s a charity beer, who the hell am I to quibble? It’s supposed to make a large group of people happy and still manage to have to have flavor, something they can’t pull off at a sporting event."
Town Hall Hope;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Light red-orange color with some foamy white head. Sour cherries on the nose. Predominant cherry flavor with a hint of bitterness.
Penn Penndemonium;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a rich golden color with a thin but firm head.

Penn Penndemonium;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;On tap at Molly Malloy’s in Philly on 6/19. Faint malt aroma.

Penn Penndemonium;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Draft at Brew’d Pub. Clear deep golden color. Very malty, this one, and pleasantly sweet without being cloying.
Penn Penndemonium;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;22 ounce bottle. Bright, brassy gold color. Small white head. Earthy, fruity malt nose. Sweet toasted malt flavor with notes of bubblegum citrus hops. Complex flavor has notes of caramel, tropical fruit, vanilla and alcohol. Overall, a nice tasty Maibock.
Penn Penndemonium;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a crystal clear orange-amber color with a thick one finger white head that has good retention. The head fades over time to leave a lighter level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The nose of the beer is sweet and fruity with heavy notes of apricot, peach, and apple as well as a good showing of a sugary caramel smell. Along with these smells comes some other aromas of a bready and doughty smell along with a little bit of a hop aroma of a grassy and floral nature. Taste – The taste begins less sweet then would have been anticipated from the nose, but does contain a decent amount of caramel and a lighter fruitiness of peach and apricot. Along with these flavors is a good showing of a bready flavor. As the taste advances the caramel decreases with the bready fruity flavors getting slightly stronger and being joined by some grainy pale malt flavors. The caramel loses much intensity by the tastes end, but is replaced by a new light apple flavor that develops later in the profile. All the while some quite light hop flavors of a grassy and floral nature develop on the tongue and, with the other flavors, end up leaving a smooth, somewhat grainy, fruit sweetened, bready flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The thicker and chewier body is fantastic for the bigger bready flavors of the brew all while the lower carbonation helps to allow for the lighter hop flavors to be sensed and to nicely complement the fruity and malty tastes of the brew. Overall – A rather tasty Maibock overall. Thick and bready with a good showing of fruit and just enough hop to keep it more balanced and rather enjoyable. Quite tasty.
Penn Penndemonium;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Pretty nice, a long time since I’ve had a decent Maibock. Golden pour. Some sugared malt. Light sweet finish. Nice. Tap at Brew’D.

Lompoc Dagda Irish Red;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Lompoc Brewing;"Bottle. ""Malt beverage aged in whiskey barrels."" Pours slightly hazy dark amber and topped with film and a sparse ring. Aroma shows nuts, fruit, and oak. Terrific flavor. Semi-sweet with caramel, lacto, whiskey, and oak.

Lompoc Dagda Irish Red;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Lompoc Brewing;Bottle: &nbsp Carmel in color, a little dark and reddish, thin frothy off-white head, spotty lacing. &nbsp Soft Whiskey and peat on the nose. &nbsp Very soft maltiness up front, mild sweetness, a little Whiskey and peat. &nbsp A little more malt than your average Irish Ale, which I like, &nbsp Decent body. &nbsp Lingering caramel like malts after the finish. &nbsp Pretty simple overall, but pretty enjoyable, and easily quaffable.
Lompoc Dagda Irish Red;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Lompoc Brewing;Casked at Oaks Bottom, one of the best places in town for New Old Lompoc on tap. A dark red, with a unique smoky quality to it all. A full bodied ale, that is nonetheless quiet quaffable. A little bitter but mellowed by a hearty flavor of roasted barley.
Lompoc Dagda Irish Red;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Lompoc Brewing;On tap at Oaks Bottom Pub. Pours dark mahogany red with a small bubbled beige head. Poured off cask at room temp. The cask made this beer very soft on the palate. The softness and warm temp allowed the malts to gain complexity. Warm toasty caramel notes blend with a light toffee and bready character. Hops were subtle, but enough to balance. Very nice session brew.
Cerveza Artesanal Yeska Rubia;Bariloche, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveza Artesanal Yeska;Me llegó esta semana directo desde la patagonia, y al probarla , me parecio poco interesante, poco sabrosa, algo dulce y poco lupulada.

Aroma: malty, yeasty, aromatic citric-fruitiness. Low hoppy’s smells. Flavor: yeasty and pale malts, mainly. Citric-fruity, similar to grapefruits and lemon. Poor hoppy taste. Yeasty aftertaste. Palate: light body. Excessively carbonated.
Cerveza Artesanal Yeska Rubia;Bariloche, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveza Artesanal Yeska;Bottle conditioned, a very slight haze to the amber colour. Not much of an aroma, just a otuch of hops. Some zesty flavours to an otherwise unremarkable palate. OK, but nothing memorable.
Cerveza Artesanal Yeska Rubia;Bariloche, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveza Artesanal Yeska;in bottle, 330 ml. Amber and golden, they prevail in a set of colors, very turbid. Frothy, too much. (Too many gas attaché). Strong aroma, to flowers, probably something of citrus fruits. The body is light enough. First there comes the candy, fort, with a light bitterness. The malty does not appear. Has an abrupt and tart end.
Otto Tipp Gringa;El Bolson, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otto Tipp Cervecería Patagónica;"Appearance: amber orange color, turbid. Medium head, white color and persistent. Aroma: sweet like sugar of beetroot, candy, vanilla and honey touches. Sweet-fruity like cherry and strawberry in syrup. Not hops smells.

Hunter Draught;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Spicy hop malt aroma. Clear amber colour with good head and lacing. Bitter hop malt flavour with stale after-taste. Fizzy palate.
Hunter Draught;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Bottle (375ml). Poured a pale yellow with a frothy white head which was mostly diminishing. Aroma was of honey, some hay and wet cardboard. Taste was a typical commercial pale larger with wet cardboard and some honey. Body was light with a watery texture and a non existent finish.
Hunter Draught;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Yuck. VB. Nasty. Vile. Foul. This beer belongs in hallowed halls of GTSAFM right next to the Schoff! As soon as I poured this filth the aromas of VB jumped out and punched me in the face and I knew I was in for a treat! Smells kind of like dried corn mixed with a little sweat and vomit. The vomit part I am assuming was from my younger stupid days when I though VB was ok and drank enormous quantities that revisited me shortly thereafter. Very clear beer with a small white head that quickly disappeared and reminded me of soap scum. The flavour was slightly smokey and hangs around for far too long after swallowing (which was hard enough). Dry and watery on the palate with a fizz like soft drink, leaves the mouth feeling defiled and chalky. Avoid like the plague!
Hunter Draught;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);No discernable aroma at all. Poured a cheap and nasty headless stench. Worse than most of the Aust macros. What are Blue Tongue doing with this? Tastes of corn with a nasty sweetness. Dire.
Hunter Draught;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Smells terrible, corny, metallic and generally offensive. Just your typical Australian lager really. On tasting it doesn’t prove to be as sweet as expected, and although there is nothing there to make it worthy of a drain pour. However, I am following the bottle’s advice and drinking it quite cold, because I’m very afraid of what would emerge at warmer temperatures. Actually, I do know because this is the second time I’ve had this beer and the other time I had it warmer (and did indeed drain-pour it)! Frankly this is nothing more than a VB clone aimed at claiming the loyalty of the parochial Hunter folk - I hope it doesn’t succeed and fades off into history.
Hunter Draught;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);not as bad as i expected, cardboard nose, corn flavours, slight bitterness. Very low carbonation so it is definitely aimed at Guzzler territory. What i don’t mind is that it is low on sweetness and uses restrained hopping which means that there is little to dislike. Problem is not a lot to explicitly like either.
Hunter Draught;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Picked up a 6 pack of 375ml at my local Dan Murphys. Soapy corn aroma, skunky like you standard low-end Aussie ’draft’ beer. Pale gold body with some white foam. Thin bodied, corn flavours, slight hop flavour with a metallic dry finish. Unremarkable, dime-a-dozen sort of beer.
Hunter Draught;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);"Bit cheeky of Blue Tongue to nick the ""Hunter"" appellation for this new lager when junior local rival Potters uses it for its range. I guess there’s no trademark on regions of origin, but I can’t see that the confusion does either party any favours. Blue Tongue positions its standard lager as a ""premium"" product, so this must be pitched at a lower price bracket for the local market. Certainly that’s what the cheap and old fashioned label, replete with the Australian flag, seems to indicate. It’s a fairly sorry looking lager, clear gold with a budget-sized scattering of suds. The aroma confirms that we’re in VB/Carlton Draught territory here - cardboardy malt, sweetcorn and sour uric notes. It’s thin and sweet, with strange chalky flavours, before finishing with a familiar POR metallic ring. Grippy carbonation. ""Serve ice cold"", it says on the label, and you’d want to because you wouldn’t want these aromas and flavours to develop any further. No worse than VB or Tooheys New but certainly no better. (330ml bottle from Liquor on Parade, Kingsford.)"

Chișinău Specială Tare;Chișinău, Moldova;Pilsener - Imperial;Efes Vitanta Moldova Brewery;Thin, somewhat harsh, grassy, and not terribly good stuff--doesn't have much of the boozy or any of the malty notes that make the style fun, though as an ISL fan i still obviously find it quaffable and am rating it on that basis. Could be stronger as well (not just for the name!) (16.9 oz bottle, supermarket, Chișinău)

Lidskae Klasichnae;Grodnenskaya obl., Lida, Belarus;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lidskoe Pivo (Olvi);Alk. 5,2% ABV. Zwyczajny eurolager, bardzo słodowy. Na plus - wygląd, barwa przezłocista, piana z lacingiem, ładnie musuje - przecietna wielkość wysycenia. Chmielu i większych wad brak. Ta słodowość zabija dość pijalność, dlatego zaniżam oceny. Białoruś odhaczona.

Heifer;Barcelona, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Damm;I bought this bottle at the alcampo in Sevilla. I drank it yesterday without any surprise and it was the true. Of course. that for the price don't expect a river of gold and the taste is something sad like the buldings of Sao-Paolo. You have almost no taste with three seeds of malt, a small piece of hop and a huge river like the Rhein. The color is yellow and gold, normal carbonation, thin and white foam and it is a cheap and boring nectar.

Green can with lots of golden ears of corn to indicate that I am in for a malty and grainy experience. Can’t hardly wait. Pours clear pale yellow with white head and lively carbonation. Head disappears almost immediately. Aroma of sweet malts, wet cardboard and glue. Strong carbonation and watery palate. Taste is very sweet with almost no bitterness for balance. This is an almost perfect example of a bad discount beer.

Hints of cinnamon atop some wet cardboard and light malt. Light pumpkin flavors with some dry grass and mild, mild spice.

Fox River Pumpkin Spice Ale;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Fox River Brewing Company;On draught and in bottles at the Appleton brewpub location (Fox River Mall), pours a clear light amber brew with an average sized off-white head that quickly dissipates to a thin white ring and very light lacing. Aroma of golden grain malt, a touch of corn, light pumpkin, a hint of mint, and some light spice. Taste is semi-sweet, very little carbonation with flavors of light golden grain malt, pumpkin and a touch of nutmeg. Finish is slightly watery with a hint of spice and mint aftertaste that quickly disappears. The mint was interesting for a pumpkin beer.

Mash House Cherry Blonde;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;"Sampled at the brewpub; bright pink with the aroma of maraconio cherries.

JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);"still a little lighter and more one dimensional than i’d prefer, but the Hallertaus are evident, and i like that at least a little. i may even return to this one."""
JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);"Poured bottle from Trader Joe’s into nucleated pint glass. A beautiful golden color with creamy white foam. Very aromatic: bread, cracked grain, faint caramel. Well-rounded taste. More body and complexity than familiar light lagers. The hops bitterness is sufficient to balance the malt sweetness, and you can smell some noble aroma hops, but I would hardly refer to this as a ""hop fest."" JosephsBrau Hopfest marketing misleads hops-addicted American ale drinkers, but it is nonetheless a decent German-style Pilsener."
JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Slight lager aroma, with a touch of floral hops. Pours a clear amber, with a nice white head. Slightly sweet start, with a bit of a bitter finish. Very light on the palate, and very drinkable. A good value for a summer drinking beer at $6 a six pack.
JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle: The aroma consists of light-moderate honey, light corn, and a touch of grass. It pours a transparent gold with an inch tall white head with okay retention. The flavor starts light-moderate sweet with honey. The finish has light grass and floral hops along with a touch of lemongrass. Light-medium bodied with carbonation that is somewhat fizzy.
JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pours a clear gold body with a thin but lasting white head. Very light flavors - mildly sweet and some earthy hops. Not much to this one but okay.
JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Clear golden pour with barely any head. Aroma of european hops and light buttery malts. Flavor is vapid, boring, very little hop flavor , corn, slight bitterness in the back of the throat. Not crisp enough for a solid pilsner. And the name Hopfest is a misnomer. Very meh.
JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Gold with a thick, fizzy white head. Aroma of slightly sour lagery malt and hops. Flavor is hoppy with an undercurrent of sweetness. Mild bitter hop finish. Meh. Ok.
JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);A grainy corn aroma and a toasted grain flavor. Appearance is a clear yellow color. Would love a little more body but this is a drinkable beer nonetheless.
JosephsBrau Hopfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle. Poured a large, rocky white head that didn’t want to fall away. Nice lacing. Clear, golden body. Light malt aroma with some hay and a fair amount of floral and herbal hops. Taste was about the same with some mild pear and honey flavors. The hops definitely play a prominent role in the flavor profile (without being too dominant/overpowering), which I appreciate. Light body with average/pleasant carbonation. Nice hop finish. Overall a nice German pils for the price, but the malt flavor could have been a bit cleaner for me...something about the pear and honey notes seemed off.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Fire Chief Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Had the 2014 version of this beer. Hazy reddish color.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Fire Chief Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Pint draft at the brewpub (Lombard, IL). Pours a nice dark coppery red, lightly hazed, with a khaki thick moderate head that stays and laces well. Aromas are nice toasted carmel malts, light hoppy bouquet fades in and out, and some cereal graininess. Initial is a littlw lighter on the palate than expected, light carmel and toasty malts mix with light floral hoppy bitterness with a touch of citrus. Malt dominant, but fairly light and a little watery overall. Lacks flavor, lacks life! A mediocre amber.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Fire Chief Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Growler - purchased 03/24/2009. Dark burgundy, with a creamy off white head.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Fire Chief Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On tap at Yorktown RB. Poured a cloudy, light walnut color, very much like Erik the Red, (but not red) which I had earlier. Had an off white head which diminished to a small ring with light lace.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Fire Chief Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Yorktown;"Mug Club Draft. Brewmaster Tim says he made the 2008 edition an ""American Style"" ESB because he had some Fuggles hops available. I think that’s how a lot of brewpub creations are going to be decided on for some time: ""What can we make with the hops on hand?"" Be that as it may, here’s a beer that pours a cloudy reddish-brown with a nice short but stiff head. I suspect Tim’s keeping the color close to the prescribed ""red."" Toffee malt smell punctuated by a dose of English hops and, for no reason that I can figure, a whiff of green chile pepper(?). Taste is pretty rich and hearty, with chewy but not sweet malts, settled by a punchy fresh hop taste (Tim says he also used Nugget, Centennial and Cascade). Rides the border between ESB and a ""red"" ale, but bitterness proves it. Very sessionable, I even enjoyed it in the chilled mug I got."
Rock Bottom Yorktown Fire Chief Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Yorktown;"Before this entry is summarily poo-pooed by the Powers-That-Be and relegated to the status of a duplicate addition of an already present corporate beer - - I had this at the brewpub during the course of a half hour conversation with the head brewer, Timothy Marshall. I asked, ""Is this your recipe?"" Tim replied, ""I’ve heard this before. Let me set the record straight once and for all. NONE (his emphasis) of the Chicago area’s Rock Bottoms use ’corporate recipes.’ They’re all the creation of the individual brewers. If anyone has any questions, have them call me."" Which is what I would recommend whoever verifies the beer should do, and not rely on the word of whatever serving staff person who answers the phone. Rant over... for now. The beer pours a bright copper body with a substantial head that performs some heavy lacing. The aroma is filled with caramel and sweet oranges with a touch of floral/earthy hopping. Medium bodied with a lively mouthfeel, the flavor has the addition of some peppery spiciness. It finishes on a mildly bitter, dry note. Sessionable. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL"

The aroma has the token notes of banana, wheat, tart grassiness. I found this to be not as sweet as some others in the style with more apparent tartness. This is refreshing with a pleasing level of banana and faint spiced notes, though I think it could use a bit more character. It’s a nice drink though, especially in the brutal Hotlanta weather.

Michigan Brewing Nut Brown Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;Good aroma of caramel and light hops. Clear medium amber with a persistent head cover, light splashes of lace. The taste is caramel malt and hazelnut, impacted negatively through a greasy mouth-coating residue that makes it seem quite heavy. Not much going for this brew. Not recommended.
Michigan Brewing Nut Brown Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours ruby red to amber with tan head of foam. The aroma offers up some sweet malts, roasted malts, sweet nuttiness and a dash of chocolate malts. Pretty nice.

Laughing Dog Crotch Sniffing Bastard;Ponderay, Idaho, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Laughing Dog Brewing;19-Dec-09 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 09-Dec-09 for $4.99 at wineandcheeseplace.com) The nose is malty and slightly grassy, but the more prominent aromas of plastic and red apple skins linger. On the palate, caramely malts show a touch of sweetness, while the moderately bitter hops are very grassy and moderately piney. There's a bit of apple skin in the flavor too, especially in the finish. Medium in body, high in carbonation, dry and slightly chalky mouthfeel. Hazy, dark-amber body with a volcanic head that shoots up to over two inches in height before slowly settling to a quarter inch. Patchy lace initially, but it slides down the glass. Overall, this isn't an especially enjoyable beer, and between the plastic and apple skin qualities and the excessive carbonation on the pour, it seems this bottle isn't 100% healthy. A rerate should happen at some point, but I'm now two for two in saying that about Laughing Dog brews.
Laughing Dog Crotch Sniffing Bastard;Ponderay, Idaho, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Laughing Dog Brewing;May be my first beer from Idaho. Definitely first beer from Laughing Dog. Been wanting to try them since I've seen it at Total Wine & More for the past year. They sold me on the label, as this really is not that good of a brew. Balance is off....over-carbonated, aroma smells like wet dog (no pun intended), etc. The appearance and hop finish on the flavor is about all going on here. For that the flavor is barely a 7. Kinda scared to try their others now for what they are charging. Why can't these brewers just bottle them in 6-packs and sell for what it's worth....$6-7 tops. To call this premium, stick a cool label on it, and sell for $5 a bomber is just a crime.
Laughing Dog Crotch Sniffing Bastard;Ponderay, Idaho, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Laughing Dog Brewing;Thanks Frank. This was poured into an English pint glass. The appearance was a ruddy burnt orange almost copper color with a finger’s worth of light foamy white head. Some lace, but sliding and messy. The aroma had some biscuits, toast, sweet grain, butterscotch, caramel/toffee malts, earthy to grassy hops and a touch of dried leaves. The flavor was malty sweet like many ESB’s I have tried. Expected earthy hop to smooth malty crispness in the aftertaste. Finish was crisp and malty. The palate was roughly medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt good as best as a bottled ESB can be. ABV felt as projected. Overall, I’d say this was a pretty good ESB worthy of having again if I could get it. Pass the fish n’ chips, Frank!
Laughing Dog Crotch Sniffing Bastard;Ponderay, Idaho, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Laughing Dog Brewing;22 oz bottle. Poured a copper color with a frothy beige head. Taste of sweet malts, caramel and toffee. A little over carbonated, medium body. Excellent ESB!

Thought the CSB would stand for something similar to ESB. Not quite! Pour is hazy amber, with a thick beige head. Aroma is malty and bready. Taste is malty, bready, cloying, and sour. This is strange for an ESB, or perhaps for any beer. Not good. Didn’t finish it.

Body is lite medium.. but somehow it and the carbonation pulls everything together very well with a lingering full tongue finish."

Bernard S Čistou Hlavou / Free;Humpolec, Czech Republic;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Rodinný pivovar Bernard (Duvel Moortgat);Nice, thick foam, golden, clear. Unpleasant note typical for low-alco beers + something sweet and malty. Taste is empty, low bitterness. The non-alcco note much less present in the taste, which is nice. Still, the beer is rather watery-sweet. Not that bad, bud i've had much better.

Clear, golden amber with a medium large, frothy, almost stable, white head. Sweetish, slightly grassy-spicy aroma of grains and some straw. Just slightly sweet, moderately bitter, gently grassy-spicy taste of grains, some straw and just hints of wort, followed by a short, moderately bitter, pretty dry and slightly grassy-spicy finish.

TableRock Old Fitzgeralds Barley Wine;Boise, Idaho, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;TableRock BrewPub & Grill;This was absolutely fantabulous. Not extremely hop heavy, remains true to the style, a very nicely done American Barleywine. Rich and sweet on the palate without being cloying, brown sugar and honey notes, with some dark caramelized fruits, some candied fruit zest, but all remains in balance with the hops coming through giving some much needed bitterness. This is full bodied, but extremely well balanced and drinkable.
TableRock Old Fitzgeralds Barley Wine;Boise, Idaho, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;TableRock BrewPub & Grill;"3/7/08 on draught at the brewpub. Aroma is malty-sweet with lots of caramel. Appearance is reddish brown with an incredibly well maintained light tan head (particularly for a barley wine). Flavor is rich with dark dried fruit and molasses; alcohol dos not come through, but is evident, which is more than I can say for the hops. Mouthfeel is full bopdied and slightly syrupy, with lots of warmth and a minor carb feel. Overall, a great example that is definitely more English than American in style, but brings out a lot of great portlike characteristics."

Small off-white head and light lacing. The nose is citrus and malt, the taste moves into a more roasted malt with dark fruits, citrus, and caramel. Very smooth, no alcohol feel at all.

Seven Bridges Toasted Almond Brown Ale;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Seven Bridges Grille & Brewery (Craftworks);On cask at the brewpub. Clear brown with a small tan head.

Seven Bridges Toasted Almond Brown Ale;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Seven Bridges Grille & Brewery (Craftworks);Cask, Very sweet malt aroma that definitely smells of what is probably some almond extract, but as I love a malt bomb I liked the aroma. The body is dark brown with a ridiculously lasting creamy tan head. The fore holds toasted malts, almond and other nuts and sweet dark fruit. As this was from a cask the head and lacing were beautiful. Easy to enjoy.
Seven Bridges Toasted Almond Brown Ale;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Seven Bridges Grille & Brewery (Craftworks);Pint at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville. Hand pulled from cask. Rather average looking brown ale with a white head that soon fell away. Slight malty aroma. Flavor did not appeal to me at all, especially after having two other excellent beers there. Flavor was astringent malt, lacking in hops and bitterness. Last beer of the night and I didn’t even finish the glass. Subpar and not representative of the brewpubs usual standards. Really poor for an offering on cask.

Badger Hopping Hare (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);On tap at the sloop. This golden ale, is very refreshing, with a slightly bitter yet not to sweet taste. Goes beautifully with a summers day and a hard days thirst. Its taste is hard to distinguish at first, but towards the end of the pint a slight taste of nutmeg and meringue comes through. I’m not a great fan of badger’s beers but this installment isn’t too bad and is something that I could probably drink more often.
Badger Hopping Hare (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);On tap at Tröls. A fine English pale ale, love the english malts that brings citrus, peach, grass and herbs with them balanced with a nice semi-sweet maltiness. Get it and try it.

Bouillon Cuvée du Fondeur;Bouillon, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Bouillon;33cl @ Delirium BB 05-2010. Gusher, once again, keeps the br. Bouillon’s tradition that anything not over four years past the expiration date will gush. The brewery has some serious bottling issues. Dorée sur un profond doré foin, col blanc épais. Arôme fruité, houblonné agrumes/citronné avec ce joli bouquet de noix. En bouche, dors et déjà, cette bière est sauvée par le rajout de noix qui donne une très belle dimension au palais. Le tout se mélange bien à un profile plus centré sur le houblon, les agrumes. Malt est léger, laissant une pointe de caramel/biscuité avec ce très bon côté de noix, le tout sur une carbonnation qui donne un pétillant trop agressif et qui se retrouve dans bcp trop de leurs bières. Dommage car le produit a du potentiel.
Bouillon Cuvée du Fondeur;Bouillon, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Bouillon;Light yellow coloured beer with medium carbonation and a medium white head.

Seven Bridges Vanilla Stout;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Stout;Seven Bridges Grille & Brewery (Craftworks);Pint at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville. Hand pulled from cask. Very dark almost black beer with a big tan head that lasted a while. Aroma of dark roasted malts. Flavor was excellent, a complex mix of sweet dark malts, roasty coffee and chocolate, subtle hints of vanilla, a good hop presence, and nicely bitter finish. Tasty and easy drinking. Similar to their Iron Horse Stout but a slight malt sweetness replaces the faint saltiness. I really enjoyed this.
Saint-Omer Nordik Pils Premium;Saint Omer, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint-Omer;Bottled - 250ml. Found by my Dad in his travels in Calais. Pours a nice gold colour with a good white head. Has a real floral aroma, with a very dry citrus taste. Just your average French beer, just about drinkable.
Saint-Omer Nordik Pils Premium;Saint Omer, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint-Omer;Bottled(250ml). -Brought by a friend from somewhere. Best before end passed on 13th of January 2007, so I’ll re-rate it as soon as (if) I found it again. Golden coloured, small white head, lively carbonation. Very dusty aroma with notes of caramel and hay.
Små Vesen Vette;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Små Vesen Bryggeri;Bottle. A very timid opening, just a hint of wheat, almost no froth and very little roundness in taste. Ok but a bit watery.
Små Vesen Vette;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Små Vesen Bryggeri;330ml botlle. Body is golden with a huge off-white head. Aroma is fruity yeast with a little hint of yeast. Flavor is fresh, relatively sweet, some malt, a certain level of sourness (recognizable from the Kvernkrnurr, but not this overwhelming). The finish has certain bitterness. Medium body and a bit watery. This beer is promising as a kind version of a German style weissbier but not to complex. At a certain level I recognize some of the “infection” acidity from Kvernknurr, but not to annoying this time. This could have something to do with this beer sampled quite fresh and this style beer could easy tolerate certain sourness at a moderate level. I want to re-rate this beer from another batch, this could be a quite interesting beer somewhere between average and complex weissbier.
Små Vesen Audhumla;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Pale Ale - English;Små Vesen Bryggeri;330ml bottle. Hazy, dark golden body with a big, creamy off-white head. Aroma is fruity and acidic. Flavor is acidic fruity like green apples, some citric, moderate but pronounced bitterhops and yeast. Body is a bit thin. Not exactly a very complex beer, but refreshing in it’s own way and actually may be on it’s way to infection, but no clear evidence of that when sampled.
Små Vesen Audhumla;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Pale Ale - English;Små Vesen Bryggeri;Bottle. A hazy, golden-orange beer volcano-ing out of the bottle, settling a finger-thick, diminishing off-white head. Milky sour notes in the aroma, slightly citric, with some hops, a touch of malts and some faint papery notes. Citrusy and piney hops giving some bitterness in the mouth, and also some malty sweetness. Thin to medium body. Sweet and lemon-sour finish with a pleasant bitterness. Sure going bad. Citrusy sourness and piney and bitter hops make a strange combination. The beer is still drinkable and refreshing, but I wonder how much longer that would have lasted. (081202)
Små Vesen Audhumla;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Pale Ale - English;Små Vesen Bryggeri;Bottle. Dar golden- orange colour with an off-white head. Aroma is acid, orange, citrus peel. Flavour is acid, orange citrus peel, malt, hop. Ordinary beer.
Små Vesen Audhumla;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Pale Ale - English;Små Vesen Bryggeri;330 ml bottle, bought at Hotel Havana (which is not a hotel, but an upmarket delicatessen / grocery store in Oslo). Brew #1, BB May 2009. ABV is 4.7%. Cloudy amber to orange colour, moderate but lasting off-white head. Nice hoppy aroma, also notes of citrus and white wine vinegar. The flavour has a moderate hoppiness, but unfortunately also some vinegary notes which may mean that an infection is on its way. Dry and sourish finish.
Små Vesen Audhumla;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Pale Ale - English;Små Vesen Bryggeri;"Bottle from Hotel Havana, Oslo. Fully diminishing offwhite coarse head. Cloudy orangey-brown body. Fresh and fruity hop nose; lemon, unripe pinapple and a hint of pine, supported by a light caramellish malt scent. Taste is dry malty, has a fine bitterness, and a fruity acidity with a twist of vinegar. Medium body. Dry, almost tart fruity ending."
Små Vesen Audhumla;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Pale Ale - English;Små Vesen Bryggeri;"Bottle. Pours cloudy orange with some sediment and a tan creamy head. Interesting fruity aroma, quite sharply acidic, orange zest, but adding to that passion fruit and soothing toffee. Good bitterness, orange zest dominates, quite dry. It is miles away from an English pale ale; though containing no wheat, it certainly comes close to some saisons. Refreshing it is, anyway."
Små Vesen Audhumla;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Pale Ale - English;Små Vesen Bryggeri;Bottle shared by GrOve. Nice, fresh, hoppy aroma with a thin malty body underneath. There is, however, some citric acid lurking underneath in this one, too, so I thing this should be drunk as fresh as possible.
Små Vesen Audhumla;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Pale Ale - English;Små Vesen Bryggeri;Thin white head. Hazy orange body. Citric tropical fruit aroma with toffeeish malt notes and some plums. Dry citric tropical fruit taste with grapefruit notes. Aftertaste is all fruit: oranges, mango, and grapefruit. Very dry all the way through, almost a bit harsh. Very unusual, but grows on prolonged acquaintance. Nice. (Small sample from bottle, Bølgen & Moi, Oslo.)
Små Vesen Yme Pils Spesial;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Små Vesen Bryggeri;Old rating, 0,33l bottle @ home: Aroma is fruity, hops, grain and hints of citrus. Taste is slightly dry, hops, light malts, hay. Medium bitterness, slightly dry mouthfeel. Fair enough.

Erdet ikke en stund siden disse forsvant tenkte jeg. Joda denne hadde BB apr 09. Men måtte smake. Flott disig gylden farge med hvit skum på toppen. Lett fruktig og syrlig aroma. Ser av tidligere ratinger at den har hatt en viss sødme. Ikke mye sødme igjen her. Syrlig og fruktig med en grei malt bakgrunn. Fortsatt frisk og drikkelig tre år etter BB.

Små Vesen Yme Pils Spesial;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Små Vesen Bryggeri;Okay... 0,33l Bottle bought at Vinmonopolet Røa, Oslo, Norway. Lovely honey golden colour, slightly hazy. White, long lasting head, BUT wayyy too much. Foams more than any belgian tripel or wheat beer I’ve ever seen. The most over carbonated beer I’ve ever seen.Tried 3 btls. All the same. Light aroma of floral and slightly lemony hops, barely noticeable light malt (some wheat?) and refined or light candi sugar (none of those are supposed to be in a pilsner, or what!?). The foam and head structure supports this theory too. Dry, acidic and foamy entrance on the palate the body is quite slim, but the creamy mousse makes the body seem bigger. Nice acid structure, though. Lemon/lime’ish, floral and Belgian blonde’ish sugar dryness and taste. Quite short aftertaste, but with a medium bitterness that lingers for sometime. All in all a bit unbalanced, certainly not a pilsner, more a bitter Belgian blonde and horribly overcarbonated and way too foamy.
Små Vesen Yme Pils Spesial;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Små Vesen Bryggeri;(Bottle 33 cl) Courtesy of yngwie. Hazy pale golden with a dense white head.

Små Vesen Yme Pils Spesial;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Små Vesen Bryggeri;33cl bottle from Vinmonopolet. Batch 2. It poured a murky orange colour with a medium white head. The aroma smells of hops and grass. It has a dry, spicy and fruity flavour that tastes of malts, apricot and a hint of vinegar. It reminds me of a blend of lager and an IPA. Strange but pleasant. It has a short aftertaste.
Små Vesen Yme Pils Spesial;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Små Vesen Bryggeri;33 cl bottle - thank you yngwie. Bath # 2, best before 03/09.

Små Vesen Yme Pils Spesial;Bagn i Valdres, Norway;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Små Vesen Bryggeri;Bottle, brygg no 2. Label states Yme Pils, but with 5.5% ABV (sold by Vinmonopolet after all), I suppose it is the Yme Pils Spesial. Gradually, the cloudy, grapefruit-coloured beer appears under the enormous, off-white head. Decent grassy hop aroma with hints of citrus. Toffee and grass flavours as well as a hint of grapefruit with good bitterness throughout. A quite good Kellerbier it has become.

The beer had a clear gold color with a small bubbly white head that had little retention and cling. It had a grassy and grainy hops aroma with a bit of corn and adjuncts. The flavor was surprisingly bitter and grainy, and not very pleasant. It had a thin, lightly-carbonated mouthfeel without much texture.

Alpine Summit;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Can. I can’t believe I actually poured this into a glass. Very light smells of grain and sweat. Head was small, fizzy, white with no lacing and fully diminished. Color is clear gold. Flavor is lightly acidic. Palate is light and watery with a fizzy carbonation and a dry finish. Blecch.
Alpine Summit;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;"The Aussies routinely brew beers that are halfway between regular beers abd light beers. They call them ""Midstrengths"" and every major brewer in Australia has at least one in their lineup. Anyway, I digress... This pours like a Corona-- pale clear straw yellow with a rich foamy white head leaving no lace. Low grainy aroma. Light watery grainy palate. The only positive thing to say is that it tasted clean (unlike the mouthful of piss Alpine Max I tried yesterday), but otherwise pretty featureless and lacking in character."
Alpine Summit;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;A bit of a livened up light beer. Pours straw yellow and has some light malt notes. You actually get a light hit of hops on th finish. It is better than miller lite.

Ha! Halfway between light and ""regular"" beer. What the hell. Anyway, there’s a big frothy, fizzy head that dies away very quickly atop the pale, you-could-read-through-it-clear cidery body.....aroma is not unpleasant, what there is of it, barely distinguishable mild adjuncty graininess....on the tongue, well, it’s cold, that’s about all I can say about that. There is a bit of a metallic character at the finish that’s not so pleasant but otherwise there’s really nothing I can grasp, just an extremely faint corn sugar - dry stale bready quality....carbonation is low, mouthfeel is syrupy yet very thin at the same time. About as ""good"" as the Cold-Filtered Light I had a couple of days ago."
Hampshire Fools Paradise;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;500ml bottle from Beers of Europe. Bottle conditioned and nicely done by an experienced brewery.

Lightly hazed golden color with a full white head. Small lines of lace. Light noble hops, with a touch of grass. Mild pale malt drift around in the background. Light pale malt sweetness in the front followed by a light zip of zest. Finish is crisp and light. Perhaps a touch acidic, but a nice domestic pils.

There wasn’t much lace on the glass at the end. Pretty standard pilsener. Light noble hop aroma complimented by a tocuh of cereal grain. Slightly sweet on the tongue. Honey touched malty cereal grain dominated the flavor with only a bit of hop in the background.

Rock Bottom Minneapolis R T Ryebock;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;On draught at the ABR 07 in Minneapolis, MN. Pours a semi-clear brownish amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that dissipates clean. Aroma of multi-grain malt, a touch of lime zest and some apples. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with a very dry multi-grain and flowery hop flavor. Finish is dry, a litle gritty and some metalic aftertaste.

Rock Bottom Minneapolis R T Ryebock;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Named for Minneapolis mayor R. T. Rybak. Dark mahogany hue, with bright-ish burgundy highlights. Smaller head from this pour than I got at the pub yesterday, (but this growler has been waiting in the fridge since then...the RB growlers tend that way, in my experience.) Aroma: malty sweet, hints of chocolate, toast, cherries, & tobacco. Slightly smoky. Quite nice. Tasty right from the start, a copious helping of delicious malty flavor, and sublimely smooth. Grapes and other dark fruit are here, met with a grainy texture, that plays well off the tongue, Continues solid, smooth, and intriquingly delicious. I’ll be enjoying the remains of this growler and checking in for a few more pints before this disappears.
Selins Grove Winning Jar Ale;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Hand pump at the brewery. Pours a clear yet dark amber (ruby red hue) with a small off white head. Aroma of light citrus, malt and red wine. Taste of light citrus, faint malt and wine. Watery.
Selins Grove Winning Jar Ale;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Draft at Brewpub. As JRedmond discribed it so elequently it is a mix of ales together in a cask. Rather offensive brew with notes of biscuit and hop spice. Very disappointing. 2.55

The taste is clearly complex but mildly offensive.
Arran Paisley Dark;Isle of Arran, Strathclyde, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Arran;Tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in 2007. This was specially brewed to commemorate Jack Drew, a real ale stalwart who worked hard behind the PBF scene - nice way to be remembered eh. Cask, Handpump dispense. Ruby black in colour with a thin creamy buff head. Whiff of wood smoke in the pleasant aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malts give a full roasted grain flavour with hints of burnt maltloaf and raisin fruit. Pleasant hop bite in the aftertaste and onto a dry woody finish. Tastes like an old ale. Good stuff.
Arran Paisley Dark;Isle of Arran, Strathclyde, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Arran;Nice ruby colour, with a light malt fruit nose, and a deep rich fruit flavour with a little hoppyness in its finish.

Goose Island Saison 07;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Growler pour @ DLD 4/28. Pours cloudy orange/copper color with a small white head. The aroma had notes of citrus, corriander, grass, and some funk. The flavor consisted of more citrus, spices, sweet malt, and an acid tartness. Medium mouthfeel, smooth drinking. Not my favorite, but worth one sample.
Goose Island Saison 07;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);From a growler at DL Day: Pours a surprisingly deep amber with reddish highlights and a small head which left just a hint of film on the glassware. The aroma has notes of coriander, rosemary, ginger ale, biscuity malts, toffee, apple, pear, and a hint of brett like funk. The taste mostly followed suit with a spicy character over a layer of acidic fruit and malty base. Bready and slightly gummy finish. The mouth feel is smooth and soft. Okay at best but worth the try.
Goose Island Saison 07;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampler at Clybourn. Quite a change from the reds, weizens and bitters I’ve been sampling tonight (June 6). Brown pour with rosy highlights. Nice brettish smell—if you like that sort of thing. Tart taste that more likely from warm fermenting. Tongue tingling and dry, with a melange of spices, though my impression is more of cherries and sour apple.

Parking Lot Serving: Sampled from a growler. Tasting Notes Aroma: Slight funk and grassy notes. Appearance: Hazy/cloudy honey color, almost opaque. Flavor: Fruity and somewhat malty with a slight corriander spice to it and a hint of tartness. Palate: Average. Overall: Okay, but again nothing special. I’m glad Goose Island is constantly trying to make new beers, but they need to work a bit more at it. Many of the brewpub beers that I have had, including this one, turn out to be only marginally better than average...
Goose Island Saison 07;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);(Tap) Pours a muddled amber color with a foamy white head. Aroma includes ginger, bread, and other spices. The taste features quite a bit of sweet malt, with some caramel and toffee noticeable. Otherwise, some hints of grass impart a dry bitterness near the end. Certainly an interesting beer, with a lot going on in it.
Goose Island Saison 07;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught. At the Clybourn brewpub. Slight hazy amber with a small off-white head. Fairly wan sweet caramel malt aroma, weak contributions from soft spices and yeast. Tasted a bit beefier (served too cold for the aroma?), coriander and other spices, yeast and sweet malt which seemed a touch lactic in the finish. Average body, mild carbonation, slightly bitter and, oddly, acidic - it was okay, not a home run though.
Goose Island Saison 07;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pours a hazy copper color with a white head. Aroma is musty, banana, clove, and slightly bready. Flavor is malty, musty, and some clove.
Goose Island Saison 07;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"I don’t comprehend why this is a ""new"" Saison from Goose Island merely because it has differing ingredients from past versions and is aged somewhat differently. After all, it is just another Saison, overly chilled, poured into a tulip glass, isn’t it? So much for this week’s commentary on Wild Blossom’s Sweet Desire 2005... This is a fine entry into the Saison category by GI. It’s a hazy amber/gold with a modest white head that does some spotty lacing as you drink. The aroma (once it warmed) is sharp and pungent, somewhat funky, with citrus zest, newly mown grasses, and wildflowers. Medium bodied, it’s somewhat bitter with grass and fruit rinds, has a splash of pale malt, a touch of coriander (can’t taste the ginger), and watered down citrus juice. It finishes on a bitterly refreshing note. Not bad. Goose Island - Clybourn, Chicago, IL"

AleWerks Brewmasters Reserve Ironbound Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;AleWerks Brewing Company;Bottle 65 cl. Courtesy of fiulijn. Pours a hazy orangey brown with a creamy and lacing beige head. Nutty aroma, burned caramel, oxidized. Rich body, nutty and toffeeish, overripe fruit, again oxidized.

AleWerks Brewmasters Reserve Ironbound Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;AleWerks Brewing Company;19th May 2010 Cloudy brown beer. No head. Silky palate which is a little soft but with a carbonated bite. Toffee caramel malt with an aged malt chocolate aspect. Fresh hops integrate well. Pine and a little grapefruit. Finishes soft and with mild bitterness. Very drinkable indeed. Another very decent beer from this brewery.
AleWerks Brewmasters Reserve Ironbound Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;AleWerks Brewing Company;Thanks to someone for sharing this at the May Freetail bottle release. The beer pours a dark copper color with a small white head. The aroma has a lot of resin from the hops, but I also get some brown sugar notes. Not quite what I expected since the beer smells more like a hoppy American Barleywine than a Double IPA. The flavor is more of the same. There is a lot of toffee and caramel as well as some bitter pine notes and some brown sugar. The alcohol is definitely noticeable, giving the beer a barleywine-like flavor. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. The beer is still good, but with the age it now has on it, it is not really an IPA at this point.
AleWerks Brewmasters Reserve Ironbound Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;AleWerks Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to Butters. 0271 of 2008 which from the description I’m assuming is a 2008 vintage. Pours a hazy brown-red-orange with a dark beige head. It took a vigorous pour but did produce a lasting finger of foam. The aroma is big, like a foot away from the glass big. Lots of caramel, toffee, fruity, apple, then some citrusy hops, and a twinge of alcohol. Taste is very spicy bitter, lots of fruity malt, apple, toffee, a touch of age, oxidation and alcohol in the finish. Very americanbarleywineish at this point.

BrewDog Punk IPA (6%);Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland;IPA;BrewDog;"Pivo u flaši. Brewdog PUNK IPA 2017 Ovo je možda najveće razočaranje na koje sam zasada naišao u svijetu Craft pivarstva ! PUNK IPA je jedno od najlegendarnijih piva u svijetu Craft pivarstva. Nekoliko Craftera sa kojima sam razgovarao naveli su baš ""tu"" pivu kao jedan od razloga ili čak glavni razlog što su se počeli baviti Craft pivarstvom. To je pivo fine arome tropskog voća i hmelja , krasnog isto takvog ""izbalansiranog"" okusa sa ne previše gorčine i lagane slatkoće. Ovo šta sam pio na ljeto 2017 je za 30% slabijeg okusa od pive koju sam pio 2016. , i nisam jedini koji je to primijetio ! Jedva čekam sa prođe godina dana od toga pa da vidim da li su prošle godine imali lošu ""šaržu"". Inače ovo pivo za mene kad je u pravom izdanju ima ocjenu 3.8/5"

Aroma is sweet, ok grassy and good citrus hops,caramel earthy and spiced, quite a bit of phenolics and some nutty toffee malts.

BrewDog The Physics;Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;BrewDog;"330ml bottle from Brewdog.com (£1.29 approx): Opening very well, this beer got off to an excellent start thanks to how good the nose was when it came through with tonnes of caramel malts & sweetness, some toffees backing them up as well. Things changed after that though, the taste being an altogether different affair with less sweetness & caramel but a lot more bitterness & earthy flavours which weren’t too my liking after the great opening to the beer. Throughout it remained an enjoyable beer but sadly the change of direction wasn’t completely to my liking & I feel like I would have liked this one more had the caramel flavours continued throughout; nice stuff but nowhere near as good as the brewery’s 5 A.M. Saint for me I’m afraid."

Berkshire Belgian Tripel;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Tripel;Berkshire Brewing Company;12oz Draft at Amherst Brewing Company. This is the first time that I have seen this one anywhere. The pour is cloudy dark yellow with a quickly disappearing 1/2 inch head. The aroma is full of yeast and bananas. The first sip is buttery smooth with yeasty bread and subtle fruit flavors. The finish was more butter and bananas. This lacked the carbonation and peppery flavors of La Fin Du Monde. It was more smooth and balanced like the St. Bernardus triple. The 8% abv that the chalkboard sign stated was completely undetected. I have always liked this local brewery and this is a great attempt at a Belgian from them. Cheers.

Aroma is powerful, dense hops. Resinous, hops flavors are as strong as the aroma, with more fruit (peach, mango and pineapple) showing through.

Relatively clear orange with some reddish highlights. Aroma has alot of citrus and pine, fresh resiny hops- citrus is slightly sweet and has alot of mango character. Taste also has a ton of hop character- sticky resiny citrus, mango, and pine. Full bodied, but not overpowering. Finishes hoppy, resinous and bitter. Carbonation was a tad low, but didn’t even make much of a difference. Excellent IIPA.
Marthas Dr. Hoppenstein;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Growler supplied by hophead75 (thanks!): Amber colored beer with lots of clarity and an off white film for head. The aroma is strikingly hoppy. Oily resins shoot out at you. Piney, grapefruit, nice. The flavor is ultimate hop oils. It tastes like hop extracts with a drop of malt in the body. Has an extreme pineyness and a perfumy character. Could be a bit more balanced in my opinion. Would improve significantly with age.

Flatlanders Dunkel Weissen;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;Thanks to hopdog for picking up this growler... Appears a dark brown with a small, light tan head that slowly fades into a small collar. Streaky spots of lacing are left around the glass.

Flatlanders Dunkel Weissen;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;This looks like a cola with a pale tan ring in lieu of a head. The aroma is quite faint. Even my girlfriend, whose nose is much younger than mine, could barely pick it up. Seems like some dark caramel and, if you inhale heavily with your mouth open over the glass, a touch of old bananas. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh for the style. Tastes like dark malt, some cocoa, black pepper, and near the finish, a hit of banana. Odd. Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery, Lincolnshire, IL

Cleveland ChopHouse Saison de Chop;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);The Chop House has some decent variety, but I found them all pretty boring.

Cleveland ChopHouse Saison de Chop;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);Clear pale yellow small white head. Fruity aroma. Taste is honey malts all the way with a touch of caramel, and citrus, orange and coriander. Floral hops, weak belgian funk bite to it but it was still there. This was an awesome beer to sit on their patio with it being 88 degrees outside, very easy to drink, very refreshing, and it may not have been made by a monk but it was still well made and was awesome with the food.
Cleveland ChopHouse Saison de Chop;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);"By far the brewery’s best option that I’ve tried; very sour, citrussy with fresh herbal and coriander notes.

Pours a nice and attractive orange-gold with a fluffy white head. Nose is fresh and popping with citrus and some resiny pine. Nothing outstanding, but still nice. On tasting, firm malt backbone supports the big bitterness and nice combo of pine & citrus. Clean and refreshing and finishes quite dry. Really nice.
Cleveland ChopHouse India Pale Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;IPA;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);Tap at the brewery. Pale golden amber pour. Very worty aroma with some DMS character as well. Flavour is incredibly watery and underhopped. It’s got less hop aroma/flavour than the pale ale, which was itself underhopped. As it warms up it starts to taste like they brewed it with water that had previously been used to cook carrots and rutabegas. Gak.
Cleveland ChopHouse India Pale Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;IPA;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);tap @ the ChopHouse - truly one of the worst IPAs I’ve ever tasted. Old vegetables and cheese. Arouma is deceptively normal. Finishes astringent and blechy.

Rugby Winger IPA;Claybrooke Magna, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kendrick's;Cask, The Criterion, Leicester. Straw with a thin white rim. Peachy apricot aroma swamped with booze. Sicky, vegetal and a bit wrong. Fibrous apple peel fruit cocktail yeastiness, grassy hop, white white booziness, soggy biscuit afters. Too still and heady with not enough hops for me. Their Festival Ale at 3.8% was drenched with lip-smacking hoppage compared to this. Weird one.

Rugby Winger IPA;Claybrooke Magna, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kendrick's;Cask at the Broadway Cinema, Nottingham.

Rugby Winger IPA;Claybrooke Magna, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kendrick's;Clear dark golden pour topped by a lasting off-white 1cm cover.

Scattor Rock Quarryman Stout;Exeter, Devon, England;Stout;Scattor Rock Brewery;I often have a stout as a nightcap when out drinking, so I know a good one from a bad one. This is not, in my opinion, a good one. It looked like a stout should at first: black, but with a small white head which didn’t hang round long. Tasted watery and weak, a little bitter chocolate and malt came through towards the end of the pint (as its temp raised to room temp), otherwise not a lot of flavour. No mouthfeel to talk of, as I have already said, it is watery and weak. This was drank last night in one of my favorite Real Ale pubs, my last note on it from last night reads ’Very Poor’.

Kendrick's Webb Ellis;Claybrooke Magna, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kendrick's;(Rating originally entered 23/03/2009, moved over from Webb Ellis Ale). Cask, The Crown, Nuneaton. Mildly irked these beers were wrongly aliased in 2012 and my re-rate of this beer has been deleted, along with my score for this and Webb Ellis Ale. Shit happens. (These words relate to a beer consumed in March 2009, itself almost certainly a different recipe to the Wood Farm beer now labelled ’Webb Ellis’)....Resolving straw domed with loose sudsy white. Delicate flowery lemony hop mousse, dashes of mandarin and America. Amarillo? Long sweet vanilla malt afters with alcohol splashes. Sits nicely alongside the JHB- similarly pale citrus refreshment with a squirt less lemon cleaning product. Very fine sessions. Shades of Ufford. Soft alpha creaminess, fresh and good. Surprising, so much so I saw about 4 of them off in rapid succession- virtually unheard of these days. Earlier Rating: 9/24/2012 Total Score: 3.1

John Harvard's Barbarian Bock;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at JH. Pours a mostly clear gold with a thin-moderate white head that faded to a film after a few sips and left spotty lace. The aroma is very light malt and not too much us else going on. The flavor is a stronger dose of malt along with some lager yeast and bread. A bit of light fruit emerges towards the finish. Mild bitterness. A solid, if unexciting beer.
John Harvard's Barbarian Bock;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap at JH. Aroma of bready malt, sweet light fruits/citrus notes, and a bit of a metallic edge. Flavor quite fruity and refreshing, but that metallic character and a mild astringency is distracting. Good potential here...
John Harvard's Barbarian Bock;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at JH. Pours a clear, light orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet fruits and a touch of citrus. Flavor of light wheat malt and some light fruits in the finish. Crisp with a solid palate. Very easy drinking and quite enjoyable to drink. A winner! 7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)
John Harvard's Barbarian Bock;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Pale golden/amber colour, slightly cloudy with a thin head.

John Harvard's Barbarian Bock;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Translucent yellow body, with a decent, bright-white head. Great, strong malty aroma, blended well with a rich hop balance. Crisp and clean, very refreshing to drink. Pleasant, malty finish makes this an enjoyable brew.
John Harvard's Barbarian Bock;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Clear golden out of the tap, with a slight copper tint, and a small, but lasting head - aroma of honey, cane sugar, light floral touches - the flavor, at first, seems a bit too bitter, but the rather high sweetness compensates for this somewhat - honey sweetness is the most apparent characteristic - there are some floral and herbal flavors that don’t quite mix with the bitter/hop profile as well as they could, sometimes making the beer taste soapy - more honey, and a bit of lavender in the finish - not their best, but a decent effort.
CooperSmiths The Cache;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Tap. Dark orange, very hazy body. Small white head. Aroma is typical barleywine, sugary and malty. Taste is sugar, pineapple, and not surprisingly oxidation. Alcohol tastes about 9%, well covered. Nice earthy, mild bittering hops in the finish but oxidation still looms. Texture is slightly sticky. This is supposedly 12 years old. I think they should have opened it 10 years ago.
Du Lièvre IPA Impériale;Mont-Laurier, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Microbrasserie du Lièvre;Enjoyed at the Brewpub. Pours a clean amber colour with a light beige head and good creamy lacing. Aromas of caramel malts and some grassy hops. The taste is quite hoppy, grassy over the caramel malts. Some nice roasted malts appear later. At first, seems pretty bitter for an Imperial IPA, but just less sweet than most of this style and grassier. Quite inviting with some darker malts.
Du Lièvre IPA Impériale;Mont-Laurier, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Microbrasserie du Lièvre;Old bottle at a bottleshare: pours copper with a white head. Aroma is piny and malty with some caramels. Taste is bitter and malty. Light bodied. Lingering hoppy aftertaste. Ok.
Du Lièvre IPA Impériale;Mont-Laurier, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Microbrasserie du Lièvre;Bière orangée à tendance cuivrée, plutôt limpide, effervescence moyenne-bonne, et surmontée d’un col beige moyennement large et bien dense, mousseux et persistant. Arômes principalement maltés, pain légèrement grillé, pâtisserie, et tout de même pas de sucres mi-foncés, mélange de sucre d’orge, réglisse rouge, caramel et cassonade. Effluves plutôt pâteux, fruits rouge, baies, pâte à fruits… Derrière ces odeurs maltées, on décèle également les arômes d’un houblon qui semble surtout floral, ainsi qu’une certaine dose d’alcool. Nez moyennement agréable et complexe présentant toutefois une bonne intensité. En bouche, pétillement moyen-faible sur la langue, onctuosité tout de même intéressante au palais, belle rondeur, c’est soyeux et velouté. Au goût, pain légèrement grillé, gros grain brut qui manque de raffinement, sucré au goût plutôt générique malgré une petite tendance sucre d’orge et/ou caramel, houblon floral, alcool, et même caoutchouc par moment… Bière céréalière, sucrée et plutôt grossière, avec un alcool un peu mal supporté, et une finale à l’amertume de faible à modérée. Bonne intensité en bouche, mais goût plutôt ordinaire et complexité assez faible. Aussi, c’est assez loin de l’idée qu’on se fait habituellement d’une IPA Impériale. Tout juste une bonne bière, sans plus…
Du Lièvre IPA Impériale;Mont-Laurier, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Microbrasserie du Lièvre;750ml bottle. Clear copper with a foamy off-white head. Flavors are toasted cereals, caramel and alcohol with earthy and fruity notes. Medium body, soft carbonation, slick texture. Cloying sweet, boozy as hell, unnoticeable hops...this is disastrous.
Du Lièvre IPA Impériale;Mont-Laurier, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Microbrasserie du Lièvre;Let this one sit for about a year, and am pleased with outcome. The nose is a soft malt and caramel mixture. The initial taste has a relatively sweet blend of toffee, malt and caramel. Dark fruit - dates, blackberries and figs - soon enter the mix with a slight bitter overlay finishes it off. I agree there is little bitterness expected of an imperial IPA, but as a barleywine/IPA hybrid, its a smooth, tasty sipper.
Du Lièvre IPA Impériale;Mont-Laurier, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Microbrasserie du Lièvre;"Bière relativement mince, limpide, rougeoyante avec un tout petit peu de mousse ; en nez c’est très malté, on sent du caramel, des sucres divers et un peu de houblons. D’une rondeur extrême en bouche, elle laisse finalement, après de longues secondes, pointer quelque houblon en fin de vague. Trop simple, trop retenue, trop sucrée et trop maltée, elle accomplit l’exploit d’être tout ce qu’une IPA impériale ne doit pas être, tout en étant plutôt agréable au goût. Dichotomie au final pas très payante pour le Lièvre, et par ricochet pour le goûteur appauvri de 11 dollars aussi."
Du Lièvre IPA Impériale;Mont-Laurier, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Microbrasserie du Lièvre;Dark copper pour, small white head.

Pours a clear reddish amber with a short lived white head. Aroma is caramel and hops. Flavor is malt, caramel, fruity notes. Finish is very metallic. Lingering cola flavor. Syrupy mouthfeel. Average carbonation. It was probably WAY too old...Don’t worry, I used it for cooking ribs instead of letting it go to waste.

End of bottle is muddy. Very spicy, pharmaceutical, faintly fruity.

The aroma has notes of apricot, berries, apple esters along with grainy and caramel malt, slight grassy hops. Very floral and fruity indeed. The taste has a malty and fruity overtone with an earthy and herbal backbone. A weird plastic finish did cause some concern. The mouth feel is lively yet soft, chalky dryness in the finish.

Goose Island Pennant Race Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampler. Seems to have migrated to the Clybourn location once the Cubs were out of the pennant race as of June. Looks liike the Rotweizen I just had, minus the murk and the weizen. Smell is actually a little less robust, too. Much clearer reddish brown color. Simply a hearty, lightly malted ale with a hidden hop burn at finish.Cask pour. The cask version, available 6/6, shows a stiffer foamy head. Still has a nice effervescence, with a much more prominent malt character.

Flavor was of artificially-sweetened, lightly-toasted caramel with faint dark fruit and light herbal bitterness.. uptick of dark fruit again at the finish. Lighter-bodied with noticeable effort to be non-offensive in all facets… certainly sessionable.

Rock Bottom Chicago Tribulation IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Chicago;This has a cloudy amber/orange body with a decent beige head. This has a tropical fruit aroma along with some hits of grapefruit and grass. There’s a soft caramel sweetness at the base, but it’s full of a fruity, hoppy bitterness. The only flaw that I’m finding is that the bitterness seems to end too quickly in the finish. Otherwise a dandy drink. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL

Walking Man Foot Fetish;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Walking Man Brewing;An excellent double brown ale from Walking Man. Very rich and roasty caramel malt flavors.

Rocky River Springfest (German Keller Bier);Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);I’m not a huge fan of the American hops in lagers.

The Brewery at Lake Tahoe Nut Brown Ale;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Brown Ale;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;"""decent aroma, and i agree that this is one of their better beers. unfortunately that’s pretty much saying it doesn’t suck, but it’s not worth a trip there. totally let down by this brewery. 10-2010-can’t even say that anymore. 1 dimensional, barely brown (dark tan?) and weak."""

The Brewery at Lake Tahoe Nut Brown Ale;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Brown Ale;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;Not much aroma. A pretty nice brown to me because despite the name, it isn’t all that nutty. A bit thin in the finish, but quite drinkable.
The Brewery at Lake Tahoe Nut Brown Ale;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Brown Ale;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;Their best made beer IMO. Perhaps it was the freshest since it’s a seasonal beer? Maybe the others weren’t up to par? At any rate, this was a pretty good brown ale. A dark brown appearance, clear with a fluffy off-white head. Aroma was caramel, buttered pecans, molasses with a toasted bread character too. Mouthfeel was on the thin side. Flavor was clean, malty with a strong molasses sweetness that was pretty overpowering. This was their best creation. Now if they could pull up the rest of their beers we might be talking something good here.

Glenwood Canyon Sunlight American Wheat;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery.

Glenwood Canyon Sunlight American Wheat;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;The mountains of Colorado harbor many niches, nooks and crannies, within which lie a bounty of hidden mines, towns and even the occasional bakery (Silver Plume). Glenwood Springs is not what you’d call a quaint mountain town, exactly, but it’s not a global tourism destination either. Home to a therapeutic hot springs, it sees its fair share of visitors, and those who do go get a chance to visit the local brewpub: Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company. It is by no means an infamous brewery, or a landmark in craft beer, but it provides better beer to a town with one foot still in the past, and that makes it all the more charming. My family and I ordered a sampler to get a well rounded taste of the offerings, and I came away reasonably impressed, considering my expectations. The American Wheat appeared early on in the sampler, providing a welcome therapy after the depressing efforts of the Glenwood Canyon Brewing Honey Lager. I’m doubtful that a wheat really belongs in a restaurant context. Wheat beers, whether Witbiers or American are exceptional by themselves, isolated, with the drinker’s palate dedicated entirely to the beer. The subtle spices and flavor configurations can only be appreciated without sauces, syrups and seasonings disturbing the precarious silence that a wheat beer demands. Perhaps a salad or a fish dish might be appropriate, but there are too few places at the dining table where a wheat beer can find the proper care and treatment it requires. This American wheat was actually a pre-prandial arrangement, but it’s still coupled to the restaurant that supports the next door brewery, no doubt spoiled by many diners who used it to wash down a rack of intensely flavored ribs. The Sunlight American wheat was a very golden yellow hue, with nary a floating particle in sight, nor any head to speak of. Still, vapor exuded from the half-dollar sized top, pleasant with hints of lemon, but countered by a Frankenstein skunk-flower blend that is more confusing than ill tasting. The taste ditches the bewildering aroma, glazing the tongue with a moderately sweet flavor of refined sugar and the slightest hint of coriander, besides the assumed generic wheatiness. If you can get past the confusing vapors, then you’ll find a solid American wheat with enough to please and no forays into the kinds of excess that harms many American wheats.
Glenwood Canyon Rock Garden Biere de Garde;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;The mountains of Colorado harbor many niches, nooks and crannies, within which lie a bounty of hidden mines, towns and even the occasional bakery (Silver Plume). Glenwood Springs is not what you’d call a quaint mountain town, exactly, but it’s not a global tourism destination either. Home to a therapeutic hot springs, it sees its fair share of visitors, and those who do go get a chance to visit the local brewpub: Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company. It is by no means an infamous brewery, or a landmark in craft beer, but it provides better beer to a town with one foot still in the past, and that makes it all the more charming. My family and I ordered a sampler to get a well rounded taste of the offerings, and I came away reasonably impressed, considering my expectations. The Biere de Garde came somewhere around the middle, striking a balance between the light-bodied lagers and pale ales, and the ruddier stout. The name provided no information about the beer’s flavor, aroma, or even its categorical style, so, with a completely mysterious jar of beer in front of me I took a plunge. Evidently, what I had thought was a mystery had turned out to be a familiar friend. The Biere de Garde, for all its veiled, incognito efforts and foreign titling was remarkably similar to New Belgium’s Fat Tire. The body of the beer is a mix of deep and light colors, synthesizing a deep dandelion color, clear and lucid, and a great cream colored head. The aroma, unlike any other beer in the sampler, had a very aged, mature feel to it. It was funky and cheesy, as any good cheese monger’s shop should be, but also skunky, suggesting it had suffered some UV abuse. The aroma is reflected in the taste where the skunkiness prevails over the gourmet flavors. Some of the skunk taste is hidden with an interesting combo of pistachio, peanuts, caramel and brown sugar, though it persists much to the detriment of the brew. A week later I called the brewer to ask what the style was, since it had reminded me of Fat Tire, and he told me it was a “French Farmhouse Ale”, while Fat Tire is classified as an Amber Ale. I know that classifying beers can often mislead, but the Biere de Garde and Fat Tire are very similar in taste, especially with the nutty and skunky flavors dominating the palate. Still, it was a reasonable beer, and was a big hit with the family. We took home a growler that evening and played a rousing pirate board game with it, calling out for hotel glasses of grog and growing ever merrier with each pour and each sunken pewter ship.

AleWerks 400 Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Strong Ale - American;AleWerks Brewing Company;Very woody aroma with lesser hints of maple syrup. Opaque brown, thin head. Maple syrup is much more distinct on the palate. Chocolate syrup is also present. Alcohol is not noticeable, but there is a whiskey note. Holds up surprisingly well after 4 years. I was very fortunate to find this bottle. Not much in the way of hops, but after all this time, I wasn’t expecting any. I usually prefer a hoppier brown, but this was quite good.
AleWerks 400 Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Strong Ale - American;AleWerks Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a murky hazed deep amber brown with a thin head- low carb. Aroma is vege, dms, solvent, light dusty caramel malt, burnt toffee, biscuit, sharp edges turn to a grapeskin, and sour wine.

AleWerks 400 Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Strong Ale - American;AleWerks Brewing Company;22oz from Once Upon a Vine, Richmond. Nice dark brown pour, almost mahogany with bits of amber in there. Minimal carb, almost looks soupy once it’s in the glass. I was all keyed up for something malty and nutty, but I got a dank, vegetal funk instead. I’m not talking oud bruin, and happy dank. I’m talking infected. Mild yeasty notes are detectable if you’re looking for something palatable and somewhat to style. But there’s some serious oxidation going on to top off the likely infection. Shame, as other ratings seem to suggest the ale is - when healthy - exactly what I’d hoped for and expected. As is: drainpour.

Pours a hazy orange-copper with a big, mostly-lasting, fluffy off-white head. Decent aroma, slightly sweet, of caramel malt, more hops then expected, some fruit and light toastiness. Light, hoppy, fruity flavour, a touch watery, backed by lightly toasted caramel malt and a light bitter finish. Easy to drink. The aftertaste got just a tad iffy after a while though. Medium bodied. Though not amazing or anything this is still much better then I expected and I would easily drink it again.
Orlio Organic Common Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle sampled at NFB&WF ’08 at Martha Clara Vineyards. Pours a clear amber. Mild aroma of malt. The flavor starts out with some caramel malt, and is followed by light hops bitterness. Not a bad beer, its just that the flavors kind of lurk in the background and never seem to make a real appearance.
Legend King James Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Legend Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of Eepiest. From memory. Nice brown, pretty up the middle, picked up a little molasses with age, still not very sweet though. Legend Brewing is the shit.

Legend King James Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Legend Brewing Company;22 oz bottle, cellared 6 months. Dark amber brown with a lively, but settling beige head.

Legend King James Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Legend Brewing Company;"22oz bottle, courtesy of jasonp. Thanks, Jason! Pours an oily, dark cola color; off-white head with patchy lacing. Nougat and sticky dried fruits in the aroma; some coffee. Medium mouthfeel: coffee and nougat; slightly watery, with a decently chewy malt core; messy and kind of weird, honestly. Medium, nougat and instant coffee finish."
Legend King James Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Legend Brewing Company;"Poured from a 22 oz. Transparent and reddish sienna brown pour. Aroma suggests wheat biscuits, chocolate, wild rice, and molasses. Tinny hints of maple and caramelized sugar wander in. Taste is of tepid malts, being strangely clean, lightly fruity and generically dull. Wood, honey, maple, and vanilla in that usual montage of dark malt sweetness. Thin palate lacks any kind of liveliness or rich bombast; it couldn’t serve as a refreshing session or as contemplative sipper. Something so uninspired can hardly be expected to inspire. Thanks for sharing, Jason!"
Legend King James Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Legend Brewing Company;Appears a dark brown with a light tan head that slowly fades out. Scattered lacing is left around the glass. Smell is of roasted nuts, toffee, cream, cocoa, light buttercream, and gentle smoke. Taste is of the aromas with a decent mix in a different but enjoyable flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, smooth, sugary with mild cocoa bitterness hitting the tongue on the swallow.
Legend King James Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Legend Brewing Company;Dark brown, nearly black. Rich malty aroma. Strong maltyness that fills the mouth. Roasted, creamy mild body.

Dorada Michelado;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Bottle: Another of these weird beer mixed drinks, can´t taste any beer at all, only tomato juice. Food Pairing: Bloody Mary.
Dorada Michelado;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Poured pale yellow with a small, quickly fading head. Another new Guatemalan beer and another bad one. Tequila infused, even has the salt. Hard to descibe. Bad from start to finish. This has to be one of the worst brews ever produced.
Brew It Up! Belgian Pale Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brew It Up!;On tap at the brewpub. Served overly chilled. Light caramel aroma. Amber color with fine white head. Starts with belgian candy flavoring, a bit of spice. A light bitter in the finish balances the sweetness a bit. Tastes like a light Belgian dubble? Less yeast and spice than a Belgian. Pretty good stuff. Might be better at a warmer temperature.
Emmetts McCarthy American Red;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Candy sweet nose initially with a lightly buttered toast note behind it. A subtly not malt slickness to the palate with a focus on malt toastiness, a hint of roast and a tad bit of slick butter. Decent but not a style I care for.
Emmetts McCarthy American Red;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Emmetts Brewing Co.;355ml bottle. Amber pour, large offwhite head. ARoma is hoppier than expected, some tropical fruit and citrus, some caramel and dried fruit. Falvor is both earthy and hopppy. This is actually pretty good. HErbal, piney hops, ,caramel, pretzel, supremely dry, spices even the lightest roast/smoke. Complex. A winner in a mundane category.
Emmetts McCarthy American Red;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap at Emmett’s, pours a clear amber with an egg shelled colored head and some spotty lacing in the glass, the aroma actually had a nice hop touch to it with the sweetness following, the flavor has a hoppy and fruity front end with a sweeter finish of caramel and malt, hoppier than I expected, pleasantly surprised.

Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;330ml bottle. Dark red in colour,with a small beige head. Nice dark malt flavours with a sweet aftertaste.
Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;330ml bottle. This limited release porter carries a big fluffy tan head that is made up of big and little bubbles. Dark brown in the glass with very strong honey aroma. Reminds me of when you open a jar of honey and that big sweet aroma wafts out. The sweetness carries over to the flavour and if you closed your eyes you would swear you had a piece of fresh honeycomb in your mouth. Full flavoured and carries the alcohol well. Dry on the palate with an aftertaste that fills the mouth and goes on and on. Sometimes you come across a beer that you wished you bought more than one of, this is one such beer.
Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;Pours dark brown, almost black, with a large, off-white head. Nose shows honey, grainy malt, and some soft roasted malt. Flavours have a little more impact in the way of roasted malt, with some coffee hints showing up, and more honey is present. Unfortunately there’s also a huge grainy, cardboard character and overt alcohol which ruins it. Carbonation is much too high.
Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;Bottle. Dark red brown with a beige head that fades but laces nicely. Aroma of (tea-tree?) honey, raisins, burnt sugar, candied ginger, vanilla, angelica. Silky texture. Alcohol completely hidden. Taste has some dark malts but is mainly about fruity and herbal/ spicy honey. Modest sweetness, interesting herbal and slightly astringent finish. Good match for hard cheese - would pair very well with Pecorino Toscano. Unusual and good.
Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;Bottle 330ml. Delicious beer. Aromas of honey, alcohol, and liquorice. Taste is sweet, with bitter notes, and long length. Palate is velvety, and medium bodied. Dark brown, with a thin white head.
Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;Bottle. Pours dark amber with a small beige head. Aroma of honey, chocolate, plum and alcohol. The flavour is sweet honey/toffeeish malt, chocolate and a peppery taste presumably parted from the alcohol. A strange mix to be honest and at no point is the beer intriguing to drink, but having said that I like the innovation of the brewers to try something different. Very sweet finish. It’s really not that bad just rough around the edges.
Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;Bottle. Pours dark clear ruby brown with a short light tan head. Aroma is of cocoa, caramel, malt and honey. Flavour has very little distinct honey but you can tell its there from the slight influence it has on other flavours: malt, chocolate and coffee notes all have a slight twist from the honey. Quite light for a porter, this is still an ok beer but it seems like it could have been a fair bit better.
Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;Creamy thin head good carbonation red brown ale.Aroma caramel honey toffee walnut chocolate.Flavour soapy like but not harmful it,s the honey mixing with the other flavours of chocolate toffee caramel nuttyness,gives it a creamyness like texture that is not hard to take,finish mild bitter creamy nutty flavour.
Red Duck Limited Release Queen Bee Honey Porter;Alfredton, Ballarat, VIC, Australia;Porter;Purrumbete Brewing;This got a bit better as it warmed. Dark brown body with a ruby tinge and a short head. Sweet malty aroma with hints of raisins and probably some honey. Smooth taste, don’t notice the alcohol, not big flavours but don’t expect that with a porter.

Ølfabrikken Tripel Special Reserve;Roskilde, Denmark;Tripel;Bryggeriet Ølfabrikken (Gourmetbryggeriet - Harboe);750 ml bottle, thanks to ClarkVV on this bottle. About a 2007 vintage... Mildly hazy gold color with particles floating around the liquid. Aroma is honey, mild dried fruits. Maybe mild sugar. Flavor is a pale malt base with mild spice, clove and like apricot. Body is pretty decent. Pretty much spot on for the style. Nice.
Ølfabrikken Tripel Special Reserve;Roskilde, Denmark;Tripel;Bryggeriet Ølfabrikken (Gourmetbryggeriet - Harboe);2007 bottle randomly acquired at Downtown Liquors, drunk 11/28/15. Honey, cork, plastic, mandarin, alcohol. Hmmm, quite mellow. The flavor is sweet, with 8 year old carb that is obviously low. Oxidation is mild with lots of honey and citrus. Pretty tough to drink, though not sure how this could have been any better young. Incredibly sweet as it progresses.
Ølfabrikken Tripel Special Reserve;Roskilde, Denmark;Tripel;Bryggeriet Ølfabrikken (Gourmetbryggeriet - Harboe);750ml bottle from 2007 shared by ClarkVv. Thanks, Clark.

Ølfabrikken Tripel Special Reserve;Roskilde, Denmark;Tripel;Bryggeriet Ølfabrikken (Gourmetbryggeriet - Harboe);Light yellow with a bit of a white head. Smell is honey and spices. Something about this is off to me. I like it sort of but I can pinpoint the off flavor. Maybe it’s just the lime leafs... like I need citrus or I need more tea or something in this. IDK.
Ølfabrikken Tripel Special Reserve;Roskilde, Denmark;Tripel;Bryggeriet Ølfabrikken (Gourmetbryggeriet - Harboe);75CL from Clark, A very light orange color with a 3 finger head. Fully carbed for a 2007 beer. Aroma is super cheesy, very yeasty with a little bit of citrus. Well, it’s certainly old. You get a ton of oxidation, cheese, lemon meringue and old shoe. Believe it or not, this is still drinkable but lots of oxidation.
Ølfabrikken Tripel Special Reserve;Roskilde, Denmark;Tripel;Bryggeriet Ølfabrikken (Gourmetbryggeriet - Harboe);Bottle at Haket during Ölets Dag 2015. Hazy golden beer with a small but kinda lasting offwhite head. Malty fruity aroma, caramel, figs, raisins, grapes, bready notes, some spices.

Ølfabrikken Tripel Special Reserve;Roskilde, Denmark;Tripel;Bryggeriet Ølfabrikken (Gourmetbryggeriet - Harboe);750ml bottle (Pikkulintu, Helsinki) Bottled 2007, BB 2010, Drunk 2014 Simple fruity aromas, some interesting esters. Magical taste - I was literally like a sow with pheremones sprayed in front of her snout as soon as it got some in my mouth. Fruity, banana, orange. Gentle malts, sweetish and so mellow. A genuine 9/11 of wow, I’m flattened. Sweetish full paalte, nice carbonation stops it from being sticky. Marvelous full waves of esters through the back of the mouth. Later the aroma loses the aged aspects and becomes more mellow after the yeaster end of bottle is poured in. Better without yeast, only 8 in taste now. 0lfabrikken - we miss you!

Barons Pale Ale;Woollahra, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barons Brewing Company;"A good looking clear golden amber with a 1/2"" head and swirls of lace. Sweet caramel malt carries all the way to the finish where light carbonation provides most of the bittering. A decent big box brewery offering, but not enough taste or complexity to merit a big rating. Best for a night at the bar with your mates."

Au Maître Brasseur Duchesse DAiguillon Scotch Ale;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;AMB - Au Maître Brasseur;Bouteille 500 ml. Vieillie environ 1 an. La bière est de couleur rouge-rubis avec des reflets brun- bourgogne. La mousse quant à elle est modeste mais dure tout au long de la dégustation. Au nez, une attaque d’arômes percute notre sens de l’odorat. Le caramel au beurre, le caramel brulé, les noix grillés, les dattes, les figues, les pruneaux,l’alcool, le toffee et le moût de raisin s’entremêlent pour créer une expérience inoubliable. En bouche la bière est d’une rondeur fort appréciable et nous confies des flaveurs de caramel au beurre, de chocolat, de noisettes grillés, de malt fumé, de vanille et de raisin confîts. Le tout se termine par une amertume qui s’estompe plus ou moins rapidement tout dépendant de la température. De plus, une légère touche d’alcool est présente. WoW

The Brew Kettle Rich's All-Grain Imperial Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;Light chocolate aroma. Black body with a thin head. Medium palate. Flavor is chocolate malt with a dose of bitterness as well. Enjoyable.
The Brew Kettle Rich's All-Grain Imperial Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;C-Bus 7 Bottle shared by crizay: Pours black with a light tan head. Aroma, some chocolate, and roasted malts, dry and earthy. Flavor, smooth roasted malts, coffee, and some chocolate. Some roasted bitterness. Solid.
The Brew Kettle Rich's All-Grain Imperial Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;Oily black pour, thin looking body. Light brown head has well retained compacted bubbles. Aroma is a good balance of chocolate and roastiness, some coffee. Further nosing indicates more chocolate than roasted malts, minute hoppiness and off smells of acrid smoke and pineapple. Flavor is not very good, unbalanced and unexpected. Coffee grounds are dominant now, grainy to a point of annoyance. Too much bitterness in the finish is not akin to a fresh, highly hopped imperial stout of recollection, but rather a poor malt extraction. Thin mouthfeel doesn’t help this beers’ cause. A phenolic, cluttered oddity.
The Brew Kettle Rich's All-Grain Imperial Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;Sampled at the O-Town throwdown thanks to Crizay. Dark pour with light brown head. Black patent burnt malt aroma with malted milk shake and kind of vanilla notes. The flavor doesn’t divulge its imperial nature. Seems awfully drinkable. Burnt malts start things off with malts sweetness close behind. The finish is pure burnt even charred malts.
The Brew Kettle Rich's All-Grain Imperial Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;Thanx to Crizay for sending this down for the O Town throwdown.the nose on this was that hoppy dirt aroma.I am not sure I detected the bologna Fantomas was raving about.I sniffed this several times and told him I didn’t get that.Lots of hops and coffee with slight chocolate.Easy drinking not too heavy.
The Brew Kettle Rich's All-Grain Imperial Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;Smells like ring bologna. If you don’t believe me, buy some. Smell it. No doubt, though, that it’s the hops giving it that smoky paprika aroma. Stark imbalance between the hops and the malts with the former dominating the later. Whatever roasted coffee, chocolate flavor is here is playing second fiddle. Tastes more like a dark DIPA. But the bitterness does play well with its supporting cast.
The Brew Kettle Rich's All-Grain Imperial Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;Thanks to Crizay for shipping this to Dragonstout for the O-Town Throw Down. The body is deep black and holds a finger sized, compact tan head which is lasting. The aroma is massive coffee and cream with chocolate and fudge brownie notes. It isn’t very Imperial in the burnt/roasted malt parts of the aroma and actually smells a bit like an amped up sweet stout. Smells very good though. Fore is again chocolate, coffee, cream with some vanilla, esspresso, fudge and a very silky mouthfeel that makes me suspect it may have a little oatmeal in it. The finish gets much more roasty and bitter than the aroma or fist sip would indicate. Finishes quite nicely.
The Brew Kettle Rich's All-Grain Imperial Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;Bottle... O-Town Throwdown... This beer rocks!... Pitch black ale with a small, creamy, khaki head. Good retention. Chocolate and big-time coffee in the aroma. Some oxidation in the flavor, but mainly sweet chocolate and burnt, bitter coffee grounds. Full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and feather-soft carbonation. Finishes chocolaty sweet, then charred and bitter. Thanks to crizay for shipping this world class brew down for The Throwdown!

Rock Bottom La Jolla Catcher in the Rye P A;La Jolla, California, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom La Jolla;An amazing IPA at Rock Bottom. Initially smells only of the strong bitter hops, but after drinking off the top layer (and probably desensitizing to the hops) it smells and tastes like liquid rye bread, including the cumin twang every now and then.

Kona Wailua Wheat;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Pours clear orange amber with a three finger, off white head.

Kona Wailua Wheat;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"18-Jun-07 (12 oz bottle: Purchased 15-Jun-07 for at BevMo in La Jolla, CA) One of my favorite fruits is the passion fruit, especially when you buy it fresh off the tree at a market in the Caribbean and have them cut it open for you so you can eat it right there on the spot. So in 1996, when I spent several days in Hawaii, I fell in love with this local beer called ""Lilikoi Wheat."" Now here it is 11 years later and this Kona beer is finally available on the mainland as a seasonal. And I'm sad to say that my impression is much less favorable this time around. On the nose, this beer smells like your standard American Wheat beer, but the tart fruitiness of passion fruit is almost able to offset the cheap wheat aroma and provide at least some level of enjoyment for fans of this fruit, though the underlying American Wheat aroma is still what registers the most. Each sip begins with a similar balance of gently tart passion fruit and wheat beer flavor, but the fruit fades in the evolution for a ""cheap beer"" finish and a pretty awful after taste. Dark straw in color and fairly clear in appearance. The small, white head fully dissolves fairly quickly. Body is predictably light as is usual for the style, and carbonation is medium. While the fruit is still in play, the mouthfeel is fairly refreshing, but the finish and after taste lead to staleness on the palate. So after such fond memories, this has been a disappointment, so either I didn't know any better back then (likely), or this just isn't as good as it used to be. I guess the plan should be, drink it cold and drink it fast."

Brick House Drews Brew;Patchogue, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Hazy/cloudy, unfiltered, golden yellow body with a lush head. This ESB has more flavor and alcohol than is typical, I think, but it is still a good session beer and easy to drink. Full finish - caramle-maltiness, sweet, roasty finish balanced by a refreshing dose of hops. The flavor is hoppy as a good American beer will be, and I wouldn’t consider this typically English, as they claimed at the brewery, but it is tasty and nice overall.
Brick House Drews Brew;Patchogue, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Cloudy golden out of the tap, with a soft, pillowy head - grainy, bready malts in the aroma, with more of an american hop aroma than a british, which is fine with me - a slighthard water, mineral quality in the flavor makes it seem authentic regardless of the more american-ish hop profile - medium, crisp, fresh hop flavors are balanced well with a slighty dry, biscuity malt flavor - I could drink this one all day long.

Brick House Belgian Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Stopped at this nice little brewpub in long island. Unable to get good tasting notes because had to catch the ferry. Staff was very nice and the beers was enjoyable. Very nice food too. Would like to stop back sometime and get proper rating but numerical score will have to do now for the flight we got.
Brick House Belgian Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Growler. Poured a slightly hazed deep orange-copper color with a medium off-white head. The aroma starts off phenolic and then shows some banana underneath. Even some minty notes. Toasted bread malt makes the base of the aroma. Sweet malt thats gets some spice in the middle through the long sweet finish. Light to medium body. Odd finish that makes my tongue twist.
Brick House Belgian Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;"I think that ""Notalush’s"" rating hits the nail pretty squarely on the head when he says that it is out of balance. The spice was in generous proportions which, to me, made it a very interesting brew. In this year’s batch the alcohol is covered up much better with orange citrus and coriander flavors. Another improvement is that it no longer has the sticky sweetness described. Don’t misunderstand, it is still sweet, just no where nears what I would describe as over-sweet. This is not like any other Brickhouse beer, so if you haven’t liked them in the past don’t count this one out."
Brick House Belgian Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Not your typical belgian strong ale - clear golden with a copper tint - sweet aroma, with a lot of spice, bracing you for what’s to come - the alcohol is a bit evident at first, but a heaping helping of spices helps cover it up quickly - coriander, and some nutmeg? are strongest - light banana and clove coupled with a touch of phenolics - strong belgian sugar sweetness makes the beer a bit too sweet, and makes it a little sticky - a little out of balance, but still quite nice.
Benelux Anniversaire (Sherbrooke);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;En fût sur place, rue Sherbrooke. Un liquide dorée avec une mousse blanche. Un nez de fruits tropicaux, de malt blonds, de pain et de houblons résineux. Une bouche intense légèrement marquée par l’alcool, les fruits exotiques, la résine de pin. Finale longue et mordante qui en fait une bière qui est difficile à boire.
Benelux Anniversaire (Sherbrooke);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;On tap at l’Isle de Garde. Clear bright orangey-golden with a medium white head, good retention, leaving good lacing. Aroma is of melons, resinous hops, caramel, floral notes and mangoes. Taste is of caramel (not overwhelming, just as a good malt backbone), resin, floral presence, moderate fruitiness and some bitterness. Medium body. Moderate-medium carbonation. A bit oily mouthfeel. The finish is where it’s less interesting as the resinous bitterness lingers quite a bit. Good oily and resinous IIPA but it could use some refinement and work on the balance.
Benelux Anniversaire (Sherbrooke);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;2016 Anniversaire. Glass @premise.

Overall: on the sweet side (again), too malted too. Ok.
Benelux Anniversaire (Sherbrooke);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;En fût au Brouhaha. Liquide profondément doré, translucide, filtré et clair, surmonté d’une mousse qui tient bien la route. Nez caractérisé par des fleurs, de la sueur, des houblons trop résineux et un malt fermenté. C’est très puissant. Intéressant mais surtout puissant. En bouche le liquide est huileux, visqueux. Une quantité importante d’alcool me picote et me chauffe la langue alors que la résine de ces houblons floraux me cole au palais. Amertume coupée par tout ce sucre (et cet alcool), cette bière est pour moi trop intense dans toutes sortes de directions et manque de fini. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for Android

Benelux Anniversaire (Sherbrooke);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;"(On tap at downtown brewpub, 2014 version, May 25 2014) Poured a orange-copper colour with a small white head, slight lace. Hoppy aroma, grapefruit, lemon, some sweet tropical fruit, a bit herbal/wet pine, some caramel malt and alcohol. On the palate the toffee/caramel malt sweetness was more pronounced, grapefruit rind, orange, lemon, some ""green"" hop quality, fairly bitter towards the finish, some alcohol heat as well, still fairly dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel medium-full, oily, fairly soft carb. Good stuff, but on the sweeter, maltier, boozier side of the DIPA spectrum and so not a perfect beer. A little brash."

Un bouquet presque exclusivement constitué de houblons fruités et herbacés nous laisse croire qu’on aura droit à une bombe houblonnée. En bouche par contre, c’est assez bien dosé, une petite présence maltée venant adoucir l’amertume puissante de la bière. Le citron, le pamplemousse et les autres agrumes rendent cette bière très désaltérante, quoique j’aurais aimé que ce soit plus aromatique qu’amer.

Copper Flask;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Clear amber color. Decent off-white head. Sweet caramel aroma with some sour. Tastes quite plain with some cloying sweetness, but it could be worse.
Copper Flask;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);I paid $2.99 for a six pack of GLASS bottles in West Allis, Wisconsin. Deep malt, caramel. and brisket aroma (yes, BRISKET!). Nice deep, golden color with a creamy, beige head that last longer than others have said it does. Leaves a gorgeous lacing on the glass. Bourbon whiskey/caramel flavor with too quick a finish. EXTRA (yes, I intended ALL large case letters) thick, caramel consistency feel on the tongue, palate, and throat. You can taste the texture of this brew in your olfactory, I shit you not!!! An OUTSTANDING beer at ANY price!!! But...did I mention I got it for $2.99 for six 12 ounce bottles? Rock-’ N-Roll, my friends! Rock-’N-Roll!!!
Copper Flask;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Very surprised by the lack of skunk, considering the clear bottle. Pours a clear amber with quickfading white head. Interesting flavor, i suppose that comes form the sour mashing? A little grainy in the finish. Cheap and interesting, worth a try, but not gonna be a regular in my fridge.

Copper Flask;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);12 oz bottle. Pours a clear copper-gold with a white head that quickly recedes to a thin film that leaves a little lacing. The aroma is pretty subdued - metallic malts, maybe a little vegetables. Some sweet sugary malts come out as it warms. The flavor is sweet malts with some sugary candy with a bit of bitterness to finish. Sour mash comes out some as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with sharp carbonation. Overall, a small step above macros - nothing too exciting.

Marzoni's Belgian-style Golden Ale;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Draught @ Brewpub: This one poured a cloudy, straw yellow color with a very small white head. The aroma is milder. It contained notes of fruits, yeast and breadiness. I was hoping the aroma would pick up as it warmed, but it stayed kind of light. The taste was good. It was somewhat bready and slightly sweet. There were some fruits evident, noteable slight pineapple and banana. Also a slightly peppery finish. Nice.
Marzoni's Belgian-style Golden Ale;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Sampled on draft this beer poured a hazy vibrant golden color with a small white head. The aroma was sweet, tangy, yeasty and lightly fruity. The flavor was thick sweet sugar with a nice plum fruity element and a long, tangy, sugary finish.
Marzoni's Belgian-style Golden Ale;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Don’t look at my numbers, this is a great beer for the style, I just don’t care for high alky brews. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color with a slight haze. The aroma of this is quite scary, strong and sweet. You know by smell you are going to get a big alky taste bud impact. The initial kick is hard, sweet and laid back all at the same time if that is possible. The developement of flavors is complex. Alky impact, then that numbs up the taste buds for the sweetness. Hides the initial alky bite quite well. A few of these and you will not pass a DUI checkpoint. I feel my head getting dizzy already. This is a very refined brew that deserves accolades. Continuing thru the session, the alcohol bite builds. Barely any carbonation. Fruity hints thoughout. After a while, the alky effect begins to take over. Very strong malty alky finish. Borders on uncivilized! Not quite as refined as Grimbergen Blonde or Chimay Blanche (White) but certainly on par with great beers like Tripel Karmeliet, Allagash Tripel Reserve and Victory Golden Monkey.

Marzoni's Belgian-style Golden Ale;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Draft. Murky yellow lemon color. Sweet candy sugar and lemon nose, heavy sugary citrus smell and flavor. Yeast character is quite light, but overall it’s very good. Full of sweetness but then with a little bite of lemon juice and fluffy yogurt yeast flavor. Finish is lightly spicy and peppery, syrupy and sweet fruit and lemons and light yeast. For a second it even resembled a witbier. Good stuff.
Marzoni's Belgian-style Golden Ale;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;From draught at Marzoni’s, then again from growler I brought home. Sweet honey and heather, some bubblegum and cotton candy. Light graininess and a bit of Belgian yeast funk. Some bit of jasmine or other greenery in there that I can’t quite decipher. Mild coriander. Cloudy golden pale, like a creamy butterscotch color, with mild foamy lacing head. Medium bodied with medium-soft carbonation. Alcohol warming, for sure. Starts sweet with honey and grain, cotton candy or candi sugar, melon. Yeasty chalky bitterness with some citrus rind and Beeman’s gum. Light herbal/orange oil bitterness at the finish with mild chalky after. Finish is just a tad too sweet buy in no way cloying. Very nice sipping tripel.

BFM Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien (2006);Saignelégier, Switzerland;Sour / Wild Beer;BFM (Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes);"Tasted the 2006 version on 4/18/15. This great beer still tastes remarkably fresh despite it’s age. It is holding up extremely well and aging very slowly. I found it sitting on the shelf in the store. Compared to the 2013 it is still very acidic with just a hint of increased malt in the background. Carbonation is light to moderate, unchanged compared to the 2013, just perfect for this beer. Aroma: Lovely balsamic vinegar blended with apple cider, vanilla, with a hint of leather, cherries and peaches in the background. No hint of hop bitterness. It has subtle but noticeable barnyard funk, hay and aged cheese along with the bread on dough. The taste parallels the aroma; it is incredibly complex and well balanced despite the high acidity. The mouth feel is delightfully velvety and viscous, but not syrupy. This beer tastes like a super concentrated, super complex great OUDE GEUZE. It is fascinating and absolutely delicious. It is built to age well for a long, long time. Be forewarned; This unusual beer will not appeal to everyone. I consider this an ’extreme on the edge beer’. If you don’t like complex sour beers with funk, this is not for you. I rate this and the 2011, 2012, 2013 (and all the Grand Cru versions) 100+."

Pours muddy brown orange with an average tan head that leaves thick lace. The nose is vinous, super sour, nice caramel malt, and super funky. The flavor is a bit maltier and oaky, with the sourness coming through a bit less vinous, but very balanced. The body is full with just under average carbonation and a long, nicely sour and caramel malt finish.

BFM Cuvée Alex le Rouge;Saignelégier, Switzerland;Stout - Imperial Flavored;BFM (Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes);This one has been in the cellar for a couple years. Probably courtesy of wombat23 since that’s where most of my BFM Stock came from, and there’s no German labeling. Virtually black with a creamy beige head that lingers. Vanilla and chocolate aroma. Fairly straightforward. Taste is mildly sweet up front and nuanced—full of vanilla, black tea, herbs and chocolate. The finish is more peppery than bitter, although a mild bitterness is present. Big thick body that covers the alcohol completely. Delicious.

(RBNAG 07) Poured a hazy, orange-golden with a minimal, off-white head. Sourish, fruity aroma. The flavor is sour as well, too sour I think, and it also has fruityness and some sweetness. Thin mouthfeel, slightly astringent. I’m used to a little sourish touch in the beers from Fuglebjerggaard, but this was too sour, and far from the best they’ve made. (071103)
Fuglebjerggaard 0031. Bryg - Blid landøl (Krukke 1);Helsinge, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Fuglebjerggaard Gårdbryggeri;750ml bottle @ RBNAG’07. Hazy orange body with a nice dense off-white head. Aroma is a bit fusty or cellar characterized, not unpleasant. Flavor is quite mild, a bit sour, certain bitterness and very refreshing. As many of the beers from Fuglebjerggaard, this reminds me of some kind of farmer ale (saison?). I’m getting used to these flavors, and am enjoying them, but this body is a bit too watery and thin. A really quaffable refresher, but not the best from this interesting brewery.

Caramel and toast lead the way in scent with some dry floral hops in the background. To me this had all the makings of a simple red ale. Not that simple is bad, but sometimes simplicity is needed when making a somewhat simple brew. Light malt and again some floral hops. American/irish red ale mix. This is one of those simple brews that I could spend a session with and not get tired of. Basic and simple is sometimes nice.

Dry on the tongue with a dominant spicy malt flavor, but less intense grapefruity hop taste than the Flossmoor version. There was some pleasant light hop bitterness at the end."

What to make of it? Anyways, as said the beer pours a cloudy golden with basically no head. Tart malt aroma. Medium body with some malt and a degree of acidity. The finish is dry. 230407

Fortuna Komes Porter Baltycki;Miłosław, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Fortuna;"Sweetish aroma, fruits, caramel, molasses. Deep black color; you only get slight fringes of dark ruby around the edges with a backlight. Tall, thick, creamy, dark tan head with moderate-to-short retention; its down to a 1/8 inch after 5 minutes, leaving no lacing. (But disconnected spotty lacing as you drink.) Eventually, the head completely disappears and the sides of the glass are completely clean. Moderate body and feel, smooth. Initial taste is an interweaved complex of malt flavors: bread, sweet molasses and caramel, plums, fruit, chocolate liqueur, dry roasted malts, playing back and forth. Semi-sweet in the beginning, with no bittering initially. It becomes somewhat bitter, starting in the middle and carrying on into the finish and aftertaste. It remains semi-sweet through the middle, but ends semi-dry in the finish. Very slight alcohol presence on the roof of the mouth. Some sweetness returns in the aftertaste. The complexity and interplay of the flavors, sweet-to-dry-to-sweet, and balancing bitterness is just great."
Fortuna Komes Porter Baltycki;Miłosław, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Fortuna;Brunatne. Nieprzeniknione dla światła. Jasno brązowej piany całe mnóstwo. Syczy jak kłębowisko węży. Redukuje się. Prawie bez koronkowania i nie znikając do końca. Został atol. Nikły aromat czekolady i kawy. Średnie do niskiego nasycenie. Gładkie, słodkie, palone. W smaku prym wiedzie czekolada. Jest i kawowa kwaskowość. Niska goryczka. A posmak zdecydowanie – jednak umiarkowanie - palony. Są i owoce: śliwka i wiśnia. Jak na świeżynkę całkiem ułożony egzemplarz. Jedynie może bąbelków za dużo.
Fortuna Komes Porter Baltycki;Miłosław, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Fortuna;Well-made smooth beer, creamy almost, not stout or roast bitterness, just clean. My only knock is that it’s a little muddled, a big mix of random flavors. Jabeerwocky warsaw
Fortuna Komes Porter Baltycki;Miłosław, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Fortuna;"Degu rok po dacie przydatności. Barwa podręcznikowa - czarny brąz, z nieśmiałymi rubinowymi refleksami. Piana niska, średniej struktury, dość szybko znika. Aromat średnio złożony, na czele gorzka czekolada, ziarna kakaowca, dalej kawa, palone słody, delikatnie wyczuwalny tost, biszkopt, toffi. W smaku również średnio: słodka kawa zbożowa, ciasto czekoladowe, delikatna kwaskowość palonych słodów i tak samo delikatna ich gorycz. Pozostawia wrażenie nieco rozwodnionego i mało alkoholowego portera, aczkolwiek gładkiego i z ułożonym smakiem. Brakuje mi tu zdecydowanego ciężaru gatunku i smaku rozbudowanego o owocowy susz. Cena do jakości bardzo dobra, ale leżakowanie nie przyniosło efektu ""wow""."

Founders Bourbon Maple Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter - Imperial;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);From growler at DLD: Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights. The aroma has your standard BA vapours of vanilla, oak and booze along with syrupy maple and brown sugar characteristics. Some chocolate, grassy and aromatic hops, and a hint of pipe tobacco on the nose as well. The taste is surprising on that sweet as I feared because of the cleaning effect of the bourbon. You get a lot of sugary sweetness and husky malt tones at first but then the alcohol come a calling a takes over in a brash manner. In the end it the BA nature became a bit too much but I still enjoy the sample I did receive. The mouth feel is wonderfully lush and oily, mildly carbonated and a warming brew. Would like a set down with a full pint a see if that would be even a better experience.
Founders Bourbon Maple Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter - Imperial;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);DLD. If you didn’t get this, you really missed out. Deep brown body. The aroma was a nice mix of brown sugar, toffee, caramel, and bourbon. Taste follwed the aroma exactly, and was very, very enjoyable. I hope they bottle this one.
Founders Bourbon Maple Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter - Imperial;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);well...this is odd...had this on tap at the brewery and it doesnt resemble that of any of the other ratings..initially i was served a backwoods bastard and was told it was this beer, then asked for another sample of it from a different bartender, and alas i was given the bourbon maple porter...it was dark amber/brown body with no head..aroma large in sweet bourbon and nothing else....ditto on the flavor..it was missing all porter characterisitics and had no maple to speak of...i guess i better go again to try, but this was more of a bourbon malt beer than a porter...

Founders Bourbon Maple Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter - Imperial;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Dammit Scott!! You beat me to another beer, and my rating is once again similar to yours!!! Sampled from a growler. The nose was immense amounts of bourbon and lots and lots of maple that worked really well within this beer. Very thick on the palate which I didnt really expect with a porter, but it was fantastic stuff! Not really sure on the alcohol percentage of this one but it was certainly noticeable but all the while it still went down very smoothly. Highly enjoyable stuff and a beer that I didnt know even existed let alone did I think I would get to try it. Thanks to who ever brought this to DLD. Truly appreciated!!

Flying Bison Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter;Flying Bison Brewing;On tap at the brewery. While tasting the porter my brother found out our host was Tim Herzog, who my brother went to High School with for 4 years.

Medium body with a pleasant maltiness and a hint of chocolate and coffee. Great.

Flying Bison Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter;Flying Bison Brewing;On cask at Goodbar, Buffalo. Very dark brown, small bubbly white head. Nice subtle roast and chocolate aroma. Good cask roasty taste, very sessionable. Light body, a true session cask porter without really knocking it out of the park.

Flying Bison Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter;Flying Bison Brewing;Cask at Mr. Goodbar, Buffalo, NY. Pours a very dark brown with a small diminishing tan head. Very mild aroma of lightly roasted malt with a hint of coffee. Slightly watery flavour of lightly roasted malt, some caramel and hints of chocolate and coffee. Body’s pretty thin. Disappointing, this needs more taste and character, as it is it’s just O.K.
Flying Bison Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter;Flying Bison Brewing;Cask. At Goodbar in Buffalo NY. NOT their Imperial Porter, this is a new beer, recently launched. Poured typical dark brown, small cask off-white head. Mild aroma, sweet light chocolate malt, a hint of cola syrup, very mild floral hops. The taste ... pretty weak, really, tries to be roasty, and mostly succeeds, but I kept getting watered-down syrup - on cask it was certainly easy to drink, perhaps too much so, no real finish to it. Very weak body, mild astringency which faded instantly, fairly still - drinkable, but I was frankly disappointed.

There are notes of cocoa, bitter chocolate, nutella and capuccino coffee. I noticed also a perfumey hint that detracts from the overall profile and makes the smell feel a little unclean. Flavor is affected by a sour-ish sign of infection. Underneath the lemony and grassy hitns there is some cocoa and chocolate mousse. Could be OK, but not in this state. Medium mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Finish is long and chocolatey. Decent aftertaste. Need a good bottle to rerate but it seems this one has batch problems.

Excelsior Lager;Wimbledon, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lidl UK;Review: 500ml blue can of Excelsior Lager: 4.0% vol. Can find it with 4.1% to 3.9 % in strength, depending on the region. Coming in a pretty cool looking logo of a Knight’s sword, in a nice blue can. Aroma is pretty shit, in fact it smells a bit like shit, had the aroma of a fart! Lagery smell, and very metallic on the nose. Not great! Looks good on pour, a nice frothy white head, nice and creamy, and a golden coloured beer on show. Not bad. Head maintains well, and some good lacing apparent. Get a lot in the can. Bit of an off taste found initially, not great at all………. Overall, it is a bit tasteless, and any taste you do get is bittersweet and lacking in flavouring. Second can, it improved a little, and was slightly easier to drink, a bit smoother and nicer on the old stomach, but still lacking any real depth to the beer. Malty and a little hoppy, but overall not a nice beer at all. Very forgetful and not worth trying again, cheap as it is and all………..
Excelsior Lager;Wimbledon, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lidl UK;Can, 4-pack found at me local Lidl. Pours with foamy enough head and a yellow liquid, small bubbles. Smells of soft garbage cabbage. Flavour is slight grains and sugar with a medium finish. Given how cheap this is, I don't think it's bad at all.
Excelsior Lager;Wimbledon, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lidl UK;50cl can from LIDL. Thick creamy white head. Clear golden pour. Watery. Not much to it.
Excelsior Lager;Wimbledon, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lidl UK;An inexpensive lager at Lidl, it’s not particularly nice to drink on its own. Overly fizzy and with very little taste. However, its lack of richness and relatively high carbonation does mean that it makes for a lovely light shandy for a summer afternoon when you want to take it easy, so it is worth picking up a few of these on the cheap to keep in the cupboard with some nice lemonade in time for when summertime comes around.
Excelsior Lager;Wimbledon, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lidl UK;Can 0.44l at home, Vantaa. Enjoyed straight from the can. Aromas and flavours: Sweetness, syrup, grain and malts. Very bad bulk lager.

Well, I didn’t expect much of this and I wasn’t disappointed. Taste is on the sweet side of lagers. Includes some kind of sugared colour or something. It is drinkable if you are very thirsty, but I’d prefer more hops and malts. Made in France.

Tröegs Scratch 1;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottle at campground brewdown. Pours gold with a white head. Pretty well oxidized at this point (obviously) with some faint sweet apple notes, and off yeasty notes as well. Honestly, for a 7 year old beer of this style, I expected way worse.
Tröegs Scratch 1;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Tröegs Brewing Company;*First and foremost, this review is for how this is drinking right now, not in the past. My scores reflect the last time I had it but didn’t review it.* Big thanks to John for bringing this one to Campground Brewdown this year. Never thought I would have the chance to try it after so long a time. A - Pours pale yellow with a decent one finger tall white head, quickly dissipating to a light film, leaving small rings of lace on the sides of the glass. S - This one just plain smells old. Plenty of oxidation, stale bread, died up yeast, bubblegum, apples and some sugary sweetness. T - Starts off with some green apple skins and wet cardboard oxidation slowly being joined by the pale malt, bubblegum, old yeast and some light sweetness. Finish is a touch sweet with more oxidation. M - Medium-Light body with high carbonation. Prickly, sweet feel. The bottle sounded like a gun went off when it was opened. O - I knew going into this that this one was long gone so I was expecting all of this. If you still have one of these it is for pure novelty at this point.
Tröegs Scratch 1;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Tröegs Brewing Company;A: The beer pours a very hazy golden orange color with a large white head. S: Butterscotch and cardboard are prominent, which is disappointing but not necessarily surprising. Toffee and caramel sweetness with a little bit of bready. Strangely, there is a strong Cracker Jack aroma. T: A very strange fruity flavor that I can’t quite describe. Cardboard oxidation, toffee, butterscotch, honey, and some more Of the Cracker Jack character. M: Medium in body with a fairly high level of carbonation. O: I was happy to try this just because of what it is in terms of the series, but it’s really not worth drinking.
Tröegs Scratch 1;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to Derek!.. I’ve now managed to track down the first 25 of these! Poured hazy peach with a short, swirly cap of whitish head. The aroma picked up soft, buttery notes and pale malts with early-stage composted grass around.. sweet overall, and age definitely showed. The flavor found honey and bready malts at the core (again showing age, but pleasant).. dry black pepper, earthy notes, and a touch of grass around.. finished with a lemon-peppery twang over honeyed bread. Light-medium bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. sweet complexion, but it dried out on the edges.. past its prime, but still a tasty and interesting brew.
Tröegs Scratch 1;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Tröegs Brewing Company;Poured yellow with a white head. Aroma of fruit. Some fruit flavors. Light bodied. Little bit hops.

Tröegs Scratch 1;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Tröegs Brewing Company;7-27-08 bottle shared with lb4lb thanks to DIM, we believe Cloudy dull dirty yellow with a thin and short lived white film of a head. Smell is very doughy with a faint splash of citris - very faint. Flavor is light malt and mostly dough but there is that light citris backdrop there as well. Drinkable, but not superb.
Tröegs Scratch 1;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottle in trade from a forgotten source. Possibly DIM? Thanks though! Pours a nice hazy light orangish yellow color with a small white head. Smell is lightly hoppy and with sweet tea like maltiness. Taste is fruity with lightly bittering hops and a touch of a yeasty flavor. Unique tart and citrusy flavor with a touch too light sweetness. Pretty interesting beer.
Tröegs Scratch 1;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Tröegs Brewing Company;Wow. I was expecting a boring beer here, but this was outstanding (especially for this style!). Aroma was fruity hops and pretty strong. Pour was murky light gold with a one finger white head. Taste was very sweet in the front. Sugar and fruit mostly. The hops balance the sweetness, but after the swallow the cheeks are almost numb. Don’t know why but there is a crisp aftertaste that tastes like Juicy Fruit gum. Very nice.
Gilded Otter Imperial IPA;New Paltz, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: An enticing wooden, spicy hop character evolves into an assertive earthy, herbal finish. This drinkable Double IPA is a hop feast, no doubt about that, and should satisfy those looking for a high-alpha fix. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam seeps into the hazy peach blond. -The aroma isn’t overblown, and that soaring bitterness could not have been predicted. -Sandy dryness and tame biscuity maltiness work well together. -As you can imagine, maltiness is only here to support the hop flurry. -After their lackluster Barley Wine, I admit I was surprised by the high flavor content and complex hoppiness in this one. On tap at Tap NY.
Gilded Otter Imperial IPA;New Paltz, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;This Imperial Pale ale has a huge amount of hops. The beer pours deep brown and the nose offers a deep hops aroma. The mouthfeel and palate is dense with a carmel like hops flavor. The beer finishes long and with a balanced bitter.

Big Boss Bad Penny Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Found out of bottle from a variety pack. Nice appealing brown pour and odd copper smell.

Big Boss Bad Penny Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Big Boss Brewing Company;This one is good and has some punchy malt flavors. I’ve certainly had worse brown ales. The aroma could be a little more pungent, but still it has plenty of that brand cereal notes with a sweet underbelly. Taste follows with lots of cereal, brand flakes, toasted bread, toasted malt, grains and faint leather with a smooth sweet sugary character in the background. Finish is slighly sticky and malt...pretty much what you’d expect.

Benelux Cimonak;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;Une bière noire, aux reflets bruns, avec deux bons doigts de carbonatation qui s'estompe rapidement toutefois. Au nez, une fumée assez présente, un peu de sirop d'érable ainsi qu'une touche de pain brûlé. En bouche, c'est pas aussi lourd que je l'avais imaginé avec un corps assez mince somme toute. Le côté fumé est léger, ne prend pas trop de place avec une sensation d'eau d'érable également. C'est assez facile à boire mais très simple au final.
Benelux Cimonak;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;Où, Quand, Comment : Dégustée en fût sur place sous le nom « Double à l’Érable » (printemps 2007). Visuel : Couleur : ambrée-foncée. Apparence : semi-voilée. Arôme : Grains de malt, caramel sucré, notes fruitées et de sirop d’érable. Goût : Entrée de bouche : Léger goût de levures fruitées (mûres?). Une dominante maltée de caramel doux est également présente avec des notes de sirop d’érable, de houblon herbeux ainsi que quelques traces fumées. En bouche : Corps : moyen. Effervescence : moyenne-douce. Texture : légèrement sirupeuse aux petites notes huileuses. Finale : moyenne, composée d’un léger résiduel sucré avec quelques notes de houblon herbeux.
Benelux Cimonak;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a reddish brown color with a small white head.

Benelux Cimonak;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;A nice reddish amber ale with a thick creamy light moka head. Fruity esters melding with maple in aroma. In mouth, a nice caramel malt, with fruity notes, woody maple, a very nice ale. Medium bodied. On tap at brewpub, April 24 2009.
Benelux Cimonak;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;Pours a copper color with a thin white head. Strong aroma of maple syrup with some malt. The maple is a bit less intense in the falvor and the malt is a bit more present. The palate is medium and oily. The maple is very present, but as a dubbel, it’s not great.
Benelux Cimonak;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;My Bottom Line: Authentic maple syrup sweetness and wooden character is swept into slender toasted maltiness until clean hop bitterness tactfully closes each sip. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the clear brownish copper. -The flavor profile is not as sweet as the had announced, and drinkability is enhanced. -The body is leaner than I would’ve expected from a maple-flavored Dubbel. -The Dubbel character is overtaken by the maple and so the beer becomes a decent maple-flavored ale, more than anything else. On tap at the brewpub.

Benelux Cimonak;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;Dark brown color, with a creamy beige head, yeasty nose, with notes of wineyness, faint toasted malt, some acidic berries fruitiness, not sweet maple accent in the aroma, follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a yeasty, fruity winey, sourness character, hint of sweet toasted malt, no maple syrup flavor here, with some pruney, date, and raisiny notes, with a faint floral hop, leading towards a fruity, malty alcoholic finish. This beer needs some works.
Benelux Cimonak;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Benelux - Brasserie Artisanale / Brasserie du Canal;(Batch brewed for 1rst anniversary 28 april 2007). Clear ruby body topped by a small beige head. Strong aroma of wet earthy. Not much of the advertised maple on the nose. In the mouth things get worse. The beer has a somewhat lactic taste, borderline yogurt. That lactic taste really doesn’t sit well with the other flavours which include watery caramel, nutty/earthy malts and a little fruity touch of berries. Weird and not very pleasant mix here. The expected maple flavour really takes the back-seat (which is not a bad thing to me). The hops are there but can’t seem to find a way to express themselves. Carbonation is a lot of soft small bubbles and is appropriate here. Overall I was left with a “wet cloth” feeling. A big disappointment considering how good the beers from this brewpub have been lately. Something went wrong. Ha well, accidents happen. I even owe my being born to one.

Pours a dark brown color with mahogany highlights. Has a dense, large, thick beige head with good lacing. The aroma is like unattenuated malt in the hydrometer. Sugary sweet and almost bock-like in some ways. It’s like this is not fully fermented. Some toasted malt flavors are here like a burned marshmellow at the campsite. I am strangely attracted to this.
23rd Street Crystal Rye Bock;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;23rd Street Brewery;Sample at the Parkville Microbrewers Festival. Tawny color with a light tan head.

Trois Dames Saison Houblon;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Trois Dames;Visual: (cellared for 5 years). Pours toffee brown with lots of suspended sediment, barely any head, thin ring with very thin layer of retention, a mix of fast and slow loose scatter streams. Nose: pukey, soft funk'd malt, lime oil (lvl-6)-pungency Attack: thicker-dull CO2, sour-funk malt impression Mid-palate: subuded & controlled short pukey-sour, honey barley malt, (lvl-4-sweetness) Finish: elderflower, lime oil & peel bitter, stealth lingering bitter hops Summary: Unlike any other saison I've had, this one is pukey-sour but is particularly engaging because of it. Also unique about this is the lime flavour as opposed to the usual banana-wheat malt in a saison. Very smooth and palatable, excellent to whet the appetite.
Trois Dames Saison Houblon;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Trois Dames;Bottle from my somewhat secret euro santa, cheer anstei! Pours a hazy bright yellow with a white head. Really good farmhouse nose with barnyard stuff, wet straw but also grass and citrus, as well as some overripe sweet apples. If I stick my nose deep into the glass and inhale I get some feces, so I stopped doing that and just enjoy the beer with less intense inhalation. Taste is refreshing, with lemon juice, gooseberries, grass, pepper, white bread, some pineapple. Quite tart, quite sweet with a good bitterness to keep things in check. Zesty lemon and peppery finish, if a bit short. Like!

Trois Dames Saison Houblon;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Trois Dames;Bottle. Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly lasting. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, corn starch), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, apricot), lightly yeasty (barnyard), with notes of lemon taffy, plastic, pear syrup. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, slightly unclean/plastic. Medium body, velvety/watery/oily texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. If not for the plastic-and-taffy odor and aftertaste, this could be pretty nice. It could use more finishing bitterness as well. Cleaner fermentation (presumably) would probably take this to mid/upper 3s territory.

Amazingly complex spicy nose, black pepper, aniseed, licorice, coriander, citrus and more... although no spices are used. Clearly a result of the warm-ish fermentation with a saison yeast. Same spicy, peppery palate, with sizeable fruitiness and a nice hoppy edge, lingering, complex, crisp finish.

Trois Dames Saison La Récolte;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Trois Dames;Bottled (thanks Bov!). Golden colour, huge foamy white head. Aroma is very fruity, spicy and mildly yeasty. Also some mild sourness and earthyness is lurking in there. Flavour is very fruity, mildly herbal and some earthy and yeastyness.

Trois Dames Saison La Récolte;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Trois Dames;Bottle Mondial. Sour fruit aroma, mildly farmyard, dark hazy brown, small off-white head. Starts with a very malty taste, fruit, some yeast qualities. Mildly acidic, dry and yet refreshing. Very good. My first saison from Switzerland.
Trois Dames Saison La Récolte;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Trois Dames;Cloudy dark golden body with a large white head. Lush body with a mouthfeel that is full yet silky. Just enough lightly roasted malts with a light touch of caramel but as expected the main attraction is the wild fruity yeast with its citrus, banana and bubble gum flavours. Lots of bubbles yet never aggressive. Refreshing light tartness. This is not an intense beer, it is rather a highly drinkable Saison that you just cannot get tired of. A full bottle would have been more appropriated than my generous 6oz tasting sample. Excellent session Saison from a country where they call swiss cheese… well… cheese.

Lake Placid Imperial Stout;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;My Bottom Line: Vanilla-laced roastiness evolves proficiently on the palate, developing fruitiness and sturdy bitterness. This low-gravity Imperial Stout is a fine introduction to the potential power of this style. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam covers the brown-sleeved blackness. -Grapey esters are perceived in the nose. -The roastiness is king here, reigning through flavor profile and remaining quite healthily in the aftertaste. -The important carbonation stays comfortable at all times. -Some supporting hops are muddled in the intense finishing roastiness. -This wasn’t served on nitro, which is a plus. On tap at the brewpub.

The Golddigger is Silver City’s Golden Ale. Not a lager. Anyhow, It poured a very pils-esque body with a creamy white head. Biscuity, crisp but with less of the lager skunkiness as the kellerbier.

Silver City Gold Digger Golden Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Silver City Brewery;Tap - Brewery A deep golden yellow color. This was the least of my favorite beers at this visit. The beer was light in flavor missing some key malts and was just lacking in flavor. Might be this was a fast batch and they just needed to go to tap before its time. Better luck next time.

Loads of plastic, some sweetness and some berries in the aroma. Flavour is quite sweet and is dominated by some infected burned berries. Sounds good? Well it isn’t! Is quite thin bodied. Is grapish and sour in the end. These beers are totally not good. One could wonder who buys these beers apart from beerchaser and beercolecters. The only good thing about this beer is, that the brewer has turned 50. One could wish, that he will go into ealy retirement at about 60, leaving us with only 10 years of pain.

Chatham India Pale Ale (2012 and earlier);Chatham, New York, United States;IPA;Chatham Brewing;Tried at NY TAP festival. Not a big IPA in any sense of the word, but cleanly made, and satisfying. If you have friends that you’re trying to get on the IPA bandwagon, this is a good entry-level ale.
Chatham India Pale Ale (2012 and earlier);Chatham, New York, United States;IPA;Chatham Brewing;On tap @ Coles in Buffalo NY. Not a bad IPA but seems a tad jumbeled & not very balanced. The elements for a good IPA are there but IMO just needs some more trial & error. Pours a slightly murky amber orange. Aroma is caramel malts sweetness with some hop aroma in the background. Taste has nice hop bitterness upfront followed by some maltiness that could use some more cohesion.I expect that this will get better as the brewery grows
Chatham Amber;Chatham, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Chatham Brewing;Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt orange to amber color with a sly crispy looking ruddy lace after a thin white foamy head dissipated. The aroma held a semi-burnt sly caramel to bready malt, slightly grassy in the hoppiness, somewhat bitter and pushing the hops to be forward but mostly staying in the background. The flavor lends to the hand of semi-sweet to a crisp subtle bitter. Keeping that malt mainly wanting a sly sweet, but really bready. Aftertaste of some nuts and caramel and toffee. Crisp sweet to toasty and roasty sort of finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. Overall, good amber ale for the most part that I could come back to.

Chatham Amber;Chatham, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Chatham Brewing;Woo hoo, 1st rater! Growler from Spotty Dog. Pours a very murky, deep dark amber color, almost dark red cherry colored. Cannot see through it. Thats basically where my appeal ended with this beer. It was not bad, no off flavors, no faults. My issue is it was just bland and blasé. The OG seemed to be a bit high and masked the hops and yet the malts come off watery as well. I could see this beer getting better as the brewers keep messing around with it.
Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a dark brown color with a finger’s worth of creamy colored head. Sly messy lacing. The aroma had some sweet to roasty coffee almost espresso bean-esque quality. Subtle vanilla wafers. Robust cocoa beans trickle in. The flavor blends all of the previously mentioned aromas together with a nice semi-earthy backup. Crisp wafers-ish to coffee roastiness hits the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt good. Overall, very nicely done porter that I would have again.
Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;This is a damn perfect porter. Sad to hear they are resting it until the fall, I’m grabbing every can I see to enjoy for as long as I can.

Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;Pours cola brown with creamy off-white head. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and milk. Roasted malt flavor with milk chocolate backbone and hint of coffee. Really great porter.
Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;Roasted malt aroma with a slight sweetness. Taste is roasted malt and almost has a milk stout smoothness. Very full flavored, nice stout. It is really good. No smokey flavors really just roasted malt and seems like lactose is in there. Full flavored, smooth, easy drinking Porter with lots of body. I really like this one!! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;"While every brewery is trying to re-invent the wheel, Chatham Brewing tends to stick to classic styles brewed using traditional recipes. Their porter is a good example of this: a solid, to-spec, porter that has plenty of flavor and is easy to drink. That’s what I consider a good beer. I poured a 16oz growler into a tulip glass. Appearance: Pitch black in color with just the faintest brownish/red highlights. Pours to a two-finger, brown, frothy head which retains and laces well. Smell: Sweet dark malts with notes of toast, milk chocolate and dairy. Taste: Porters aren’t intended to be exploding with flavor, they’re meant to be flavorful, easy-drinking beers, and that’s what you get with Chatham Porter. Up front there’s a sweetness derived from the dark malt; notes of milk chocolate, cherry, and a sweetness akin to lactose (though this is not brewed with lactose sugar as far as I know). It has almost a cola flavor, as well (Dr. Pepper to be exact). The roasted malt comes alive on the back end, while the hops lurk in the background throughout. An interesting, classic palette anyone can enjoy. Drinkability: Weighing in at 6% ABV, Chatham Porter is a little heavy for the style. Though it’s in no way a thick, heavy beer per se. The mouthfeel is thinner than you’d think, with a silky texture and ridiculously smooth finish. There’s a mild dry aftertaste from the dark malt, though it’s easily tolerated. A versatile palette – this beer will pair with a savory meal or dessert (or as dessert)."
Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;Draft at dive 75 NYC. Pours a dark black color with a malty easy drinking texture. Lighter them it looks. I enjoyed it
Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;A - Pours a pretty dark black color with a finger of frothy tan-brown head. The head faded down to a ring around the glass lacing nicely. S - Aroma is a blend of roasted chocolate and coffee scents. A tiny bit of smoke and hop are also in noticeable in the background. T - Starts off with some roasted malt flavor and some sweet chocolate. Through the middle some deeper and richer coffee and chocolate flavors come through. The finish is a mix of roasted chocolate and coffee with just a hint of hops that lingers nicely. M - Medium bodied with moderate-low carbonation. Feels smooth and a touch creamy. Finish a touch dry and fairly clean which is very nice. D - Very drinkable. Nice coffee and chocolate flavors throughout. Well balanced and just enough creaminess. Really nice lingering flavors after the finish.
Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;Tap at Dive Bar. Poured a deep dark brown with a bug beige head. Nose is light with roasted malts and chocolate ringing through.

Chatham Porter;Chatham, New York, United States;Porter;Chatham Brewing;Smells great - roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Taste is similar, but it has a fairly light body for a porter. Taste fades away pretty quickly. Not bad, but not the best.
Ohyama (Big Mountain) Tokubetsu Junmai Nigori Sake;Tsuruoka-shi, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Kato Kahachiro Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"500mL bottle shared at Oishii in Boston, on 4/21/07 Very interesting appearance; it’s not all that cloudy and dosent show a thick, white, milky sediment, but rather a very finely ground up residue, leading to a more diaphanous robe of opal. Still some clarity on the edges, actually. Very light film of bubbles on the surface and excellent legs left behind. Semi-sweet nose is more spicy and citric than I have ever seen from a nigori. Not all the rich, chewy coconut/pina-colada notes (though inevitably, there is still some of it). Perfume and passion fruit, with a dry, almost tangerine-like fruitiness and lemon seed acidity. Soft vanilla blossom and very minimal honey notes arrive on the finish, which is dotted with white pepper and carries a good strength to it. Alcohol very well masked for its strength (listed between 14 and 14.9%). Very refined and has completely redefined the style for me. It seems a nigori dosent have to be blatant or forceful in its display of unfiltered qualities and this one is very close to any other high quality, filtered sake. The flavor follows suit, with a soft mouthfeel, that, importantly, isnt thick and chewy, but rather more fluid and full. Pineapple, tangerine, passion fruit and light melon sit on the palate, with some light vanilla and moderate acidity for a finish. Surprisingly floral and delicate for its unfiltered nature. Very well concealed alcohol. Delicious stuff."

Sows Ear Sparkling Cider;Brooksville, Maine, United States;Apple Cider;Sows Ear Winery;750mL Bottle. Thanks for sharing, Chas! Dry, peppery aroma backed with a little reduced apple juice and lots of minerals. Flavors quickly open with a whole lot of natural apple funk. Earth, white pepper, dust, ethyl acetate, and other wooly creatures. There’s a light snap of acidity and a good sparkle. Personally, I don’t care for the taste of apples fermented with their own yeast, as it gets a little too tape and foot tasting, but I appreciate the quality of this one and the underlying apples. I think it’s a good example of a rustic, mousy natural cider.
Sows Ear Sparkling Cider;Brooksville, Maine, United States;Apple Cider;Sows Ear Winery;From notes. Gold. White soda-like carbonation. Nice balance of acid, sweet, and musty earth. Crisp, dry finish. Medium body, slightly juicy, slightly soda-like. Nice cider.

Sows Ear Sparkling Cider;Brooksville, Maine, United States;Apple Cider;Sows Ear Winery;Maybe my cider-philia is getting the better of me. Pours a crystalline golden yellow, with a steady bead coming forth. The aroma is sweet apples, yeast, floral notes. The flavor is glorious, crisp, acidic and direct. The apples are the star here, but this cider finishes very dry, with the essence of green apples, hitting you at the end. Amazingly, the 10% alcohol is virtually non-existent in the flavor, this is an awesome cider.
Rooster Fish Hop Warrior Imperial IPA;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rooster Fish Brewing;This is a backlog rating from 2011 from a bottle shared by Tmoney99, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time.

Rooster Fish Hop Warrior Imperial IPA;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rooster Fish Brewing;Found some old rating notes from TapNY 2013 that somehow never got entered. (I’m keeping this a little shorter than my normal rating style to help catch-up my backlog a little faster.) I thought this was a pretty nice DIPA. It has a plenty of hop bitterness. Fruity hops. Some caramel malt flavors are here too. Pretty nice mouthfeel as well.
Rooster Fish Hop Warrior Imperial IPA;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rooster Fish Brewing;It is rare that I try a IIPA that I dislike... This came close. Mostly sweet big malt and bitter finish. I didn’t get a very powerful aroma or hop flavor. I wish there was more here, I really wanted to like it.
Rooster Fish Hop Warrior Imperial IPA;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rooster Fish Brewing;Draft @ J. Ryan’s. red color with great head retention. Nose is light citrus hops and caramel malt. Taste is a strong amount of pine hops with caramel backbone with a hint of Earthy malt. Body is medium with a moderate lingering bitterness. More like a standard IPA, then DIPA. Ok
Rooster Fish Hop Warrior Imperial IPA;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rooster Fish Brewing;"I poured a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 4/13/13 making it less than three weeks old. Appearance: Extremely hazy but translucent shade of burnt umber/dark orange/cherry red. Forms a small, off-white, foamy head which leaves some lacing and never completely evaporates. Smell: Extremely earthy aroma of tree bark, pine cones and grass but also a subtle fruit juice concentrate scent as well. Taste: I hate to criticize an up-and-coming brewery since we beer nerds are supposed to support the little guys, but if a beer is not good I’m not going to lie about it. And while Rooster Fish Hop Warrior Imperial IPA is far from abysmal, the fact remains it’s just not a good beer. The reason this beer fails for me is twofold: a complete lack of hops; and a base malt flavor of burnt peanut brittle. Though it’s quite hoppy to the nose, there’s little actual bitterness to be found here. This is especially disappointing considering the label indicates an IBU rating of ""100+"". There’s a mild sweetness throughout the first half of the palette. It’s a general earthy flavor but without anything particularly distinctive. The finish imparts an off taste akin to licking a pine cone. Sure, some hops can have a piney taste to them, but this doesn’t seem right. The aftertaste is akin to burnt sugar, or maybe even sorghum. I don’t really know what this beer is supposed to be, but basing an entire DIPA around the Warrior hop doesn’t seem to work. Drinkability: Though I didn’t much care for the taste, I have to admit Rooster Fish Hop Warrior Imperial IPA was surprisingly drinkable at first. The body seems to be undercarbonated, creating for a thin, slightly flat mouthfeel. This makes it easy to drink, but once it warms the aftertaste becomes dry and bitter. At 8% ABV it’s inefficient, though I could probably throw back the entire bottle myself easily."

Great Adirondack Cloudsplitter Barley Wine;Lake Placid, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;Tap at Hop Devil Grill. Pale amber-orange beer with no head. Chewy and sweet on the aroma with loads of orange blossom honey and some citrus fruitiness. Extremely sweet and cloying with loads of orange peel and honey. It’s really more like a sweet mead than a barely wine but not a great example of either. Fatty and underattenuated. Bleh.
Great Adirondack Cloudsplitter Barley Wine;Lake Placid, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;My Bottom Line: Humble base malt flavors are swimming in alcohol, as scattered hop vests are thrown around to attempt salvaging them. This is a cleanly-brewed, but highly soporific blond Barley Wine. Further Personal Perceptions: -There is no foam to be seen atop the hazy blond. -This is nearly scentless, aside from some honey and alcohol sharpness. -Another Great Adirondack strong ale I just can’t get into. -Some citrusy, wooden hop presence appears when looked for. -It definitely lacks malt development and hop definition to be worthy of a thumbs up within this broad style. -Some milkiness is found in the nose.

Gilded Otter Centennial Barley Wine;New Paltz, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: This hop-happy Barley Wine lathers the tongue with leafy and earthy hop flavors which lead to a sharp and slightly astringent finishing bitterness. The thin body points towards an Imperial Pale Ale, or something of the sort, but its unidirectionality and lack of malt depth remain its downfall for me. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam protects the cloudy pale orange hues. -Wet leaves and citrus fruit tickle the nose. -The prickly carbonation is too strong for the feeble maltiness. -Tasted blind, one could think this were a monstrously hopped APA. -Alcohol was shy, but present. -Their Imperial IPA was so much better that day.

Northwoods Bumbln Bubbas Lingonberry Light;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Northwoods Brew Pub;Fresh, on tap at the Eau Claire, WI brewpub location. Pours a pale light yellowish gold with a lot of carbonation and a small fast dissolving white head. Some spotty lacing. This beverage does not have the deep red color of real linonberries but may have just the juice and no skins added. Very faint aroma of light corn/barley malt, some citrus, and a hint of tart Regal variety lingonberries. Taste is light, a little watery, crisp and very carbonated. Finish is a bit watery and soft white bready. Could use a little more Lingonberry tartness but a nice 105 + degree lawnmower beer.

Northwoods Irish Red Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Northwoods Brew Pub;On tap at both Chetek and Eau Claire, WI brewpub locations. Pours a light penny copper brew with a barely thin white head. Hardly any lacing. Aroma is a clean glass, maybe a hint of malt but no hops. Nothing more. Darn, we tried to get a whiff of something of ten to eleven minutes of trying. We even tried it outside on the Chetek tavern porch to get something. We could smell only the white pines off Pokegama Lake but no hops in the beer. We simply gave up. Taste is highly carbonated, very watery and a little malt taste. Finish is clean with nothing to remember the beer by. Nice try but hopefully next year’s batch could maybe have some hops added.

Beautiful golden colour with a white head that leaves behind lacing. Nice hops/malty aroma. Easy drinking with a wonderful balance of fine malts and hops. A good one.
Robert Simpson Sugarbush Lager;Barrie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Flying Monkeys;On tap at the brewery A clear deep gold colored lager with a decent 2 finger tight pored cap that lasts and laces. Aromas of fresh bisquits and a floral-citrus tone from the Yakima valley hops Lovely smooth feel in the front with ample carapils malts to chew on, nice balance with the herbal-citrusy hops ...finishes clean with a biscuity snap and a nice hop bite. A very staple lager of the old pre-prohibition Canadian style. When fresh this is far better than Creemore....more malts more smooth finish...this is much like a smooth malty steam beer.
Robert Simpson Sugarbush Lager;Barrie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Flying Monkeys;Had on Tap at Witlock’s on the beachs. Nice cleean crisp beer, very easy drinking but i actually enjoy this more then the ale. again a golden straw color, nice amount of white head with some lacing. slightly sweet flavour with some decent hops for the style. nice and refreshing

Tap Room No. 21 Moe's Backroom Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 5/11/2016. Pours clear medium orange/amber/light copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, honey, brown sugar, toasted bread, light nuttiness, light citrus/apple fruitiness, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Okay aromas with some dark/bready malt, honey, and light earthy hop/fruity yeast notes; with decent strength. Taste of caramel, honey, brown sugar, toasted bread, light nuttiness, light citrus/apple fruitiness, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Minimal herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel. honey, brown sugar, toasted bread, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Solid robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, honey, and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal dryness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready/grainy mouthfeel that is good. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.5%. Slight diacetyl presence. Overall this is an okay amber ale. Decent robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, honey, and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. This was pretty bland and needed more hop presence; but was fairly tasty and enjoyable otherwise."
Tap Room No. 21 Moe's Backroom Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Bottle. Clear copper color with a thin white head that quickly dissipated. Aroma was light malt with a strong caramel taste. A little metallic on the backend.
Tap Room No. 21 Moe's Backroom Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Bottle. Pours a clear copper color with fair head. Aroma of caramel, bit of grain and malt. Taste of caramel, honey and malt sweetness. Mild bitterness and a sweet finish. Moderate body, smooth and candy sweetness. Nice if you are into bubblegum.
Tap Room No. 21 Moe's Backroom Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;I’ve never had a beer quite like this. I expected mild maltiness, but got medicinal and metallic.
Tap Room No. 21 Moe's Backroom Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;"Poured into a perfect pint. Says ""ale with honey added"" on label, so this might be a different listing. 3.25 A: Clear dark orange color. Two fingers of frothy off-white head. Retention is a touch below average and a short ring of lacing is left. 2.5 S: Light toastiness. Bland overall with a noticeable adjunct aroma hinting at rice. A touch of honey comes through, but only because the rest of the nose is so anemic. 2.0 T: Man this is bad. It’s has that sickening adjunct sweetness that I will never get used to. The residual honey only bolsters this flavor. Again light toastiness and maybe a touch of graininesss. 2.5 M: Lighter body. Too much carbonation. Could be creaminess. Finish leaves a horrible sweet aftertaste. 1.75 D: This beer is ass. Don’t buy it. Avoid it at all costs. ★ 792 characters DavoleBomb, Aug 18, 2013"
Tap Room No. 21 Moe's Backroom Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;"Upon pouring this beer, I immediately knew I was in trouble. It just SOUNDED like it was going to be a crappy beer. The ""head"" was fizzing rapidly, as if it couldn’t wait to disappear as quickly as possible. It was reminiscent of finding that 2-liter bottle of cola that’s been sitting in your fridge for weeks because no one wanted the last half glass of flat soda pop. I got screwed when I wanted a frothy beverage then, and I got screwed now with this sorry excuse for an amber ale. The carbonation evanesced faster than the talent level of a Miami Marlins roster after winning the World Series. The aroma was no better. It smelled like your hand after holding a pocketful of arcade tokens. As for the taste--does ""fallacy"" count as a taste? Besides being flat and listless, this ""copper"" colored ale tasted like it was brewed with pre-1982 pennies. I’ve never actually drank anything brewed with pre-1982 pennies (or post- for that matter), but I think I accurately likened the taste. This beer is brewed in Rochester, New York. I was in Georgia when I found it. It was probably delivered via backroads in an open bed truck, with the sun pounding away at the uncovered bottles the entire time. This entire Tap Room No. 21 series should be put in a crate Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark-style--not because it’s a relic, but because it should be hidden away so the general public never sees it again."

Tap Room No. 21 Moe's Backroom Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;12 oz.bottle into pint glass. Pours clear. Toasted and malty aroma. Taste sweet. Average beer.
McMenamins Caveman 3000;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the Blue Moon McMenamins. Pours dark mahogany with a strong tan head. Very sweet aroma and flavor with a bit of hops to try to balance, but stayed sweet through the finish. Although you could taste the alcohol, it wasn’t overpowering, only minor excess alochol hints in the finish. Caramel flavors mixed with a light toasted bready flavor combine with citrus hops.
Gambrinus Imperial IPA;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Gambrinus - Artisan Brasseur;Cloudy amber pour with a thin offwhite head. Nice aroma of citrusy, resinous hops. Good flavor of citrusy, resinous hops with a bitter finish. The body is light to medium and slightly liquorous while the carbonation is moderate. Nicely done.
Gambrinus Imperial IPA;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Gambrinus - Artisan Brasseur;Very dark copper, hazy. A lacy off-white ring does not show much endurance over the liquid. Coniferous, piney pungent hops are the first noticeable aspects as you plunge your nose into the glass. The first sip therefore surprises with its important toasty maltiness that serves as the foundation. Lightly bready as well, but really focused on toast malt flavours. The hop importance grows and grows by the sip, reaching out towards earthiness and saltiness in the hoppy finale. Certainly not refreshing, but a pleasant hop discourse.
Gambrinus Imperial IPA;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Gambrinus - Artisan Brasseur;En fût. Verre de 20 oz dégusté au Broadway (Shawinigan, QC). Arôme: Odeur d’houblons résineux avec une pointe de pamplemousse. Apparence: La couleur est ambrée. Présence d’un mince col mousseux et d’une fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût d’houblons résineux avec une pointe de caramel. Durée moyenne de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement huileuse. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. Légère amertume en arrière goût. (Rating #2013)
Gambrinus Imperial IPA;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Gambrinus - Artisan Brasseur;My Bottom Line: Resinous hops readily bloom onto the chocolate and caramel maltiness of this levelled Double IPA, an inspiring landscape which rolls away into the sustained bitterness of verdant greenery and its fresh earth. Further Personal Perceptions: -A slice of foam decorates the dark orange-red. -The soft tingling of carbonation is perfect for the suave body. -The hoppiness is redolent of Cascade and Simcoe varieties. -The flavor profile is balanced in its intensity. -Strawberries seem to grow from the caramel malt base and the chosen yeast. On tap at Broadway Pub, Shawinigan.

Trailhead Pilsner;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trailhead Brewing Co.;It poured a clear yellow color with a small white head. The aroma was of straw, bread, spicy hops and light citrus. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry finish. The taste was of straw, bread, earthiness and spicy hops with a crisp dry finish.
Trailhead Pilsner;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Clear dark straw. Smooth. Slight creamy. Pretty light with a nice hint of lasting bitter.
Trailhead Pilsner;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Pours gold with a decent white head. Nice hoppy aroma. Flavor is nice and malty with a dry hoppy finish. The best of their beers that I tried.
Trailhead Pilsner;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trailhead Brewing Co.;A very decent pilsner. A nice floral hoppy beer. Definitely their best beer. Much better unfiltered.
Trailhead Pilsner;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Easily the best offering from this brewer. Poured gold with a small head, great lacing on the glass. Aroma is initially floral hops, caramel malts, and a very slight citric hint. Flavor is also very floral, bitter rose hearts and mild cereal malts balance elegantly. Mouthfeel is quite full for the style, almost chewy. This may be the best example of this style I have ever had. Brilliant!
River City Imperial Stout;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Stout - Imperial;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);On tap at the Parkville Microbrew Festival. Good Lord that’s an interesting Impy. Pours black with a yellow-ivory beige head. The solid creamy head leaves awesome lacing behind. Has a real smokestack aroma of roasted chocolate and lots of smoke. Chewey, thick palate. This beer really masks its high alcohol. This is tight, solid, and smooth.
River City Imperial Stout;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Stout - Imperial;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Sampled at the Parkville Microbrewers Festival. Poured opaque black with a some light brown head. Both the aroma and flavor were like a cup of coffee with a decent amount of creamer in it. It drank pretty rich, and I didn’t think there was too much hop character. It was a nice beer, but it drank too much like a sweet/cream stout to rate among the good Imperial Stouts.
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottled, 355ml from Beermerchants of Kent aged 3 years. Hazy gold with white head. There is quite an aggressive hopping to this from the off, resinous, sharp and full. Bitter orange, pithy citrus notes, assertive and bittering throughout. Sweaty, fleshy fruit notes. Decent and interesting beer.
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Originally rated on 12/5/2009. Greeted by a nice citrus aroma as i opened the bottle,it pours a deep burnt cooper body with a thick massive head that left plenty of good lace. Aroma of pineapple, grapefruit, floral notes with a slight earthy hint. Flavor was a bitter blast with malts showing in the aftertaste, the taste was a little disappointing considering the nice aroma. Medium body and smooth going down, with a decent balance. Overall it was a fairly good beer.
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours a deep dark orangish amber color. Aromas of big hop action, sweet malts, and more hops. Flavor has some bready maltsy tastes with nice grapefruit and floral hop taste.
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12 oz bottle picked up at Blue Max in Burnsville, MN. Disappointed because this one has a best by date 06-12-15 and I missed it when purchased. Poured into Belgian snifter glass. Deep brandy, reddish orange color with a healthy off-white head. Nose is a little bit malty and caramel-like with a little bit of a pine hop resin undertone. Guessing this one was brighter and hoppier when fresh. Taste has a healthy dose of sweetness with citrus (mango, orange) coming through. Much more malty and bready than anticipated once again probably from the aging of the beer in the bottle. Alcohol is relatively well-hidden. Finish feels a little bit like a pine household cleaner. I’m going to try a fresher one and re-rate this one if applicable.
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12 oz bottle. Pours a dark orange color and topped by a thick layer of off white foam that shows good retention. As the foam settles thick rings of lace coat the glass. The aroma shows note of citrus and pine hops, orange and grapefruit, and a toaster caramel and toffee malt base. The flavor follows with the orange and grapefruit citrus up front to go with the caramel and toffee malts. Citrus and pine hops provide ample bitterness with a hint of resin on the back end. Medium plus body and smooth with ample carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet finish. Solid and well balanced double ipa that doesn’t get overly sweet or bitter and the alcohol is well hidden.
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Backlog from lost & found notes: The head on this was massive, it just wouldn’t quit. Hoppay aroma with flowers, grass, citrus and pine up front. Taste is pineapple, resins, mango but also a touch of yeast. Some alcohol in there also. I’m gonna find myself a fresher version and re-rate it, as I believe that there’s something fishy with this one, even if it was more than drinkable.
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);First taste of Double-Wide had an over the top bitterness dominated by Magnum hops. Like the thick pillow of foam, the bitterness ’calmed down’ as I sampled. Strong resiny pine hops dominate. Citrus and caramel flavors were given a backseat. I enjoyed this offering from the ’new’ Boulevard, unsure if what I liked was what they intended beer drinkers to like.
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);"Single bottle from HyVee, Ankeny, IA, March 2015. ""Best by 06/12/15."" Big grassy hop smell right under the cap. Foamy pour, slightly orange over a fine amber beer body. Unabashedly strong in alcohol, since I pick that up even before the hop load. And then there are the hops. Not as strong in any one hop character, but a combination of pine and resin, grassy fresh hop bitterness. I don’t catch all the fruits mentioned in the description, but I don’t have to. Actually has some balance for a Double IPA, and I hope I’m rating this higher than, say, a 90 Minute."
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Poured from the bottle of a four pack, chunky dark orange with a big foamy white collar. Lots of hops in this double wide with some citrus, got the peach and apricot flavors mostly in the 3rd and 4th beer, but the part that impressed me most was that it has a whirlpool where hops are added. I only wonder if my palate is pedestrian, because I walk around the neighborhood quite a bit (usually drunk).
Boulevard Smokestack Series: Double Wide I.P.A.;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);(Bottle) Reddish amber colour with rocky, beige head, leaving traces of lacing. Malty, fruity nose with notes of citrus, caramel, orange peel, treacle-toffee, black-currant and pink grapefruit. Malty, fruity, hoppy taste with caramel, treacle-toffee, black-currant, citrus peel, grapefruit, lychee and a generous resiny/citric bitterness in the finish. Almost full body, with a certain sweetness. Solid and well made DIPA. Despite it’s strength and bitterness it’s not aggressive, instead it’s very well balanced. Another great beer from Boulevard. Excellent stuff!
Bluegrass Old Shillelaugh Irish Stout;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout - Dry;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Pours on the red side of black with lacy beige head. The aroma is roasty coffee and some toasted nuts. The flavor is dark-roast coffee with some grainy off notes. The finish is dry and slightly tannic. Noble effort, but not so great.
Bluegrass Old Shillelaugh Irish Stout;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout - Dry;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draught. Fine black pour with some rubies on the edges and a nice tan head. The aroma is musty with a surprising hop character. I don’t mean like an IPA or anything, but there is a bit of pleasing brightness going on. Also scents of tree back, earth, coffee, and butter are noted. hm. Pretty tasty at first with adequate roast and a good chocolaty flavor. The finish is drying with acidic notes. Some diacetyl starts to come out but not too bad. It makes it tastes like cheap chocolate cake a little bit. It gets a little tougher toward the end of the glass as the buttery stickiness starts to accumulate. Still, not horrible, just not the best beer from this brewer.
Bluegrass The Daisycutter Organic IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Brown ale coloration. No read head. Sweet malty character. Sweet aroma. carbonated strong ale.
Bluegrass The Daisycutter Organic IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft at Shelbyville Road. Poured hazy copper with an average frothy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate sour citrus and sweet malt aroma. Medium body with a slick texture. Heavy bittersweet flavor with a heavy smooth bittersweet and small alcohol burn finish of long duration. A very good beer.
Bluegrass The Daisycutter Organic IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Pours dark golden amber with a mostly receding head. Aroma of grapefruit, sweet cookie and citrus, and mild note of earthy toffee. Taste is tangy and citric with earthy malt notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied and resinous with lush carbonation. Pretty nice IPA from the BBC.
Bluegrass The Daisycutter Organic IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;clear orangish amber with a great white head that lasts forever and leaves great lacing. funky earthy caramel aroma with some juicy orange notes. nice balanced bittersweet orange light pine and caramel flavor with some light nutty notes. very nice. bitter finish. medium body. lively carbonation. probably the best beer i have seen come from BBC yet! very well done! This needs to be brewed all the time!
Bluegrass The Daisycutter Organic IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Pours copper with tight ivory head. The aroma is American hops, citrus, muffin-y malt, and some floral notes. The flavor is dry, citrus hops up front along with some earthy bitterness and burnt toast. Slight maltiness works its way into the middle before a dry, botanical finish with only some faint hints of alcohol and a hint of sugary sweetness.
Bluegrass The Daisycutter Organic IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;draught. Pours a cloudy, hazy copper with a fluffy white head. The aroma is fully floral and honey sweet. It’s not too sharp, but delicate in its intricacies with suggestions of green peppers, fresh cut grass, herbal tea. Hey, this stuff is pretty tasty. It’s really clean which as we know, can be tough to pull off in this style. I’ve had a few other hoppy brews from here that haven’t been great, but this was really enjoyable. There is a strong green tea flavor with honey and a fruit bouquet like apples, grapefruit. The finish is plenty drying with pinier characteristics. Excellent balance all around and adequate cajones to boot. Mouthfeel is just slightly sticky and still enjoyable as I slurp down the last of the glass. It reminds me of a U.K. IPA in the malt department, but more of a U.S. hop profile. Nice work!
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;Tap, gold pour, white head, nose is chai, taste is chai, interesting tea plus beer here
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;July 29th, 2014 - As I stood at the counter at Central Coast Brewing, an excited young man came up and straddled the seat to my left. As I waited, he eagerly ordered several bottles of the Chai Ale to go, and as I looked around, it seemed to my slightly tipsy eye that the Cream Ale’s logo and color scheme was the plurality eye-candy in the brewpub. This, then, appeared to be Central Coast’s poster brew, and I was excited to see why. A veritable sachet of spices lies in the aroma: clove, all-spice, cinnamon, brown sugar, and everything that makes chai chai. It smells intensely of chai, and could easily be mistaken for any other kind of chai themed beverage. As for the taste, the chai tastes are subtler. The blonde ale base takes the beginning, and then the chai swells up slowly until it dominates the aftertaste. The brew is spicy, and on a thinnish palate, it has a refreshing effect, but the tastes are...strange. I like chai, and I like beer, but while the two together are novel, it’s not something I’d be champing at the bit to get a second serving of. If you’re hunting new and quirky combinations and additions to your brews, though, this is a must try.
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;Bottle from backlog. Pours clear amber with a small fizzy off-white head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving some residual and lacing. Aroma is grain, spices, cinnamon, clove. Flavor is light sweet, burst of lemon, clove, bit of lemony tartness. Medium body, interesting, not necessarily good.
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;Pours a clear deep golden color with nearly no head at all. A white ring forms and clings to the edge of the glass where it joins with the beer. A very faint aroma of tart pear emerges from the glass. Mouthfeel is wet and smooth, yielding to some carbonation scrub, and finishing a little powdery. Very mild, blended flavors. Mild clove is noted. Lightly sweet and just as lightly tart. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;Draft @ the brewery. Pours a pale yellow color with a small white head. Has a fruity spicy aroma. Fruity malty spicy creamy flavor. Has a fruity malty spicy creamy finish.
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;Clear golden pour with a white head. Slight tartness up front, but otherwise nice spice notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Some bready sweetness, water, and a grassy undertone. The flavor is a bit watery, tart, and grassy. Some good spice flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg, but overall unimpressive.
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;On tap at the brewery with my bro-in-law Mike. Great off-the-radar brewery. Was told by bartender this was their blonde ale with chai added during fermentation Nice cinnamin chai flavor. Creamy and light.
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;Bomber poured into a pint glass. Gold with a heart of orange and a fizzy cola-like off-white head. Aroma is sweet with obvious chai spices, vanilla, hay, candied citrus. Flavor is sweet as well, with a round honey malt base and a restrained chai spiciness that surprisingly doesn’t become overwhelming. At first the beer is on the cloying side but with a little warmth, some mild tea tannins come out and dry the palate without being too astringent. I wasn’t expecting much here but this beer is completely fine. The only flaw is it’s sweet and fizzy.
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;Bottle from Henry’s: Poured a sparkling golden liquid and had a fizzy short lived formation of foam. As for the aroma, I can definitely pick up on the scents of cream, green herbs, spices, and perhaps a light background of tea. The flavor is just as rewarding as the nose led me to believe because of the touches of herbs, tea, and spicing as well as a delicate usage of cream flavoring. Certainly creative and different cream recipe than made for an interesting drink since I usually don’t fancy cream ales unless their really dark in complexion.
Central Coast Chai Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Central Coast Brewing;"Draught at the brewery. A beer clothed in controversy, and possibly rightly so. Takes more of a sweet chai line than spicy, though the spice is there in a rounder, sweeter way, like a starbucks chai with plenty of sugar. But I like starbucks chai; much better than their coffee. Basic blond/cream ale base with light hops but a little more malt sweetness to carry the tea. Nice stuff."

Niewielka i krótkotrwała piana nie miała tu akurat znaczenia. Aromat wypadł dość słabo i mało intensywnie. Niby jest paloność, chmiel, ale gdzieś w głębi coś nieprzyjemnego. Podobnie w smaku. Nie mogłem pozbyć się wrażenia czegoś starego, zepsutego. Trochę nazbyt wyraźny alkohol, lekka kwaskowość i wodnistość. Coś poszło nie tak. Zdarza się...

Aromat zdominowany przez bardzo intensywna kiszona kapuste, gdzies z tylu ledwie przebija karmel, diacetyl, palone slody i ziolowo-kwiatowy chmiel. W smaku polwytrawne, intensywnie karmelowe, zbozowe i lekko palone, charakterystycznie sliskie i mleczne (diacetyl), dosc mocno kwasne. Krotko mowiac - zakazenie.

Town Hall Uber Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Slightly hazy warm copper, small skim of off-white head.

Town Hall Uber Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tried this at the 2007 Arborfest, it was served on Cask. Great hop aroma, clean start and finish, great pale ale, with a heavy hop twist.
Town Hall Uber Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pale, clear orange/amber look, under a creamy staying head, leaving lace. Nice! Interesting aroma, with orange peel spilling out first, vanilla, cream, lemon zest,...what else? Sweet, slightly spicy, and unlike anything I’ve ever encountered before. Most interesting. Taste: again, sui generis. Clean, hoppy, fairly smooth...brisk, sweet, citrusy flavor. Snappy, crisp, easy to drink...boy, I’ve had these hops in other Euro-brews before, but maybe not in this combination, or with these malts. I can’t get over how unusual this is! Mouthfeel/texture is a bit of a wrangle, though...very odd, takes some getting used to, for sure. Sticky herbal hops cling to the palate, citrus and spice hang on...there’s a long finish, that eventually dries. Drinkability, though, is a breeze...getting over that unique play on the tongue is easier than I thought...so easy to swallow! Dang, this is good!

Town Hall Uber Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Enjoyed at Town Hall on 4/30/07. This is a a break from the usual for Town Hall. The aroma of this beer is fairly light on the hops. There is rotting fruit, and some hops. There is also something here that doesn’t smell so good, but I can’t nail down exactly what it is, but what is more weird is it works with the beer overall. Flavor is bone dry. This is not excessively hopped, but what is there is bitter, and a light flavor of lemongrass enhances this dryness. Overall I like it; I am always happy to see Town Hall do something different. This beer could use some adjustment, but overall it is good."

Stewart 80/-;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stewart Brewing;Gravity cask at the 2019 Bedford Beer Festival. Mahogany and incredibly thin-looking. Flat. Bit nutty, malty scent, hints of spiced orange peel and carbo. Taste carries a gorgeous balance, with the sweetness paired with the sweet/bitter/sour interplay of overripe tangerine, and finishing with a hint of hazelnut. Flat as a pancake, but it was always gonna be. Nice.

Stewart 80/-;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stewart Brewing;Cask at Bow Bar. Pours clear deep amber. Aroma is slight caramel and pine needles, also rose petals. Body is full but not heavy, rather sweetly painted over background bitterness. Still malt forward with toasted flavours, all gentle and smooth. Usually characteristics I rather don't like, but here they harmonise perfectly. Dryish palate, but actually developing the full flavour profile only there. Outstanding for a bitter!

An interesting, complex palate, but a stout?
Allagash Hugh Malone;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Allagash Brewing Company;Bottle dated as 15 months old, so might be slightly past its prime. Pours hazy straw color with a 3-finger white head. Fruity aroma mixed with a pine note. Maybe some earthiness from the yeast. Medium body. Finish is long and dry, maybe a touch of astringency. Piney hops flavor with a touch of resin. Earthy note at the back.

Allagash Hugh Malone;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Allagash Brewing Company;Thanks altonbrownd for the bottle! Poured into a snifter showing well filtered golden yellow with a finger of quickly dissipating clean white foam. The nose shows strong Belgian yeast influence with light pine hops around the edges. The palate is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Flavors of Belgian yeasty forwardness and light bready malts ending on a moderate hoppy and tea-like astringent bitterness. Somewhat out of place but it’s alright.

Allagash Hugh Malone;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Allagash Brewing Company;Pour is a cloudy looking yellow with a large white head. Aroma is a nice fruity hop with some esters in the back to let you know this is not a typical IPA. Flavor is more of a fruity hop. Not much of the Belgian yeast shows up in the flavor. More grapefruit hops are left on the tongue as this goes down. Decent IPA I just wish more of the yeast came out to play.
Allagash Hugh Malone;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Allagash Brewing Company;Thought I had rated this before, guess not? Bottled 7.21.16..pours a medium golden yellow color with a slim white filly head atop..nose is really solid with that Belgian yeast essence and some pineapple..bottle neck sums this up well, fruit and pine hop notes balanced with Belgian style yeast esters, a very nice representation of the style, has some alcohol legs to it that are disguised well at first, but linger post sip..
Allagash Hugh Malone;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Allagash Brewing Company;"Purchased at Bottles and Cans in Chicago, IL; enjoyed at home while nervously flipping between Bears/Packers and NLCS game 5. This is a good beer to be nervous with. Appearance is pale yellow with a rich frothy white head. Aroma is abundant with citrus, orange peel, grapefruit, lot going on. Taste is equally good, goes down bitter and tart, rich in lemon notes, light ale yeast. Really good one here."
Allagash Hugh Malone;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Allagash Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle, consumed on 10-7-16. Bottled on 07/20/16. I’d say 3 months is the cutoff for a typical IPA, so I’m pushing it a bit with this one, but it should be alright. Pours a hazy yellow to dirty gold with a small to moderate amount of creamy, beige head. Not the most attractive appearance but not problematic. The final pour, however, is quite cloudy and produces a large amount of creamy, cream-colored head and pretty good lacing. Ends up looking much better than it did in the initial pour. Fresh smell features scents of melon and lemons. The Belgian-esque esters and hops combine to produce a heavily citric aroma. Lemon peel and grapefruit scents. Tame, subdued, dry flavor. Slightly chemical, although it’s not entirely clear whether that quality derives from the yeast or the hops. Quite dry in the sense of lacking in sweetness but not actively drying in the palate. Disappointingly low in flavor. Lively and frothy in the palate. Medium body. I’ll write something that I didn’t expect at all to write about an Allagash Belgian IPA: Bland!
Stumpys Old Stumpy;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stumpys Brewery;Bottle. Murky yellow appearance which was not a good start. Bitter but no others flavours present. Not a lot going for this one.

Clear dark ruby red in colour with a creamy white head. Soft bramble fruit in the short aroma. Good creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a strong fruit base with dark plums and ripe bramble evident. Moist earthy notes present in the short hoppy aftertaste.

Sulwath John Paul Jones;Castle Douglas, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sulwath Brewers;Cask (handpump) at Great British Beer Festival, day 4 on 5 August 2011. Quite a dark coloured bitter - deep copper with a ruby tinge. Some berry fruit in the aroma. More nutty, with a touch of toffee, on the palate. More malt than hops but not too sweet - finishes rather dry in fact. There’s also a slightly tart, vinous quality here. Quite tasty and interesting, especially for the relatively low strength, even if I usually prefer a bit more bite and hop grip in my bitters.

It was named Standing Order Red Ale on the pumpclip, so I wonder why it is not red???
Sulwath Standing Order;Castle Douglas, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sulwath Brewers;Sparkler’s white head. Hazy golden ale of strong posture with more alcohol notes than most and a full, but airy body. Sweet cerealic notes are all over the place, accompanied by muted banana undertones. Floral hop range is kept to a minimum all along, leaving the pureed impression more important. A big bowl of cereals.
Sulwath Standing Order;Castle Douglas, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sulwath Brewers;Standing Order. Who knows how this place manages to get through so much ale that 2 brewerys make ale for it. Aroma is tart fruit, hints at sourness, yeasty and malty. Taste is similar buttery sourness, really just badly kept beer in all aspects.

Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;On tap @ Maduro, Bells GTMW pre-party 8/10/07. Cloudy light orange golden with a quickly fading white head. Aroma has lots of orange, white pepper, alcohol, and a bit of leather. Flavor had lots of ripe orange pulp an coriander, white pepper, and the leather became more apparent as it warmed. Light carbonation with a medium body--masked the alcohol better than the Right Bank. Good beer--more like an imperial wit?
Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;Bells Left Bank [b]Draft at Maduro’s during GTMW weekend[/b] Cloudy orange gold color.

Nice mouthfeel.
Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;Draft. Poured a clear light orange color. Head was white and one finger high. A bit of lace was left behind on the glass. Smelled of orange, coriander, a splash of alcohol, and subdued clove. Not unlike the aroma of a strong wit beer.Sweet on the tongue with orange marmalade, clove, and flower blossom flavors. There was also a slight earthy/leathery note and mild hop bitterness. Interesting beer. Similar to some Belgian IPA’s I’ve tried.
Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;tap at maduro. weird note i wrote: have you heard of this. super mint ginger aroma. tastes wonderful. a bit of a tripel.
Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;On tap at Maduro for the GTMW pre party Murky flat yellow with a touch of white head. This is very much a corriander experiment. The nose has a spicy nose with a pinch of citrus. Again in the flavor, tons of spicy citrus flavor. Sort of a lighter body, yet fluffy on the palate. Nice but a touch one dimensional.
Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;On tap at Maduro – GTMW pre-party. Poured hazy medium golden with just a short cap of white head sticking around. Aroma picked up heavy banana, bubblegum, and cloves upfront, with toasty banana and more spices moving outward.. well put-together, strong, and enticing. In the flavor, sweet, lightly-toasted banana and sour wheaty notes abound.. some sharper diacetyl notes make an appearance, especially across the middle.. decent balance between the sweet and sour notes. Little too strong on the palate overall with the diacetyl detracting a bit.. long, warm impression. Tasty stuff!
Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;On tap at Maduro’s Thanks to whomever shared half a pint of this with me. Otherwise there is no way I would have possibly finished my Wedding Ale as well. This is apparently one of the test batches for Batch 8000 so once it is gone I don’t think you should expect to run across it except by sheer luck. If the Batch 8000 is this good though I will savor every bottle. Aroma / Appearance - Creamy orange scents remind me of a Belgian wit ale with a bright open aroma. The yeasty background plays nicely against the fruity characteristics. The body appears to be almost identical to the Right Bank and Batch 8000 pours - dark orange with a minimal head. Flavor / Palate - Orange, wheat and a trace amount of rye bread create a fruity playful mouthfeel. It reminds me of a Belgian wit with more bite than normal. I found it a tad on the rich side but yet still attractive. If I was just going to kick back and not rate anything the rest of the night I would have been content with these.
Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;Tap at Maduro pre-GTMW party. The beer pours to a murky straw orange colored body with no head.

Bell's Left Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;"On tap at the Eccentric Cafe. The closest fit for this beer appears to be American Wheat; witbier characteristics were absent. Poured a clearish, lifeless orange with no head. Strong clove aroma with sugary malts, toast, and alcohol. Heavy body dominated by clove with light banana, sweet toasts, and caramel. Lingering clove finish with modest alcohol bite. About what I expected from the short description. So-so."

Master Tmavý 18°;Pilsen, Czech Republic;Bock - Doppelbock;Plzeňský Prazdroj (Asahi);Auch dieses Master-Bier habe ich bereits 2014 getrunken. Damals hat mich der süßes EInschlag und das Aroma nach Rumtopf irritiert. So schmeckt kein Dunkles bzw. Schwarzes aus Tschechien. Die Einstufung als übertrieben süßen deutschen Doppelbock kann ich gutheißen -das muss man halt mögen. Ich kenne eigentlich keinen Tschechen, dem so etwas schmeckt, aber es wird wohl einen Markt geben bzw. gegeben haben (ich habe es schon lange in keinem Supermarkt gefunden).

Dugges QuarlasAle (ETS 75 år);Landvetter, Sweden;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dugges Bryggeri;Draught, Dugges brewery. Beautiful off-white cover tops the orangey beach sand coloured hue. Hoppy, spicy and rather woody nose reminds of avenyn, but got sweetish hay-like nuances that I did not find in the former. It feels spicier as well - fuggles, and sweeter, perhaps juicier ultimately, orange earthiness. Made for easy-drinking. Efficient, cleansing carbonation invites to the next sip. Well if I had had that as the University’s staple beer, I’d have spent more time at school.
Dugges QuarlasAle (ETS 75 år);Landvetter, Sweden;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dugges Bryggeri;(Draught) Pours hazy brown orange.

Balans Bräu Beyaz (Weissbier / White);Istanbul, Turkey;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Balans Bräu;Draft - served in their lager glass. An unclear dark golden beer with a thin white head - wonder how to get that small a head on a Weizen. The aroma has light notes of wheat and cloves. The flavor is sweet with notes of wheat and dusty hops as well as lighter notes of cloves, leading to a dry wheaty finish. Boring.
Balans Bräu Beyaz (Weissbier / White);Istanbul, Turkey;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Balans Bräu;Draft @ brewpub. Pale, bright hazy yellow. White foamy head is pretty long-lasting. Aroma is distinctly rotting fruit, smells like a garbage disposal. Low carbonation, thin palate. Tastes better than it smells. Lots of citrus and the tartness is inoffensive. If it weren’t for the aroma this would not be a bad beer.
Balans Bräu Beyaz (Weissbier / White);Istanbul, Turkey;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Balans Bräu;Cloudy yellow. Banana aroma but with footy off-notes. Sweet, watery body with light pedio taste. Slight tartness in the finish.

Balans Bräu Special (Pilsener);Istanbul, Turkey;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Balans Bräu;Draugha at the brewpub as Pilsener. Yellow/pale golden coloured, small white head that went away slowly, light malty nose. Grainy, light bready and watery with pretty strong stale acidic finish and aftertaste. 4€ for nothing.

Balans Bräu Special (Pilsener);Istanbul, Turkey;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Balans Bräu;Draft. A dark golden beer with a white head. The aroma has notes of malt and lighter notes of Bamberg smoke. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of smoke - which comes as a bit surprise to me, when it was listed as a Pilsener on the board, but it also has malty notes, leading to a dry smokey finish. A good thirstquencher. I asked the bartender and he told me they did use smoked malt for this beer.
Balans Bräu Special (Pilsener);Istanbul, Turkey;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Balans Bräu;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden colour, sparkling. Small stable white head. Fizzy mouthfeel and mildly grainy flavour. Very bland. Does not taste microbrewed at all, more like macro swill.

Balans Bräu Special (Pilsener);Istanbul, Turkey;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Balans Bräu;Draft @ brewpub. Hazy yellow-gold with nice white head. Decent head retention. Sour aroma is not all bad, just fruit tang. Low carbonation, is nearly flat. Lots of fruity flavors, esp citrus. Drinks easily enough for not being a very good beer.
Balans Bräu Special (Pilsener);Istanbul, Turkey;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Balans Bräu;Hazy straw colour. Footy-funky aroma. Relatively flat. Light straw taste, probably too much acidity. Goes down easy, though.
Balans Bräu Special (Pilsener);Istanbul, Turkey;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Balans Bräu;"On tap at the brewpub in Istanbul. Pours a hazy, glowing golden yellow color with a small, foamy white head. The foam is quickly fleeting, and soapy lacing mostly rejoins the body. The nose is heavy on bready yeast, with a pungent, sourdough type note. Floral hops are weak to hardly distinguishable, with just a hint of a spice note. Flavors follow suit, with pungent grains and yeast balanced by faint floral hops. Moderate in both body and carbonation. This beer doesn’t leave much of an impression on me, it’s just kind of ""blah""."
Balans Bräu Special (Pilsener);Istanbul, Turkey;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Balans Bräu;Draught at the brewpub. Hazy yellow, small head. Medium bodied with rounded, spritzy mouthfeel. Grainy with very light spicy hops. Quite mellow with low bitterness. A quite messy beer without much pilsener characteristics.
Balans Bräu Special (Pilsener);Istanbul, Turkey;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Balans Bräu;[i] 50cl glass from the Balans Brau brewery tap 21-01-07 taken from travel diary notes [/i] I added this brewpub to places on the 24th January and I’m pleased to see that its had a couple more visitors since and that the beers that I had have been added. These were my last two beers of the night and of my time in Turkey my notes read ’soft, easy drinking, cloudy yellow unfiltered beer’ (amusingly for both beers)The reason I didn’t rate this at the time was I was unsure whether the beers I had were one and the same (see notes on place) and I had to write the type of the beer down in Turkish I had written Special and Kristal for each one as thats what I was told they were, but hoped that someone else in a less wobbly state could add them better than I did.

Deinze Export;Deinze-Gottem, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Huisbrouwerij Sint Canarus;(Bottled) Slightly hazy yellow-golden with a small, frothy and lacy head. Herby-honeyish hops and buttery, pale malt in the aroma. Pale-alty, slightly cardboardy flavor with hints of buttery diacetyl and herby hops. Medium body with pretty soft carbonation. Quite surprising to see this kind of beer from Sint Canarus. This one didn’t have a BBE date, but calculating from the amount of dust in the bottle, it wasn’t the freshest sample. Drinkable, but not something you’d want to have while in Belgium.
Weyerbacher Muse;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;This is a backlog rating from 2009 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time.

The taste is sweet orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit, metal, hay, straw and dough. Light-medium body and moderate carbonation. Too thin and a bit too much sweetness. Balance is not great either...

Hopfenstark Framboise;Lavaltrie, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Hopfenstark;Elle est blonde-rosée et limpide ayant un mince voile à sa surface. Des arômes de papier mouillé et de framboises qui semblent trop mûres. En bouche, c’est acidulé et suret sur les bords. Des épices mêlées à une effervescence prononcée semblent brouiller les cartes. Par moment, une impression de blé courtise les papilles. Légère déception quand même.(860-181013)
Hopfenstark Framboise;Lavaltrie, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Hopfenstark;Plutôt pâle, couleur or blanc, elle laisse échapper des notes assez puissantes de framboises, tel que prévu. Douce en bouche malgré une petite pointe acidulée, elle n'envahit pas avec ses fruits, et si elle a un petit côté aqueux, elle emploie bien ce fait en étant désaltérante. Pas mal du tout pour uke fruitée, mais elle ne soulève pas les passions.
Hopfenstark Framboise;Lavaltrie, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Hopfenstark;750 ml bottle. Pours a pinkish whitish orange with a short lasting white head. Aroma is sugar, field berry, but mostly, raspberry.

Three Rivers Raspberry Imperial Stout;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Draft: Penetrable black. Jagged, big-bubbled grayish foam quickly diminishes. Fairly attractive nose of cocoa-dusted raspberries, black licorice, dark chocolate, and raisins. Briskly prickly carbonic sting. Rounded fruit-derived acidity gently puckers the palate and is softened by moist hints of tobacco. Velvety chocolate and gritty char deepen the fruitiness. Pungently earthy roast stop just short of becoming grainy. Metallic zing of malt enhances the bright acidity of the fruit. Finishes bittersweet and softly chocolaty, yet slightly crunchy with char and black chocolate. A straightforward rendition but well-structured and surprisingly vibrantly fruity.

Concord Extra-Pale Honey Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Concord Brewery;Flat hazy golden pour that remains completely headless. Powerful honey nose, thus sugary and tartish. At the same time, its hops are rather floral and it makes a weird mix with the acidity. It never grows more complex than that and the lazy attenuation ensures the residual sugariness in high enough levels to leave a stale film in the mouth as you swallow. Poor.

Nimbus Belgian Gold;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Nimbus Brewing Company;"This beer sits in my pint glass with a fully hazy, straw-gold color and is topped by a wispy, off-white colored head that barely covers the beer. This beer has an aroma that is predominantly made up of fruit aromatics and an earthy spiciness, which makes me think of the Chimay yeast strain. There is a fair amount of sweetness in the flavor, though it is not enough to keep this from being light and quaffable. The sweetness accentuates some fruit notes of pear and a touch of green apple. There is also a light, lemon-like zestiness to the flavor as well as an unrelated, yet accentuating, touch of tartness. There is some malt sweetness that leans towards simple grain accents, but there is something else (definitely fermentation derived) that seems to be upping the sweetness here; it works here and seems to be almost saccharine like in some ways. The mouthfeel has a certain fullness to it, which somehow works in a beer of this gravity. There are some grassy grain flavors here, and I would bet that the hops also add to these flavors. A definite underlying earthy note and a low level of spicing are just perceptible as well. This has really hit the spicing almost perfectly; there is nothing that hits you over the head with its obviousness. This is actually quite nice, and I am much more impressed than I was expecting."

I rated it with a friend of mine, Robert, and we said ""Very sweet caramel nose - not for the toffee nosed!"" I have drunk it a couple of times since in the bottle, but this is the first time I’ve tried it in the cask. It was bought for me by aceofhearts on a quick visit to London. The beer is comforting and syrupy and fruity. Rather average really."

Bornholms Middelaldercenter Stormands mjød;Borup, Denmark;Mead;Søbogaard;(Ceramic bottle 75 cl) Courtesy of yespr. Pours a hazy, pale amber - no head. Spicy, alcoholic nose. Very full-bodied and rather acidic fruit notes combined with pleasant honey notes. That tartness is really somewhat unusual but quite interesting. 180907
Bornholms Middelaldercenter Stormands mjød;Borup, Denmark;Mead;Søbogaard;Cloudy golden color. Aroma of glue, ethanol, cherries in brandy, hence a bit fruity. Medium sweetness (for a Mead), with a very nice touch of sweet herbs (like the Alpine herbs), a bit spicy and fruity. At the end the alcohol is very warming. It reminds me some Alpine herbs liquors, a bit more honeyish. Very good.
Bornholms Middelaldercenter Stormands mjød;Borup, Denmark;Mead;Søbogaard;Bottle. Pours am deep orange colour. sweet honey spiced fruitish alco aroma. The flavour is sweet with honey, spices, alcohol and alcohol. Spiced sweet finish. Quite a pleasant mead. Tak Jesper.

Aso Farmland White Ale;Aso, Kumamoto-ken, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Aso Farmland Brewery;Heavily carbonated, fizzy with a thin white head. Fairly standard hazy golden color. Fruity, bubble-gum aroma. Sweet and fruity candy-like flavors. Not too much depth or complexity. Decent, but not very interesting. Light, slightly sticky mouthfeel. An alright white ale, but nothing special.
Aso Farmland Rice Ale;Aso, Kumamoto-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Aso Farmland Brewery;It pours a light gold with a soapy head of white foam. It has a really fragrant floral, peppery & lightly grainy aroma. Really summery. Round raspy carbonation with a fairly soft light body. The taste is very crisp, light malts, bright green noble hops - this is a really nice lager-ish the beer.
Aso Farmland Rice Ale;Aso, Kumamoto-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Aso Farmland Brewery;Bottle from the brewery. Smells very sweet and is reminiscent of a japanese macro beer. Guess that’s the rice thing. Bit fruity too. Taste is alright. Honey, sweetness, light grassy hop bitterness, bit grainy. I’d rather drink it than most of the macros, but that’s not really saying so much.
Aso Farmland Rice Ale;Aso, Kumamoto-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Aso Farmland Brewery;Bottle, mail order from the brewery. Malty, fruity nose. Honey, bread, rice, sweet orange, light apricots. Deep gold with a low, fine head. Sweet, fruity flavor. Bready and grainy, with biscuit, orange, peach, honey. Cereals come though but not particularly rice. There is a slight Belgian spiciness coming from the yeast. Not bad at all. Cleanly made and drinkable, though less than exciting.
Aso Farmland Rice Ale;Aso, Kumamoto-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Aso Farmland Brewery;Slightly hazy golden brown color, white diminishing head. Aroma of barley, rice, and a slight bready sweetness. Rice-dominated flavors along with barley malt, hops, and a caramel-like sweetness. Crisp and light palate, finishes very dry. Interesting but nothing special.
Ferme Bourgeois Farms Belliveau;Memramcook, New Brunswick, Canada;Apple Cider;Verger Belliveau;Bouteille verte, avec bouchon de plastique, de 750 ml reçu en cadeau de la part de mes parents. Arôme: Très légère odeur de pomme. Apparence: La couleur est presque translucide avec une moyenne densité de bulle. Saveur: Léger goût de pomme verte. Durée moyenne de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture minérale. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. (Rating #2187)
Ferme Bourgeois Farms Belliveau;Memramcook, New Brunswick, Canada;Apple Cider;Verger Belliveau;750 ml bottle. Dark golden colour with a fully diminishing fizzy white head. Sweet brown sugar, caramel, and apple aroma. Caramelized but not overly sweet apple flavour with a lightly woody background character. Medium bodied, lively carbonation but very refreshing. Surprising complexity for a 5% abv cider - almost has some ice cider character.
Mad Anthony Cherry Bomb;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of tan colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated dark orange colored body. The almost non-existant aroma was malty. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of malt hops cherry and semi-sweet. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.
Mad Anthony Cherry Bomb;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Tap at MABC in FW, In. Off-whte small head that was mostly lasting with a fair amount of lacing, transparent, visible carbonation, and an orange-golden hue. Nose was semi-sweet, cherries and a hint of malt. Flavor was semi-sweet, cherries and dry. Smooth, dry mouthfeel. Light body. Too one-dimensional IMO and lacks character.
Mad Anthony Cherry Bomb;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On tap in FTW: Deep golden hue with a small fading head and okay lace. The aroma has a light cherry juice character along with biscuity and grainy malt and a hint of dusty yeast esters. The taste a very faint hit of cherry but more basic sweet and toffee malts with no bitterness or acidic bite. The mouth feel is initially sharp but fades to a thin nothingness followed by a weird medical aftertaste. WHERE ARE THE CHERRIES? An udder disappointment to say the least.
Mad Anthony Cherry Bomb;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Tap at MA. Strong cherry aroma on the artificial side. Reddish amber with a small head. Strong sweet-tart cherry flavor - slighly cloying. Light hops and artificial cherry finish. Liked the tartness of the beer but didn’t like the artificial cherry.
Mad Anthony Cherry Bomb;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;tap at the brewpub - Pours an orange-ish color with a minimal head. The aroma is very mild and sweet. It tastes of sweet maltiness and a subdued cherry flavor. The body is thin to medium. It’s not a bad quaff by any means, but I would have liked more of... something. This is the right time of year for a sweet, easy drinking brew though, and it’s always nice to see MA roll out another new one.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;Sample at Atlantic Beer Festival Moncton. Clear amber color, medium white head. Aroma of vanilla and caramel. Taste is malt forward with a bit of vanilla. Not bad.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;Clear amber/brown pour with a fairly minimal head that has a bit of retention. The nose on this has more brown sugar than maple with some underlying grainy character. The grain stands out more on the palate and then leads into a lightly brown sugar and maple note with a bittersweet finish. Very unremarkable, but at least it’s not as sweet as a lot of these maple beers tend to be.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;Amber pour with a thin head. Strong maple aroma. Very sweet, almost too sickly. Really get the maple from this but you can?t have everything.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;I love maple. I’m the biggest maple fan I know so I’m probably overrating this by a large margin. It’s not over the top maple but it’s there and it is nice.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;Location: Draft at a restaurant in Saint John, 7/6/13 Aroma: The nose is malty, with some maple notes, and a bit of hops as well Appearance: The pour is an amber color, on the darker side, with a tan head to it Flavor: The taste is medium sweet, but it keeps clear of getting past that, and light bitter Palate: The body is medium, it has a mild stickiness, and solid mouthfeel Overall Impression: I was expecting an over-the-top sweet beer, but this one turned out to be surprisingly tasty. This exceeded my expectations.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;341 ml bottle from ABNL. Pours a nearly clear orange/amber with small whiteish head. Aroma is maple, caramel, wood and grains. Flavour is moderately sweet maple, toasty caramel, vanillaish wood and bready grains. Soft mouthfeel. I’ve often thought these maple beers are a bit of a gimmick but this strikes a nice balance between actually delivering some maple flavour and being sickly sweet.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;341ml bottle. Pours the colour of light maple syrup, moderate, slightly tan head. Filtered. Aroma is faintly maple with some toffee and bread. Taste is pretty much the same, medium bodied. Overall, this was a solid amber ale with a hint of maple sweetness added. Glad they didn’t go overboard and make it sickeningly sweet. Probably the best of the Atlantic Canadian maple beers I’ve had.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;Pours a brown amber color with a white lacing head. Aroma of maple and brown sugar with a bit of hops. Mouthfeel is pretty hoppy with some definate sugar sweetness. Finish is also very sweet. Overall pretty decent
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;Had on tap at the brewpub in Moncton. nose is maple syrup and malts brownish color with some white lacing. flavor is maple but not overpowering maple. some malt some toffee. reading other ratings i am betting they changed the recipe for the better.
Pump House Maple Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;Tap at Vices & Versa. Cloudy brown body with a very small beige head. Some berries in the aroma along with dirty wet cloth, also evoking kitty litter. Taste is certainly not what I expected from a maple beer. A weird mix of brown cake, butterscotch, white grapes (?!?) along some unidentified rotten fruits. As much as I was trying to relate to usual beer flavours I could only come-up with unusual flavours. I even thought the beer was a bit meaty in a sea-fish kind of way. Not as bad as I make it sound to be but not a whole lot better either. Maybe it was a bad keg. The pint I had was about as recommendable as a piranha blowjob.
Bullfrog East Kent Pale Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - English;Bullfrog Brewery;Their Kent hop . Lacey with noticeable head, some hops in there. Malty. OK cask beer. Floral and herby hops, and some sticky candy there.
Bullfrog East Kent Pale Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - English;Bullfrog Brewery;"Growler, courtesy of LordMaynard. Thanks, Russ! Even after two+ weeks in the growler, this pours beautifully: a clear, golden-orange color; fluffy, off-white head with great retention and lacing that coats the inside of the glass. Plenty of citrusy bitterness in the aroma; English-style bittering with some candy sugar malt underneath. Medium mouthfeel: citrus and English-style hops upfront; lively carbonation; well-balanced with a candy sugar and maple syrup maltiness. Very drinkable and tasty, like a hopped-up ESB. Nice, dry dose of floral and citrus hops on the finish."
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Draft at Tyler’s taproom Raleigh. Pouts orange and muddled with a thin head that disappears quickly. Nice orange aroma. A tad sweet on the tongue but that’s just the orange coming through. Finishes clean. A real easy drinker that hides it alcohol well. Certainly the best Big Boss I’ve tried so far.
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;very nice on Tap at the Marriott downtown. Like a session beer but clearly Belgian oily sweet, hints of spice, slightly cloudy light amber with no head but pleasant odor.
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Pint @ Tyler’s Apex. Good aroma, sweet & sour, spice too. Yeasty, seltzer kind of sharpness , little corniness about it, hints of orange and/or grapefruit. Touch of haze, golden yellow, cleared as it sat. Ok head, minor to no lace. Bittersweet flavor still a yeasty streak, banana kicks in, though I’m still getting some corn about it. Thick body, creamy oily mouthfeel, bitter sweet finish, Little rough around the finish. Tasty, though I wasn’t diggin the corn I got out of aroma, didn’t effect flavor as much. Didn’t stand out for me.
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Draught at Tylers in Durham. Pours a hazy golden color with a frothy white head. Great notes of sweet wheat. Aroma is quite good as well. Tastes of cotton candy. Finishes with a great sweet taste, yet not to sugary.
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;"Rating #1800, growler, sampled at the 1st Annual Shenandoah Beer Throwdown, courtesy of wilkie. Thanks, Chris! Fittingly enough, this was my final rating of the weekend. Pours a hazy, golden-orange hue; white head with fine-bubbled lacing. Lots of cloves, bananas, and breadiness in the aroma; solid witte nose. Lively carbonation; medium mouthfeel: lots of bananas, caramelized sugar, and cloves, with some warming alcohol / roughness coming through; some astringency. Medium finish: bananas, brown sugar, and toasted malts."
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Poured at Milltown. Pours a soft yellow gold with a one finger white head. Doesn’t look like a Belgian White, filtered maybe? The nose is a little sweet, some citrus, alcohol, a little bit of wheat and yeast imprint. Not as big as I would like it to be. The flavor is similar, a little warm, some orange, sweet, not much yeast or wheat flavor. Tastey.
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Wow... awesome beer. Also had this at the brewpub, with Ryan and Chris, while playing photohunt. We didn’t know you could get the adult version until we were done. Bogus.
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Draught at woodys in downtown raleigh--a while ago...found this on a machine washed receipt) Pours golden, hazy, with small white head. Aroma is yeasty, with citrus and spice, orange peel? lemon? Flavor is earthy, yeasty, and a little pepper in malt. Slight alcohol in aftertaste, but not too much.
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Growler thanks to Turdferguson. Thanks Sam! This was surprising for a double wit. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a thin lasting head- but lower carbonation that it should have since it was a growler. Aroma is actually very similar to a saison- im curious as to what yeast strain they used. Lots of spicy phenolics, pepper, dandelion tea, orange and lemon in the very background. More green pepper flavor, lgith doughy yeast, cream of wheat, light phenols, some vanilla and a whispy doughy finihs. Nice double white for sure, but I wanna say if they used some kind of saison yeast, this falls more into a saison than a double wit. Would be interested to try fresh on tap with a high carbonation.
Big Boss Belle Wringer Double Wit;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Hazy yellow-gold color with a minimal head. Aroma is big, sweet, & spicy - lots of orange peel, coriander, and assorted spices. Flavor is sweet with citrus, banana, pepper, wheat, and earthy spice. Nice tingle as it goes down. Unique - I would put this one above Southampton’s Double White
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;120z bottle from Willow Ben (Tampa, FL). Pours a hazy lemon color with clearly visible chunky particulates and a creamy foamy white head. Aroma is sweet and floral with notes of citrus, lemon, honey, yeast, grain, orange, tangerine, light caramel, floral esters. Flavor is essentially the same with some stronger honey and fruity notes. Light to medium body with a floral finish.
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company, Ltd.--White Ale--1998 12 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV (2.75 / 5.0) Wit--Very light cloudy color. Orange peel, coriander, and pepper spiced. Spice is not overdone. More malt body would enrich spice.
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a hazy golden body. Lemon grass, wheat with a light citrus note and a clove and grain y finish. Decent.
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;(bottle). Pours a cloudy yellow color with particles floating. Medium white head which is mostly diminishing. Wheaty aroma. Wheat flavor with light citrus. Avg duration. Thin texture. Soft carbonation. Spare lacing.
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;To use an semi-old term. This stuff is da bomb. Pours a cloudy yellow with particles in the liquid looking suspended in air. Best part is the great, smooth taste. I was leery of this beer for no reason..turned out to be a super choice.
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;"Bottle. Pours like a wheat that is a little past its prime. Kind of a gush of fizz somewhere in the middle of the pour and then it dies back quickly. I’m a little concerned as I look at the highly carbonated pale liquid, but aromas don’t seem too offensive, so I take a sip. My buddy from Bozeman insists that this was a right of passage when growing up... so how bad can it be, even after the brewery sold out or whatever the deal was? Aromas are fairly nondescript: a little bit of wheat, grass, spice and maybe even citrus. Flavor is about the same. The carbonation is a little obnoxious, but I can’t deduct since it is probably my fault for delaying on a ""summer wheat"" until the snow flies in November. The flavor doesn’t seem to have deteriorated at all... it’s just not that interesting."
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Phenolic wheaty lemon aroma. Thin small head on pale straw colored beer, small dark chunks of yeast floating. Mmmm citrus lemon flavors up front with lingering dry sour (in a good way) phenolic wheat finish. Clove flavors remain in the background and lemon not orange dominates. Nice mouth feel spritzie well carbed, too style. Overall very drinkable, big bonus for all biers in my opinion, balanced but tart. Just what you’re expecting from a Belgian style witbier. Note: This is one of the better bottled witbiers I’ve had. I suspect I got fresh bottles of this, as Hoegardden is a favorite, but it’s really suffering by the time it reaches my supermarket shelf!
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Bottle, from total wine. Pours a gold color with a fair head. Pretty average white beer. Aromas of fruit, yeast, biscuit. Flavor is typical of the style and not anytihng amazing. But easy to drink for sure.
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;More or less true to style, slightly spicier than expected. Metallic notes a bit stronger than desired, taste is a little thin, lame head. Flawed but far from a pour-out, would not recommend.
Spanish Peaks Summer White;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;The Spanish Peaks Summer White is a culinary experiment in brewing, taking on many of the qualities of pub grub rather than the actual pub’s beer. The regular, well bubbled white head takes up a medium volume, with the melted butter golden brown beer sitting peacefully below. Likewise, the aroma effuses with the smell of butter in the pan, along with a pinch of black pepper, a squeeze of lemon juice, the delicious oils of white fish, frying batter and even some friend corn chips. Really, there’s a lot of gustatory flavors present. The taste is, to my delight, a perfect match of the aroma, exhibiting all the tastes of a good buttered up and fried dish. Very French and Southern. The only negative is a very busy palate which blockades rather than assists the flavors. But still, this is a wonderfully different white beer, and one that could be a daily staple for your friend food fanatics.
The Covey Dunkleweizen;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;Pours a dull dark brown-grey with a foamy head. Aroma is sharp and wheaty with clove and vanilla. Taste is all the typical d-weizen elements: clove, banana, vanilla, sweet wheat, light pepper. Taste of unsweetened cocoa or chocolate malt is strong, possibly more than I’d prefer. Gets cloying toward the end. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, typical wheat texture. Overall, in the range of a Franziskaner Dunkel.
Gampertbräu Förster-Gold;Weissenbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Gampertbräu;Bottle @ Gotha. Pours clear golden with a white head. Straw, grass and slight marzipan. Smooth and soft with a short bitter herbal finish. Okay

Gampertbräu Förster-Gold;Weissenbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Gampertbräu;Bottle thanks to ErlangerNick. Prost my friend. Clear pale gold colour lasting white head. Lemon hop aroma. Tastes a bit like an export beer. Yes quite light but some sweetness from the abv. Nettle lemon hoppy beer. Rather light and refreshing. A little harsh maybe. Bit too carbonated. Decent.

Hop Back Maypole Axed;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Community Centre, Frodsham 25/05/2001 Light coloured and hoppy with a bitter finish.
Hop Back Maypole Axed;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Draught (St. Urho’s, Helsinki) Light yellow, light head. Odd savoury aroma, some yeastiness, some apples and some oddness. Taste is similar, but without the apples. Some odd brown mush of flavours, dominated by the bitterness which leaves an unpleasant 1-dimensional bitter aftertaste. Hop Back can do far better.
Hop Back Maypole Axed;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Cask@Black Door Pale yellow color, small steady white head. Honeyish-hoppy aroma, some homemade booze notes (old cask?). Light palate. Honeyish flavor, touch of hops in the finish. Thirst-quencher.
Hop Back Maypole Axed;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Cask@Ealing BF. Very light. Texture is grainy and thin, with some lightly earthy citric hops in the finish. Not much happening to be honest, but i guess its drinkable. If a bit boring.
Hop Back Maypole Axed;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;"Cask @ ""The Wharf"", Aalborg. Golden in colour with a white head. Clear. The aroma is of spicy hop and a bit of yeast. The flavor is of bitter hops and malt that lingers."
Hop Back Maypole Axed;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask. Golden colour with lots of floaters. Slight sulphur in the nose. Citric and wheaty flavour that has reasonable balance. Boring.
Hop Back Maypole Axed;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Half pint gravity fed from the cask at the Ealing Beer Festival, a slight haze to the golden colour with a white bubbly head. A pungent malt aroma with a hint of fruit. The palate was smooth with a bitter finish that was a little tart. There wasn’t much flavour, just a basic ale - but did get better through the glass.
Hop Back Maypole Axed;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Waterloo Arms, Soton. Golden. Drinkable but lacking in flavour. Moderately dry with a bit of bitterness. Fine but uninteresting.

Dancing Camel Cherry Vanilla Stout;Tel Aviv, Israel;Stout;Dancing Camel;Draught at the brewery. Black with beige head. Rich vanilla aroma that makes you expect something unbalanced. Upon tasting I find that cherries lies behind a thin curtain of vanilla and coffee. Honey rounds off possible edges is the mid sized body. Piney bitterness creeps out late and I realize that my fears of lack of balance were unfounded. This is a good, unusual beer!
Dancing Camel Cherry Vanilla Stout;Tel Aviv, Israel;Stout;Dancing Camel;"On tap at ""pre-passover keg party"": a lot is going on with this beer, cherry jam, some artificial sweetness, vanilla, mocha like ice cream, some notes of roasted/burnt barley, the different flavors are are integrated in wierd way which is not so good but overall a nice and interasting beer."

Stewart's Bourbon Strong Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stewart's Brewing Company;22oz. Bottle: Aroma of whiskey, bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, wood, cherries, and yeast. Poured light brown with some amber in color and a medium-sized, loose, fizzy, off-white head that disappeared very quickly. Hazy. Very sparkling. A few large, and many tiny, particles. Light to medium sweet flavor. Tastes heavily of bourbon, whiskey, vanilla, alcohol, a hint of tobacco, and wood. Very heavy on boozy flavors. Medium body. Oily texture. Average carbonation. Sweet, boozy, bourbon finish.
Stewart's Bourbon Strong Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stewart's Brewing Company;May 2007 - Pours mahogany brown color, with smallish head and lacing. Extremely strong aroma of bourbon. I like Stewarts beers, but their barrel aged beers often tend to taste more like bourbon than beer. Strong flavor of bourbon and wood, almost losing the beer underneath. Hints of vanilla, caramel and something sour that almost tastes off. Very sweet.
Stewart's Bourbon Strong Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stewart's Brewing Company;Courtesy Santa (DocLock). Slightly cloudy brown color with a thin broken off-white head. Tannic oaky bourbon on the nose and not much else. The taste is severly bitterly tannic to the point of being unappealing. The sour twang keeps on through the finish and dominates the beer. Overboard with the bourbon, very astringent.
Stewart's Bourbon Strong Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stewart's Brewing Company;Bottle... O-Town Christmas Gathering ‘07... Cloudy, dark, Longhorn-orange ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Notes of sour mash, resin, oak and toffee amount to the aroma. Full-bodied and biting with restrained carbonation. Mostly sweet and malty, the flavor provides rich essences of vanilla, caramel and bourbon. Moderately acidic. Mid-length, lightly tangy, very drying finish. Vastly underrated. Thanks to jayg for bringing this beer along to share!
Stewart's Bourbon Strong Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stewart's Brewing Company;Courtesy jayMFg. The body is a hazy, dark caramel brown. A small, foamy, off-white head leaves behind some sudsy lacing that mostly rejoins the body. The aroma shows darkly toasted caramel malts, light bourbon, vanilla, and a touch of ripe cherries. This one smells really nice, with a touch of cream smoothing out the light booziness from the bourbon. The flavor mostly follows suit, though things are a bit more muddled. The cherries aren’t as pronounced on the palate, moving more towards a non-descript, general fruity component. Medium bodied and fairly smooth. Short finish. This is a pretty solid brew. Surprised to see that it’s 9% ABV. I would have guessed lower.
Stewart's Bourbon Strong Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stewart's Brewing Company;Copper colored with some head and lacing. Aroma is yeasty with a hint of sourness. Flavor is yeasty with a spicy sourness.
Stewart's Bourbon Strong Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stewart's Brewing Company;Courtesy jayMFg. Pours a copper color, with a small off white head. smells of bready yeast, dark malt, and some light bourbon, but not too overpowering. Theflavor was fairly fruity and sweet, alot of apples, malt, and the light bourbon as well. The body is a little bit thinner than I had hoped for. very sweet, almost too much, which took away from it a bit. seemed like it had not enough bourbon in it.
Stewart's Bourbon Strong Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Stewart's Brewing Company;Enjoyed at SLLs secret, especial, members only, totally secret friday nights beer tasting with Robert, eaglefan and an un-named BA member. Thin offwhite head that settled out quickly, little lace. Deep brown with some red edging. HELLO WHISKY! Plenty in the nose along with some dark fruitiness, definate lumber and alcohol. Body is med/full, slick on the palate. Plenty of Bourbon flavor, really dominant with dark fruity notes, wood, alcohol and maybe some toffeeish, caramel notes as well. Finish is fairly dry, whiskyish but clean. Guess i,ve turned into a BB aged whore as i seem to be diggin most of them any more. Thanks to eaglefan for sharing, thanks Brian!!

Portsmouth Brewing Raven Rock Doppelbock;Portsmouth, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Portsmouth Brewing;"This dark amber beer comes with a small but fairly durable head that leaves a little splotchy lacing. Very good clarity. The flavor profile is a bit unusual for style, probably due to the use of ""domestic Perle hops"", but I found only a little harm in this. Medium body with good, medium carbonation. Smooth. O: Interesting version of this style."
Portsmouth Brewing Raven Rock Doppelbock;Portsmouth, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Portsmouth Brewing;A growler from the brewpub, served in a dimpled mug. Pours a deep copper with red hints and a small, tan head that quickly fades. Decent lacing. Heavy carmel malt aroma with subtle hints of coffee. Full, creamy mouthfeel with slightly more effervescence than is typical of the style. Sweet, malty flavor, but without much depth or complexity. Nonetheless, a decent representative doppelbock. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for the Daystrom M-5

John S. Rhodell Texas Brown;Peoria, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;John S. Rhodell Brewery;on tap-pours a tan head and hazy copper color. Aroma is caramel-medium malt, some spice hops. Taste is caramel-medium malt, some spice/earthy hops.
John S. Rhodell Texas Brown;Peoria, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;John S. Rhodell Brewery;Served at a cooler cellar temperature in a pint glass. Poured a nice looking crayon brown with a small foamy head that settled into a thin lacing, minimal amount of sticking. The cascade hops immediately hit your nose, floral and citric, with a light backing of nuts and chocolate. Good moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, velvety smooth medium bodied mouthfeel. Cascade hops are the first thing you notice in the taste, they have a good citrus fruitiness, juicy, not too sour and a little sweet, a light grainy nuttiness, dry chocolate malty, and a dry fruity, malty finish. Just a well brewed American Brown Ale, tasty and balanced, another good effort from Mark at Rhodell’s.

Double Mountain IRA (India Red Ale);Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;On tap at the Pizza Schmizza Pub & Grub in Beaverton, OR. Not quite clear red pour with a big sticky head that dissipates quickly and leaves a ring of residue down the glass. Fruity caramel aroma and taste with a marked bitterness and medium mouthfeel. Bitter finish.
Double Mountain IRA (India Red Ale);Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Draft at PreFunk. Dark amber, clear, scant head. Sharp malty aroma, Band-Aids. Taste is also malt centric, leaves, tobacco . Slightly dry, cough drops.
Double Mountain IRA (India Red Ale);Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Bottle shared with Ladi at Bad Flash on the last day of his tenure. Drank alongside the ’Hop Lava’. Both beers were disappointingly not hop forward. Nice malt profile and smooth and easy going. This one had more depth of flavour, more hops and was slightly more enjoyable.
Double Mountain IRA (India Red Ale);Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;The apearence of this bottle and beer is pretty normal but the taste us great. Not super heavy red but definitely hop. In the bottle drank with the neighbor lesbos. Good times.
Double Mountain IRA (India Red Ale);Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;On tap at Hop City. The yeast gave it a banana and clove finish that I want expecting, nice malt body.
Double Mountain IRA (India Red Ale);Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Pours dark amber, slightly hazy with a nice off-white head. The aroma is caramel, malanoidin malts, some tropical fruit, ripe apple and pear. The taste is sweet, lots of caramel, hard candy. The bitterness is moderate, grassy and piney, long-lasting. The beer’s ok, I guess, but way too hard candy sweet for my taste and the bitterness doesn’t balance out the sweetness in a very pleasant way.
Double Mountain IRA (India Red Ale);Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;On tap at St. Augustine with Ash during Double Mountain tap takeover. Pours a slightly hazy copper with a beige head. Aroma is caramel malt, some tropical fruits. Taste and aftertaste is the same with piney bitterness notes. Quite good.
Double Mountain IRA (India Red Ale);Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Double Mountain Brewery and Taproom;Appearance: slightly hazy medium amber with two fingers of rocky ivory head diminishing quickly to a thin skim, moderate lacing. (4/5) Aroma: caramel, pithy grapefruit and orange peel, cedar, tropical fruit. (7/10) Taste: moderate sweet, moderate-high bitter. (7/10) Medium slightly oily body, moderate carbonation, off-dry medium duration slightly spicy finish. (3/5) A little elderly, perhaps, but the slightly higher ABV seems to have provided some measure of protection. The intention here is pretty clear: marry the characteristics of sweet malty red ales with those of IPAs. The execution is… slightly less clear. Although bitter and sweet are not necessarily antagonistic, they can be tough to balance - one or the other seems to always win out. In this case, malt is clearly dominant. On the plus side, the SImcoe hops don’t taste skunk or catty, so there’s that. (14/20)

Northwoods Sawmill IPA;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Northwoods Brew Pub;On tap at both Chetek and Eau Claire brewpub locations. The tap marker at both brewpubs do not have any special brand name except the three letters I P A. So... I’ll just call this Northwoods IPA.

Taste is light body, medium carbonation and a watery finish. Not much hop bite in the aftertaste. Too clean finish. 5/8/07 - The brewpub just sent me the actual name of the product: Northwoods Sawmill IPA

Rubicon Olde Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Old Ale;Rubicon Brewing Company;Draft at the brew pub. Dark, malty aroma with hints of dark fruit. A deep brown color, not quite opaque. Decent beige head that left point lacing. Medium bodied. A light carbonation bite. Starts sweet with malt and plum and/or raisin. The finish is not quite dry. The hop is always dominated by the malt, but it is noticeable in the end. Seems to be floral hop, but it’s hard to tell with the malt and dark fruit. The alcohol was never intrusive. Seems a bit more Belgian than British. Sip rather than gulp.
Rubicon Olde Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Old Ale;Rubicon Brewing Company;10 ounce sample tasted at the brew pub. Vinous, raisiny aroma with some light buttery notes. The aroma on this is actually quite faint and not overly noticeable. Mild-moderate hazy amber body with a copper hue present. There is a small off-yellow head. Wow -- caramelly, buttery, big herbal diacetyl flavors to start. Lots of butterscotch. Correction. Tons of butterscotch. Mild vinous flavors in the middle. Light booziness to finish with a very mild hop bitterness in the end. This beer is a love/hate beer. If you do not like diacetyl, you will not like this. Asfor me, I do not mind it.

Mendocino Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Bottled at Akkurat, Stockholm. Cloudy dark yellow, coarse lively head. Fruity bubblegum aroma. Medium bodied with clean, rounded mouthfeel. Caramelly malt builds a mid sized body that is covered in bubblegums and estery pears. Getting a bit honeyish and sticky in the finish.
Mendocino Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Bottle. Poured a slightly hazy, dull, straw color with a soapy white head.

Weird sort of astringent bitterness shows up near the finish. Not great.
Mendocino Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Bottle: &nbsp Dull golden, hazy, moderate sudsy white head, spotty lacing. &nbsp Pale, dull wheaty aroma, a little basement like, dank, perhaps even a bit grainy. &nbsp Rather dully wheatiness on the tongue, a little bready, backside is a little astringent. &nbsp Has a musty aspect to it. &nbsp Not bright, certainly modeled after an American Wheat as I get no clove nor banana in this one. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate, a little thick but at the same time very dull. &nbsp Pretty boring and not all that flavorful. &nbsp Not bad, but given that its nearly spring this summer release is probably over the hill. &nbsp Thanks Bob for the bottle!

Mendocino Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);03-Feb-08 (12 oz bottle: BevMo in La Jolla, CA) Slightly hazy and bright golden in color, the quarter-inch-tall white head is kept alive by dozens of streams of tightly packed bubbles making their way to the surface. Wheaty nose seems sweet and honey-like, with a floral hoppiness coming out as well. Big, wheat taste is balanced by floral hops, but the honey sweetness is terribly prominent. Bitterness is light-medium, but seems stronger because the wheat is an easy push-over. Medium in body and well-carbonated, but the sweetness of the beer along with the floral nature of the hops leaves a heavy and stale feeling on the palate and a bad aftertaste. Plenty of flavor here, which is a big plus for an American-style wheat beer, but the hop profile isn’t especially enjoyable.

Bruveris Kviešu;Riga, Latvia;Wheat Ale;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);Weird beer, colour is like drained mash, foam lasts medium, to me it tastes like mudwater with oil used in macDonalds plus some sweetness. Cause don’t have much experience with wheat ale, hope to update info some day. update: some flower hops in aroma at the beginning, carrots, then - whole ginger, licorice flavor. Pours cloudy pale amber to orange with medium white top, thin foam layer stays on. Taste - malty light sweet with weird bitter from hopping and something else.

Mash Citrus Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Radler / Shandy;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Thought I’d better these to see what all the ’fuss’ was about. Described as smelling a bit like lemon dishwashing liquid and tasting a whole lot like lemon dishwashing liquid - I just can’t disagree with that. And what makes it worse is it get’s sweeter the more you get down through the glass. Good thing wifey likes it as she’ll end up drinking 5 & 3/4 of the 6 pack!

Mash Golden Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I suspect this is lion ice repackaged. See my comments on lion ice.

Goldmalt Black;Hanoi, Vietnam;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Goldmalt;Draught at Goldmalt 2, Hanoi. Dark brown with creamy beige head. Aroma and flavour of sweet caramel malt, toast and chocolate. Low bitterness and a slight roughness in the finish. Not as good as other locally brewed dunkels.

Kolding Dragons Delight;Kolding, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kolding Bryghus;Tap. Pours a hazy red amber with a small, but staying and very creamy white head. The head reminds me of Guinness’.

Aass Weizen;Drammen, Norway;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Aass Bryggeri;0,5l can. Pours semi-cloudy yellow/golden with white head. Vague aroma of banana, wheat, fruity. Taste is fruity, wheat, banana comes through in the finish. It's like they took a good hefeweissen and just stripped nearly all the flavour out of it. Boring.
Aass Weizen;Drammen, Norway;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Aass Bryggeri;"25-06-2018; can; at home (bought somewhere in/near Voss, Norway). The looks of the beer are alright. It has the crystal clear looks a Kristallweizen is supposed to have. The color is golden yellow. On top of the beer a nice layer of soft white foam is formed. Foam retention is rather good. A nice thick soft drape is left after some time. Nicely done. The smell of the beer isn't to special. There are some sweet malt aromas, with that fullness of a Weizener. Some herbal hops are also present. All in all, there aren't a lot of aromas. Some yeasty touches are there in the distance, but not the strong fruity aromas a Weizener has. The taste of the beer also isn't to special. Malts give some sweets and hops some bitter herbal notes. I miss the fullness of the yeast and the touches of coriander and banana. Those are what makes a Weizener to me. It is a bit simple. Also not completely balanced...it is a bit to bitter-dry. The palate is so-so. Light body, rather thin texture and medium carbonation. The finish of the beer is short and contains some sweets and a hint of fruit, but it mainly is bitter. All in all, not the best beer. But it is a decent beer...it is easy drinkable and I most certainly enjoy it."

Grassy, flowery aroma leaving the malt in the background. The flavor is much the same, but with more emphasis on the malt, giving the beer a grainy impression.

Hugos Honey Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Hugos;(Draught) Talked with the brewmaster today, Ted, who said that they put premium Hallertau Hersbrucker hops in this ale. It did give a grassy flavour and nose to a fairly muted Pale Ale. The head was a creamy white thin top above the clear, medium amber, low carbonated body. The taste has a slight bitterness and very, very faint honey touch. Fizzy caarbonation and light hop bitterness round out the palate into the finish. Refreshing in its subtlety.

Flavor is just like the aroma, but man this is full of smoke and wood. Way too smoky for me. I liked the Bock malt profile, so if perhaps they just tone down the smoke about 50%, this would be excellent. I think the smokey peat and char just dominate the beer too much. I poured this out

Bullfrog Biere de Mars;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Bullfrog Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. I like this style’s sass and spiciness, of which this was an over-reach of skill and not a great rep of the style. Reddish colour, overcarbonated and off taste. More maltiness than anything else.
Bullfrog Biere de Mars;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Bullfrog Brewery;Pours a cloudy turbid coppery brown with a thick fluffy beige head which fades to a film. Aroma is dirty and yeasty, doughy, thick bready malts, light caramel, and some earthy spice and hops. Doughy slightly dirty and earthy flavor with some spice, smooth light sweet malts, herbal, and slightly bitter. Dirty and messy but still pretty smooth, and kind of reminded me of a biere de garde I made a few years ago. Somehow this started to taste even better with some food.

Stoudts Smooth Hoperator;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Very much like this beer. You don’t get the feeling of a true doppelbock, but you get a nice combination of a good doppelbock and some good hops. I approve.
Stoudts Smooth Hoperator;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Bottle to shaker glass, pours hazy mahogany-red. Two plus finger billowy tan head. Nice lacing and awesome retention. Aroma of roast and nuts. Taste is very sweet but generous hops balances this beer nicely. Full bodied, lively carbonation, slick mouth feel. Finishes bittersweet.

Stoudts Smooth Hoperator;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Probably my favorite doppelbock. Has all the great characteristics, but with a sharp ipa profile that works really well. This one opens my eyes.
Stoudts Smooth Hoperator;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Bottle: If every doppelbock tasted like this, I would be all over them all the time. Clear brown color with a frothy off-white head. Sweet aroma of malts mixed with hops - interesting. Love the aroma. Flavor is hoppy grains with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Thin body.
Stoudts Smooth Hoperator;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Stoudts Brewing Co.;"Impeccably cloudy, the color of prune juice. Layer of slush on top. Looks like a chunky barleywine. Glows only slightly in front of the light. Aroma is supremely sugary malts: definitely closer to a barleywine aroma than a doppelbock even. The piney hops are definitely there, floating above the malts as an accent. Finished wood and resins. Light oak. Flavor is sugary malts, more resinous hops. Spicy finished wood. Basically everything in the aroma matches in the flavor. Has a taste of powdered Lipton iced tea. Feels rough and grainy; not quite a choker but a slow sipper. This is a very good beer. Although the prices I’ve seen them charging for a six pack is outrageous, it’s a damned fine beer."
Schlafly Organic Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;(draught at the brewpub) I heard the same tale - they had intended to make a Vienna lager, but used an ale yeast by mistake. Stuff happens. Nice amber color with eggshell head. Malt aroma. Flavor was biscuit malt, some hops, some spice. Interesting.
Schlafly Organic Amber Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. This was supposed to be an organic Vienna, but when ale yeast is used instead of lager yeast you get an amber ale instead. Pours clear amber with a dense white head. The aroma has grainy caramel malt and minor grassy hoppiness. Medium / light body that’s grainy and crisp with lots of sharp tight carbonation. The flavor starts with grainy malt and some astringency along with a peppery spice. The finish has more spice and some bitterness. A fair brew.

Golden Leaf Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Semi hazy amber with a quickly dissipating white head that laces a little as it fades. Aroma of floral and citrus hops, yeast, cereal with some vegetal properties. Body is effervescent with citrus and caramel leading up to a medium bitter finish that has some sweetness to it. The hop character on the finish isn’t very well defined… Bargain bin pale ale.
Golden Leaf Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Coppery brown color with a small but firm head. Herbal and citrus bitterness in the aroma along with a hint of grain and malt. Flavor is a light hit of tart citrus with a cereal malt finish. It’s a little lighter than most APA’s but still a very drinkable beer. Nice to see City Brewery branching out a bit.

Golden Leaf Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Picked this up at a local shop because it was a bit different and very cheap. Pours an copper color with a decent head but nothing to rave about. The scent is citrus mixed with cheap beer/malt liquor. The taste matches the smell pretty well. The flavor of this beer is pretty much Old Style with grapefruit/lemon flavoring. Did not care for it too much.
Golden Leaf Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Quite a nice one, dont mind it at all, love the simplicity of it, nothing special ar extra, easy to drink fun beer, doesnt feel too strong or too light, just right, mild bitter finish

Sand Creek In-House Stout;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Picked this one up at The Coffee Grounds, it is their official beer brewed with their own coffee by Sand Creek. Pours a dark brown bordering on black with a creamy white/tan head that doesn’t leave any lacing as it recedes. This one has that coffeehouse scent, more so than a lot of coffee beers. The smell is predominantly coffee. The flavor is also heavy on coffee, it has the classic oatmeal stout mouthfeel as well. There is also some chocolate and sugar thrown in the mix for good measure. It was a surprisingly good beer. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 08-24-2010 02:36:41
Sand Creek In-House Stout;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Thank you to goryshkewych for this extra! Black pour with a lively tan froth. The aroma is very lactic and sweet- milk chocolate, mocha, oat sugars, and cream pervade the nose. The flavor is much the same- quite sweet, lactic and full flavored with loads of coffee. The palate, unfortunately, is quite thin. Still delightful though..
Sand Creek In-House Stout;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Thanks to Tom for this rare bottle. Pours dark black with a two-finger tan head that stayed. Aromas of coffee and milk chocolate. Medium body with smooth, creamy carbonation. Flavor is coffee and bitter milk chocolate. It’s bitter, but can’t tell whether it’s coffee bitter or hop bitter. Finishes coffee and chocolate. Maybe it’s more dark chocolate than milk. Makes me want more.

Sand Creek In-House Stout;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"Bottle. Glad to try this rarity; thank you to the trader who sent it to me. Pours dark as expected with a shy tan head. Smoky, ashy aroma and a flavor to match (wet french roast grouds!); my wife describes it as drinking a cigarette and there’s more truth to that than would be ideal. The flavor and mouthfeel alike are otherwise on the thin side as well. Some acidity, little sweetness beyond a sugar-in-the-milk superficiality. Not awful by any stretch, but not exceptional either."
Sand Creek In-House Stout;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Bottle... VBWT2008... Pours dark and sits black in my glass with a small, creamy, lightly tanned head. Great retention. Big chocolate-milk with fractions of coffee and caramel in the nose. Barely medium-bodied and watery with medium carbonation. Sweetness and bitterness are evenly matched with a whisper of acidity thrown into the fusion. Finishes crisp and well-roasted. CaptainCougar supplied the bottle!
Sand Creek In-House Stout;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Courtesy hopscotch. Pours black with a smaller, creamy, light brown head. Smells of fresh coffee grounds, syrupy malts, light chocolate, and mild roast. The flavor is mostly coffee with a big malt presence. The body is a little watery for what it looks like. Very creamy texture, the finish is lightly bitter, with a big dose of the coffee. Smells better than it tastes because of its thin body, but still not a bad overall brew.
Sand Creek In-House Stout;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Bottle from CaptainCougar on 10/28/07. Big head of medium bubbles on initial pour despite a gentle pour and very cold beer. Settles over 10 minutes to a dense creamy small bubble layer on the surface. Can’t help but wonder if they are trying imitate nitrogenization. Whatever it looks pretty good. Aroma is super chocolatey, but not sweet. A hint of roast. Flavor is decent, again more chocolate, but way to dry for my tastes.
Sand Creek In-House Stout;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Pours to a black-brown body with a lasting tan head.

Billabong Ginger Beer;Myaree, Australia;Specialty Grain - Other;Billabong Brewing;Bottle from Mane Liquor. Not bad quaffing ginger beer. It leaves that touch of a bite at the back of the throat which is always nice I suppose
Billabong Ginger Beer;Myaree, Australia;Specialty Grain - Other;Billabong Brewing;330ml bottle. Murky and cloudy with a colour that resembles dirty dishwater, complete with a scattering of soapy looking bubbles that pop and disappear.

Murky, dull straw coloured body. Taste is fairly sweet and mainly ginger but is there a hint of pear and or apple in there. Body is just above medium and on the finish just a bit of a bite. One of the better Gluten free beers that I have tried though one was enough.
Billabong Ginger Beer;Myaree, Australia;Specialty Grain - Other;Billabong Brewing;Gluten-free beer now available mainstream at a few places in and around Perth. Mine, a bottle from the Beer Store Morley. Into a shallow chalice fresh chilled from the fridge. I let it known I love Ginger root anyway, so a bias goes towards anything made with it include. It pours an opaque, sandy yellow. A few reluctant bubbles grip the side of the glass, the others, conditioned and well trained, trace a silent path to the top, releasing up to a short, loose, bubbly pad of white that manages to stick around for dessert. Aroma of Fresh ginger is seemingly mulled, and plentifully spicy, ripe, woody and sweet. There is an extra spice there in the aroma hinting at Caraway seeds, rather fragrant. Quite sweet in the mouth as I expected. The ginger has a tough battle but pulls it off, this is very sweet, tangy and juicy but fairs clear of becoming cloying. Big spice of ginger in back , very woody and quite drawing with a long, sweet, equally woody ginger flavoured swallow and aftertaste. The carbonation is quite soft, the body firm and in charge. Quite refreshing I must say. Sessionable? I reckon it would pass at that too!!! (33cL, 1324)
E. J. Phair Ryezome IPA;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Tap (rating from notes 5/23/07). Cloudy dark amber orange color with an off-white head. Vinous, rye, hoppy, and orange aroma. Smooth and bitter with a clean slightly sweet finish.
E. J. Phair Ryezome IPA;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Draft. murkey caramel color with a thin off-hite head. Low citrus aroma. Grapefruit, citrus, slight pine flavor with earthy/spice/caramel backing. LIngering grapefruit and pine. Decent bitterness. Medium body. I’ve had this a number of times and the beer has been all over the place with some kegs being much better (Toronado was the worst).
E. J. Phair Ryezome IPA;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;"Draught at the Toronado. Beer is hazy, light/medium caramel with a small, white, frothy, mostly and quickly diminishing head.Malty with a light note of toasted grain, trace of caramel; Hoppy with a heavy note of resin/pine, light note of lemon/orange zest; Lightly yeasty note of attic, trace of sweat.Lightly sweet, moderately bitter, moderately acidic with a long, lightly/moderately bitter, lightly acidic, lightly sweet lingering finish.The body is medium, the texture is watery/velvety and the carbonation is soft/lively.Utterly fogetable."
E. J. Phair Ryezome IPA;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;"Draught at Toronado. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is light to medium amber. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately to heavily hoppy (grapefruit, resin), lightly yeasty (dough), with a note of butter/diacetyl. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Found it amusing after having the El Toro Deuce and thinking ""here we go again."" Diacetyl and yeast once more, and similarly pretty much just a hop bomb with little else of interest (for a non-hophead). Very lean, stark."
E. J. Phair Ryezome IPA;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Draft at brew pub. Murky, dark copper pour with an ivory head. Piney and floral hop aroma with an obvious rye note. I couldn’t help but think what a great name this beer has has I drank it...Bid rye notes line the malt sweetness with the hop flavor and aroma of a west-coast IPA. Very dry and bitter- a great, and very different, IPA.
E. J. Phair Ryezome IPA;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;On tap @ E J Phair poured a clear copper with a small lasting ivory head. Aromas of carmel, earthiness, pine and grapefruit. Palate was medium bodied crisp and dry. Flavors of rye, earthiness, carmel, pine and grapefruit rind witrh a crisp dry lingering bitter finish.
E. J. Phair Ryezome IPA;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;At NorCal Brewers Guild Festival at Raley Field. Aroma of piney hop with hints of grapefruit. Light amber color with little head. Starts with firm mouth feel and over the top pine. Perhaps some underlying grapefruit residue. Great long bitter finish.
E. J. Phair Ryezome IPA;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Tasted on tap at the 2007 Bistro Hop Rhizome Festival. This IPA pours a medium amber color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is mild, but kind of bready and floral. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are caramel, fruity and sweet. Hops are grapefruity and floral. There is a touch of spiciness from the rye. Good carbonation. A medium bitter IPA, the hop flavors are about in the middle of the scale. Mouthfeel is perhaps a touch thin, but not every sip. Which is kind of strange. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is bitter with a touch of alcohol bite.
Mill Creek Red Head Lager;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mill Creek Brewery/Freddys Brewpub;ON tap at Freddy’s brewpub. Solid middle-of-the-road offering with just enough nutty, toasted character to be keep things interesting.

Aroma and flavour of bready malts, light caramel, and grass. Pretty ordinary but well-enough made. Decent stuff.
Mill Creek Red Head Lager;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mill Creek Brewery/Freddys Brewpub;Draft - Light malts and a hit of toffee. Clear amber with a rich white head. Grains, light caramel and a watery finish. A very light drinking amber, almost like a British Mild.
Mill Creek Red Head Lager;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mill Creek Brewery/Freddys Brewpub;"Draught at the brewpub Darkish amber color, clean; creamy head. Very light aroma and flavor of caramelly malts, with ordinary bitterness, an inpression of chlorine (bad tap) water, and a slightly metallic finish. Boring."
Mill Creek Red Head Lager;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mill Creek Brewery/Freddys Brewpub;1 of a 6-variety sample tasted on 03/10/2011. Colour: Maple syrup.

Mill Creek Red Head Lager;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mill Creek Brewery/Freddys Brewpub;Amber body with no head. Faint malt aroma. Caramel sweet in flavour with not very much hop presence to tame the sweetness. Finishes a little sweet and simple.
Mill Creek Red Head Lager;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mill Creek Brewery/Freddys Brewpub;I actually don’t know if this is a lager or ale. It could go either way. Fairly standard-looking amber colour. It was served rather cold for much aroma to escape, a bit caramelly, maybe grainy. Flavourwise is tended towards a mild sweetness, with subtle caramel and fresh malt notes. Very clean - hence why I’m not sure of the yeast. Typical of Freddy’s brews in that it’s well made but not terribly flavourful.
Boundary Bay Cyclops 1 “Eye-PA”;Bellingham, Washington, United States;IPA;Boundary Bay Brewery;Tap@ Panther Room. Cloudy orange pour, white head and medium lace. Citrus hops from nose to finish, light-medium body, not very complex. A typical PNW IPA.
Boundary Bay Cyclops 1 “Eye-PA”;Bellingham, Washington, United States;IPA;Boundary Bay Brewery;9/28/08 On draught at the Panther Room, Seattle, Wa. Aroma is caramel malt infused with grassy citrus flora. Appearance is hazy orange with a well maintained white head. Flavor is a bit harsh with a very starchy resin, low sweetness and somewhat sour bittering. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carb texture and dry finish. Overall, interesting, but not easy drinking enough.
Boundary Bay Cyclops 1 “Eye-PA”;Bellingham, Washington, United States;IPA;Boundary Bay Brewery;This brew is made and served exclusively for the Cyclops bar in Belltown, Seattle. Was told they add an extra bag of hops (dry hopping?) to there regular IPA (which is sensational) to create this brew. Gorgeous sunset color, with a nose full of cascades! Wonderful cascade hope flavor, possibly rounded out by crystal. Just enough bitterness to give it backbone. Quite a tasty IPA.
Hakusekikan Niwa Weizen;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Clear golden color. Green apples and cloves in the nose. Not tart, but green apples, wheat, cinammon and funky yeasty character in the mouth. Rich apple brandy toasted malt finish. The aftertaste just sits there and lingers. Very interesting, but not really a hefe.
Hakusekikan Niwa Weizen;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;My Bottom Line: This off-the-wall wheat beer does not set its foundations into any known style (not surprising, this is a Hakusekikan beer after all), yet even if it throws you off, it should eventually conquer you with its sweet apple fruitiness, honeyed maltiness, and enlightening tartness. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the deep gold. -This is not a Weizen at all in the nose, barely showing a few cereals. -The lean body, frothy effervescence, and fruity tartness recalled quite cidery. -After reading the other guys’ ratings, I wonder if our glass was on its way down...in any case, it was definitely far from the usual style characteristics when paired side-by-side with the Fujizakura and Hidatakayama Weizens. On tap at Popeye’s.
Hakusekikan Niwa Weizen;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Draught at Popeye’s. Hazy golden with a smallish head. Banana, wheat, spice, yeast and sweet malts in the aroma. Flavor is fruity - citrus with strong banana notes, wheat, yeast, and some spice. Light, refreshing body. Nothing out of the ordinary but light and refreshing on a warm summers eve.
Hakusekikan Niwa Weizen;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;On tap at Popeye’s in Tokyo. Slightly hazy golden color with a thin white head that disappeared very quickly. Aroma of sweet citrus fruits, wheat, and a certain sugariness. Rich fruity flavors (banana, citrus), with spices and a bready yeast base. Decent carbonation and a crisp refreshing mouthfeel make this a very good hefeweizen.
Bubes Hemp Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Bubes Brewery;draught. taps a medium amber with a white head. smells very sweet and somewhat like a sorghum beer. flavor is sweet and has some indescribable flavor. pleasant though. drinkable but not a head turner.
Bubes Hemp Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Bubes Brewery;Tap at the brewery. Clear orange amber colored body, no head really at all. Weird smelly, sugary fruit cocktail nose, but not really smelling of hops, the hemp smells more like sweaty fruit, but not any hop. Sweet and syrupy, low carbonation. Sweet fruity pears and marachino cherries tasted, altogethor it tastes like a spoiled.
Bubes Pipers Baine Scottish Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Bubes Brewery;Brown color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malts, light vanilla. Taste of strong caramel, faint roast, sweet on the finish.

Bubes Pipers Baine Scottish Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Bubes Brewery;tapped a deep amber with a dense nitro-looking head. sweet smelling and tasting it is lacking a bit in complexity, but more than makes up for it in drinkability. very smooth for the supposed 5.9 % abv, I polished off 2 pints before my food even arrived.
Bubes Pipers Baine Scottish Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Bubes Brewery;"Draft, Bube’s. Pours a bright, cherry-amber color; headless.

Bubes Pipers Baine Scottish Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Bubes Brewery;I wasn’t too impressed with this brew. Body was kinda thin, taste was lacking, maybe it wasn’t fermented long enough or it got tainted, but this just didn’t taste all that great.

Elliott Bay Imperial Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Draft. Fudge black color. No head, but subtle tan rim around the edges. Raisins, chocolatey, with hint of apple. Thin, syrupy-like flavoring with soda consistency and body. Not much beyond initial punch to recommend it - though high alcohol content does make an appearance in the deep recesses of the throat. Ok, but really a disappointment given how much richness an imperial stout style affords the brewer. Seemed flat and unimaginative.
Elliott Bay Imperial Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;On tap at the 2007 GABF: Barely transparent dark mahogany pour has a tan ring of head.

Back Road Hefeweizen;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Road Brewery;"THIS BEER IS RETIRED, please see the ""Weiss"" entry for the 2008 version, thanks: This rating from the growler but I had two of these earlier at the brewpub, I served this in my Wiehenstephen weizen glass which makes sense! Pours mostly clean since the yeast is at the bottom of the bright tank, topped by a huge fluffy white head and excellent lace. Looks all the part of a classic hefeweizen. Onward towards to nose where I found a fresh banana and clove ester, mild grassy notes and a classic bubblegum overtone. Smells the part of a classic hefeweizen. The taste is mildly fruity and malty and quite refreshing minus a hit of soapy aftertaste. Mild spice and flowery qualities also found within. What I like about this is you can notice the wheat bill without a struggle unlike many American made versions. The mouth feel is softer than the German original is is dryer than many hefes as well. A fine effort from Back Road, Kudos! Worth a try for anyone looking for a solid summer brew."

Poured a clear golden amber with a one-finger white foamy head that diminished fast to a collar that laced OK. Carbonation low with rare small bubbles. Aroma subtly of light malt is quite pleasant but typical of a lager; no hops. Taste of slight sweetness and a very slight bitterness if anything at all. Light body. Smooth crisp refreshing but another run-of-the-mill macro brewed lager."
Victoria Bitter Midstrength;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);On Tap- very dissapointing beer. Just a watered down VB. Not worth detailing. Reminds me of Coors Light and that is not a good thing.
Victoria Bitter Midstrength;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Only ever got to shot gun this through the can after losing a bet at work. Was shit then, still shit now
Victoria Bitter Midstrength;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Bottle - pours light orange with a loose head. Not much of an aroma. Some malt on the taste and dry finish. Pretty straight forward, think I prefer it to full strength VB!
Victoria Bitter Midstrength;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);same crap as normal VB. only difference is it is a mid strength. still tastes like cat piss
Victoria Bitter Midstrength;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);"375ml stubby. Clear gold with a negligible white head. Faint malt aromas and little else. Light sweet malts on the tongue. No hop presence. Light bodied with a thin watery mouthfeel and abrupt finnish. Actually tastes a little less ""chemical"" than a full strength VB. Still awful."
Victoria Bitter Midstrength;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);375ml bottle. Bland to look at when poured with a taste to match. Thin and watery with no head, small white bubbles only. Skunky aroma with a heavy hop mixture. Bland taste and texture, not flavoursome at all.
Victoria Bitter Midstrength;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);"Can @ home You would have to drink this to find out how bad it really is, but that is not something that I would recommend. This ’brew’ tastes phenomenally bad; I never poured it from the can so I can’t comment on the appearance but it had a rancid aroma and a nasty watery texture and metallic taste. Totally unpalatable. I imagine rust would taste much like this does."
Victoria Bitter Midstrength;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Another rather thin and watery, mass-produced Australian beer. This is the sort of stuff you buy a case of for a house party, not something you buy to savor and compare tasting notes. But you could do worse. A cold VB on a hot Australian day can work wonders.
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;yeah...pretty much duclaw’s version of a corona. not too much to it...a little sweeter than your typical light lager...pretty drinkable. i’m content to just have it the one time a while back...just getting to adding some of my old tasting notes.
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;20090707 Tap at Bel Air location. Meaty and malty with light vegetal flavors. Mostly reminds of white sandwich bread. Metallic aromas. Little to no hop presence. Husky. I swore it seemed adjuncty, but the folks behind the bar swore it was all malt so...okay. With beers like this on tap, I don’t get why the brewpub has to stock something like Miller Lite, yet they do.
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;Lets just put it this way.. this beer is made for the brewery to make money off of people who think Corona is the nectar of the gods. I can’t blame them for trying to make money. And yes, this beer blows
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;Draft at the 2009 MD Spring Fest. Light yellow with a hint of green. Super filtered. Refreshing middle-of-the-road Helles. Well balanced, with a hoppy crispness. Some doughy yeast. All around a good straight forward session beer.
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;Thought this was pretty good for a crappy light beer. If you compare it to other pale lagers, its nice. Sweet, grainy, good flavor. Most of all, its clean with no skunk.
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;on tap-pours a white head and pale yellow color. Aroma is sweet grain, continental hops (Hallertau?). Taste is sweet grain-honey, continental hops (Hallertau?)-lemon. Mild carbonation.
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;Draft @ Bel Air location. Boring, watery lager. Seems odd that a brewpub would make a Corona clone - that’s basically what this is. Drinkable, but not DuClaw’s best offering.
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;On tap @ Arundel Mills. Golden yellow color w/a moderate white head. Aroma of corn & bread dough. Kind of a basic, easy drinking, light, summer brew. This will never be confused w/a classic, world class brew, but it’s not trying to be. It’s just a beer you can knock a few back & enjoy w/o thinking about it too much. Some flavors of bread dough & hay, maybe a little corn. Very slight hop bite. Decent mouthfeel, not too thin. Plesent finish.
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;Sparkling gold, fizzy white head. Soft cornbread and faint earthy citrus aromas. Flavor is corn and lightly sweetened citrus throughout. Well balanced and refreshing. Light bodied with light carbonation. This would be easy to put a growler down on a typical MD summer afternoon...
DuClaw El Guapo;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;An average Cerveza. Enjoyed as a part of the sampler from the Arundel Mills location. Threw a lemon in the glass and it ended up tasting like lemon. Very Corona-like and nothing more, except maybe a fuller body. That’s it.
Flat Earth Element 115;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Saint Paul Brewing Company;"From Jul 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Lofgrep. Thanks Peter! This pours a clear copper colour with a 1 finger head of foam. It has some lacing and though the foam shrinks a lot, there's still some there at the end of the session. Overall, a very nice looking brew in my glass. The smell has some caramel malt in it but the hops dominate with citrus and some grass. The taste at first sip is on the sweetish side with good caramel notes and some grain but the hops follow very closely with some nice citrus and a touch of grass that adds some good bitterness. I think there's some other fruitiness here but I'm not all sure which one(s) I'm tasting. The finish is definitely hop oriented with a nice bitter citrus flavour that is fairly long lasting. Good close to medium mouthfeel and this brew is working for me. I'm glad it came in a 22oz bottle because it sure is easy enough to drink. Well done Flat Earth! I'd be glad to drink this during the hot days of summer, which it currently is. ;^)"

Svaneke ÆbleBock;Svaneke, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Svaneke Bryghus;The color is very reddish brown, slightly hazy. The foam is somewhat thin and evanescent. However, left little spontaneous foam residues on top. It smells very clear and pleasant of fresh apples with a slightly sweet malt aroma. The tart and familiar taste of a ripe apple is the first impression tasting and a little later appears the sweet hint of malt. The taste is also cinnamon and banana, and lead into a soft and not too sweet final. The tangy and sweet combined really well in this beer.

Svaneke ÆbleBock;Svaneke, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Svaneke Bryghus;Bottle. Hazy reddish-brown with a nice off white head. Aroma of apples and grape along with a fruity sweetness and some malt ditto. Flavour is initially slightly sour with notes of apple, but then becomes sweet and more malty with spices showing themselves and ending in a dry lemonish bitterness. Gets better with every sip, so this is a beer that deserves more than a just a quick 3 mouthfull rating.
Svaneke ÆbleBock;Svaneke, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Svaneke Bryghus;Bottled. A slightly hazy dark-amber with traces of brown in it with a bubbly light tan head. The aroma is sweet with notes of fresh apples mixing in with notes of wheat, making it a very refreshing aroma - reminding me of spring. The flavor is sweet with apples hitting first with the slight acidity of a fresh green apple - or a medium cider, then comes the malt and wheat and gives it some body, before the refreshing acidity comes back. The finish is dry and wheaty with a slight note of the apples lingering.
Svaneke ÆbleBock;Svaneke, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Svaneke Bryghus;Bottle, 6.5%. Hazy orange/brown colour, looks thick when poured. Small head. Acidic aroma with a hint of green apple. The flavour is quite acidic, cidery with some apple juice and wild yeast notes. Some sweetness to balance. Strange and perhaps infected, but not bad.

Lost Abbey The Angels Share - Bourbon Barrel;San Marcos, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;2013 375mL bottle drunk 10/12/18. Dark mahogany with cola tints. Good clarity. Beige head fades steadily to a ring. Oh ya, lovely bourbon and oak mix with toffee and molasses, very lightly warming alcohol and soft vanilla. Spicy and full with light chocolate and raisin lingering. In the mouth, it's soft, slippery, spicy and full of a good mix of oak and bourbon. Everything has aged incredibly well, with little/no oxidation and great malt and wood integration. Super low but tight carbonation with chocolate and vanilla longering alongside fruity esters and warming alcohol. Thins out on the very end with very spicy bourbon and vanilla lingering. Goid attenuation. Lightly sticky at times but not sugary or syrupy in the least.
Lost Abbey The Angels Share - Bourbon Barrel;San Marcos, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;"Thick, sweet, and syrupy, with an unrelenting booziness bordering on overpowering. Not that this is a bad thing: BBA Angels Share is malt pushed to its indulgent extremes, a celebration of fermentation with nary a care as to balance or restraint. Waves of caramel, toffee, date, and fig fade into a booze-fueled bourbon extravaganza on the finish, wood and vanilla and a mild hop bitterness trying in vain to offset the liquor flood. Good, but I'd be hard-pressed to finish a pint; eight ounces are plenty."

Stonehouse Wheeltappers Wheat Beer;Oswestry, Shropshire, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Stonehouse Brewery;Bottled, 500ml from The Spar Shop in Chirk, Wales. Hazed gold with white head. This had a floral, fresh character from the start, perhaps a little thinnish, but there was a lemon note along with a hint of pear drop. I didn’t get the herbs to come through, but all in all a reasonable Wheat Ale.
Stonehouse Wheeltappers Wheat Beer;Oswestry, Shropshire, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Stonehouse Brewery;50cl bottle from the Spar at Rhos on Sea. There’s definitely the expected tang of unmalted wheat in here and the lemon zest added, increases this aroma and and taste. It’s fairly true to the style, but I’d really have liked something of a bit more intensity - maybe orangey and a bit more creamy. It could do with just a little more body though I generally do like this style, so still enjoyable.

Les Brasseurs du Hameau dHam Noire Extra Malt;Ham-Sud, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Les Brasseurs du Hameau;341ml bottle thanks to Glouglouburp given to me at BCTC ’07. One really great looking beer, vigorous pour garnered one HUGE light tan head sitting atop a dark thick abyss of black. Aroma was not so good. Huge nose of dust and mustiness. Hidden in the background is slight touch of malt but that is only noticed after really searching through the old basement mustiness. Full bodied with some large carbonation that was very lively. Flavor is lots of raosted malt with a slight touch of dark bitter chocolate. Looks great, smells bad, tastes average.

Les Brasseurs du Hameau dHam Noire Extra Malt;Ham-Sud, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Les Brasseurs du Hameau;Very dark brown body, chunks of yeast and a small tan head. Malt profile really feels like generic over-baked “black-cake”. Dusty yeast, some raisins distant back grapes, a little robber here and there. An overall dirty and dusty and the roatiness had this ashes feeling to it. A week later I shared a big bottle with some friends and the result was even more disappointing. It’s a good beer but I much prefer the original D’Ham Noire (without the “extra malt” label). Although to be fair “extra malt” can in fact translate to “unnecessary malt”.

Les Brasseurs du Hameau dHam Noire Extra Malt;Ham-Sud, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Les Brasseurs du Hameau;"My Bottom Line: Roastiness reigns on this frothy and dry Belgian Dark Ale, scarcely helped by coffee beans. A straightforward quaffer this is, overshadowed by its more complex and livelier brother, d’Ham Noire. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the brown-sleeved black. -There may be more malt in the recipe than their regular Noire, but it does not contribute more body; it’s just very dry and roasty. -The back end is just more roastiness, and perhaps a smidge of supporting hoppiness if you’re really looking for it. -As is usual with Brasseurs du Hameau beers, the body is light and carbonation big-bubbled, providing the typically quaffable Belgian Ale character.

Les Brasseurs du Hameau dHam Sud (Blonde Extra Pale Ale);Ham-Sud, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Les Brasseurs du Hameau;"My Bottom Line: An adorable balance of spicy, leafy hops and homely honeyed cereals resides in this modest and highly convenient quaffer of a Golden Ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sticky ring of foam circles the hazy peach golden. -The malts have that personality intrinsic to the Frontenac maltsters; that farmy, grainy greenness is definitely detectable. -The finish lengthens the leafy side of the chosen hops and adds some grassiness too. -A subtle tropical fruitiness can be found in the nosem blending in perfectly with the malt and hop profiles. -Although it’s name might have you expect an English style, du Hameau’s house yeast is definitely Belgian... -I get the impression the tap version was a tad better integrated than the bottles.

Rock Bottom Cincinnati Vienna Lager;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Rock Bottom Cincinnati;"5/01/2007: The Cincinnati version of the Rock Bottom Vienna has a slight Mexican flare to it... Color is clear, reddish amber. It has a thin frothy head that is off-white in color. Weak malt is present in the aroma. The flavor has a bit more malt (medium level), but is comparable to that of a Mexican ""Vienna"" Lager rather than that of a more full true German Vienna. The malt presence is toasty in character. Medium-light body with ample carbonation. This beer is easy to drink, but is lacking depth and excitement. 20 oz draught (mug) at Rock Bottom Cincinnati complements of Tmoney99. Thanks Tom!"

Wolf Whistle;Besthorpe, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wolf Brewery;Hand-pulled pint in my local Spoon’s during the March 2012 Beerfestival. I have enjoyed all the beers I’ve had from Wolf and this was no exception. Clean looking: chestnut red and almost bright in appearance: an off-white crown of creamy textured head sat on top. The aroma was of mildly toasted malts sprinkled with some citrus esters, pleasant without being over-powering or heavy. The taste was a fine blend of beery things: malty yet not sweet, hoppy yet not bitter or too citrusy. The alcohol was well concealled within the flavours: this is an easy drinking beer and a pleasure to sip.
Wolf Whistle;Besthorpe, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wolf Brewery;Cask (Pint): Some sweet malts and a faint touch of caramel along with some more earthly malts and possibly some dried fruits. Amber to copper colours with a fairly small, foamy white head at the top of the beer. Faint malts and caramel or perhaps toffee to begin with, but again like the smell the taste is also very weak and light. There is some bitter hops and malts with the bitterness staying around for a while. Slightly chewy with a medium body and a very bitter finish that is slightly dry. Carbonation on this one is very low and as is normally the case with a cask ale, it taste a little flat with a sightly warm feel. This one was like every other cask ale I can remember, the nose was fairly weak and light with the taste not much better. The feel was a slightly warm, flat one. 1001 Beers Blog:

Vogelbräu Karlsruhe Vogellennium;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Vogelbräu Karlsruhe;"My Bottom Line : An important doughy yeast presence attempts to slowly down the soaring alcohol heat while light banana esters and bubblegummy phenols politely express themselves. Further Personal Perceptions : -A veil of foam sits atop the dull, cloudy blond. -This remains a decent Belgian-style Strong Ale for a German brewer, but it would be second or even third tier in Belgium. But kudos to this brewer for trying something different! -The flavor profile is simple throughout. -The mouthfeel is almost elegant; well carbonated and not too sweet . -Herbal, spicy hop bitterness makes an appearance alongside the alcohol heat. Bottle. Thx Alex!"

Trois Dames Pacific North West Pale Ale;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trois Dames;Backlog - May 13, 2010. My 330ml bottle shared with blankboy and garthicus. Near-gusher on opening. Very hazy pale gold with a huge and lasting fluffy white head. Aroma of paint, avocado and weak resin (hey, that’s what my notes say). Dry, nutty and stale leafy flavour - a bit aggressive, but not quite to the point of harshness. Thick mouthfeel, solid carbonation, a bit astringent and quite quick-finishing. I guess it was a tad old when we drank it - fresh, I am betting this would have been pretty damned interesting.
Trois Dames Pacific North West Pale Ale;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trois Dames;12 ounce bottle shared by footbalm. Pours a very opaque yellow color with a large white head, some gushing out of the bottle. A sweet nose of honey and rich herbal malts and hops. Sweet flavors of herbal hops, grass, light honey, almost like a saison. Some dry oranges and pear. The bottle has the abv at 4.8% not 5.4. Best by Nov. 2009. Seems fine to me.
Trois Dames Pacific North West Pale Ale;Sainte-Croix, Switzerland;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trois Dames;"(Old BA rate - bottle) Pours with a thinner slightly off-white head that’s pretty small; burnt orange hue that leans clearer rather than hazy. Aroma has notes of citrus, some apply, pineapple, and a light malt sweetness. Taste follows suit with some tartness on top of the passion fruit hoppiness. Leans a little too sweet for my taste in the style, and the hops are definitely overshadowed by the maltiness. Lingering bit of flowers and candy in the aftertaste, and doesn’t stand up to the better ones in the range. MF is almost medium with a very soft carbonation. Little sticky at points. OK drinking as I would have looked for something hoppier, cleaner, and more refreshing. Not a bad try but not quite there."

It pours a pale yellow beer with a quite fast diminishing average sized white head. Unpleasant nose of stale hops and lemonade. The taste is of the same, the lemonade really doesn’ t work out well at all with the beer, an awful shandy. A very poor combination. Fairly tart and a lot to sweet. A hint of bitterness. The finish is quite enjoyable though: Some citrussy elements combine with a pleasant biscuitty crispness. Despite the finish, it wasn’t a pleasant beer at all, I could hardly finish the bottle!

Belgian yeast flavor and fruit of banana and apple dominate the middle and finish. It seems like a brew with 6% abv Also slightly oily on the tongue in the finish with notes of hay.

Lost Abbey Devotion;San Marcos, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;With Lost Abbey's Devotion the California brewers bring the typical standard of excellence and, well, devotion to Belgian brewing methods. Devotion has a yellow-gold color and a lively, somewhat hazy body. The yeast esters impart a somewhat chemical-like earthy aroma. While the flavor is largely malt-driven, there's a pleasantly complex spiciness. Notes of nutmeg, white pepper, and clove. Feel is soft but crisp. There's grassy and mildly bitter finishing hops and gorgeous lacing is left behind on the glass. In all, it's a mostly traditional Belgian Blond, though the hops are a welcome addition.
Lost Abbey Devotion;San Marcos, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;"Good Belgian blonde ale, with a subtle sweetness offset by uber-dry noble hops and a lingering grassy finish. Mild spiciness on the back end rounds out the subtle fruit notes, while hints of clove and straw add complexity. Lingering hoppy bitterness on the fade almost seems pilsner-ish, but yeast and an underlying sweetness provide balance. Nose seems lacking in much Belgian goodness; not much else to fault. Not my favorite, but the pint seemed to disappear rather quickly."

River City The Grinch (Bourbon Barrel Aged);Wichita, Kansas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Draught at the Parkville Micro Fest. Aroma is massively powerful, richly malty and sweet, dark, and earthy with plenty of bourbon character and spun sugar, combined with raisin, date and plummy fruitiness, also seeing some lighter spicy, citric hop tones and wafts of peppery alcohol. Properly deep, murky mahogany-amber color, head is creamy and lasting. Flavor profile is equally huge but showing surprisingly good balance between the aspects of malt sweetness, dark, dried fruits, hop bitterness and flavor, and the ever-present kiss of bourbon. Attributes include plenty of dark malt sugars and carob, along with some tannic oak, vanilla, charred toast, toffee, some herbal, leafy, citric hop character and plenty of alcohol. Palate is chewy, thick and slightly sticky, body is simply huge. Pretty impressive. Went back for as many samples of this as I could, totalling roughly 20 oz. over the course of the afternoon.
River City The Grinch (Bourbon Barrel Aged);Wichita, Kansas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);On tap at the Parkville Microbrew Festival. I feel that this was my beer of the show. The first thing that hits you is the strong aroma of vanilla and bourbon. It is an extremely dark beer- dark reddish orangey brown. Has a thin, but cantankerous yellowy beige head. The intense orange flavor stays on the tongue a long time. A thick and chewy beer with a big orange sweetness to the flavor. There seems to be lots of cane sugar sweetness to this. If you try, you might even discern a bit of coconut.

Samuel Adams Saison;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Boston Beer Company;Tasted 03/05/2007. 12oz bottle, shared amongst 4 of us, after a BJCP study group. Hazy pale-medium gold, reasonable white head stands. Fruity hops on the nose at first, mostly orange. Caramel malts, possibly munich, come to dominate the nose with some spices later that aren’t all that pleasant. Caramel malts and medium bitterness up front in the mouth, with strong unpleasant vinyl and clove note in the finish. Too malty, under-attenuated and under-carbonated for the style. Not all that pleasant to drink either! I’m not surprised this failed to medal at the NZ Beer Awards. Sam Adams seem to struggle with beers that are not meant to be richly malty.

Bullfrog Lil Slugger Pale Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bullfrog Brewery;Draft at Bullfrog. Poured medium gold with white head.

Bullfrog Lil Slugger Pale Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bullfrog Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Gummy, juicy hop fragrant aroma. Citrus and pine heavy. Pours a middle orange-golden, lightly hazed, with a just past white head, lacing. Flavor was a bit muddled and malt messy, but then opened up slowly into some rich, raw, unbridled hop flavors. I want a little more bitterness for balance, as the hop flavor doesn’t feel counter-weighted. Finishes a little dirty and a bit thin. Nothing crazy.
Bullfrog Lil Slugger Pale Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bullfrog Brewery;"Draft @ Bullfrog. Pours a clear, slightly dulled golden-orange color; off-white head with fine-bubbled lacing. Very light, slightly bland aroma, showing minimal hops, some sugar, and cardboard-y malts; light and generally inoffensive. Medium mouthfeel: stronger show of hoppy bitterness in the mouth: citrus and soft earthy / floral hops upfront, solid levels of bitterness, and fairly drinkable and pleasant overall; much better than the nose; solid pale ale after the initial impression. Medium finish: toasty malts, mineral and citrus bitterness, and sugar."

Bullfrog Lil Slugger Pale Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bullfrog Brewery;Light but drinkable. Not at all what one expects when they order an APA. I honestly thought there would be more hop and more malt ... well, I guess I thought there would be more taste.

Haacht Speciale 1900;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;25cl draft at Het Verdronken Land, Ghent (18 II 2016). This special belge is a red brown looking ale with a notable grain and malt nose. The collar is small beige coloured. The taste itself is rather flat, coming from the low carbonation and the thin watery body. Some flavours really are too subtle. There are some pleasant almost soury hints in the beer as well. Classic special belge... with a faint palate though, I’m afraid.

32 Via dei Birrai Curmi;Onigo di Pederobba (TV), Italy;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;32 Via dei Birrai;"750ml crown-capped bottle with plastic-cork come with a free screwed pin bought at CitySuper in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui. Looks: Translucent light golden honey colour with a ring of dirt-like yeastsediments; One finger head and soapy white foam which last for 90 seconds; Minimal lacing and very fizzy carbonation. Aroma: Fragrant malt, with strong wheat and tartness, strong coriander, strong orange peels, banana, faint pineapple, faint dark fruits, bread, strong yeast, lemon and thin grass. Taste: Mid to light sweet light malt, with strong wheaty tartness, spelt, orange peels, coriander, sugar, strong spices, earth, dry biscuits , strong yeast, lemon, moderate bitter hops and strong grass. Body: Close to light body. Slick and crisp palate. Mouth Feel: Fair malt in a slick background. Strong tart wheat and quite coarse spelt presence. This coarseness raise the effect of orange peels and coriander, which make the palate a lots livelier. Sweeter than usual Belgian White, with strong spices and yeast. Good lemon to round. Good! Hoppiness: Lemon and thin grass in nose, a lot stronger in taste. Bitterness is fairly strong for a lasting, mid-to-high astringent sweet-bitter finish. After Taste: Quite dry. Sweet, wheaty and bitter to mouth. Comments: Like most of 32’s line-ups, this Witbier is bold and expressive in wheaty aroma, orangey / spicy taste with a strong hoopinness. I think the spelt factor jack up its taste to another level without being unpleasant like most spelt beers do. Only the strong sweetness tilts its balance off a bit. Otherwise this is a good one to enjoy with friends!"

Surly Bitter Brewer;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Surly Brewing Company;"From Jul 2008 I got this can in a trade with Lofgrep. Thanks Peter! Another adventure into Surly-land. It pours from the 16oz can(it says 4%abv) into my New Belgium Imperial Pint glass a hazy orange gold. There's about a 1"" head of foam(which doesn't last very long) and there's some good lacing. The smell is very fruity. I get a lot of citrus but there's also a sweet fruity nose there as well. It's nice. The taste hits me with some caramel malt sweetness balanced by a good, but not over the top, hoppiness....definitely mostly pine but also some citrus with the grapefruit. The sweet fruit aspect that I mentioned in the nose is more subdued in the taste, darn it, but for a low abv brew, it *is* power packed with flavour and is *very* easy drinking. If I had something like this on tap at a local bar, I could easily session on it all night! No kidding. It's close enough to medium bodied that I'd call it medium bodied, carbonation is on the very light side of medium, and it finishes piney and very dry. Sometimes dry doesn't work for me but in this case, it's right up my alley. ;^) Bottom line: I really like this ""English Bitter"" though purists would probably say it's too bitter. I agree, basically, but it in no way impedes me from enjoying this brew. This is yet another winner from Surly!"

Big Horn Nefarious Nelson Stout;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Stout;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Sampler at RAM, Schaumburg. A lot of coffee, kind of a syrupy, almost Kahlua texture. Taste is a quite warming coffee roast, with some cacao nibs. I’m catching a bit of alcohol and a touch of vanilla. This could be something amazing if it were allowed to sit in a barrell for a while.

Big Horn Nefarious Nelson Stout;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Stout;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);(Ram Restaurant and Brewery, Schaumburg, IL) Draft... DLD’08... Clear black ale with a mid-sized, creamy, light brown head. Wafts of nutty, dark roast coffee and cocoa send my olfactory system into an ascending spin. Medium-bodied with bristly carbonation. Chocolaty with medium sweetness. Balanced decently by charcoal malts and moderately bitter, herbal lupulin. Chocolaty, coffee-dry finish. Surprisingly spot-on stout!
Big Horn Nefarious Nelson Stout;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Stout;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);This draft brew from the brewery in Chicago poured a medium sized head of foamy tan colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a semi-opaque dark ruby red brown colored body and a fair lacing. The almost non-existant aroma was malty. The semi-thick mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of malt hops and roasted malt. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.
Big Horn Nefarious Nelson Stout;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Stout;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);On tap at Ram - Schaumburg. This was a very pleasant surprise! Poured a beautiful deep brown with a thick, creamy cap of caramel head. Aroma was of deeply-roasted cocoa, coffee, and faint hints of herbal.. full and quite enticing! Flavor had a couple really nice levels of roasted chocolate.. first cocoa, then some darker chocolate.. coffee and faint grassy bitterness was quite complementary.. some dark fruits emerge at the back-end, and were quite welcome. Medium-bodied with nice depth of flavor.. very good mouthfeel.

Buttery malt aroma with a hint of honey. Sweet taste full of grainy golden syrup: like an all-butter flapjack. A little bitterness.

Big Rock XO Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Big Rock Brewery;Bottle. Another old Big rock rating. Yellow gold pour with a thin white bubbly head that soon dissipates.

Big Rock XO Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Big Rock Brewery;Hazy pale golden pour. White head. The aroma is fairly sweet with lots of DMS present up front. Fairly slick, almost greasy palate. I think that about says it all - down the drain with this beast.

Taste is very light with a hint of malt and a slight hint of fruit, nothing to interesting. Very little carbonation and no body. After taste is very watery and smooth, just like water. Overall, this beer is very bland offering nothing unique.
Big Rock XO Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Big Rock Brewery;Bought this one at The Beer Store in a variety 12-pack. XO, giving the impression of aged (like cognac), but not really. Talks about this on back label but does not mention anything about how long (so not really important and credible). Small white head, not lasting long, with a few wet spots of lace. Golden colour with little carbonation. Smells like wet hay and pee. Wet mouthfeel, wishing it was at least crisp (for a lager). Nope. A little bit of grass is felt to save the day, in the taste. Other than that, not much else. Short finish and overly boring.
Big Rock XO Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Big Rock Brewery;Straight from the can, no glass involved! Nice fresh hoppy aroma. Taste is ok, mild bitterness on the roof of the mouth. Very clean finish.
Big Rock XO Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Big Rock Brewery;"341ml bottle from The Beer Store. Pours light yellow. No real aroma. Not a lot of flavour, but nothing innoffensive either. Should be caled ""OK Lager""."

WJ King Birthday Beer;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;Gravity Cask @ Reading Beer Fesitval 07. Fruity slightly astringent. Odd yeasty nut finish. I wasnt too keen on this. I’ve found a similar odd flavour in some of their bottled beers which I’d assumed to be a bottling problem rather than house character.
WJ King Birthday Beer;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;A Mes rate: Gravicask @ Reading Beer Festival. Not the best way to start the festival but what I wanted had sold our already (thanks Ian) and this was near by. Has the looks of cold tea. Tea in the aroma also but backed up with some hops. Thank god the tea is missing from the flavour and it’s much better for it. Malty up front and then some nice citric hops to finish.
Alcazar Sheriffs Gold;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alcazar (Shipstone's);Small white lace. Thinn yellow color. A litle opaque. The aroma is small with some sulphur. Big bitterness but only small hop taste balanced by a too big sweetness for such a low alcohol beer.
Alcazar Sheriffs Gold;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alcazar (Shipstone's);Cask conditioned at Harbury Beer Fest ’09. Gold with white head. Light and a little thin, but with a sweetish malt and flowery hop, lemony and a decent bite. An enjoyable start to the Festival for me.

Alcazar Sheriffs Gold;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alcazar (Shipstone's);Gravity Cask @ Reading Beer Fesitval 07. Sweaty with sweat malt. Not too much to say as I didnt examine it too closely but doesnt drink to badly.
Alcazar Sheriffs Gold;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alcazar (Shipstone's);A Mes rate: Gravicask @ Reading Beer Festival. Sorry guys but this was awful. Eggy sulphuric aroma. Looks like it hasn’t settled properly. Golden body filled with some very very fine floaters. Flavour of bleach and swimming pools with just a lick of malt at the finish being its only saving grace. Very poor.

Pours a clear pale straw yellow with a fizzy white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma is full of stale bread with some corn and sweet grains. Flavor has a combination of straw and stale bread with a bit of corn underlying.
Sol Cero;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Low / No Alcohol Beer;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Smells of rotting bread. Has a decent head and an okay lager-type body.As for flavour, it’s all wet bread with an overarching hint of caramel. Watery mouthfeel. Another big fail in the non-alcohol department.
Sol Cero;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Low / No Alcohol Beer;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Can of 355 ml. There are so many Sol beers out there lately and one seems to be worse than the other, let’s see how this one is doing.  Pours a golden yellow colour with a one finger head, good retention although it looks quite soapy. A light aroma of corn which it wouldn’t be that bad, only it reminds of corn flakes in milk. Taste is like you’ re drinking that milk, aweful!  As for mouthfeel, watery and no carbonation at all.  This one tastes and smells and feels so skunked, It’s like they invented a can that allows sunlight to get through it and spoil your beer.
Sol Cero;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Low / No Alcohol Beer;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Cannette bue à Playa Del Carmen. Pas vraiment d’arôme, peu de goût et arrière goût un peu désagréable.

Otokoyama (Mans Mountain) Naturally Pure Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Asahikawa-shi , Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Otokoyama Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Served at Sanraku japanese restaurant in san francisco. This has been my go to sake for many years and is hard to find. Beautifully clear. Slightly sweet aroma. Delicate floral notes. Perfection.
Otokoyama (Mans Mountain) Naturally Pure Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Asahikawa-shi , Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Otokoyama Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle thanks to my dad who apparently regularly gets this stuff...news to me...Pours as clear as water with strong legs. Aroma is on the sweetish side with berries, marzipan, and honeydew. Complex yet a bit light. Taste is very sweet and amazingly smooth, perfectly balanced with absolutely no alcohol presence what-so-ever. Very, very well balanced. Smooth, full mouthfeel, amazing stuff!
Otokoyama (Mans Mountain) Naturally Pure Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Asahikawa-shi , Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Otokoyama Shuzo Co., Ltd.;$185 750mL bottle split with a friend and Oishii in Boston! From first sniff to the first sip, I was in love. My first daiginjo, so take this rating with a grain of salt, but I must admit, I was quite shocked. I was expecting daiginjos to be the austere, conservative, flawless/perfectly executed type, but perhaps lacking a bit in some funky character. Nope, not this one anyways. Legs and all, with as clear and clean an appearance as I’ve seen. Fruity notes abound and it almost seems to have as much body and substance to it as a nigori. But yet, the liquid never seems heavy nor does drinking the stuff get fatiguing. Rich, but yet spritzy and playful, with tangerines, apricots, peaches and rosehips. Wow. Sensory overload and truly divine. Worth the price tag, in my mind. The flavor somewhat outdid the aroma in sheer complexity.
Otokoyama (Mans Mountain) Naturally Pure Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Asahikawa-shi , Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Otokoyama Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"My tongue is tingling while I’m walking through the parking lot towards Rangetsu, my favorite restaurant. I approach the bar and as I’m sitting down I order a bottle of this. ""Are you sure?"" asks the bartender. ""Definitely."" This isn’t my first encounter with this sake, nor will it be my last. ""Well, the manager keeps it locked up in a refrigerator in the office, I’ll be right back."" Shortly thereafter a wooden box is presented to me in the same fashion a rare diamond might be carefully handed over to someone who has no means to procure it. The manager, the bartender and the others at the bar are silent. All eyes on the fool who just ordered the $250 bottle of sake. I produce a crystal glass from my pocket and begin to pour. Suddenly, I am alone. The experience, from the first twist of the cap, to the last drop disappearing from the glass, is always surreal, transcendent. The liquid pours out in a silken fashion, crystal clear and quiet. It’s like staring through a window, one that just had a foggy mist wiped from it. On the other side is a lush green mountainside, and a look into the distant future. The whole event brings with it a keen sense of meditation and contemplation. The nose is very light but sufficiently aromatic. White flowers parade forward with stunning delicacy. Rainwater and hints of pear and Kaffir lime coalesce and disperse across my tongue, giving each sip a sense of divinity. The flavor is as soft and pure as glacial water. Notes of exotic soft-skinned tree fruits balance a graceful employment of earthiness. Tea leaves and very mild acidity dice through minimal sweetness like razor wire. Slight hints of melon are imparted with a gentle caress. The mouthfeel is as soft as a cloud, ultimately light-bodied. Alcohol is never noticeable, even in the enduring finish. So many years. So many sakes. To find one that crushes everything in its complexity, destroys all competition with its truthful purity, is such a rewarding experience. Divine Droplets are these, a regal nectar that gleefully thwarts any futile attempt at toppling its elegance from the aforementioned brand, or any other unworthy contender. This is the absolute, unequivocal benchmark for sake. Almost perfect."
Selins Grove Baltic Raspberry Porter;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Aroma: raspberry seeds/hairs/skins, slight tartness--like the kriek Appearance: reddish brown, small white head Flavor: nice tartness, some chocolate, some raspberry seeds/hairs/stems Palate: little lite, chcolate covered raspberry aftertaste
Selins Grove Baltic Raspberry Porter;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. Purple and brown colored body with little to no head. Fruit syrup nose of plum, black cherry and mostly raspberries, with only a light porter presence. Flavor is more of this syrupy fruit flavoring, moderately thick, very lightly tart and punchy - overall very tasty and easy to drink, but not a runaway winner. Too syrupy, artificial tasting, floral, etc, with minimal porter character.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;Chestnut brown pour, thick white head. Dried apricot molasses and malt. I wouldn’t describe this as a Weizen Bock, but still a tasty ale.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;Sampled from a bottle, this beer had a dark brown pour into the glass and gave a small off-white cover that receded to a small ring and a few islands of bubbles, it was a dark red at the edges of the glass when held up to a lamp, the nose had aromas of raisin and date with a prominent dark fruit sweetness, toasted bread and bread crust, melanoidins, some hints of chocolate here and there, the flavors were bread with some dark fruit (though not as much dark fruit as I thought it would be based on the nose), some melanoidins, a little spice and some bread sweetness, the mouth feel was medium to full, it layered on the tongue, it felt creamy and had average carbonation, the nose was pretty good and big, the flavor was not as big as I thought it would be from the nose, it was sweeter on the nose than the flavor, it was an ok drink.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;12 oz bottle. Pours a red brown with a very off-white head. Intense banana toffee and some strawberry in the aroma. Toffee flavor with some wheat and some weizen yeast. A touch of an off flavor as well. Not enough to make it unpleasant by any means. Decent beer.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light clove/nuttiness, slight chocolate, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light clove/nuttiness, slight chocolate, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light herbal bitterness/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good weizenbock style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;21-Feb-11 (12-oz sample bottle: Free bottle for stewarding the 2008 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) This beer pours dark ruddy-brown with half an inch of tan head that fizzles away to a wide ring and dusting. The nose is very fruity, with raisin, banana, apple, and fig, plus brown sugar and cola. The fruitiness continues on the palate, again with the raisin, apple, and brown sugar, but the sweetness is sugary, the darker malts are vague, and the yeast character is barely noticeable. Medium-plus in weight, though much of that is from residual sugar, and the carbonation is medium-high and distracting. Not bad, but too much emphasis on the fruity character, and not enough on malt or yeast.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;Nitro… RBSG 2010… Clear, beautiful copper ale with a mid-sized, creamy, khaki head. Lengthy retention. Caramel and toffee dominate the bouquet, but a rumor of banana works its way into the mix. Full-bodied and creamy with tame carbonation. The sweet flavor renders caramel and banana with a whisper of clove. Low bitterness. Not a lot of chocolate. The flavor eventually fades to a sticky-sweet wet dream.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;4-30-08 on tap. Brown minimal beige head. Aroma very faint combo of banana and caramel. Flavor is pretty much spot on. Banana, prune, raisin, clove. Slightly boozy, thins it out a tad too much. Other than the lack of aroma, this is pretty solid.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;MBG Winterfest 2010. Poured hazy dark brown color with a large off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate spicy toasted malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium toasted sweet flavor with a medium sweet and small alcohol bite finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable brew.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;MiBG Winter Fest 2010: Ruby brown with a very good creamy off-white head. The aroma has the expected banana, clove and bubblegum esters along with some red wheat, walnut and roasted malt character. The taste is twangy fruits and light yeasty spice in play along with the wheat and roasted malt tones. Light alcohol presence towards the end. The mouth feel is lively and chalky. An okay example of the style.
Dragonmead St. Nicoles Weizenbock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Dragonmead Brewery;Beer #36 of 42 at GTMW, 8-8-09. I wanted to try one of their meads, but all out! So I’ve got this treat instead. It is a dark, weizenbock appearance, a thin but foamy head. Good beer smell, rich in malts. Good bock taste, like dark wheat bread. Very slight bit of estery fruitiness.

Yupp, totally pale, clear and almost transparent in the looks, well actually it looks just like water this, and it has a small quickly completely gone top. Don’t know what it looked like.. Sweet with apples and some canned pear on the nose. Not much more really. Average on the carbonation and light sticky in the mouthfeel. It actually taste a bit of pear this. Not only apples, but they are definitely also present. A bit to sweet and artificial to be classified as easy drinking’, but also this one was possible to finish the glass. Yeah, thanks Gunnar! 18.10.2012
Berentsens Pærecider;Egersund, Norway;Perry;Berentsens Brygghus;Biggish coarse white head quickly disappears entirely with a soft, crackling sound. Clear very pale greenish yellow body. Strong pear jam aroma with perfumy floral notes. Unusual. Sweet sugary pear jam taste with vaguely earthy, herbal notes. Mid-bodied. Sweet honey and pear aftertaste with faint cinnamon notes. Well, for a cider it isn’t bad at all. Very clean, but too sweet, and lacking in freshness. (0.5l can, Meny Ringnes Park, Oslo.)

Aroma is sugary apple juice and candy tones. Meh. Taste is sugary apple candy tones, as well. Not too good, but barely passable I guess. Body is thin and watery. No, on second thought: this is pretty much like the other ""ciders"" out there in the Norwegian grocery store segment - not good (real apples or not)."
Berentsens Eplecider;Egersund, Norway;Apple Cider;Berentsens Brygghus;0.33l bottle shared with The Tasting Crew. It’s definitely what you can call clear and pale in the color. Perhaps a swiff of something sea-green and the head is bubbly and transparent. Oh, the aroma takes me back to my youth. Sweet and apply with a gummy bear candy touch as well. Not much more going on here. Oh, it’s aggressive on the carbonation and thin and sticky-sweet mouthfeel. The taste has tons of sugary sweet yellow apples. Tastes a bit like the juice on canned pears. I have no problems finishing my glass, but I think that’s about my limit. Thanks Gunnar! 18.10.2012

Mikkeller X Imperial Stout 2007;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;A special treat from the brewers private cellar. Thanks alot for the chance to taste this black X. The pour is realy black and almost oily with s very dark brown head. I dont recal I have seen a darker head than this. The nose is packed with laqurice, brown sugar and alcohol mixed up with a vinoes and sweet side. There is some vanilla, som oak and something that reminds me of oil from a ferrys machineroom. The taste is enourmous - so huge that it fills up every little part of your mouth. There are some sweet chocolate, cinamon, burned malts, coffee and dried fruits. The palate is picking and sticky. In the finish therede is a balanced sweetness and bitterness with notes of cherrys.. Excelent. Thanks M

Mikkeller X Imperial Stout 2007;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;"Tasted at the WLV tasting. I agree with 17th that this was a wonderful and delicious treat. Perhaps I was a bit toasty by the time this one came out, but I definately found to be better than what the rest of the chi-town crew are giving it. So it goes I suppose. Deep black pour with very little in the way of head. Aromas were very unusual. Chocolate, coffee, soy sauce, some very herbacious notes, licorice. I could keep my nose over this all day. Flavors folow suite, roasty, chocolate, soy, some other elements that are hard to define... especially cause I lost my notes from that day :*( I agree that there wasnt a strong or rather identifiable brett character, though I’m not sure what it would be like in a 15% stout anyway. In any case I am very glad to have been able to try this rare treat and am very much looking forwarf to trying the barrel aged version this summer ;)"
Mikkeller X Imperial Stout 2007;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;Shared at WLV liquors... Thank you Ted for keeping this one for so long! Out of the 30 beers we tasted this day this one stood out the most... and in a good way regardless of what these others say on here =p shame shame. Strong varnish aroma, spicy, nutty and some plums. Pours very dark brown. Sweet raisin, plum and cherry flavors, some chocolate and soy as well.
Mikkeller X Imperial Stout 2007;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;huge thanks to the folks at wlv who shared this rare gem. . a dark brown our almost black with no head whatsoever.... ghastly aroma of sour, spoiled vegetables and soy which i couldn’t quite stand.... flavors didn’t help out at all either. sweet, sour, chocolate, seaweed, spoiled vegetables which was difficult to keep down.....this one garnered a wide variety of reactions. some liked it and found it very unique. i thought that it was pretty different in a bad way. my facial reaction really showed it all. i’m glad i don’t have a picture of it. i’m hoping that i can attribute this to a poorly mishandled bottle.
Mikkeller X Imperial Stout 2007;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;bottle. pours black with no head. an odd aroma, extremely vegetal, soy, and some chemical i can’t put my finger on, there seems to be some cherry notes in there as well. flavors are chocolatey, soy, and herbs. perhaps this has aged horribly. i didn’t get any brett either. alcohol was pretty well hidden for 15% but this is just a mess of a beer. in the end pantanap’s face and the instant almost depressive episode afterwards gave the best review of this beer. cheer up bud, you’ll be drinking M soon I thought.
Mikkeller X Imperial Stout 2007;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;Sampled by bottle at West Lake View Tasting. So I was really excited the good people at WLV decided to open this one up for this generous tasting. But I was blown away (in the opposite direction) by this one. Pours brown black with no head. This nose says this beer had bottling problems or was seriously abused by heat. Vegetables, soy sauce, and fresh hops before they are even thrown in the boil. Sweet flavors. Chocolate, roasted malts, and booze. Full chunky body. Touch of alcohol with a harsh and nearly unbearable soy sauce. What’s goin on here? No brett detected and its kinda the let down of the year. Terrible.
Mikkeller X Imperial Stout 2007;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;Draught at Copenhagen Beerfestival 2007. Pitch black colour with a white head. Aroma of sweetness, roastedness and vanilla. Also flavour of roastedness, vanilla, chocolate, sweetness and with a strong alcoholic finish. I would like to taste this beer again after cellered a couple of years.
Mikkeller X Imperial Stout 2007;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;Motor oil looks, headless. A very intense, port-wine like nose with hugely concentrated sugars immediately reminiscent of brown sugar. Fortunately, it has this grapey vinous character that saves it from being an unjustified sugar fest. It is dense dark fruits, admittedly complex malts from the beginning until the end. Blackberries, ink, tar, oil… Not very beery in the end. Hugely alcoholic and syrupy with the limited carbonation. Pure sugary experiment, playing with desserts, molasses intensity. A bum with a citric character. Obviously aiming at pushing the boundaries of craft brewing further. It is appreciated, I enjoy the end, but the means, not completely.

First it is nicely woody and its raspberry flavours are very well extracted, but the palate did not protrude as much sourness as I would have hoped and the result feels extremely sweet to the point of being sticky despite the very high carbonation. The alcohol is also well upfront. Raspberry waffled with ginger and soaked in rum.

It’s finally back and not from a barrel!. Pours a lightly hazed bronze with fluffy white head. Nose is actually citrusy and fruity, hints of tart wheat, restrained yeast character and noted ethanol. On tasting, medium-high bitterness, much lighter body than expected. Was anticipating more of a barleywine character. Alcohol is definitely noted, but not all bad. Fruity and lightly sweet but balanced. The citrusy notes are definitely welcome.

Goose Island Wheatmiser;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at the Clybourne location. Pale golden pour. The nose is intensely sweet with a lot of candyish and cotton candy aroma. Very sugary palate with a real tooth-aching sweetness. A little bit of peach and rotted fruit. Vegetal and DMS laden. Herbal hoppiness but nothing could even come close to balancing all of the unfermented, underattenuated malt sugars in here. Gak!
Goose Island Wheatmiser;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at GI Clybourn served in a snifter. Slightly hazed copper pour with a thin head of lasting tan foam. Okay lacing. The aroma was a little dull for a beer this big. Some toasted wheat followed by some faint caramel notes.

Goose Island Wheatmiser;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Goblet poured draft at the Clybourne brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours an orangey amber! Light haze, moderate offwhite head that sticks around and laces pretty damn well. Aromas are wheaty malts, cereal with some toffee sweetness, a touch fruity with some darker bits and a bit of booziness. Some grapefruit citrus, caramel come in stronger as it warms a bit. Initial is warming booziness, an imperial wheat throws some bigger but smooth sweetness, toffee and graininess. Hops come in fairly strong but taper down. Citrusy grapefruit and a bit of other fruitiness comes (Pear? Apricot?) In with some warming booziness. Lighter on the palate, delicate with pretty good sweetness and decent hop balance. Finish is warming, sweet, with ok hoppy balance.

Cumberland Dortmunder;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Cumberland Brews (US);"I had this last night under the title ""Dorkmonster"" - they still tagged it as a dry hopped dortmunder, so I am guessing it is the same brew.

Awesome refreshing citrus wheaty hoppy flavor. NOT to style reallt, but quite pleasing. Medium to lite body with medium carbonation. Overall: great summer brew."

Aroma is sweet and roasty chocolate and espresso, with some earthy hops. Flavor is the same. A bit creamy mouthfeel. A solid porter, on the sweet and moderately hoppy, but still very easy-drinking side.
Boulder Creek San Lorenzo Porter;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Porter;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;I am a big fan of porters. But their porter missed the mark to me. Nice deep dark color and great lacing, but way too hoppy for a porter. The chocolate malt was masked by the bitterness, which should not happen in a porter, for me.

Quite ok to sniff on for a while. Also a fine balanced sweetness for a beer like this. And a mellow carbonation level that made it easy to drink. Boozy, but no sticky alcohol.

Strong aroma of pear syrup, Turkish delight, candied plum, earth, roasted peanut, milk chocolate, herbal liqueur, green tea. Taste is medium to heavy malty sweet, pure candied plum & Turkish delight with a caramelly edge & a dash of pear syrup; light herbal bitter middle offers balance, notes of cookie spices, green tea, bit roasted, chocolatey & nutty. Dryish, herbal & peppery hoppy finish, lingering caramel, plum & nuts, and a firm dash of warming herbal liqueur alcohol. Medium to full body, oily-syrupy texture, soft carbonation. Funny to discover this is inspired by Rochefort and the likes, with Mikkeller making an over-the-top version of it."

Grizzly Paw Springbock;Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;So as not to add another springbock to this brewery I will add this review here. This latest one is called Axis and Allies Maibock. Anyways, pint on tap at the brewery pours a clear golden color with a small white head that leaves very little if any lacing on the glass. Aroma is grass and grains. Taste is a grass hop bitterness with a grassy malt sweetness. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this brew is average at best for the style.
Grizzly Paw Springbock;Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;"Draft at the brewpub; bright golden and quite still. Light malty aroma. Smooth drinker. Sharp and biting flavor with a big cerealy malt undertow; little to this distinguishes it from a common American lager. Where’s it’s warming aspect you’d want from a Maibock? Bland. (#2882, 5/14/2007)"
Grizzly Paw Springbock;Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;"The new seasonal, and quite a disappointment. Bright, clear straw yellow with a thin white head. Very faint aroma, grainy and wet hair (dirty lines?). Quite light, quite carbonated, and quite featureless unfortunately. The bartender reassures me that there is ""a mild hop presence"", but I can’t find it. It may be because I had this after the IPA."

Hadrian & Border Cowie;Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hadrian Border Brewery;Strong sparkler white foam covers the golden body veiled by a light haze. Well hopped this! Highly flowery, lightly lemony and brightly extracted. Firm bitterness in the finish. Really drinkable, but perhaps a bit too grainy in its maltiness that does not really follow any other discipline. I found it to be a very impressive and tasty low ABV ale, perhaps one of the nicest cask ale I’ve had in Scotland and I’m afraid to say that unsurprisingly, it is not Scottish.

In the mouth it first gives apples, then fills out to a malty bitterness. After swallowing, count to 5, and then a wonderful wave of slightly doughy malt will hit you. The finish is also very bitter, later it becomes zesty orange. Everything you could ask for in a bitter. Very caramelly too.

There’s a lot going on in the taste of this beer... chocolate and coffee in the malt, a bit sweet, but also a strong dry hops kick with grapefruit, lemon, pineapple.

Breconshire End of the Road;Brecon, Powys, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Breconshire Brewery;Cask half-pint at NERAX on 5/3/07 Frothy white head is small, but provides messy lacing. Body is not completely bright and a very brassy-golden color. Sulphur, though very faint, is detectable in the nose (as it was in their other beer this year, the Welsh Pale Ale). Very fruity, ripe yellow fruit esters, with hard water-like minerals and a creamy, wheat-like nuttiness. Some hop bitterness is noted, but surprisingly very little aroma. Maybe these are the last of this hop for a good reason? Don’t know, but the stuff, even discounting the sulphur, seemed very underwhelming, as did the Welsh Pale this year, the Golden Valley and Fan Dance last year. Not any significant character, and a weak strength of aroma at that. Still a trace of sulphur in the flavor, with light saltiness and grainy malts. Some fruity, citrusy hops help bolster the overall flavor and some herbal tanginess is contributed from the hop as well, but the malts only show a pinch of sweet pale maltiness at best, and mostly range from nutty to grainy and are quite bland through and through. Other than the fruitiness and hop bitterness, I don’t find a single interesting character in this beer. Lots of hard mineral character as well. Medium-light to light-bodied, slight wateriness, but appropriate for style. No alcohol noted, no flaws but for the light sulphur. This hop taste like a mix of Northern Brewer, Tettnang and Amarillo. Interesting and very weird.
Breconshire End of the Road;Brecon, Powys, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Breconshire Brewery;Cask gravity at Reading BF 2007. Copper/gold. Not much condition. Bit farty, bit minerally in mouth, bit of tangerine maybe. Some dryness on finish, slightly juicy in mouth.

As a result, at the Chippenham beer festival it was the stouts and porters I hit first, which were unconvincing. Returning to milds, I was reminded of how great this style is - my doubts are over, milds reamin as my favourite style! This one is slightly smokey with a hint of coffee and a bit of toffee. Finishes with sweet malts and goes down a treat. Good stuff!

Flowerpots Pots Black;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Mild Ale;Flowerpots;[i] [b] Cask, gravity at the Flowerpots brewpub, Cheriton, Hampshire 6th June 2008 [/i] [/b] Pours very dark brown fading to a mid brown towards the edges. Nose was quite nice and very traditional methinks, with some good solid roasty and woody notes. Tasted very traditional and whilst it initially impressed I felt that it started to lack little as I go down it but interestingly aside from the gentle roasted flavours there was a slightly sour edge and I think that this was intentional with also some nice gentle hoppy flavours coming through, not bad.
Flowerpots Pots Black;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Mild Ale;Flowerpots;Cask gravity at Reading BF. Decent condtion. OK for a 3.2% mild. It was good, nice mild.

5 Seasons North Sgt. Schultzs Hefeweizen;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons North;On tap at the brewpub. An odd hefe, for me at least, in that it smells not just better than average for style, but a bit better than it tastes. The feel may be the low point as this is thin to the point of watery, partly doe to a somewhat low carbonation level. Mild for style, with a rather bready aftertaste rather than just bananas and clove.
5 Seasons North Sgt. Schultzs Hefeweizen;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons North;Comes out of the tap hazy hay-golden with a fairly thick eggshell head. Strong, wheaty aroma has firm citrus and yeasty undertones plus a hint of malt. Flavor trots wheat, citrus and malt notes across the palate, with malt and a bit of hops in the background. Texture is fairly firm, smooth yet lively. You don’t have to know much to appreciate a good Hefe.

5 Seasons North Sgt. Schultzs Hefeweizen;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons North;On tap at the brewpub in Alpharetta - cloudy, murky medium golden pour with a crisp, yet fluffy white head. Clean, fragrant estery aroma, cloves, bubblegu - there are in there. Flavor of bananas, but not contrived - nice and natural. Extremely thick mouthfeel for a Hefe. Overall, an excellent Hefe - the North branch seems to be on the same high level as their original.
5 Seasons North Sgt. Schultzs Hefeweizen;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons North;I wish this had more head, but that could be a sympton of the sample pour. The full hefeweizen glass pour that I saw after making my rating certainly had plenty of head and it lasted. Cloudy yellow. Great banana aroma. Good wheat underneath. The only problem I had with the beer is the flavor is almost too sweet.

5 Seasons North Doctor Moran's Dunkelweizen;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;5 Seasons North;Taps barely translucent chocolate brown with a fair buff head. Aroma offers caramel, toasted malt, wheat and banana notes. Flavor ups the banana and wheat character, but retains the malt and downplays the caramel. Body is about average, while tingle has some good life. Ask for a prescription.
5 Seasons North Doctor Moran's Dunkelweizen;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;5 Seasons North;Tap at 5 seasons North. Pours a deep dark woody brown with a good beige head- fades a bit over time. Aroma is banana and clove-typical hefe yeast, with some spritzy and spicy phenolics - peppery and zesty with earth and a good doughy deep caramel and nutty malt character. Flavor is initially sweet with caramel malts, toast, and bread with more banana and clove and a doughy light chocolate nutty hint. Very smooth overall with a slight salty slick kick that I get from a few dunkels- nice. Pretty good for a dunkelweizen.
5 Seasons North Doctor Moran's Dunkelweizen;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;5 Seasons North;Appearance: Dark brown, near black body with some slight garnet-hued edges and a smallish, off-white head. Smell: Aroma smelling of chocolate bars and caramel-covered wheat with only a faint note of banana. Taste: Roasty wheat flavor with tastes of chocolate and weak coffee. Bits of dark caramel sweetness on-hand. As it warms a bit, a more apparent wheat tanginess develops. Very light banana fruitiness. A drying nuttiness emerges even as the chocolate persists. Vague spicy hop character, though almost no bitterness. Finishes dry with an earthy taste of wheat and chocolate. Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: Quite nice! More out-and-out chocolate flavor than I find in most dunkelweizens. It makes for a nice surprise, like finding a piece of chocolate on a hotel pillow. That was a piece of chocolate on the hotel pillow, right?

Ksiaz Ksiazecy Specjal (Mocne);Warszawa, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg Polska;Plechovka 500 ml. Aroma je příjemně sladové s jemným květinovým nádechem. Pěna je jasně bílá, jemná, středně vysoká a mizící. Barva samotného piva je zlatá. Chuť je sladová s alkoholovým obalem, nepříliš pestrá a fádní, finiš je velmi slabý, nehořký. V ústech pivo působí vodově a je poměrně těžké, má střední říz. Celkově se jedná o nepříliš chutný silný ležák, který není ani nijak vysoké pitelnosti.

O'Fallon Whiskey Barrel Smoked Porter;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;O'Fallon Brewery;Tasted on 3/28/12 from a waxed and capped 650mL bomber bottle purchased at West Lakeview Liquors, I believe that this is the 2010 bottling, 587/2398. Pours an opaque, dark cola brown with a thin tan head that leaves an average collar of lace. The nose is smoked dark malt, with coffee, dark chocolate, a hint of molasses, and just a touch of maple and vanilla from the very subdued oak treatment. The flavor is fairly subtle, with the smoke really coming through nicely, with some cola, dark chocolate, and then the very subdued oak once again. The body is just lighter than medium with average carbonation and a long cola, dark chocolate, and smoked finish.
O'Fallon Whiskey Barrel Smoked Porter;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;O'Fallon Brewery;Bottle. Pours dark brown with ruby highlights and a medium sized beige head. The aroma was moderately smoky, roasted malt with moderate whisky barrel notes. The flavor has well blended notes of smoke, whiskey, roasted malts, barrel. Fairly nice flavor and only comes in at 6%.
O'Fallon Whiskey Barrel Smoked Porter;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;O'Fallon Brewery;Black pour from bottle. Minimal head. Body is light. Massive whiskey in the nose with added licorice and maple syrup. Mostly whiskey and wood. Flavor captures a more subtle version of the smell. More subdued in whiskey, but it is still very much in the finish. Very light and quite smokey. Little else comes through in this disappointing beer. Thin and watery.
O'Fallon Whiskey Barrel Smoked Porter;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;O'Fallon Brewery;Bottle poured into a snifter. Pours black with frothy tan head. Aroma of smoke and firewood and oddly, bacon. I don’t get any bourbon barrel at all. Taste is mildly sweet and bitter, a bit medicinal. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and watery, good carbonation. Disappointing that I didn’t get any of the bourbon or vanilla character that I would expect.
O'Fallon Whiskey Barrel Smoked Porter;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;O'Fallon Brewery;Received in trade from jtrockchalk, thanks for the opportunity. Pours a solid dark brown and faint ruby highlights when held to light. Thinnish off white head lingers for a short while and leaves minimal lacing. Smell is bourbon up front and strong. Some smoky peat a bit of chocolate some wood as well. Taste is a bourbony oaky affair with some roast bitterness at the finish. The mouthfeel is oily/watery. I think the underlying porter doesn’t have enough body to stand up to the thinning properties of the bourbon barrel. Carbonation is light. I actually enjoyed this one a lot, but would have loved it with a thicker body.
Karlsson Devils Backbone;Sandy, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Karlsson Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. A hazy copper colored beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet malty with primary notes of caramel, but also light notes of bourbon and alcohol. The flavor is very powerful with notes of bourbon, alcohol, and over ripe fruits, leadin to a dry woody finish.
Karlsson Devils Backbone;Sandy, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Karlsson Brewing Co.;From a tap at Oak’s Bottom and Concordia Alehouse in Portland--Poured a deep mahogany chestnut amber-orange. Tan small fluffy head. Nose of high alcohol heat and musty fruit cough syrup. Thick, resinous piny hops and sweet and cloying malts. Bubblegum and sticky fruit finish with a fleeting buttery texture. Oaky, woody and quite a strange blend of flavors, though most enjoyable.
Karlsson Devils Backbone;Sandy, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Karlsson Brewing Co.;On tap at Oak’s Bottom. Aroma of maraschino cherries, white toast & a bit of nail polsh. An IIPA without hop aroma?-- maybe under the chemical smell. silky o the tongue, almost hot pin-pricks into the tongue. Dark orange color w/ chino colored head, tin but peristent, hops express in the flavor, though still the solvent presence w/ hints of dired cherry, grapefuit & bubblegum. could be a good English strong if the chemical presence was gone or hidden.
RAXX Bartlite;Riverside, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;No real aroma. A clear gold color. Somewhat crisp, no malt backbone, very wattery. Actually the flavor profile could say carbonated water with mild hop flavor. Very unimpressive.
RAXX Gold Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;This was pretty much the same beer as the Bartlite except it was less wattery. I could taste a little more malt or grain as well. More crisp than the Bartlite. Gold in color. Light in body. Meh.
RAXX Raspberry Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;A nice mild raspberry aroma that smells pretty natural surprisingly. This beer is a clear yellow. The flavor is a very smooth and sweet. Almost tea like. A buddy of mine was asking for more beer flavor and compared it to Nestea or a fruit water. It wasnt bad, just not very beerlike.
RAXX Rain Cross Hefeweizen;Riverside, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;murky apricot color with no head. very faint wheat nose. bitingly fizzy and almost flavorless save a little wheat note in the finish and the lager yeast phenols. this place gives you 6 tasters for $6, not bad, even if its crappy brewpub beers.
RAXX Rain Cross Hefeweizen;Riverside, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;On draft at brewery, 02/11/08. Yellow with almost no cloudiness (despite the claims of not being filtered). Thin skin of white foam for a head. Aroma is very sweet, like confectioner’s sugar. Some sweet fruits also present. Still carbonated after quite some time. Wheat flavor present with only the mildest hint of banana. Some vague sweetness. No hop character I could discern. Due to mixup with taster, I thought this was the blonde lager at first: not a good mark on this beer’s flavor profile.
RAXX Rain Cross Hefeweizen;Riverside, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;On tap at RAXX. Clear yellow with no head. Banana aroma. Orange and clove taste with a disappointing palate and finish.
RAXX Rain Cross Hefeweizen;Riverside, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;A sweet wheat aroma with a slight fruitiness. Faint, faint banana. It is a nice bright yellowish orange color. Probably their best looking beer. Flavor is a slight clovey sweetness. Pretty carbonated. I could see this being good on a hot day. One of their better beers, but that does not say too much.
RAXX Red Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;A little hops in the aroma. Both some citrus and some earth. The beer is a dark amber/red color. The flavor is somewhat watery, but it is smooth and hoppy. Although somewhere in there is an unclean earthy grainyness. No real sweetness. It was pretty smooth despite the shortcomings. Crisp and hoppy on the palate, but not too full bodied or resiny. There really is something going on here with the water or the lines because alot of the beers have this wierd ass uncleanliness to them

RAXX Pullman Pale Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;On draft at brewery, 02/11/08. Clear yellow, lots of carbonation. No detectable aroma. Subtle sweet maltiness up front, a little grapefruit hoppiness at the end. Unexceptional.
RAXX Pullman Pale Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;On tap at RAXX. Clear golden amber with creamy white head. Malty aroma witha a sweet taste a good bitter bite with citrus notes and a bready finish.
RAXX Pullman Pale Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;A mild hoppy and grainy aroma. Somewhat bready as well. This beer had the best head retention of them all and was a nice orange golden color. A nice piney flavor. It is pleasantly crisp and hoppy. Not alot of malt backbone, definitley more so in the nose. A dry mouthfeel as well. A nice beer.
RAXX Stout;Riverside, California, United States;Stout;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;Bottle (leftover judging beer from 2006 GABF labeled Brazen Hussy Oatmeal Stout) poured a translucent brownish black with a minimal tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, coffee, bakers cocoa and a hint of vanilla. Palate was light bodied, crisp and slightly tart. Flavors of coffee, roasted malt and a hint of cocoa with a lingering bitter finish.
RAXX Stout;Riverside, California, United States;Stout;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;On tap at RAXX. Reddish brown with a creamy tan head. Sweet aroma with roasty, grainy, and chocolate notes. Medium bodied palate. Sweet roasty taste, milk chocolate, and a cereal taste to the finish.
RAXX Stout;Riverside, California, United States;Stout;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;This was on a nirtro tap. It had a really pleasant sweet malt aroma. A little bit of hoppy chocolate. Poured black with a tan velvetty head. The flavor is mocha and coffee with a nice dash of crisp citrus hops, but not overpowering or unbalanced at all. Mostly on the backend do the hops come through. The mouthfeel is dry and roasty. Somewhat full bodied. One of their best beers by far.
RAXX Schwarzbier;Riverside, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;The aroma is mildew and some malt. WOW, probably one of the worst smelling beers I have ever encountered. Black in color with no real head. Flavor is sweatsocks, malt, and mildew. Not good at all. Obviously not the flavor the brewmaster was going for. It was light bodied for how dark it was if that can be a plus.
RAXX Double IPA;Riverside, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;On tap at RAXX. Clear orange amber with a creamy white head. Aroma of caramel, grapefruit, and yeast. Thick sticky palate. Citrus and pine taste, some caramel sweetness, and a slightly bitter finish.
RAXX Double IPA;Riverside, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;Some citrus aroma, but not overwhelming. Some sweet malt as well. Beer is a muddy orange red color, and looks as if it is unfiltered. Initial flavor is pine and citrus hops balanced by some sweet caramel malts. It is a pretty balanced DIPA, but pretty underwhelming actually. Not very impressive, but not bad. There is also alot of alcohol in the flavor which is pretty strange being that it is so balanced by hops and malt. Full bodied with some dry resiny hops and tons of alcohol.
John Harvards Munich Dunkel Lager;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap. Toasty, raisiny, caramelly, earthy. Gritty earth. Quite German. Didn’t write much down about it, but it’s my favorite JH brew to date.
John Harvards Munich Dunkel Lager;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at JH. Pours a deep red with a very small white head. Aroma is pretty sweet, with rhubarb and light fruits, and some light wheaty lager malt. Flavor of sweet and light malts, some buttery popcorn. A little bland but not bad overall.
John Harvards Munich Dunkel Lager;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;"Tap at the Lake Grove location: Pours a deep brown/amber color with good clarity, topped by a creamy tan head. Aroma is sweetly malty and appetizing; toasty caramel. Has a nice creamy texture with velvety carbonation. Roasty malt flavors give off chocolate-like hints, and almost a maple-ish sweetness. There are also hazelnut flavors in the background with a balancing toasty dry finish. A solid Dunkel."
John Harvards Munich Dunkel Lager;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Clear dark amber with pretty much zero head - somewhat light, fruity aroma (some touches of cherry, mostly) - the flavor up front is dominated by caramel sweetness, and some hints of roasted nuts - however, this gets washed away quickly by a clean, almost watery, far too sudden finish - it’s like the beer doesn’t know if it wants to be full and flavorful, or light and quaffable - decent flavor, but a little uninteresting.
John Harvards Munich Dunkel Lager;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;The last batch of this beer (the first by the current brewer [Dave?]) was really good. Unfortunately, I am rating the newest batch which is not as good. Tap at brewpub, dark amber color, clear beer but dark enough that you cannot see through it. Some light streaks at the bottom of the pint glass. Aroma is light lagered fruitiness as well as light prototypical German maltiness (very clean). Taste is again a very clean malt, well lagered. Light bitterness at the end of it all. A very good replication of a style that has a lot more potential. A decent thirst quencher but not worth a return visit, unless I get a caramel bomb like the first batch.
Bethlehem Brew Works Pre-Prohibition Pilsner;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap at the Bethlehem location. Poured a medium yellow color with an averaged sized white head. Aromas of citrus, grains, and some spices. Tastes follow suit.
Bethlehem Brew Works Pre-Prohibition Pilsner;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Fegley's Brew Works;Straw yellow color with a white head. Grainy citrus-lemon flavor with earthy aroma. At 7.8% ABV, easily the most powerful pilsner I’ve ever had. Nice beer and not my style.

John Harvards Marzen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a mostly clear deep reddish amber with a very thin off-white head that quickly disappeared and left very little lace. Mild aroma of malt and not much else. The flavor is straightforward malt with just a bit of sweetness. Mild bitterness at the finish. Very easy to drink. No problems.
John Harvards Marzen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Deep copper coloured beer. Lovely sweet malty nose. Very clean and well-integrated. Soft fresh bready/crackery nose and a nice fresh light noble/spicy hoppiness. Crisp and crackery and very quaffable. A pretty solid brew.
John Harvards Marzen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at JH. Aroma of some light berries with sweet, crackery malt. Flavor mostly crackery malt with some other grain complexity. A very light sprinkling of leafy hops, VERY light. Nothing outstanding, but also pleasing in its simplicity.
John Harvards Marzen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at JH. Pours a clear amber with a small white head. Aroma of sweet malt. Flavor is sweet initially with some wheat and crackery malt notes and a fruity finish. The malt backbone is very nice. Super fresh and crisp. A surprising beer, especially considering that oktoberfest/marzen is not one of my favorite styles. 7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)
John Harvards Marzen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at the Lake Grove location: Deep orange pour with a fading head. The aroma shows some grainy, cereal like hints with a caramel touch. Grainy malt flavors are evident, with a light toffeeish hint. Also has a oat-like cereal character and a earthy touch. A straight forward, simple example.
John Harvards Marzen;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at brewpub, amber colored, good clarity - can see through it pretty well. Color is slight orange/red in direct light. Aroma is a bit unexpectedly hoppy for the style, which is an effervescent earthiness. This is all mixed up with a clean maltiness. Taste is similar with a hoppy aftertaste. Its not that the hops are strong they just stand out in this beer. A decent thirst quencher.

Sweet aroma of caramel and honey on toast and a faint noble hop touch. Sweet flavor with some darker bready melanoidins but mostly pale malt flavors. Some spicy hops and a light to medium bitterness but finishes sweet. A bit sticky and sugary on the palate. Getting there, but this would hae been much nicer with a lower finishing gravity to dry it out.

Hunter Old;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);This one had sat in my pile of beers to taste for far too long, I thought it was going to be terrible so I’d put off opening it for a good 6 months. Shit knows why I felt the need to open it tonight but here goes... Deep clear ruby brown with a small tan head. Strong chocolate aroma, a bit of sweetness, tobacco, smoke and soft yeasty fruits... not particularly complex but pretty bloody solid. Medium body, light roasty bitterness and slight sweetness. Strong mocha flavour, smoke and something like a box of sultanas thats been kicking around in your school lunchbox on the 45degree day. Small roasty finish. This stuff is pretty good, much better (and different) to Tooheys Old.
Hunter Old;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Bottle (375ml). Poured a opaque with ruby highlights and a thick, creamy, tanned head which was fully lasting. Aroma was of some burnt malts, coffee, light notes of dark chocolate and some nuts in the back. Taste very similar to aroma but a bit thinner with burnt malts, light coffee and nuts towards the end. Medium bodied with a watery texture, soft carbonation and an average dry finish.
Hunter Old;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);A bad version of Tooheys Old. Bland and tasteless with a flat head. Some metallic notes to round out the dullness.
Hunter Old;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Dark red tinged brown with a hard earned beige froth. Some bready malts with a little bit of roasted malt and a lashing of nuts. Too sweet, and with a milky taste, it doesn’t really sit too well. As has been pointed out, it’s more like a cola, albeit a bit flat. All in all it’s hard to see why anyone would drink this more than once, unless for some silly reason you bought two bottles of the stuff...
Hunter Old;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Picked up a 6 pack of 37ml bottles at my local Dan Murphy’s. My old man and his mates have been rambling on about how good this beer was in its prime for ages. Reminds me alot, if not too much, of Tooheys old. Cola and some oaky roasted malts on the nose. Pours a deep bronze body with some dense off-white lace. Thin body to it, some metallic bitterness to it. Some roasted malts with some cola sweetness to it finishing with a woody dryness. Nothing special, definately not worth the hype I heard.
Hunter Old;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Something old, something new, something borrowed, something bleugh... This Old is new and very similar to Tooheys Old, the brewer of which might be flattered at how much this borrows from the original. It’s a while since my last Tooheys Old but my impressions of this are fairly similar to notes about the former. It’s a thin-looking teak-coloured brew with a spare scattering of suds. The aroma has a light roastiness, strong Cola notes, cardboardy malts and a whiff of tramp pants. It’s softly carbonated, verging on flat. Thin fare indeed. Too sweet and Cola-like, with just the faintest roast maltiness. Nasty sour-milk aftertaste. Dry finish. Won’t be trying this again. (375ml bottle from Randwick Village Cellars)

The beer list I brought home doesn’t list this, but as you might guess, it’s a Mexican-style lager. My co-drinker says it reminds him of draft Tecate. I detect a slight Corona style skunk, perhaps intentional. But a good light pils taste. Kind of low on hops, but a lawnmower type with a dry finish. This is what they serve when asked if they have a ""light."""

The smoke notes were relatively subtle in the body, but this beer doesn’t have a compelling malt backbone. So, the smoke is not overpowering, but still dominates the palate. Pretty simple and one-dimensional; not one of my favorites during my visit."
Carlyle Rauchbier;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Carlyle Brewing Company;Sampler. Wow, with this being tasted right after their Scottish Ale, it’s like Smokin’ in the Boys’ Room here. Yes, it’s plenty smoky here, but that’s mostly confined to the malt, leaving the rest of the beer profile to come through. Kind of a brown ale base, I think. Burnt umber color. Mild and restrained for a style that can get kind of bacony.
Red Rock Humber Down Mild;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Mild Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);Bottled, 500ml, old unlabelled bottle given to me in Devon, cheers. Chestnut brown with cream head. There are sweet chocolate malts to this, perhaps a tad flat but that's unsurprising. Smooth, nutty flavours, hints of boiled vegetable. It's fine given the provenance.
Red Rock Humber Down Mild;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Mild Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);4 pints for 6 pound, bargain. Drank cool but not cold. Muddy brown with a minimal layer of beige suds atop that is fleeting, not much life evident. Aroma of peat, smoke, dusty cocoa, twiggy bark and drift wood, a little sodden earth and fell stone fruit. Thin in body but packed for flavour. A little tickle of carbonation gives it height. Lots of chocolate and smoke on the palate amongst its funky ‘humber’-like nuances. Grape-skin back end, noticeably astringent adds rather than detracts. Swallow is dusty, lots of peat, chocolate and scorched wood. Long linger, a supple sweetness to it otherwise it is dry. This is not bad stuff. Labelled as a Brown Ale, but fitting as a Mild. Love to taste it on cask as I think it would shine a little more than bottle conditioned.

Shugborough Lordships Own;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Shugborough (Titanic);Third beer in a British Beer Tasting Evening at my place, 8th Jan 2011. The second beer I’ve had from the Shugborough Hall Brewhouse which is used by Titanic on a semi-regular basis to brew different beers than their normal stuff. The beer was poured into an ’Abbot Ale’ glass pint tankard. The beer is a light ruby red/brown colour. A good looking off-white head sat on top and produced some heavy lacing. The smell was all malts, caramel and treacle molasses along with a freshly baked biscuits aroma. The taste was semi-sweet, those biscuity thoughts from the smell are there in the mouth too. A hop bitterness arrives and then retreats as the malts dominate again, so mostly malts in the taste. Full bodied, but just lacks some rich or creaminess to rise it above the rest. I enjoyed it.

Loddon Whitemans Dirty Habit;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Brown Ale;Loddon Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask @ Reading Beer Festival. Hazy gold amber appearance. Ginger spice aroma with some orange cake. Flavour is totally off the wall. One of the strangest beers I have tasted. Germoline, plenty of spicy notes from the coriander and obvious ginger. Something distinctly medicine like also. A very very odd beer with the character of a witbier mixed with a very spicy ale. It’s bonkers.

It has already gotten a little port wine notes, although it is only 2 years old, so even though it is not as brash as many other barleys, it has nevertheless its own little charm that makes it very appealing.

Americas Tom Seefurth's Mamma Mia Pizza Beer;St Charles, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Pizza Beer Company;Sampled at the GTMW Wierd. Hazed yellow with no head. It smells and tastes like pizza spices. Oregano and garlic seemed to be in the front. Certainly worth trying.
Americas Tom Seefurth's Mamma Mia Pizza Beer;St Charles, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Pizza Beer Company;"RBSG 2007 Grand Tasting. Cloudy yellow with no head. Oregano/basil nose and flavor, some breadiness. Weak body detracts from what could have been a pretty interesting beer. I think some flavors are noticed through the power of ""pizza suggestion"". Still, not bad for what is basically a gimmick beer."
Americas Tom Seefurth's Mamma Mia Pizza Beer;St Charles, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Pizza Beer Company;(Tap @ Brewpub) Pours a hazy light amber color, with little head. Very fragrant, with a strong oregano aroma that can be detected across the table. I personally expected more in the way of tomatoes, but all I really got was the spices (oregano, basil, garlic) and some funk. Garlic is especially notable in the aftertaste. That being said, this is still a very good beer that is certainly worth trying! I could have actually drank a couple more of these.
Americas Tom Seefurth's Mamma Mia Pizza Beer;St Charles, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Pizza Beer Company;"Sample from growler, RBSG Minneapolis Grand Tasting, June 23 2007. Pale amber with no real head, oily-looking....overpowering basil aroma, hints of tomato creep in, lightly doughy malts, and eventually some smokiness.....the flavor is, actually rather pizza-like, or more precisely, bruschetta: lots of tomato, light Italian spicing, light bready malts....unfortunately it’s too thin, watery, and has almost no carbonation; a better mouthfeel and this would be more than just a novelty, which is what it is in its current state if you ask me. Still, an interesting one and one of my favorite memories from RBSG regardless of the numbers."
OGriffs German Pilsener;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;From the tap, served at a cooler cellar temperature in a pint glass. Poured a very lightly orange hued golden with a foamy, bubbly white head that settled into a thin lacing. Had a spicy, herbal leafy nose with a soft, clean sweet pilsener maltiness, the hops come on a bit strong, otherwise just fine. Good moderate, tiny bubbly carbonation and a nicely crisp, dry, cleansing brisk, smooth light bodied mouthfeel. More balanced in the taste than in the aroma, spicy hops with a soft herbal bitterness, dry, clean, sweet pilsener malty, a light lemon honey emerges towards the end, and a dry, crisp, clean finish, the finish you want from a pilsener, firm, assertive, cleansing in the palate, not watery. This was a very fresh tasting pilsener, perfect on a hot spring date, easy, quaffable drinkability, another good German style lager from O’Griff’s.
OGriffs Steambock;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;From the tap, served at cellar temperature in a pint glass. Poured a clear, bright reddish orange with a foamy, bubbly topped white head that settled into a thin sudsy lacing. Spicy, herbal hoppy nose with a light fruitiness, apples and green grapes, a backing of sweet malts. Good carbonation and a crisp, dryish, smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel. Pleasant tasting, but I would have liked a more assertive Maibock taste, thin, sweet sugary maltiness, apples and grapes with lemon squeezed over them, the fruitiness mixes with the alcohol to give a mild acidity to the taste, spicy hops that provide a soft bitterness, and a dry fruity, sweet malty finish. I wish this had more of a Maibock/Helles Bock malt profile, the thinness of the malts deceases the drinkability for me, just too sweet overall. Not a bad spring offering, but could be much better.
Founders Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Draft at brewpub. Poured cloudy golden color with an average fizzy white head that lasted and had good lacing. Moderate fruity citrus wheat aroma. Light body with a smooth texture. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet short finish. Drinkable not my style beer.

Founders Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Nothing spectacular, but worth the try. Smells like Froot Loops, looks like heavily salted water with a tiny head. Does taste like blue moon belgian white, with the fruity white ale flavor. Orange peel / coriander , lemon peel, etc.
Founders Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap @ Founders. The name makes me think they really didn’t care too much about this one. It was OK for a wheat, but nothing all that great. Very light golden in color. A little citrus in the nose, a little watery.
Founders Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. This beer had little character. Light, spicy wheat, grain, and soapy notes, in addition to a touch of spice. Watery, bland, and peculiar. The uninspired name says it all. Of course, most beers would pale in comparison to the Kentucky Breakfast Stout and Backwoods Bastard on tap...
Founders Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);on tap at Founders...hazy yellow body with large white head...Blue Moon aroma (light orange peel, wheat, and coriander--with just a touch of honey)...flavor is that of a watered down Blue Moon...thin, watery palate...pretty much a waste of a tap handle
Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;Can: pours deep gold with white head. Aroma is citrus and a hint of pineapple. Taste is a bit bitter, balanced malt backbone, fruitiness. Pretty solid.
Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;"PKD 040919. From a can poured a slightly hazy mid amber with 2cm of beige dense foam that retained extremely well and laced very well. Carbonation high, lively and fine to medium. Aroma of sweet citrus, grapefruit and pine with malt undertones; alcohol well hidden. Taste is slightly sweet with orange and tangerine, grapefruit, tropical fruits (pineapple) and hints of pine and caramel malt; moderately strong resinous hoppy bitterness; unpleasant alcohol burn. Medium body. Smooth, crisp and dry with a lingering finish."
Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;Can, TW-SP. Murky orange pour, small frothy off-white head.

Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;"Can. Pours hazy golden, large fluffy white head, good lacing. Aroma is pine, grass, oranges. Smells a lot like an old west coast IPA, which isnt surprising considering the March 2019 brewed on date on the bottom of the can. I am sure its past its prime, but it is for sale; and that is on MBC for not policing their clients better. Medium body."
Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;30-Jun-17 (12-oz can, Canned 31-May-17: Purchased 30-Jun-17 for $3.49 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) This Imperial IPA pours a very hazy, pale-orange body and half an inch of off-white head that settles to a dusty sheet and creamy ring, leaving some spotty lacing on the glass. The nose is very fruity, with aromas of mango, cantaloupe, orange citrus, and ripe peach, but no malt at all. On the palate, again, it's all ripe, fleshy tropicals, melons, grapefruit and tangerine, lightly sweet actually, with a vague, minimal-impact malt base and light-medium, resiny hop bitterness. The beer is medium-plus in weight, medium in carbonation, and slightly astringent. Overall, this is a pleasant, modern, very fruity IPA. Quite pleasant for the style.
Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;Refrigerated 12 oz. aluminum can poured into a glass. Hazy deep golden with medium/small white head. Aroma is herbal hops, medium body, low carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is herbal hops and some citrus hops.
Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;"Fairly clear golden coloured body with a larger, two centimetre tall head with a nice glowing tan body that shows some depth and punch. Light hoppy aroma with more emphasis on the malts, alcohol and yeast - not too strong, but showing some flavours for sure. Medium-bodied; Nice assertive grainy flavours with a lot of alcohol and more subdued hops with some grassy and herbal notes, but no tropical fruits, resin or pine flavours at all - a relatively good balance, but a bit thin, especially for the style and not showing too many hops, compared to all the malts. Aftertaste is more grainy and bitter from the malt and alcohol than anything else - the hops hit relatively softly with a deft cover of grain near the end. Overall, a fairly good beer that shows much less of an Imperial IPA than anything else - but some softer malts, a good mild bitterness from some fruits with little else. I sampled this twelve ounce can purchased from the Food Pantry [express] on Kuhio in Waikiki, Honolulu, O'ahu on 26-December-2018 for US$10,88/six pack sampled the a few minutes after arriving to celebrate Christmas here on the Islands, on 26-December-2018."
Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;I’ve had this before I think. Nice piney, citrusy nose. Carbonated nicely in this 350 ml can offering from Maui Brewing. Smooth drinking with the big ABV and it tastes like an 8.5, luckily I like alcohol and I like this one too. Hoppy, laid back malts, what’s not like?
Maui Brewing Double Overhead IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Maui Brewing Company;Sampled from the tap at World Of Beer St. Paul.

The flavor is a very thin, a bit of hops, but it’s just so perfectly clean tasting and finishes completely balanced. I could have a good time chugging this stuff all night long.

Natty Greene's Patriot Extra Pale Ale;Greensboro, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Natty Greene's Pub & Brewing Company;"Nice amber pour with a huge eggshell head that coated the glass all the way. There is a lot of sweetbread in the bouquet... almost like toffee meets dough.... interesting. This starts off with quite a bit of caramel malt, and is immediately contrasted by a pale, biscuit note. Just like their APA, this has a nicely bitter finish, only with bit more residual sugar, accompanied by a tinge of copper. At first, to be honest, I actually thought this was a combo of their APA and amber ales. However, upon further scrutiny, it’s a brew of its own, introducing special biscuit bitters and copper into this recipe. Not bad... the sweetness tends to stay ""just"" this side of cloying, but it was a nice way to round out the 4th of July."

Dugges Celebration Ale 2Y;Landvetter, Sweden;IPA;Dugges Bryggeri;Draught at Akkurat. Amber with thick creamy head. Powerful hoppy aroma.. can’t recall any brew as having a fresher hop aroma than this! Fair bit of bittering hops too.. Not very balanced, but with hops like this.. who cares?
Dugges Celebration Ale 2Y;Landvetter, Sweden;IPA;Dugges Bryggeri;Draught, Mackinlay’s Inn Cloudy, rather opaque dark amber pour. Strongly hoppy, resiny one with pontent orange notes. Slight earthy, orange, mango peaks - remaining a citrus oriented product, with only shy malts supporting it. Fruity, light exotic notes, minimal, not even toasty, but rather grainy support foundations. Fair medium body with average carbonation. A bit ordinary for Dugges, their usual malt complexity lacks to me.

Zámolyi Világos Sör;Zámoly, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pedró Sörözö;Draught at Lake Balaton. Dark yellow beer with light Co2 and minimal foam. But the taste is quite correct: malty, and the finish is a little bitter. Just a cheap-yeast aroma makes wrong it.
Zámolyi Világos Sör;Zámoly, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pedró Sörözö;Light and creamy lager. Goes down smooth with a nice dry and slightly bitter finish. Sadly has a bit of that macrolager stale malt flavor too though. The other beers available from them are better.

Zámolyi Világos Sör;Zámoly, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pedró Sörözö;The beer available at only the brewery on tap or in a 1-liter-bottle to take away. Clear golden body, nice white lacing head. Sourish yeast aroma, some floral hop and sandly: diacetil. In the flavor is some diacetil too, but not too strong. Hay, sunflower and malt in the medium body, grassy hop taste, bitter aftertaste. One more week in the cellar and the beer would be better.
Gulf Brewery Cabin Boy Halfwit;Hahndorf, SA, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulf Brewery;The best thing about the Cabin Boy is the look in the glass - all cloudy gold and lots of bubbles. The aroma is marshmallow, boiled lollies, lots of dirty socks and a little grapefruit and lemon. The taste is incredibly sour, almost like you’re sucking on a warhead but I must say that the taste kind of grew on me - not an easy drinker, but worth a go.
Gulf Brewery Cabin Boy Halfwit;Hahndorf, SA, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulf Brewery;With sediment poured a cloudy light gold colour and developed a one-finger white foamy head that collapsed quickly. Spotty lacing. High carbonation - lots of fine bubble trails. Aroma strongly of sour malt with a note of spices. Taste sour. Light body. Finish very sour. (Batch Number looks like L2002)
Gulf Brewery Cabin Boy Halfwit;Hahndorf, SA, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulf Brewery;Out of the bottle at the brewhouse. Very light in colour for a wit. Very soft, subtle nose and same comes through in the tast. Lightly spiced. Good for summer if you a very light wit
Gulf Brewery Souwester Stout;Hahndorf, SA, Australia;Stout;Gulf Brewery;It look fantastic, with the dark and full presence with a mocha head but this as not reflected in the taste.

Gulf Brewery Souwester Stout;Hahndorf, SA, Australia;Stout;Gulf Brewery;Tap at the brewhouse. Watery brown pour with a small white head. Nose is charred chocolate.

Gulf Brewery Souwester Stout;Hahndorf, SA, Australia;Stout;Gulf Brewery;330ml bottle. Highly carbonated with a crackling coffee coloured foam that immediiately fills the glass. Deep burnt brown to black colour with roasted malt and bitter dark chocolate in the aroma. Lively in the mouth with some zing to it. Bitterness and roast flavours come in later.
Gulf Brewery Souwester Stout;Hahndorf, SA, Australia;Stout;Gulf Brewery;This only scored as high as this because it looked like a stout but this beer went down the drain after two sips. Very thin palate with a sour taste that was unpalatable. One of the worst beers I’ve had unfortunately.
Golden Avalanche Bourbon Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;On tap at Kutztown Tavern. Poured a murky brown with thin cream head.

Golden Avalanche Bourbon Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;On tap, at brewery. This was not good.

Golden Avalanche Bourbon Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Nice bold flavor. A very sweet stout that packs a punch. Caramel and vanilla are strong, even overpowering, but slight bitterness and dark stout flavor helps to temper it. The brewery will not let you take growlers of this home! I voiced my dissatisfaction.
Golden Avalanche Bourbon Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Dark body, small medium tan head. Nose is pure vanilla extract syrup. Taste is pasty and sweet, turns basically into a vanilla soda over the middle, finishing with some roasted vanilla beans and cola. Weird. No stout in there at all, and no bourbon whatsoever, just vanilla, vanilla and more vanilla.
Golden Avalanche Bourbon Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;"Rating #700, woohoo! Draft @ Golden Avalanche, pre-BCTC beerventure. Pours a dark cola color; medium tan head with fine-bubbled lacing. Vanilla extract and light chocolate in the aroma. Overly sweet, marshmallow and cheap vanilla extract upfront; more of a cola character than any sort of legitimate bourbon, with some warm chocolate and no show of alcohol. Doesn’t seem to be much bourbon or stout in here, just vanilla cola. Still drinkable, but not good. Only ABV info I could find was ""it’s probably above 7%, because it’s a big beer."""
Golden Avalanche Bourbon Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a thin light tan head and dark brown color. Aroma is cherry, vanilla, malt, chocolate. Taste is more Jack Daniel-like than the aroma and not quite as good as the aroma. A bit thin.
Great Waters Moon Dog;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Waters Brewing;Brown Color with Orange Hue and Sandy Head. Dark Malt/Bread Aroma. Light to Medium Moutfheel, Although Session Drinkability. Rasin, Dark Breads..Dry Malt...Crisp, Dry and Enjoyable.
Great Waters Moon Dog;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Waters Brewing;"Densely bodied, dark, pale brown color with a slight dark orange cast to the edges. Soft, finger high head of lighty sandy browned white, firmly creamed foam. Tons of lacing decorates the glass in broken sheeting. Aroma is very light and soft; clean, crisp, and rounded with a pale grassy, whole grain maltyness that would seem like what a Pilsner should smell like. Just not very aromatic in any fashion. Flavors are very nice and pleasantly rounded on the palate. Crisp, full, wholesome, clean pale malt profile and Pils malt taste. Kinda bready, tender with a touch of toasted grassyness and a very tiny puff of roast and cocoa. Clean favorable finish that is only a titch dry and has a late, light grassy pinch. Nice. Body is about medium with a smooth, yet tense carbonation grab thats well-balanced, firm, and holds a nice tone the whole way through. Drinkabilty is outstanding! A nearly perfect Pils. A great job by Great Waters ""Bob"" on this one. A summer drinker keeper! Yum!"
Great Waters Moon Dog;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Waters Brewing;"A dark pilsner? Hmm... Dark brown color with a medium head. Has the aroma of Noble hops and some residual graininess. The taste is a bit more barley-like than, say, Pilsner Urquell. Also some roasted malt. Not enough to turn me off to it, but just enough to say ""hey there, I’m not normal!"" Interesting and solid effort."
Lost Duck Simply The Blues Bock;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lost Duck Brewing Company;"Brewed especially for the May ""Simply The Blues"" music festival in Fort Madison. From the tap, served at cellar temperature in a pint glass. Poured a clear reddish orange hued copper with a slightly off-white head, decent retention, settled into a thin lacing, minimal amount of sticking. A nice Maibock aroma, toasted grains and caramel, apples with a light lemon, spicy with a very soft scent of herbal hops, and a gentle whiff of alcohol. Good even, steady carbonation and a crisp, dry, velvety smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel, pretty close to perfect for a Maibock. This is a straightforward Maibock/Helles Bock, but well brewed, balanced and delicious tasting, toasted grainy and sugary with a nice touch of caramel, fresh green apple slices with a light amount of lemon squeezed over them, the fruitiness mixes with the alcohol to give a mild amount of acidity to the taste, spicy hops that turn lightly herbal in the finish, and a dry, toasted grainy finish. I know the Lost Duck can do a good job with pale lagers, even their lite lager is first rate, but for me, everything else is hit or miss, mainly a big miss, but I was stunned, floored by this bock, absolutely first rate, upon the first sip, taste in my palate I knew that I would spend the rest of the night with this, a beautiful beer, I can’t praise it enough, I wish the Duck put this kind of effort into all of their beers."
Anheuser-Busch St. Louis Dark Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This is just completely terrible and undrinkable. I can’t believe it was put on the market.
Anheuser-Busch St. Louis Dark Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"At the Heritage Brew Festival on tap. Pale amber pour with a decent small bead head. Light texture with a pleasant malt taste and sweetness; light hop character. This is quite good. Of course, AB is 5 miles away and brings their stuff in fresh for the festivals. If AB products tasted this fresh and good at an average pub nationwide, they’d completely control the market."
Anheuser-Busch St. Louis Dark Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Sample at the Heritage Festival. Only got to try three of the seven St. Louis Dark Lager styles. Or a least only jotted some notes for three. Given that this one took the silver according to my notes. Filtered and amber hued. Layer of thick off-white head. Light bready with a touch floral aroma. Toasty caramel flavor. Easy drinking.
Anheuser-Busch St. Louis Dark Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Also sampled at the Brewfest. I was proud of AB for sponsoring this event and tried to sample several of their offerings. However, I was disappointed by this one. The aftertaste was disagreeable and the flavor a bit harsh.
