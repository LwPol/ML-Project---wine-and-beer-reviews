Crombï¿½ Zottegemse Grand Cru;Zottegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Crombï¿½;Gekocht op 16-08-2018 bij Dranken Geers in Oostakker. En thuis geproefd op 1-12-2018. Zottegemse Grand Cru is een helder en amber-kleurig biertje dat bij het uitschenken zeer veel gebroken wit schuim produceert met een dik-wollige structuur. Het blijft sterk aan de glaswand kleven en blijft redelijk stabiel, er wordt redelijk snel een ï¿½bergjeï¿½ gemaakt bovenop het schuim. Slechts weinig CO2 pareling gezien met fijne belletjes. Het aroma van Zottegemse Grand Cru is een beetje zurig, wat karamelzoet, gistbitter, wat banaan en citrus en wat karamelmout. De smaak is zoetig, met suiker en een kruidige toets. In de mond geeft Zottegemse Grand Cru een volle body gevoel en is hij normaal koolzuurgas-prikkelend. Een Harmonieus biertje. De nasmaak vloeit lang uit en is vooral wat hopbitterig met ook een kruidentoets en op het laatst een licht droogje. Weinig verrassende grand cru is dit, toch vraag ik me af waar de kruidigheid vandaan komt. Foto's en info te vinden op: http://www.beersfrombelgium.eu/nl/showBeerPhoto.php?id=272&nr=6

De Koninck Duo;Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);............................................................................
De Koninck Trio;Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);"De Koninckï¿½s Easter beer, retired since 1992 so I was quite surprised finding it here, but apparently it was still possible to add extinct beers in the early days of Ratebeer, so I got this vintage bottle from 1992 from a private collector just for the sake of science, so to speak. No head: only with very strong forcing and holding the glass half a yard under the bottle upon pouring, some loose, off-white bubbles form, only to disappear again in a matter of seconds. Colour is an orange-hued peach blonde, less amber than the regular ï¿½bollekeï¿½, and since this type of beers darkens with age, I assume it was a blonde beer when it was fresh; starts of more or less clear upon extremely careful pouring, but halfway the bottle, a milky yeast cloud comes in and makes everything misty; evidently a few darker proteins and dead yeast bits from the bottom of the bottle are added as well, sinking to the bottom of the glass. When I add the rest of it in the very end - not intending to taste it anymore - a much darker, ï¿½dirty brownï¿½ cloud comes in, creating the looks of a rain pool on a clay soil. The aroma is one of old beer in every sense, but one that has been kept in optimal circumstances: none of the ï¿½rustyï¿½ and off-putting oxidation (anymore?), but a clear, distinct ï¿½sherryisationï¿½ so to speak, creating a bouquet not unlike very old sherry or even white port, next to hints of stewed pear, soggy brown bread, old white pepper, sweet breakfast cereals, old dried orange peel, home-made apple juice, ginger, even a hint of milk chocolate. Sweet onset, apple sauce and pear juice with a very light sourish touch, no carbonation left at all, further thinning a body which is already heavily thinned out by age (in other words: by proteins having coagulated over time). Apricot-like and caramelly sweetness, thinned as said, remains in the middle, and the finish adds only this sherry effect retronasally (not disagreeable at all actually) as well as a hint of warming, ï¿½jeneverï¿½-like alcohol, but no sign of hops: if this beer was only ï¿½slightlyï¿½ bitter and mainly aromatically hopped, as the label states, then it should not come as a surprise that after almost a quarter of a century, both hop aromas and bitterness have completely vanished. A whole lot of sugary sweetness remains in the back of the mouth but not in a sticky way, rather toffeeish, and matching well with the ï¿½agingï¿½ alcohols responsible for the old sherry-like effect. This beer was never intended for aging and certainly not for such a long time, but in comparison with some other Belgian ales of 20+ years I had in the long beer drinking part of my life, I must say I had expected way worse; this has actually aged quite graciously, though there is not a shadow of a doubt that as good as nothing of its original flavor has survived. Instead, it has become something completely different, ï¿½unbeeryï¿½ almost, ruled by an elegant old sherry effect, but with not much left underneath, having lost all of its carbonisation and body. I guess I can only rate it here in the way it is now presented to me, as I never had this when it was young, but it being an interesting old beer tasting, I will not be too harsh on it."
De Koninck Trio;Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);Notes from early 90s. Bottle 1991, bought in Antwerp. Clear blonde to amber color. White head.

Camo High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;High gravity.....low quality. Pours light golden color with nominal head. Usual aromas and taste associated with malt liquor. Not fit for a wino.
Camo High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;Can generously supplied by Tmoney99 from notes. Pours a crystal clear yellow color with a small white head that disappears quickly. The aroma and flavor had sweet grainy corn, apple juice, solvent and a metallic note,not good is an understatement.
Camo High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;Damn really? Last of my camo ammo. This one was actually a winner. Gold pour, sweet, syrupy corn, lots of booze, great carbonation. Not fucken bad.

Camo High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;Sweet cidery nose, corny, little sulphur. Pours pale golden yellow, thin head. Medium sweet green apple cider on top of corn, light grain, and a light sulphur note in the finish. Not the best example.
Camo High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;huge fusel nose, some alcohol esters become near dry champagne notes. some banana as well. ultra bizarre and causes gag-like mouthwatering. flavor is strong overwhelming alcohol esters again with gigantic banana and even bubblegum hints. its strength is felt immediately, doesnt necessarily taste beyond its ABV but feels like it. as it warms flavor of green apple and its skins especially comes to light and its clearly offensive.
Camo High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;Looks like a malt liquor should. Tastes like one too. Smells of that corn chip funk and tastes kid of like ass.
Camo High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;24 oz can at some mini mart when there werenï¿½t many other good options. Piss yellow pour with small white head. Aroma of corn, yeast, piss. Flavor of corn, yeast, water. Watery mouth of course. This will get you hammered though, if such is your desire.
Camo High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;"24 oz can bought in Evanston Wyoming. Oh yeah, this is going to be fun. Pours a clear golden color with a small bubbly white head. The aroma is off-putting; corn, dirty oily water and some alcohol. The flavor is a bit offensive, something sweet and oily, some light hops and sweet corn. A bad trashy finish. Not horrible, but bad."
Belfast Bay McGoverns Oatmeal Stout;Belfast, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;I got this a while ago (as a single) sampled with another single of their Lobster Ale. I remember liking this one better, but both were good. As far as stouts go, this may be on the lighter and thinner side....especially for ABV% I'm guessing around 5%ish. I saw this while previewing the beer list of Total Wine & More (which I will get to shop for the first time this weekend). Reminded me that I need to review this and to buy again for a 2nd sample/update.
Belfast Bay McGoverns Oatmeal Stout;Belfast, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;smooth and with a little bit of burnt coffee and the vanilla cocoa thing going on. Sweet and even a bit creamy it isn't heavy on the flavor but still comes off a bit beery. No abv on the bottle it seemed about what it is at 6.4. $2 BOTTLE AT BREWTIQUE NYC.
Belfast Bay McGoverns Oatmeal Stout;Belfast, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;12oz bottle. Poured a dark brown, almost black color with a small off-white head. Aroma was light sweet malts, roasted malts. Light chocolate, roasted malts. Touch of coffee in this one.

Belfast Bay McGoverns Oatmeal Stout;Belfast, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;12oz bottle shared by John, down east Acadia. BB 04.06.18. Pours dark brown with a dark beige head. Aroma is sweet chocolate, coffee. Flavor is chocolate, caramel, overextracted coffee. Sadly thin, especially for an oatmeal stout.
Belfast Bay McGoverns Oatmeal Stout;Belfast, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;"Bottle at lunch over pot roast. Smooth and rich, with more flavor than I expected. Oatmeal stouts tend to fall on a wide spectrum, with ""full-on sweet stout"" on one side and ""full-on chocolate and coffee bomb (but with a fuller mouthfeel)"" on the other, and this is definitely closer to the latter extreme. Not much sweetness, but a surprisingly strong chocolate and roasted malt flavor profile. This is really quite good!"
Belfast Bay McGoverns Oatmeal Stout;Belfast, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;Bottle pour into tulip glass from Spruce Creek Provisions. Appearance is opaque black with 2 finger-width brown, foamy head with excellent retention and nice lacing. Aroma is strong roasted malt--almost burnt--light coffee/chocolate. Taste is bittersweet roasted malts, again with hints of coffee/chocolate. Palate is medium bodied with creamy/foamy texture, average carbonation and lingering bitterness almost like roasted coffee. Overall, this looks great and tastes and smells good, but if sweet stouts are supposed to show restrained roastiness, then this misses the mark for style.
Belfast Bay McGoverns Oatmeal Stout;Belfast, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;Some light oat and decent roast. Black pour with decent head. Some nut. Seems underrated. Creamy consistency. Bottle.

Belfast Bay McGoverns Oatmeal Stout;Belfast, Maine, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;DATE TASTED: February 13, 2016... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith pint... OCCASION: a cold day calls for a warming stout... APPEARANCE: stout-black body begins with a brown single-finger head and finishes as a thin halo... AROMA: warm biscuit and chocolate take the lead, with lactic elements wafting... some peat, smoke and sweet confectionerï¿½s sugars...also, some bourbon hints of vanilla... PALATE: a relatively smooth draw with a late fizziness...the slight oiliness contributes to a lingering aftertaste that again suggests whiskey mash...plenty drinkable, sidestepping a stoutï¿½s potential weightiness... TASTE: a sea saltiness pervades an experience that includes smoky peat, vegetable, dough and chocolate make for a multifaceted profile... OVERALL: BIG shout-out to Uncle Mark for his rerouting yet another Beer of the Month selection,,,this evokes enough different aspects that it rises above the average winter mix-pack variety... strong enough to stand alone, with enough alcohol to be engaging...
Wasatch Special Reserve Pale Ale;Park City, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Poured a clear, bright amber orange with a medium, foamy-white head.

A fair pale ale with very modest depth of character imposed by the oppression of Utah.
Wasatch Special Reserve Pale Ale;Park City, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Bottle. Caramel-cloudy hue. No head.

Rock Creek Potomac Doublenut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Chesapeake Bay Brewing (formerly Rock Creek);Deep brown, garnet color with a perfect creamy brown head. This brown ale had a sourness with some affinity to a flanders ale. The aroma was of and odd earthy, mossy, light peatiness wthi the flavor had a medicinal, metallic, diffuse nutty mouthfeel rounded by sourness. Quite an unusual brown ale and hard to decipher.
Rock Creek Potomac Doublenut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Chesapeake Bay Brewing (formerly Rock Creek);I don't know if I got a bad bottle (infected?) or what, but this beer had an unusually sour flavor that was undrinkable.

Mishawaka Four Horsemen Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Not too bad. Iï¿½ve observed more of a head than others have, perhaps itï¿½s the way I pour. Anyway, slightly sweet aroma of malt, and it intensifies in the finish. A better offering from Mishawaka than I had been led to expect. Maybe drinking it while watching Notre Dame beat Army has added to my impressions of it.
Mishawaka Four Horsemen Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle. Yep, itï¿½s red alright. Thin to little head to top it off.

Berghoff Genuine Dark Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;12 oz. bottle. German-style lager. Pours toasty brown. Flavors are chocolate, coffee, molasses and malt. I really enjoyed this but I have to admit that I really want the Berghoff label to succeed from a historical perspective. However this beer is solid no matter what's on the label. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Berghoff Genuine Dark Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Chicago Oï¿½Hare bottle not tap, this one was much better than the Lager or the Amber. Rich roasted toasted malt, good Aroma. Solid and enjoyable. Worth drinking again.
Berghoff Genuine Dark Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Pours a dark brown color with creamy light brown head. Taste is heavier but drinks more like a dark ale than a stout. Went great with the bratwurst at Berghoff cafe in Chicago Oï¿½hare airport.

Berghoff Famous Bock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Aroma of caramel/toffee malts and chocolate, approximately the same flavor, plus some starchy hopping. Dark reddish brown color. Mildly heavy, a welter weight for a bock. Drinks well with spicy food.

Small head that quickly fades. Aroma of caramel, roadted grain, dark fruit, molassas.

The aroma is a little nutty and burnt. Tastes the same as it smells. A little bit syrupy, but hey, thatï¿½s bock. An average bock at a good price.

Flavor was nutty, with caramel and chocolate. Medium body, higher carbonation. A lot better than I thought it would be. Highly drinkable. Kind of thin.
Berghoff Famous Bock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Bottle from Monks Cafï¿½, Wallingatan. Very dark reddish brown with a smallish head. Strong roasted coffee aroma. Caramel, molasses and coffee flavours. On the sweet side. Touches of originality.
Huber Bock Beer;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Minhas Craft Brewery;For a Bock beer it has a kind of sour taste. Much better on tap than bottled. A disappointing aftertaste.
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Red pour from draft at berghoff in Ohare airport. White head. Sweet and fruity aroma. Fruity, malty, cherry, and somewhat hoppy flavor. Pleasantly surprised with this

Taste has some decent bitter hops to it and caramel malt. Medium light bodied. Average carbonation. Not too shabby. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;This was an okay beer, definitely sessionable, but mostly because it was nearly characterless. Slightly sweet but mostly just bready malts.
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Pours amber with a slight orange tint....short, off-white head. Bready, peppery aroma. Caramel, spice, cloying fruit, apple-peel.... Sweet and malty.... APA? I think not.
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Chicago Oï¿½Hare airport draft, decent aroma, pours decent head too. Rich flavor and typical balance between malt sweet and Hops of a Wisconsin Red Ale. I would pay for it again.
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Deep red pour with a thin head. Taste is full of caramel. Very sweet. Biscuit aroma. Slight bitter finish. Easy drinking. Medium mouth.
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Not much going on for aroma, slight hops and vague sweet malt. When the bar girl said the restaurantï¿½s beers are from ï¿½Monroe, wisCAHNsinï¿½ (you know how she said it.) I knew what was up. Taste is more of the same, with some metal added. All that aside, at the right price this stuff is pretty doable.
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Just like name - Red. Just a hint of hops, easy to drink. overall decent but nothing stands out to separate from the crowd.
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Poured from 12oz bottle, pours a clear light amber with a thin bubbly head and no lacing, aroma is more of malt and just a hint of old hops, the flavor is of light hop water with a slight finish of malt, ugh.
Berghoff Famous Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Pretty decent red beer. Similar to a lienenkougel red but with much more flavor. Would probably no get again ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Suprisingly dark brownish golden. Aroma is malty with a hint of honey and something I call coconut for lack of a better term--donï¿½t know what that is. Light bodied and fizzy. A little bit of sweetness and a little bit of bitterness so in that repect well balanced. One of the better brews by Berghoff though Iï¿½m no big fan. Very drinkable at least and definitely a step above BMC.
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Lots of white floaties in this one. A dark amber body. A thin white head. Aroma of sweet honey and some light bread. The taste is an artificial sweetness. A bitter aftertaste. Tastes of metal and some bubblegum. The floaters have me worried.
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;"This is really one of those beers that does not beg for description; if you're into micros, why buy a Huber product? If you're not, how did you come across this? No ""wheat"" character here, the honey seems fake, thin, watery, but somehow refreshing in an odd way."
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;A little sweet with some gassy, grassy tones. Not really worth the dimes I dropped on it in an Indiana grocery.
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;i liked this beer, especially on tap, but it must be very cold to drink or else it gets to sweet-makes a good session ale.
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Berghoff makes some good beers, but this does not fall into that catagory. Smells worse then it tastes.
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Nice sweet aroma, beautiful golden color. Surprisingly bitter though, especially the aftertaste. I'll let my friends drink the rest of the 6 pack.
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;"Interesting opaque dark golden color. Not much in the way of aroma, just faintly sweet. Some sweetish flavors on top of the very lightly tart wheat flavors, and a slightly fizzy finish. I think it's just okay; needs a little more flavor, body and a good mouthfeel to suit me."
Berghoff Honey Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Not my favorite of the joseph huber brewing company products, but this was still better than most. Everything was good with this beer except it was slightly too sweet which made it not so good as it got warm, which mine did.
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Location: Draft at the Berghoff, 6/2/14 Aroma: The aroma is light and wheaty, banana and spice notes, pretty much a dull hefe nose Appearance: Pours a light yellowish color, unclear, with a fizzy white head Flavor: Flavor-wise this one is light and similar to the nose, okay, but leans pretty dull Palate: The body is light, it is rather fizzy carbonation-wise, with an okay mouthfeel Overall Impression: I wasnï¿½t a huge fan of this beer. It is on-style enough, but it comes off as fairly dull. Not a favorite of mine.
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Strong showing from an otherwise forgetful meal...good beer to pair. Lots of character
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;355ml bottle pours a hazy golden color with a 2 finger white head that has decent retention eventually settling to some respectable lacing. Aroma is banana and cloves with some cereal grains and light hops. Taste is malty sweet with the banana and cloves and a citrusy hop bitterness in the finish. Light bodied and moderately carbonated. The best of the Berghoff brews that I have tried to date.
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Bottled@Monks Cafï¿½, Stockholm. Hazy golden colour, mediumsized white head. Aroma is tomatosauce-pizza-spices as well as some wheat and caramel. Flavour is being very similar with some herbal notes. Probably rather old bottle (drank during summer 2010).
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;This is a Bavarian style wheat beer, unfiltered--and mistakenly served with a slice of lemon (no frigginï¿½ fruit, please!)--and represents a pretty fair effort for a contract brewer. Itï¿½s certainly much better than it had been a few years before. Brewed only using pale barley and wheat malt, itï¿½s pale straw in color and pretty full in body, with plenty of banana and clove overtones to be expected. The finish is balanced and clean, with only the lingering yeasty esters traditional to the style.
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Sampled at Berghoff brewery on Adams St. downtown Chicago. This brew was okay. Iï¿½m not very fond of the Hafe Weizen as I feel they need more fruit and less grainy. Aroma was of grains, banana, grassy. The appearance is of a yellow haze. Frothy head, appearance was great! Overall, not a fan, but will have again if I see it on tap somewhere..
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Draught from the restaurant. Cloudy, a little bit less acidic than I like my hefeï¿½s. OK.
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Pale yellow and slightly hazy. Abit of that sweet aroma, but mostly lacking. Taste is watered down lemonade. Citrus and sour. Bad aftertaste. Nicht gut.
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Gift from my Wisconsin hook up. Thanks Jamie. Hazy golden color with mild citrus aroma followed by a more dominant wheat. A clove and banana taste thin in body but not bad.
Berghoff Hefe-Weizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Iï¿½ve never been a huge fan of their stuff anyway, but this is one of my least favorite hefes for sure.
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;"Bottle, labelled as ""Bad Hare Seasonal: Hazelnut Brown Ale"". Medium amber brown, modest off white head. Aroma is grainy , sweet, with an odd chemical trace that Iï¿½ve detected in many of Minhasï¿½ beers in the past. Sweet caramel grains, nothing approximating hazelnut at all. Harsh and unpleasant."
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;12oz bottle 12/00 (Old Notes)-Pours a darker amber with a small head. Aroma of hazelnut. Taste of hazelnut, butterscotch, and slight caramel. This light to medium bodied brew is not the best but I was not expecting much as it is Berghoff.
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Ale pours an incredibly clear light brown color with a bubbly off-white crown. There is a lot of toasted hazelnut in the aroma. The flavor begins with butterscotch and then becomes lightly toasted hazelnut. The finish is moderately sweet with just a whisp of hops toward the very end. This beer is light to medium bodied, lightly carbonated, and a bit thin on the palate. Overall, this was a decent Winter Ale and the hazelnut wasnï¿½t over done. Now itï¿½s time to get to work on the holiday cards! 12 oz bottle from Party Town.
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Great, two bottles of crap in a row. Pours dark amber with a bit of haze and small sudsy light tan head. The head just looks sickly - the darn thing needs an asprin or something. The aroma definitely has hazelnut, somewhat artifical smelling though. There is also butterscotch and light toastiness. This just comes across as a jumbled mess. Medium body with light carbonation. Taste all kinds of diacetyl / butterscotch. It is also lightly nutty, sour with toasted malt. That which sounds bad was, that which sounds good tasted off from what it should. These last two trainwrecks are no way to start off a night.
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;"Bottle from iowaherkeye, Thanks Joey! Nose of grainy malts and hazelnuts. transparent amber with a tiny beige head; flavor is fairly sweet caramel and hazelnuts, with some fruity banana esters in the background, kinda like a nutty hefeweisen! Interesting!"
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;It definitely has the hazelnut aroma and other nuts as well. This is very weird. Can taste the hazelnuts too, but remain unconvinced that they are a good thing to put into beer. Interesting to try.
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;12oz bottle pours amber with a short beige head. Aromas of caramel, light nuts, and hazelnut. Flavor is hazelnut and caramel. Malty, and pretty sweet. Palate is a little on the watered down side. Pretty average all the way around.
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Bronze color with a small beige head. Aroma of malt and hazelnut. Strong hazelnut and sweet malt flavors.
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;"Bottle - confession ... I poured this one and then forgot I had for over an hour. Here goes. Dark golden colored. I donï¿½t see the ""brown"" ale at all. Beige head with decent retention. Aroma is malty with deep hazelnut in the end. Not overpowering at this point. It does deepen as the glass is raised to drink. Flavor is very sweet. Big hazelnut notes and a touch of chocolate. Not bad."
Berghoff Hazelnut Winter Fest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Reviewed as ? Red-brown with a sudsy head. Strong aroma of hazelnut. Strong flavor of hazelnut. Also sweet malt with a hint of lemony hops. I personally like the taste, but the hazelnut flavor and scent are a bit over-the-top.
Dempseys Irish Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;From old tasting notes. Clear Amber orange color with an expansive creamy beige head. Light sweetish malt aroma. Zesty toasted malt flavor has a bittersweet tangy backdrop. Dry midtaste. Tart bitter finish and aftertaste. Very ale-like. Full bodied and flavorful. Nice clinging lace.
Dempseys Irish Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Amber with off-white head, barely perceptible aroma of dried apples and hay, watery toffee flavor with slight hops and processed taste. Not offensive but not very interesting.
Dempseys Irish Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Draught at Joeï¿½s Place in Iowa City, IA. I have had this beer several times in the past, but hadnï¿½t tried it in a while. Clear amber color with thin tan head. Not much nose with some hay and caramel in the mouth. Metallic aftertaste. Not particularly good.
Dempseys Irish Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Rerate. On tap. The taste is a slightly fruity caramel with some light bready notes. The aroma is slight apple with some cheddar cheese. Mouthfeel is medium. This finishes with a cheesy aftertaste.
Dempseys Irish Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;This was a little too sweet and unbalanced for the low gravity... had a grainy caramel flavor (caramunich/caravienne?)
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Aroma is malts and, oddly, banana cream. The flavor is malts, a definite metallic edge and a mildly tart fruit finish.
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Bottle. Sweet caramel malt aroma. Amber with a small beige head. Saccharine, caramel malt, vegetal, grassy flavor. Light to medium body.
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Kind of one dimensional octoberfest. Very malty but also has a pleasant taste. Definitely a sesh beer, I could drink 8 of these and I have before. Mixes well with guinness too by the way.
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;12 ounce bottle. Pours copper/orange with a decent chunky biege head. Aroma of malt and caramel. Taste is sweet malt, caramel, fruit, and a bit of hops. A bit thin and a bit bitter. A little odd.
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;12oz bottle.. itï¿½s Berghoff, I wasnï¿½t about to pour it. Pretty malty and had a very bland taste. Poor offering for an Oktoberfest beer.
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;This beer is really pretty decent, but still nothing much to it. I like some more complexity.
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;12oz bottle. Pours a clear, golden-orange colored body with a finger-width, fizzy, off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing. Aroma is sweeter caramels with a light bread, some buttered toast, and a decent amount of floral fruits. Flavor is similar. Sweeter, bready caramels with a light toast. Floral fruits and a hint of earth before this finishes sweet with a very light bitterness. Medium length aftertaste following a smooth, medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall, a decent Oktoberfest. Fairly sweet and led by the bready caramels, but it did have a hint of bitterness and toast to balance. Not bad.
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Another American Oktoberfest. With a different label than the one shown. No date on bottle but I know it is fresh. Pours a dark amber, darker than the German offerings but still looks nice, the head is a full 3 fingers. The aroma is soft, hint of rootbeer in there, but mostly malt with a kiss of hops. The beer has nits of adjunct, slight cooked vegetables, but also some nutty malts and bitter hops. Nice sweetness and light body. Again, traces of rootbeer int he flavor. It is better than SA or Leinenkugelï¿½s despite the macro nature of it however. It is a unique flavor though that has Oktoberfest characteristics, but a few other additional flavors. The mouthfeel isnï¿½t bad, it has good carbonation and the flavors are delivered in a reasonable fashion as they are able to permeate the tongue. Overall itï¿½s taste could be better but the rest of this beer isnï¿½t bad, not the first thing I would grab during the Oktoberfest season though. It is a unique take on an Oktoberfest
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Sampled at Berghoff brewery on Adams St. downtown Chicago. Smelled of carmel, light vanilla, roasted nuts. Not very good for an oktoberfest. Carbonated and no clean aftertaste. Medium hops with little malt character. Still no comparison to Samuel Adams or Dundee..
Berghoff OktoberFest Beer;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;amazing aroma, smells so great. Looks alright. Tastes pretty good. Aftertaste is real good. Overall I say hurray.

Huber Premium Beer;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Clear golden beer with medium white head. Aroma is grains, malty.

Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;Rhinelander is an inexpensive beer that is packed with taste.

Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;great american pre-prohibition light lager. hard to find but great if you can.
Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;On tap. Water with a hint of nettles and walnut. Certianly n more offensive than BMC, yet cheaper.
Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;A little better than I would have thought. It came from the tap, was pretty light. Not from a can, so that probably helped my overall opinion.
Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;Can from Liqour Barn. Pourd clear pale color with an large frothy white head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Medium sweet grainy aroma. Light to medium body with a thin texture. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of short duration. Below average beer.
Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;I am not sure what a premium export beer is. This is a very pale lager. Bottled, when poured light yellow. Minimal whitish head. Aroma denotes metals. I would describe as the rusty can taste in a bottle. Best part of this beer is the price.
Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;Another beer of the past still being brewed today. Aroma of lightly sweetened corn grits, a touch of grassy hops and something that reminds me of corn husks and chaff. Taste is light bodied, no carbonation, slightly gritty in flavor with more corn grits and light grassy hops. Finish is very watery, light and tastes smooth as long as it is served below 38 degrees. An average swill at best. Though. I sure miss Hans Kesslerï¿½s Rhinelander recipe.
Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;a Very Good American Lager. A great beer for the cost. Hard to find in my area.
Rhinelander Original;Rhinelander, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rhinelander Brewing Company LLC;Good American Lager.

Rhinelander Bock;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Minhas Craft Brewery;Nearly brown in color with a off white wispy head. Aromas of caramel, toasty/burnt malt and grass. Taste does little to help the bock cause. Maybe this was what was left over when they went to clean the tanks. Should be called an American Standard Bock.
Rhinelander Bock;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Minhas Craft Brewery;"My first experienc with this was unpleasent. Dirty taste, metalic finish and flat feel. I will give it another chance this summer while ""up north""."
Rhinelander Bock;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Minhas Craft Brewery;While I did enjoy a case of this with Funk and the iceman I would not recommend it based on taste. However I would recommend it based on price. If you want something cheap, unique, and not totally shitty just stop by your local Joseph Huber outlet store.
Rhinelander Bock;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Minhas Craft Brewery;A touch sweet, a touch creamy, a wee bit of molasses in the taste. Interestingly packaged in old cases with recycled bottles. Decent beer, especially to quaff with good conversation in a Milwaukee apartment ... cheers, Mike!
Rhinelander Bock;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Minhas Craft Brewery;Another fine brew from Huber. Its cheap, tastes good and comes in the always cool recycled bottles and case
Rhinelander Bock;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Minhas Craft Brewery;The Huber brewing company has done it again. A good beer at a great price. You have to love the huber theme of the beat up cardboard boxes and the reused bottles
Rhinelander Bock;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Minhas Craft Brewery;Another decent bock from another good brewery in Wisconsin..................
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;"Much better than Minhas's other more popular lager, ""Mountain Crust"". Also a step above the competing ultracheap regional Wisconsin lager, ""Kul"". Initially there is a strong impression of candy orange. Fortunately you get used to this after a few swigs! Then it's pretty normal lager, a little bready. Overall I'd say spend the extra $2 per 30-pack and get Hamms."
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden color. About one finger white head. Doesnï¿½t last long. Light lacing. Aroma is light spicy hops. Pretty heavy malt. White bread. Taste is well balanced. Spicy hops give nice balance. Touch of butter. Mouthfeel is light bodied. Soft carbonation. A touch slick. Smooth. Crisp. Overall this quite good. Good balance. Better than most macros. I would buy it again and would recommend it.
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;Hereï¿½s another retro brand from the pre-micro brewery era. Picked up a single 12-oz bottle from the Malt Shoppe in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden amber colored brew with a fast dissipating off-white head that disappears clean. Aroma of light fruit, grassy hops, golden grain malt, some corn meal and a touch of butter. Taste is light bodied, soft carbonation with flavors of white flour and cornbread, a touch of grassy hops, butter and a hint of white pepper. Finish is clean, crisp with minimal bitter aftertaste. More palatable compared to the old Huber brewery recipe, but a simple light lager overall.
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;Back in the day, Regal Brau was the the same as Augsburger (Huber Brewing Co.) but sold, of course, in different bottles and at a lower price. A case of 24 returnable bottles was around $13.00 back in the late 70ï¿½s and early 80ï¿½s. This comes close but is a little off. I think Pabst might own the original recipe so this might have been just a guess.
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;This smells like grass and dirt mixed with Deanï¿½s blue raspberry. Itï¿½s sweet, sticky heavy and largely terrible. I recommend you do not drink this but I will.
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;People underestimate this beer itï¿½s a cheap beer but has the mix flavor of a lager and a brown ale. Itï¿½s a little sweet but something you could drink all night. I read that someone said itï¿½s the worst beer ever. If this is true then you have a lot of beers to try. If your having a party I highly recommend this beer.
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;12oz bottle poured into a shaker. Pours a hazy, dark yellow with a half finger of white head. Aroma is grainy but with some distinct banana and belgian yeast. Taste is light sweet. Again, mostly grains but a noticeable bit of yeasty goodness. Light bodied with a somewhat thin texture. Lively carbonation and a decently long finish. Overall, not bad. Nothing to seek out but ill drink this one.
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;Iï¿½m not so sure this is retired. It comes in an ominous old school looking case pack. 12 oz brown twist-off bottle. It pours a dull gold with a fizzy white head that quickly dissipates. Even for style standards this one looks pretty bad. It actually has a grainy smell with real barley, though there is a certain must that reminds me of corn. The taste is odd, it has a nice malt and hop presence for the style, but also the taste of cardboard and a bit of corn. It seems like they were going for an adjunct lager that was as high-quality as possible. Not very good, but not bad considering the style. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 11-24-2010 03:08:36
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;Nice lager. Better than Miller or Bud. Glad to see Minhas brought this back.
Regal Brau;West Hollywood, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Regal Brau Brewing Company;Golden color with a decent white head. Smell is fruity almost wine like. It has a slightly malty aroma. Flavor is balanced. Corn and rice are evident and help to lighten it.
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Golden-straw, clear, with thin white head. Grain and sweet malt aroma. Malt dominated flavour with bitter finish.
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Sampled from 12-oz bottle, picked up during ABAï¿½s annual beer swap at their annual meeting in Portland, Oregon. Pours a clear pale golden yellow brew with a fast dissolving white head that dissipates clean. Aroma of typical mass-produced corn/adjunct malt, some citrus zest and some fruity character. Taste is light bodied, not much carbonation, with a gritty flavor of sweet corn malt and some light citrus peel. Finish is gritty and then a clean cut aftertaste that disappears quickly. I strong believe this may be a historical revived brewery label from Storck Brewing Company of Slinger, Wisconsin but the former brewery owner claims he picked the name out of a hat.
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pours a hazy yellow color with a head that disappeared quickly.Big bready,corn adjunct aroma. You can also smell the caramel malt in the aroma too!.Typical lager flavor with hints of fruit? Smooth finsh.not really tasting the hops.Corn aftertaste.
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Clear pale yellow with small head. No noticable aroma or flavor. Tastes like your usual mass produced swill
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Maybe my beer was bad, but there was nothing going on here. Watery and lacking and personality.
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;"Draught pint at Baumgartners Cheese Store and Tavern in Monroe, WI. Clear, very pale straw with just a touch of fizzy head...faint, fresh grassy nose, lightly sweet...plenty of corn syrup in the body, gets quite bland as it warms though it does offer a tiny trace of hops at the finish...not too bad drunk quickly and cold on tap at this wonderful old tavern; still, the beer doesnï¿½t hold a candle to the experience."
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;nice yellow color, but with big bubbles in the head which quickly dissipated. Smell and taste corn with the cidery character predominating. Canï¿½t handle it. Had it at the Bodega downtown La Crosse yesterday.
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;pale yellow, slightly cloudy, fairly foamy white head. aroma is of sweet malts and truly very little else. flavor is fairly sweet and light-bodied. just not an interesting beer....not that it was meant to be.
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Yuck?! Something was dangerously wrong with this. It was unique in flavor but the prominent flavor was totally off-putting. It tasted like the can it was poured out of. Really weird cloying hop note coupled with dank rot being drunk from a bloated bilge rat.
Wisconsin Club;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Probably the closest thing to a BMC in the Huber lineup, this beer had a mild spicy aroma, was light in body with a refreshing malty flavor and clean finish. The draft version had a slightly livelier mouthfeel but was otherwise identical to the bottled. Decent, but I think Huber Premium is a tastier and better balanced brew.
Braumeister;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;355ml bottle. This beer is resurrected. Pale golden color, very light herbal hops, its decent.
Braumeister;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours golden with a small white head. Aroma of corn and grains. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is not as bad as I was expecting.
Braumeister;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Used to buy this beer not only because it was cheap but also because it came in longnecks. Best I can say is it was better than Old Milwaukee. Good poor college student, get drunk for cheap beer.
Braumeister;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;"This was my grandfatherï¿½s beer... he generally purchased it in bulk from a discount auction place called ""Rockyï¿½s"" in Harrison, Ohio and, when I drank some I thought it mustï¿½ve spoiled and skunked from non-refrigeration and mishandling. Later, when I was able to get a cold, fresh one, I changed my mind... itï¿½s just nasty."
Braumeister;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Another bad college beer moment. Convinced by dorm room buddy this was just as good as Old Style. It wasn't even close.
Braumeister;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;It really does taste like Corona gone bad. It has the most soury taste I've ever tasted in a beer. Blech!

Boerken;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Proefbrouwerij;Beefy, warming, fairly clean strong dark ale. Pours dark red-brown with some fading beige froth, reasonably sticky fingers of lace. Smells mildly of treacle, prune, and a whiff of savory soy sauce. Bitterish up front but rolling into a sharp sugary sweetness, balanced by the warming tingle of alcohol. Reasonably balanced, maybe a tad sweet, lacking in aromatic complexity for a beer of this strength.

St. Adriaans Abdijbier (Blond);Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"33cl bottle at home (21 I 2017), bottle date November 3rd 2016. I drank this brew as Leegloperke and got this bottle as a present from my girlfriend. The Leegloperke is an alias brew of Brouwerij Van Steenbergeï¿½s St. Adriaans Abdijbier (Blond) - which I did not have yet - and was bottled for the cycling club WTC De Leeglopers from Bentille in the Meetjesland region, my home turf. Glad to have this beer label too, for it is a fine addition to my label collection... And being a cycling enthusiast myself, this bottle is just lovely and stylish. The looks are quite straightforward, with a very crystal clear, copper to orange coloured liquid with some carbonic gas bubbles. very radiant, very shiny, great appearance: Almost a brandy or cognac look-a-like. The collar is top notch, a that off white, yet swiftly diminishing and gone - with only some minor lasting foam on top. The nose is interesting altogether. It has quite a few metallic and herbs hints, dominating the grains, tree bark, corn flakes features. Think of a full grown rye field; those summer scents, combined with traditional, kitchen seasoning spices. Very subtle, thank God, are the urine flavours: fully present yet faintly lingering at the very background. One has to have a good nose to spot them. The taste is the least convincing feature of Leegloperke or the blonde St. Adriaans Abdijbier. The mouthfeel already is powered with carbonation and an alcoholic backbone. Although this bottle only contains 7.5 percent ABV. The taste is a that artificial, Iï¿½m afraid (it has a keen ""perfume"" nature, but the fruity onset is pleasing. It has a mandarin oranges, zeste and peaches character for sure. The bitterness comes with a slight soury touch, which is gratifying. The malt spine is solid. But the brew is not that complex, with besides the yeast flavours a somehow watery texture. The ending is fine, with the hoppy herbs making the finish charmingly dry. All in all a perfect looking, good smelling and modest sipping brew from Van Steenberge."

Pours a copper colour, little head. Aroma is caramel, malt. Taste is caramel, vineous, dark fruits, slight carbonation, amazing for the age. Nice BW aged for the 17 years.
King and Barnes Millennium Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;King and Barnes;Bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with huge yeast flakes and medium beige head that lasts. The aroma is bready malt and toast. Medium mouth, sweet roast, brown sugar, boozy finish, good.
King and Barnes Millennium Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;King and Barnes;2 bottle and glass wooden case found in the sale cart real cheap. Bottle # 14095. Poured a deep amber, cloudy, with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, some nuts, trace of fruitiness, and just a touch of cardboard. Tastes of caramel, dark fruits, toffee, nuts, and chocolate. The tastes are nice for something this old. Well worth the under $10 I paid for 2 bottles and a glass!
King and Barnes Millennium Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;King and Barnes;Wah. Shouldï¿½ve sampled thisun sooner. Poured with zero head. Color is a cloudy medium brown. Aroma is an aromatic blend of caramel, toffee, dark ripe fruit, molasses, malt. Flavor is the same with a little bittersweetness standing out. Body is hampered by the lack of carbonation. Finish isnï¿½t too bad and similar to the flavor with the bittersweetness giving way to a slight sweetness.
King and Barnes Millennium Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;King and Barnes;Bottle that Iï¿½ve kept for ooohh over nine years now but eventually it just kept winking at me and it had to have it, consumed 09-01-09. Pours murky puddle brown with a small beige head which was reassuring. Taste and aroma were initially quite sweet with quite a pronounced sherry character. I was expected this to be well past its best and suffering from heavy oxidation and generally quite stale so I was quite pleased to find that it wasnï¿½t too bad. In fact this was quite decent, bit sweet, toffee and the alcohol was there but in an enjoyable way. Whilst I wouldnï¿½t rave about it, this reminded a bit like an old beaten up leather sofa, it was comfortable and did the job and at the time thatï¿½s all I was looking for. A7 A3 F7 P4 OV 14 3.5
King and Barnes Millennium Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;King and Barnes;Bottle, thanks for sharing, beastiefan2k. The body was hazy light brown with a small khaki head. The aroma was rich with some oxidation, but it was not overwhelming. I sensed a vinous character along with leather and ripe old pears. The taste was sweet oxidation with some leather and table grapes. There was also some black pepper spice in the finish. Still holding up nicely, but past itï¿½s prime.
King and Barnes Millennium Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;King and Barnes;Nine year old bottle doing surprisingly well. Pours a murky dark amber color. Aroma is very fruity, covering much of any negative notes of age. Light cardboard there but the fruit is just more present. Taste is fine, canï¿½t tell age, prune-ish, sweet English malts. Actually pretty light going down, not a lot of alcohol or age coming out. This is doing better than another bottle I had 2 years ago that was at that point aged exactly the same.
Samuel Smiths Strong Golden;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Samuel Smith;Lovely looking 17cl bottle shared at GBBF. No date or ABV details, but, unscientifically, it looks fucken old. Dirty orange brown, murky, no real head. Aroma is mint, sherry, salty, touch of bovril. Body is medium, smooth, low carbonation. Taste is apple, dry woody and tangy, a little meaty with some booze showing up. Pretty decent, but showing signs of age. Pretty dry.

St. George Porter;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Porter;St. George Brewing Company;Good balance and great drinkability. Pours black with good head and lacing. Light bitter finish. Some caramel. Tap at Galaxy hut.
St. George Porter;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Porter;St. George Brewing Company;12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A: Pours a very dark brown color. The head is a one finger mocha shade. Retention isnï¿½t very good, sadly, but at least it tries to leave some lacing on the glass. Not a lot, though. S: Thereï¿½s a good chocolate note to the aroma, even more prevalent than a lot of (average) examples of the style. Beneath that is some subtle roast, brown sugar, coffee, and even a faint fruitiness. This has a really nice mocha-esque nose which I really enjoy. If the nose were a little more intense, the nose would be propelled to the stratosphere. T: This does a good job of bringing the coffee-tinged roast typical of a good porter, but with the added bonus of a subtle yet prevalent chocolate flavor. To a lesser extent, thereï¿½s a slight fruity tone near the finish. Thereï¿½s a strong mineral component to this beer - which some might mistake for metallic notes, but I donï¿½t. These brewers did a good job of giving this a load of chocolate flavor without the ridiculous sweetness (Choklat, I love you to death, but youï¿½re still a sugary fucker!) M: Like most porters, itï¿½s thin. I wonï¿½t go so far as to call it too thin, simply because itï¿½s only 5%. The carbonation is prickly and the finish is rather dry, and you know what that means. CHUG CITY. Wait, no, the chocolate flavors are too nice for me to chug this one. O: I was surprised to see that this has a 90. After drinking it, letï¿½s just say Iï¿½m not. Iï¿½d even say itï¿½s top 10 among the style. This has great chocolate flavors, yet the roasted/hoppy bitterness balances it beautifully. A classic example of an under-the-radar gem.
St. George Porter;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Porter;St. George Brewing Company;Deep brown almost black pour with brown head. Very light chocolate aroma. Taste I roasty malt, plenty of malt flavors but not too sweet. Dark chocolate finish. Nice.
St. George Porter;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Porter;St. George Brewing Company;Bottle. Dark amber-brown. Very small head. Aroma is coffee, chocolate. Taste is toffee, coffee, chocolate. Bitter aftertaste.
St. George Porter;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Porter;St. George Brewing Company;"""Interesting brew... Definitely more English than American porter. Caramel, roast and chocolate aroma. Similar flavor with some coffee aspects as well, and quite earthy. Itï¿½s also gotta ash thing going on that is simultaneously intriguing and off putting.Thanks to Thomassova for some VA beer."""
St. George Porter;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Porter;St. George Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a mug. The appearance was a black color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving a little bit of lacing running nicely in a speckled sort of way around the sides of the glass. The smell had a really nice roasty slightly robust coffee to chocolate with a lightly bitter citrus hoppiness in the background. The taste was mildly bitter, roasty, robust and moderately sweet. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was good for the style and for me. Overall, I say this was a pretty good porter that I would have again.
McSorleys Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Pabst Brewing Company;On tap at McSorleyï¿½s Ale House (Macau), pours a clear copper with a small white head. Aroma brings out syrupy caramel and bready malt, with a sort of malt liquor character. Flavour is weak and vegetal, with bready malt, some syrupy notes, and boiled vegetables. Not too pleasant at all, but I gotta tick something in this beer wasteland, donï¿½t I?
McSorleys Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Pabst Brewing Company;"From old tasting notes. Labeled as ""McSorleyï¿½s Cream Ale"". Clear amber gold colorwith a whitish, yellow head and a few bubbles. Spicy malt/hop aroma has a touch of fragrance. Foretaste is a fine balance of sweet and spicy malt and bitter hops.

Beamish Red;Cork, Ireland;Red Ale - Irish;Beamish & Crawford (S&N, Heineken);"I used to love drinking this ale but it seemed to become ""extinct"" around where I live some years ago. A very sound evening could be made of some tins of this and some of ""Beamish"" stout. A ""red 'n' black night"" was how I referred to it. Creamy delivery, great rich red colour and flavour similar to ""Guiness bitter"" but with slightly more bite. Memories..."

Cerveza Escudo;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);"In Chile , unlike any other country you can enjoy a premium beer in almost every corner (or your nearby plaza as well) of this beautiful nation. It comes in different shapes and sizes but if you really want to enjoy it the way it should be enjoyed , you must buy the glass version of it , 330cc if you are alone , 1 lt if you want to have a good time with friends , and men i really had great times with this one. Since the moment you open it , you feel the barley invading your nose but the premiere moment is when you have the first zip , the bitterness is godlike and the body catches you in a hurricane of emotions I could go on and on describing this magnificent masterpiece , but its better if you try it ! 110/100 PS: you should try the famous wine ""Santa Helena"" if you are in Chile Greetings."

Royal Light;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);(Can) I always tried to avoid this beer, but I finally drank it at a friendï¿½s house, being the only beer available. Pale yellow color with a strong aroma of rice, eggs, and some grains. Very light bitterness and watery. I donï¿½t know why I didnï¿½t drink mineral water instead.
Royal Light;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);"(in can, supermarket in Chile). A very pale and very light beer. There appear cereals and masses, flour.

Royal Light;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);"Pale yellow lager, clear with a big fast dissappearing head. It leaves virtually no lacing and shows a lively carbonation. Typical light lager aroma with cereal, corn, rice, bread and a little citrusy touch. Almost flavorless, as you could expect from a ""light"" macro brew. There is little if any bitterness, but mainly tastes like water with some gas. Absolutely light, watery and worthless."

Malta Morenita;Chile;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);"330 ml can. Very soft smell, some toasted mal. Black color with brown head. Toasted taste. Is too carbonated and the aftertaste is kind of bad after a while, but it is balanced and probably the finest cheap supermarket beer youï¿½ll find in Chile. Try adding some sugar and eggs to it for trying a local classic: ""Malta con Huevo""."
Pilsener Dorada;Chile;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Bottle. Light golden in colour with a small head. Iï¿½m lacking words - like this beer lacks flavour and aroma. I guess there was weak hints of some kind of hoppyness - but I might be wrong.
Pilsener Dorada;Chile;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);One amazing aspect of the term ï¿½Premium Lagerï¿½ is that it is universally oxymoronic. All brewers must agree that whenever they denote a beer to be premium it must be crap.
Pilsener Dorada;Chile;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);"The worst beer in this country. Only teenagers wanting to be drunk buy this cheap and ""strong"" (6ï¿½ alcohol) beer."
Pilsener Dorada;Chile;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Canned: This in my opinion is the best Chilean pilsener/lager. I quite liked its mild aroma and flavour.

Smuttynose Belgian Style White Ale;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Smuttynose Brewing Company;Smells like urine, terribly unflattering. White head dissipates quickly. Coriander is evident and dominating, but thats about all this beer is. Coriander and some light carbonation. Orange and light fruit, banana, and nothing much. Terribly bland and flat.
Smuttynose Belgian Style White Ale;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Smuttynose Brewing Company;Bright glowing yellow/straw color with low to nearly flat carbonation. Ever so slight fruity/yeasty aroma. Mild spiceyness hidden behind a citrusy spritz.Not awful, just plain dull, boring and uninteresting. Hoegaarden and Mannekin Pis are much better examples of this style.
Smuttynose Belgian Style White Ale;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Smuttynose Brewing Company;There is something wrong with this beer. If I had to guess too much orange peel, too early in the mash. That and not enough malt.

Smuttynose Belgian Style White Ale;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Smuttynose Brewing Company;It has a decent nose, but the taste is weak, some malt and a little hop presence noted. Cloudy and a bit tart, but not a good offering from this fine brewery.
Smuttynose Belgian Style White Ale;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Smuttynose Brewing Company;I didn't think it was vile but it was pretty lame for a white. Evident but unflattering orange/coriander mix. Crisp and bubbly with no head and no yeast sediment in the bottle. Also had a metallic coppery twang to it. My bottle was older so this may not be a fair review.
Smuttynose Belgian Style White Ale;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Smuttynose Brewing Company;I couldn't even swallow a sip of it. I really have never tasted anything as vile as this.
Smuttynose Belgian Style White Ale;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Smuttynose Brewing Company;I wish I could give zero ratings, just for thsi beer. It reeks of shitty tequila, and tastes about as pleasant. Now, I do like tequila, and sometimes I don't even mind that its tainting my beer(Tequiza), but this was beyond foul. I thought for sure I was going to vomit from one sip. I think this experience shaved some years off of my life. I pray that this was bad, and it isn't supposed to taste this awful.

Yards Philadelphia Pale Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Yards Brewing Company;Overall pretty disappointing.

Pours light brown / dark amber with khaki head. Malt-driven nose - nutty, caramel, some roast. Taste: pleasant and drinkable. Biscuit, caramel, toast; on the sweet side, but with a mildly roasty finish. Medium- body, smooth texture. Overall: remarkably solid offering from a local brewery I almost never drink. New yearï¿½s resolution: drink more of the locals. In fact, remind me of this next year -- 2014-2015 academic year, I will rate at least one beer from every seattle brewer in the RB database."

Nose of dark nutty sweet malty toffee with a biscotti undertone. Big nutty toffee flavor with a caramel amber backbone with a slight booziness. Not a whole lot of hops, but it doesnï¿½t need it.
Maritime Pacific Nightwatch Dark Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;Draught. Pours a very dark brown color with a moderate off-white head on it. Nose is very toasty and slightly roasty to me. Taste, on the other hand, is roastier than anything else, and ends up tasting like a slightly carbonated chilled coffee. Fairly pleasant drink.
Maritime Pacific Nightwatch Dark Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;Had off tap at lindas in Cap hill, which Iï¿½ve been told I have to go to. Chocolate and malt. Not quite a porter, but nice roasted malt presence. Offputting finish, which is kind of mop water like. Body is full initial and in the middle but the finish is a little weak.

Yards Entire Porter;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Yards Brewing Company;God, back in 1990/1991 when Yard's brewed in the garage in Manayunk, this used to be one of the best damn porters out there. Unfortunately, as they've grown, the quality on a lot of their beers seems to have plumeted. I want to like them - I really do. Tonights Porter wasn't half bad. Slightly sour (sourness is a flavor that seems to pervade many of Yards brews lately). Creamy, good roasted flavor. Mild, crisp, hop finish. Very English.
Yards Entire Porter;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Yards Brewing Company;An excellent beer that tends to offer a slightly different character with each batch. Deep ruby brown in color, somewhat hazy (as expected from a cask-keg-bottle conditioned beer). The aroma is mainly of a dryish dark malt and yeasty fruitiness, but ocassionally a bright hoppiness shows through. Well balanced bitterness. Very nice.
Yards Entire Porter;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Yards Brewing Company;"An interesting ""blended"" beer that has the malt taste of the Stout evident."
Yards Entire Porter;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Yards Brewing Company;A good smooth porter. very dark brown but not quite opaque, light brown head, aroma of fresh bread. a nice smooth porter with a malty taste. lacks the chewy element that all great porters have- this seemed more like robust british mild.
Yards Olde Bartholomew;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Yards Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle from seeswo - thanks again, Chris! 2011 vintage. Pours a hazy dark orange with a small off-white head that settles into a ring and thin film surrounding an island of larger bubbles. Notes of cardboard, caramel, sugars, dried apricots, golden raisins, tea, fruitcake, dates, and cookies. Medium-bodied, with modest carbonation and a sweet, boozy mouthfeel. Probably better when it isnï¿½t 7 years old. Iï¿½ll re-rate someday because I think itï¿½s a classic American barleywine that I need to do justice to.
Yards Olde Bartholomew;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Yards Brewing Company;Pours a small, off-white head that recedes somewhat quickly. Color is orange-amber and no lace. Smell of blonde malt, light brown sugar, light vanilla and a some dried fruits. Full body with ample carbonation and a slick finish. Tastes like yellow raisins, blonde tobacco leaves, plum skin, kilned malt, mellow brown sugar and faint leafy hop. Not bad. Surprised itï¿½s so blonde and that thereï¿½s some hop left being over three years old. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Yards Olde Bartholomew;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Yards Brewing Company;Bottle 75 cl. Pours a hazy, pale amber with a small, off-white head. Surprisingly little aroma, I just smell sugar and booze. Rich, sweet body, some subtle fruit and even more subtle caramel, thereï¿½s not exactly a ton of flavours here. Ends with some balancing hops and quite some booze. Itï¿½s a Barley Wine lacking a lot in sophistication, but if you just wanna get wasted in a very short time youï¿½ll fid this more than adequate. 071016

Yards Love Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Yards Brewing Company;Can. Prominent smoky aroma and flavor. Subdued chocolate flavor. Relatively low ABV enhances drinkability.

Nose is big coffee and chocolate. Strong smell and delicious. Taste is smooth coffee with chocolate and some dark malts. Not as assertive as the smell but really good. Coffee bitterness with a Little bit of sweetness. Light and soft palate. Goes down super easy. Overall this is excellent! Similar to Guinness but I actually prefer it to the extra stout.

It wasn't super mud thick, nor midnight black in appearance...but pretty heavy overall and had a dark brown appearance/frothy coffee colored head. Not quite a perfect balance in the flavor, slightly burnt and roasty aftertaste. Good beer though....will drink slower next time and maybe not share so I have the entire 22 oz. to get a better review.

It has an accessible, but reasonably complex flavor. It's sweet balanced by bitterness.

Smuttynose Octoberfest;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Smuttynose Brewing Company;(22 oz bottle, obtained in trade with Eyedrinkale, thanks Mike!) This is a pretty big, malty, flavorful beer for an Oktoberfest, loaded up with sweet caramel, plus a prominent toastiness. Mild bitterness, most notably in the finish, so this is certainly a malt dominated beer. Unfortunately, the finish is a bit sugary sweet, but its offset by the bitterness that has picked up steam. Moderate alcohol comes out in the flavor as well. Malty nose, caramely and sweet. Dark amber color. Off-white head pours to an average size, slowly fades to a thin layer, and leaves a fair amount of lace in large patches. Not exactly what the Germans had in mind with this style, itï¿½s much more hearty than almost all other beers in this category, but itï¿½s an enjoyable, tasty brew.
Smuttynose Octoberfest;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Smuttynose Brewing Company;Peachy brown. Nose has loads of caramel, similar caramel maltiness predominates in the flavor. Surprisingly hoppy for an Oktoberfest.
Smuttynose Octoberfest;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Smuttynose Brewing Company;Hazy orange-brown with a dense off-white head. Caramel, some mustiness.

Smuttynose Octoberfest;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Smuttynose Brewing Company;As red as a penny with a tightly wound bubbly head, this bear is nice for the looking. Fresh cherries meet the nose, a thoroughly fresh malty aroma. Big bodied with ample carbonation, this beer is at once tart, and creamy with a full-frontal malt presence. Balancing hops quickly address the situation, but the finish is big with a bang, and a long, lingering liquorish finish ensues. Warming alcohol steps in. Nice.
Smuttynose Octoberfest;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Smuttynose Brewing Company;Quite frankly, I am very impressed with this offering. Pours beautiful orangeish amber color with a fluffy head. Tiny little bubbles effervesce. Aroma has a nice amount of slightly roasted malts and finely selected hops. Rich creamy mouthfeel. Very well balanced - not overly malty like some marzens. This is an all night long beer. Smuttynose is one of my favorite brewers and this is quite the lager.
Smuttynose Octoberfest;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Smuttynose Brewing Company;"The color of this ï¿½Big Old Beerï¿½ is a lucent burnished copper with a modest head that is semi-creamy in texture; the color a beauteous light tan and the lace a tight clinging sheet to conceal the glass. Ah the crisp and fresh aroma of hops, sweet malt, a maybe a bit of raisins, spicy and nice this nose. Start is sweet with a nice malt profile, top is fair to middling in its feel. Finish is masterfully hopped, the acidity stern and the aftertaste quite dry and the hops stay with you till the end, a fine drinking beer, form a great brewery."
Smuttynose Octoberfest;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Smuttynose Brewing Company;The Smutty Octoberfest had a huge head that dissipated quickly over an orangy color. Pretty ok hoppy taste. Nothing hugely amazing about this one. I'd rather have the Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale over this one any day.

Iï¿½ve had this plenty of times before in bottles, tap, and cans (where they were contract brewed in Stevens Point, WI). Bottled on 01.23.2017. Consumed 03.09.2017. Poured into a pint glass. You donï¿½t see this kind of beer by American brewers much anymore. It looks, smells, and tastes appropriate for the style. Although it is a bit slicker, thicker, and less mineral than traditional English pale ales. Light copper in color, butterscotch-ish aroma, some diacetyl flavor detected, and itï¿½s medium bodied.

Schlafly Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Not a bad Hefe, but a little too light on the palate. Makes for a nice cold beer on hot summer days.

Schlafly Oatmeal Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Saint Louis Brewery;This was ok, one of their better ones, but still seemed slightly below par for this style. Something off on the balance, slightly rusty flavor and feel. These bottles were only a week or two old, so I doubt the beer was sour. Finding the same balance pretty much on all their brews.

The pourbisba brown color with a lot of ruby shining through the clarity. The light tan head sticks around and leaves a lot of lace. The aroma is bitter roast. There might be a little bit of chocolate in there but for the most part itï¿½s just roasted malt. The flavor is worse. There is a fruity thing happening that just doesnï¿½t work. The chocolate is light and the malts are bitter. This just isnï¿½t good. The mouth feel watery and light with lack of carbonation and a lingering bitter roast and fruity chocolate. No thanks.

Northwoods Birchwood Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Northwoods Brew Pub;I really love the description. 12oz bottle picked up from the brewery. Unfiltered orange-brown. Wow, this is pretty odd. Sort of like a cream ale in a lot or respects. Very cream soda, birch beer.. Iï¿½d guess they just threw some birch extract in an otherwise off and gross pale ale and called it day. Off, pungent undercurrents. Unimpressive to say the least.
Northwoods Birchwood Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Northwoods Brew Pub;Bottle from Skyview, thanks! Sticky gelatinous cherry wood with a thin tan topper. Aroma of caramel, grains, citrus and mild floral hops. Taste is strange and has a fake fruity feel to it to go with an off-flavor. A bit gritty and light bitter with a touch of pepper on the finish.
Northwoods Birchwood Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Northwoods Brew Pub;Tap at Northwoods in Eau Claire, WI on Nov. 18, 2011. Clear light amber pour, small white ringed head. Almost no aroma. Medium to light palate. Minimal taste as well - just a touch of grain and hop.
Northwoods Birchwood Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Northwoods Brew Pub;I picked up a single fo this while in Wisconsin. It pours a dark amber with almost no head. Nothing much to brag about. I thought it was a little watery with a slight molasses taste to it. I wouldnï¿½t throw it out, but I wouldnï¿½t go out of my way to drink it.
Northwoods Birchwood Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Northwoods Brew Pub;Pours flat with no head. Not much carbonation. Taste is of coffee. Like drinking bad cold coffee.
Northwoods Birchwood Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Northwoods Brew Pub;This beer is really pretty decent, but still nothing much to it. I like some more complexity.
Northwoods Birchwood Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Northwoods Brew Pub;Iï¿½m baffled why all of these northwoods beers have such low ratings. I thought this was pretty tasty. pours a coca cola brown with a pretty much no head. aroma is coffee, nuts, cherries, wood, and chocolate. Not too bad. flavor is sweet with a little woody tartness. Doesnï¿½t seem like a pale ale at all. more like a brown ale or something. not bad.
Mobjack Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Run of the mill American Pale ale. Nice floral spruce nose and taste. Slightly dark amber pour. Rated 11/14/02
Mobjack Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Hazy orange-amber w/ frothy tan foam. Sweet, malty, grapefruit aroma. Medium, mildly sticky feel. Clean, fresh well-balanced flavour. Finish is dry & moderately bitter.
Mobjack Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);It pours a pale yellow, it has medium carbonation, a small head, light lacing, and a pungent aroma (yawn). I can taste the malt and some traces of lemon. However, nothing too exciting about Mobjack APA. It also has a strange dry metallic bitter aftertaste that sticks around for a while.
Mobjack Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draught at Old Dominion Brewpub 3/1/2006: Contract brewed by Dominion for Mobjack. Pours to a pale golden yellow, mostly clear, with a medium white head. The aroma is fragrent citrus hops with a bit of malt - bear in mind this aroma is of medium strength in both hops and malt scents as itï¿½s designed to be a genuine beer without being over-the-top/imperial/hop crazy, to which it fits perfectly. The taste is light grains, bread, biscuit, a very light bit of sweet malt along with mildly bitter citrus hops that nicely balance things out. Light-medium body, medium carbonation, finishes clean, crisp, and without much aftertaste. This really is just an easygoing session APA. Itï¿½s a dictionary entry for American Pale Ale, but New River blows this one right out of the water in my book.
Mobjack Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Once brewed in Richmond, VA, now a contract brew that is brewed in Ashburn, VA by Old Dominion. Mobjack Bay beers are very flavorful brews, and their flagship Pale Ale, is a classic example of APA. American Pale Ale is known for having a pretty aggressive hop character, in aroma and flavor. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the bench mark example of the style, and Mobjack Bay pays tribute, but with its own local character. Four malts are used in this beer, including Munich, caramel, wheat, as well as pale malts. Two hop varieties are used, Willamette, and the signature for this style, Cascade. Mobjack Bay Pale Ale pours to a beautiful, deep, pale color, with a nice white head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer jumps right out at you. Very fragrant, zesty, critric hop aromas marry with a back drop of some sweet malt aroma. The palate is a firm malt back bone of biscuity pale malt flavors, with a touch of caramel malt sweetness, and fruity, estery flavors. This beer finishes with a big, long, dry, zesty, citric hop bite that lingers on the tongue. A great example of American Pale Ale that is just so delicious and drinkable. This is a perfect thirst quenching brew, but one that also works well with a number of dishes. I could see myself pairing this with grilled swordfish with lemon butter, as easily as I could with a big plate of hot wings.

Stoney Creek Lager;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;Had this beer on 4/11/1998. Color is a bright light gold with a good carbination and light white head. Aroma reminds me of a everyday premiuim. Taste is a light bodied brew with not much flavor. It startes off with a light thin body, goes down easy and somewhat claen. Finsh is nothing to talk about, itï¿½s bla, there isnï¿½t enought flavor or hop bitterness to get you going.
Stoney Creek Lager;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;Pours into a light, clear golden-yellow with a small white head. Unexciting aroma of light malt, cereal and a bit of wet cardboard. Mouthfeel and body are crisp but watery. Flavour is very mild, primarily malty with a quick twinge of hoppiness in the finish. It also oddly had the metallic notes that I usually get from canned Euro-lagers, even though it was bottled. Whatever the case, it just isn't a very good beer.
Stoney Creek Lager;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;A nice well rounded lager with character. Good flavor, good color good body. Good aroma. I can't find this anymore around where I live, and I'm the much sadder for it.
Stoney Creek Lager;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;Sort of an undercarbed lager and slightly stale perhaps. Very very mild and sort of forgettable, yet I had no trouble downing it all quite quickly so maybe my stomach liked it while my mind was dissing it.
Stoney Creek Lager;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;This was interesting. I thought perhaps I had bought some carbonated pear juice or something of the sorts. Very odd. I won't say it was nasty, but I haven't gone back. Just a really odd flavoring.
Stoney Creek Lager;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium yellow, moderate density of small particles. Aroma is lightly hoppy (flowers), lightly malty (cereal, grain). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Quite unbalanced/sweet.
Stoney Creek Lager;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;Stoney Creek's brewpub is in Detroit and they make most of their beers in the former Atwater brewery on the riverfront. But for reasons of volume, they contract with Gluek in Minnesota to make this beer and the vanilla porter. Sadly, Gluek has a habit of making some pretty shitty contract brews and this one fits the bill - a miserable stale, soggy saltines flavour dominates, though you can tell some barley and a hop or two have been used in the brewing.
Stoney Creek Lager;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;"What a shame - this had the makings of a good (if very subtle) lager, but the pieces didn't fall into place. It is very pale and cloudy (I accept that in great brews, but I dislike ""cloudy"" in a beer), nice, soft nose, and a nice attempt to blend malt/hops flavor. But it doesn't come off, mostly, as Seinfreak says, because the beer is much too WATERY. I actually checked the label again to see if it was a ""Lite"" beer - it isn't, supposedly. And about the label: It says ""Cold Springs, MN"" Above, it says it's made in Detroit! Wha??"

Stoney Creek Original Vanilla Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;While Iï¿½ll readily admit that my memory of this beer carries a heavy amount of sentiment -- this was THE beer that I kept in the fridge in Michigan every time I went home. Itï¿½s malty chocolate and vanilla combination neared pefection from a porter that was readily available at the gas station. The fact that the brewery went out of business is beyond my comprehension.
Stoney Creek Original Vanilla Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Poured a dark crimson walnut color with a large tan head of fine foam. The nose was a pleasant swirl of cocoa and vanilla. The taste started with melted milk chocolate then was nearly overcome by the vanilla beans. Even though chocolate and vanilla are dominate there is some decent malt structure with a sweetness and a smoothness in the mouth that comes through. The finish has a tiny bitter bite that turns the sweet into a bittersweet end. The feel was medium to low but still pleasant. flavor isnï¿½t overwhelmed by the vanilla, but itï¿½s close. This beer combines one of my favorite styles with one of the most pleasant flavors on earth (vanilla). I normally like my porters with deep and roasted flavors, this not that and I loved it anyway. Itï¿½s a shame this is no longer available. I was quite found of this porter.
Stoney Creek Original Vanilla Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Bottle. Poured rich black with a small brown colored head. Very little lacing.

This beer is in my top 5, letï¿½s hope someone recreates this recipe.
Stoney Creek Original Vanilla Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Had this beer on 11/5/1998. Color is a deep black, with low carbonation and head. Aroma is rich and sweet. Taste is smooth and light. It starts with a medium / light body that goes down smooth with a creamy feel and a gentle sweetness. The finish is very light for a porter with mild roasted malt flavors and a bit of sweetness, though I wouldnï¿½t call it a vanilla taste in the sweetness. Although I feel a porter should be a little more robust than this it is a very drinkable beer.
Stoney Creek Original Vanilla Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Very dark brown with a light brown head. Big, sweet aroma of cocoa and a ton of vanilla. This one is way on the sweet side for a porter (though I donï¿½t find overly sweet beers as detestable as most) - lots of vanilla, but not as overpowering as the aroma suggested. Notes of chocolate and nuts, mildly roasty. 12 oz bottle, sampled May 2005.

Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Deep amber coloured pour with a thick creamy off-white head. The aroma is rich and malty. Caramel, toffee and a bit of stewed fruit. Light earthy grapefruit hoppiness. Decent.

Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Starting off my introduction to RI craft brewing with this apparently well-known local amber ale. On tap at Aquidneck Pizzeria in Middletown, poured a burnished amber color with lots of white creamy foam that looked impressive initially but did dissipate quickly. Notes of warm, almost fruity, caramel on the nose, followed by more caramel malt and background fruity ale yeast ester notes in the flavor. There's a slight taste of damp herbal noble hops (Tettnanger?) and some English earthy hoppiness, brings some complex balance to the strong malts. Surprisingly light bodied and clean finishing, not creamy but rather crisp and dry-ish on the palate, unique for the amber style that can tend to be more chewy ad sticky on the palate. Overall, an enjoyable and uniquely drinkable amber ale.
Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Draft. Pours a clear reddish-amber color with no foam.

Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Bottle to becher pint glass, the appearance was a slight burnt copper to amber color with a fingerï¿½s worth of eggshell white foamy head that slid off at a moderate pace. Some lace. The aroma had some caramel/toffee malts playing with a little bit of woody notes. Slight cereal grains, and a touch of earthiness. The flavor was moderately malty sweet with barely any of the earthiness there for any sort of balancing quality. Aftertaste was malty smooth and clean. Finish was malty. The palate was almost medium bodied, seemed to sit just a touch under. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt as projected. Overall, pretty nice clean well fed amber ale. I could do this again.
Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Another beer sent to me in a beer club delivery. No preconceptions on this one, I doubt it is offered in my home state. Poured into a glass mug it offers an attractive medium red body and a thin white top. It looks to be lowly carbonated. A whiff gives me a bit of malt and vanilla. It tastes decent, a little hop to go with the malt and some pecan. Very small amount of bitterness. No great shakes but I am not put off.
Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;Draft sample at the source. The beer is a clear amber with a white head of foam.

Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Newport Craft Brewing;From bottle in tapered shaker. Pours amber with aroma of yeast and sweet bread.

Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Bottle opened to celebrate Vilijaï¿½s graduation from the Brewing Science program at the American Brewerï¿½s Guild, thanks for including us. Pours a bit hazy, but remarkably still plenty of carbonation in this 14 year old corked bottle. Aromas of caramel and brown sugar with lots of sherry notes and a touch or alcohol. No surprises in the flavor. Perhaps a hint past its prime, but Iï¿½m thrilled I got to try this and celebrate such a great accomplishment.
Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Thanks Jason for sharing such a ridiculously rare beer. The beer pours to a deep brown mahogany body with a thin but rejuvenatible light khaki head. The aroma is sweet toffee and aged malts, sherry, and vanilla. This beer is holding itï¿½s own despite the age. The flavor is sweet toffee, tobacco, sherry, and vanilla. The palate is medium bodied with a lingering sweetness.
Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;750mL bottle. Poured hazy medium plummy-amber with a short cap of tight beige head.. easily-resuscitated, but it didnï¿½t stick around too long. The aroma picked up mild peppery warmth and oxidation over well-aged drawn caramel, molasses, and maple.. an almost oak-like note accented.. more vinous as it warmed up.. soft overall, with a lovely malt bill. The flavor found more maple and molasses at the core, with black pepper and vinous fruity notes laced throughout.. oxidation never hurt it, but it aided in drying out the palate.. dry and spicy over maple on the finish. Medium-plus bodied with very little carbonation on the palate.. dry and warm, but nowhere near where it shouldï¿½ve been considering the ABV.. this held up really well, and Iï¿½m glad to have tried it.
Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Bottle popped by Jason, huge, huge thanks. Pours murky reddish brown with thin tan head, didnï¿½t last long but for a 11 year beer not surprising. Aroma has notes of rich toffee, sherry, some vanilla and slight fruitiness. Taste is nice and mellow with no signs of age, nice notes of sherry, vanilla, some nice fruit and toffee, subdued caramel notes and some nice sweetness, finishing nice and dry.
Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;"Bottle poured at the brewery for The ""Even"" Year vertical tasting. Big tangy, rich malt nose, with well-masked alcohol. Immediately the texture comes across as intensely smoother than any of the others in the series. Creamy almost. Hardly oxidized. Spicy, with some light herbal character, bits of berries, and some vinous edges. Iï¿½m really blown away at how well this has held up. Itï¿½s very, very good and has aged gracefully. A wonderful opportunity to try such a worthy gem. Flickr: http://flic.kr/p/9coZrU"
Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;"Part of our hotel room tasting, GABF 2007. Thanks to whoever brought it (pretty sure this one was from Captain Cougar or someone from the Atlanta crew). Smell instantly reminded me of De Horste Signature ale in the granulation of the brown sugar and sugar cane aromas, like you were sniffing a snifter full of pure cane sugars; also had an undertone of musty raisins like a Thomas Hardyï¿½s. Very smooth in the mouth, overripe cherries and caramel on a medium-bodied beer. Thereï¿½s some dunkel-ish grain flavor late, right before the finish settles in, and some thin grape juice character too. Nice, sweet, and rich, but not my ideal barley wine, which I like to be a bit more full-bodied and a bit hoppier."
Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;From a 750mL Bottle. Generously shared by cquiroga. Mostly transparent, ruddy amber colored pour with a thin halo of whitish head. Rich aroma of sherried pears, brandied apricots, and figgy spice. Lots of complex, fruity higher alcohols generally reserved for the classic British style barleywines. The malt characters seem to have tailored off some, leaving behind a trail of fruity caramels and peanut brittle syrup. Medium bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel. A bit oxidized, expectedly so, but doesnï¿½t destroy the beer by any means. Lots and lots of sherried fruits and notes of chewy caramel. Some leathery tannins work their way into the final smack, creating a somewhat tart, crisp finish thatï¿½s accentuated by some gentle black pepper higher alcohol spices. A bit past itï¿½s prime, but still quite tasty. Thanks for sharing, Chris!
Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Bottle shared by cquiroga on 10/12/07: Pours a transparent copper amber with a thin, wispy ring of light tan head. Aroma of sweet slightly earthy and oxidized caramel malt with some light fruity notes and mild cherry tartness. Body starts with a fairly full caramel sweetness with some sherry and light fruity complexity. Finishes with a touch of tartness and toffee. Seems to have held up pretty well with its age, but Iï¿½m pretty sure itï¿½s past its prime.
Newport Storm 00;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Poured a hazy ruby amber color with a thin off-white head.

Taste is highly carbonated, light tobacco, and a sweet flowery hop finish. The palate is very watery and light. Too clean of a finish with no after taste.

Northwoods Half Moon Gold Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Lightly hazed, pearish, pale appearance, slim fizziness above, wastes away instantly. Slick, sick, fades aroma...somethingï¿½s off in the bottling line here, as this is the fourth beer yet from this company that a plastic-y smell, no real hops, no actual malt, just really wrong. Taste: actually quite horrible. A mess. Flat, cardboardy, unattractive...well, an accident...or, so I hope. The whole thing feels infected. This should never have left the plant.

Northwoods Whitetail Wheat Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Appearance: Pours a very clear, pale gold body a thin, white ring of bubbles. Smell: Beyond the lemon and butter, thereï¿½s only a meager amount of maltiness to the aroma. Taste: Faint malt flavor with an impossibly thin hint of lemon. But a lot of butter in there, though! Thatï¿½s one thing they donï¿½t skimp on. Thereï¿½s a light grassy bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carbonation. Slick, though watery mouthfeel. Drinkability: All of the Northwoods beers seem to fall far outside of even the loosest definitions of the styles theyï¿½re trying to represent.

Northwoods Red Cedar Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;In the bottle thanks to hurrisnow. This does indeed pour somewhat reddish in color, but I really get no cedar aroma at all. No head. A bolus of diacetyl emerges if you try to smell this. Butter, rancid butter. The flavor reveals some serious fermentation temperature mistakes here. Iï¿½m glad I only had to drink about 2 ounces of this frankenstein. Crapola indeed.

Aroma is extremely grainy, drab. Flavour is.. cardboard, corn and grains, just awful. Everyone else at the table thought it was ok, I think my palate has changed drastically.

Brick Amber Dry;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Originally rated May 2005. This one comes in clear bottles. It pours a light golden-amber colour with a foamy head that dissipates quickly. The carbonation is full of big bubbles, looking like ginger ale. The aroma is slightly metallic with malt and some fruits. There is a mild bitterness in the taste again, a bit of fruit. The finish is clean and dry. Nothing offensive on this one, just not a great amber.
Brick Amber Dry;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;I loved this beer, I really did. I was in University when I first tried this. I was a slave to the mainstream breweries when this happened in my glass. To me, the aroma is fruity in nature, which made me skeptical from the beginning. Being colour blind, I will not comment on colour aside from saying it isnï¿½t dark, nor is it light. As for the flavour, I love it. It has a full flavour not found in a lot of mainstream beer.
Brick Amber Dry;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Smells like a decent, tame Micro somethingorother. Drinking it makes my palate scrapingly dry, like some beers I drank in the eighties. Iï¿½m down with the mentions of butterscotch, graininess and I will add lack of hop personality - it is an odd package that,as tupalev says does have flavor.Too light body and veers into Macro territory with the feel and aftertaste. Is there corn that makes it rather Labbatt Blue-like? Bring on the Craft Brewers Alliance B-S, I was expecting it. And now... for the silly 200th rating music...
Brick Amber Dry;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bottle at the Rhino. Medium yellow, very small white head, a few streaming bubbles.

Aroma is suprisingly hoppy but I was not alarmed when it turned out a bit skunky. Like a lot of Brick brews, this one is a bit hoppier than you might have expected. No real character. Tastes more or less the same as any other of the species.
Red Baron;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;"I had this from a bottle in Toronto. Pale yellow, a light sickly sweetness, grassy aroma, minimal hops. It had a distinctly ""artificial-movie-theater-butter"" type aftertaste- enough that I may have imagined its oily texture. It took me years to trust another pale lager. To be fair, pale lagers may be my least favorite type of beer, but to date this was among my least favorites within the category."

Smells nice malt with some bitterness. The taste is grain malt, maybe mixed in with corn... but quite refreshing. Mouthfeel is half watery and half creamy. Good summer brew but prefer their bitter, Brick Connerï¿½s Best Bitter.
Red Baron;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;Brighter yellow than normal and a semi-solid head. Aroma of wood and particle board glue mixed with two day-old socks. Flavour is a vague mix of hops and adjuncts creating a smooth glass-like film on the tongue akin to a high-alcohol malt liquor. If you have friends you donï¿½t like, this would make a perfect beer to offer them when they come over.
Red Baron;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;"473ml can.

Red Baron;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;"Bottle of ""Red Baron Premium Blonde Lager Gold Medal Winner"", but apparently just new packaging from the company website. Beer is very clear and transparent. No head despite bottle a few degrees warmer than usual serving temperature. Taste is hard to describe, starts complex but hard to pick out any flavours, and finishes with a mild bitter hoppy taste. Probably best served cold on a hot day."
Red Baron;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;A blonde lager wuth a thin white head. A mineral malt aroma with light chalky notes. In mouth, a rather light malt with oily mouthfeel, faint to inexistent hops, boring. 500 ml can from LCBO, used for cooking.
Brick Waterloo Dark;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;A good beer to have with a nice meal of your favourite cut of beef.

Aroma of cereals and corn, an innuendo of grass, faint floral notes, an apple-like sharpness, some light sweet malts step up when tasted; a mild astringent aftertaste and the hops come through in the finish albeit shy.

Pours a golden-yellow colour with a medium white head that dissipates quite quickly, leaving minimal lace. Heavy carbonation of average-size bubbles. The nose is dominant of sweet malt and slowly going toward a grainy malt. Smooth with slight fizz mouthfeel. Starts off with some mild sweet malt, then goes through this hoppy light bitterness to then end with a grainy finish. Hints of apples and pears. Definitely more punch then a lager, and quite a decent smooth ale I enjoy every time at the Dominion Bar in Ottawa.
Brick Red Cap Ale;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;Same bottle as pictured. Poured light golden yellow with small head. Very light. Not much to it at all. No hops in the flavour or aroma. Kind of taste the alcohol in it. Overall decent offering.
Brick Red Cap Ale;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;For the price this one is good. It pours golden. it has a taste of sweet cherrys. it doesnt have much hop flavour to speak of. but the malts make for a flavourful beer. I would have this one again
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bares little ressemblance to what it once was which was a Canadian keg beer modelled after the English style. Decent darkish amber colour some head retention and lacing, this lacks the complexity and length a proper British brewer could bring.
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;Originally rated May 2005. Bought a 12 pack of this brew. Comes in stubbies. Pours a medium-light amber colour with a decent white head. Carbonation is lively and lacing is nice and thick. The aroma is mostly malty, but has a slight flower scent to it. The taste is mildly bitter in the middle and then goes into a smooth breaded finish with hints of fruits. Drinkability on this one is great. Nothing crazy special about this bitter, but would drink it again.
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;"Hazy orange amber with a fizzy head. Malty ""off"" chemical aroma. Tastes like a glass of warm water."
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;Faint but present hops to the nose with malt and barley. Light amber color with thick, rich frothy tan head with decent lacing... Nice. Flavor is simple yet delivers a satisfying experience. It is a balanced combination of caramelized malts, smokey barley and hops with a bitter-sweet finish... Very nice. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, perfectly catbonated and refreshing... Very very nice.
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;Retasted 15/6/06........Bottled: Poured a slightly hazey orange-gold. Nice foamy 1 finger head with modest retention, reduces to a thick surface capping lace. Nose of sweet malts and floral hops...not overstated, Medium carbonation. Starts with a sandy mouthfeel then builds to a medium-light body where the carastan malts balance off against slightly medicinal hopping, The finish is wet and bready with a nice moderate bittering bite to it. An inoffensive english style ESB. Others have said this ale took a dive after Brick took it on from Conners.... However, as good and well rounded as I found this ale to be, there is an oddity to this ale ...it leaves me with a good impression but a nagging feeling that it still lacks a something....possibly more floral hopping or some fruity tones from different yeast.. that could make it a good ESB.... It is still one of the few ESB ales available in bottles in Ontario and Iï¿½d never turn one down.....but it lacks some undefinable something to kick it up into the class of ales one would seek out as an ESB .
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bottle-Pours transparent amber/copper with a short lived, white froth. Aromas of faint floral hops and mild candied malt. Taste is semi-sweet with a smidgen of hops bitterness to balance out the act. Pretty standard, but better than a lot of stuff here in Ontario.
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;Stubby bottle. 4.8%. Pale amber with a short-lived frothy head. Not bad at all. Light bitterness, good balance. Hoppy finish.
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;"Poured a nice amber colour with an average head. It wasnï¿½t too flat or too fluffy. Taste was first a bit sharp, but not as sharp as one would expect. Nice malty undertones with the hops coming through nicely. A good supper beer; not too filling."
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;A malted down and slightly watered down bitter for mass Ontario consumption. Some bitterness on tongue that fades the more you drink (the malt base). Light mouthfeel, carmel rounded. Good lace. Needs to be a lot more bitter. Thanks Pootz for indulging me.
Conners Best Bitter;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Waterloo Brewing Company;This bitter ale pours a golden yellow colour with a small white head. Scents are generic white bread beer. First taste was pretty good. Taste wasnï¿½t too far off the generic but with good carbonation and a round malty taste. Maybe a little honey taste?! The palate was nice with just a little bitterness.
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Cheapest beer in Ontario. Same alcohol content as all the more expensive brands. Tastes like beer. 5 stars!!!!
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Mid body, modest bitterness, a bit sweetness like corn. Nothing special point but good value.
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Good beer for when you feel like something a little cheaper than Blue. Don't let the craft beer crowed scare you off now.
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Excellent clean refreshing taste. Great value. Quality brew from Brick. I prefer it in bottles.Everything tastes better in glass. Always goes down great.
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Very good value lager, very clean, smooth, fresh. If you're a big fan of craft lagers this might not be for you, but this is a better option than any macro lager imo.
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Label is quite different than this. Has a big blue maple leaf on it. Drank right from the twist off cap bottle. I assume its pale yellow & clear. Big first swig yields a fairly reasonable tasting cheap pale lager. Good co2 makes it quite quaffable as well as behaved. Civilized decent thirst quenching beer. Good job brick.
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Pours pale straw yellow with a white head. Aroma is corn, grain and straw. Sweet malt taste with a slightly higher than average carbination. Typical cheap lager front the beer store.
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Yellow, fizzy, grainy and watery. Nothing offensive but nothing exemplary, significant, memorable, or even notable about this one. That sums up Laker for you - I donï¿½t even get the luxury of something to really hate on.
Laker Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;"bottle @ The Anderson / Columbus OH --- Clear straw amber color, good 2"" white head, wide bands of lace. Aroma of malt and corn. Taste is thin sweet malt with some corn that adds solid carbonation on the swallow, moving to a lightly hopped finish. Typical ""big-box"" brew, but Iï¿½m drinking it in front of the NFL on TV, and itï¿½s okay."
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Very good value lager, very clean, smooth, fresh. If you're a big fan of craft lagers this might not be for you, but this is a better option than any macro lager (or any other value lager) imo.
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;can. Pours clear pale yellow with a bleach white head. Aroma of wheat grain. Light bodied with a slight peppery mouthfeel and quick finish. Flavour is grainy and subdued with a granny smith apple hint. Hey not bad for a buck a beer brand, and I have to rate every beer out there...even the bad ones.
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;(drain pour and ticksï¿½ night) pours clear straw without a head. almost no aroma. faint malts, boiled veggies and corn, few apple juice notes, almost absent hops if not some herbal blandness. aggressive carbonation, light body - watery.
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;NIce for being a light one. Nothing special to talk about this one. Just nice foam and character.
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Clear light yellow colour, small white lasting head. Very little in terms of aroma and flavours. Some grains on the nose, a bit of sweetness in the taste. Very watery.
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;341ml bottle. Very pale, crystal clear yellow colour, moderate fizzy head that died instantly. Lots of carbonation. Thin grassy sweet aroma with just a touch of floral and skunk. Weak taste, some grain and light malt.Thin, watery body, carbonation went flat very quickly. Overall, not recommended, even for a light beer.
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;473mL can from the brewery. Pours a pale gold with a medium white head. Aroma is okay, faint, but okay, cereal grains and Brick character. Flavour is exactly like regular Laker but without the pleasant malty sweet finish. That said, this is still enjoyable by light beer standards. Some good cereal grain malty sweetness, light palate (almost watery), with a mild dry finish and the same faint peppery zing that Laker has that makes me think there might actually be some hops here, or at least hop extract. Not bad, wouldnï¿½t bother with again, but not bad...
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Originally rated May 2006. After reviewing the Lakeport Light, I decided to review this one... Lakeportï¿½s competition. This one is slightly more expensive. Pours the same golden colour, has the same foamy white head, dissipates as fast and has hardly any visible carbonation, just like the Lakeport. Grainy malt nose that is quite present for a light beer. Grainy watery mouthfeel. The taste is slightly better than the Lakeport, with a bit more all-over flavours. Grain malt, mild fruitness like apples, honey and just a tad of corn in the aftertaste. Just a notch up from Lakeport Light, but both are unoffensive light brews.
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Well you get what you pay for, what more can i say? Brewed for people who want a cold beer, that doesnt taste like anything. It delvers what it advertises, not my thing.
Laker Lager Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;"I believe this is the worst tasting beer I have ever had, the malt used was just ruff and strange tasting, I have tasted the malt in other beers but never so over powering, for a light beer it has lots of flavour but lots of bad flavour, I don;t know how to describe this beer other then bad"
Laker Dry Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bottle (Old Notes-Brewed at Lakeport Brewing)-Pours golden with a small white head. Aroma of corn and grains. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is just another pale lager.
Laker Dry Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;not bad when you dont have anything else to drink cheap beer. not bad when ice ice cold
Laker Dry Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bottle-A buck a beer, so a six pack doesnï¿½t set you back much. Very grainy aroma, pours dull yellow, with busy yet dead white fizz. Corny grain flavours, lots of booze as it warms. Good thing it doesnï¿½t have preservatives........this brewery..........my word.
Laker Dry Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Happy Birthyday to KT, happy new rating for me! Pale yellow body. Fruity sweetly inoffensive body with the vaguely malty cardboard aroma typical of the value brands available in Ontario. Thin and watery, but surpringly drinkable. At least as good as Molbattï¿½s or the other non-descript lagers available.
Laker Dry Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;"(Bottle) Living in Ottawa means so many priviledges like a full selection of Laker at the Beer Store. Yipee! How lucky. Gross, boring and sub-standard brew. You know something is wrong when everyone writes, ""someone gave this to me to try..."""
Laker Dry Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Some guy gave this to me. I think his name was Jasper. Dry yes grainy yes. Pure bordum.
Laker Dry Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;I shall summarize in few words . I had no pleasure drinking this product of Brick whatsoever , alcohol soda like , not much any aroma that is worth of mentioning .
Laker Dry Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Grainy, slightly alcohol-tasting mainstream lager. .........................
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bottle (Old Notes-Brewed by Lakeport Brewing)-Pours a clear pale with almost no head. Aroma of corn and alcohol. Taste of the same. This medium bodied brew is not bad for a malt liquor.
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;Originally rated May 2006. Last of the Laker reviews. Kept the strongest for last. This will also compliment the Laker Premium Light I just had. Pours a rich golden colour with no carbonation. The head is big, creamy and foamy with better retention than the Laker Light. Good lacing all around. The nose is grainy in malt with a touch of alcohol. Watery mouthfeel, with again the alcohol showing up slightly in the back of the throat. The taste is mild with grain malt and fruits like apples in the aftertaste. Not bad on the burn, but rather have a few more of their normal lagers to get her done.
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bottle (12oz) shared with HogTownHarry & GregClow -- courtesy of GregClow. Pours a pale gold with a spare diminishing white head. Aroma of urine-covered diapers, slightly rotten apples and alcohol. Flavourï¿½s watery, corny, grainy and filled with various nasty elements. Light bodied. Simply awful -- if you must drink this then drink it ice-cold and chug it so you canï¿½t taste it.
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bottle shared with blankboy & HogTownHarry. Another ratings whore find in the LCBO singles bin. Bright golden colour with a small white head. Aroma of fusel alcohol and plastic, with vague malt notes. Sticky body. Flavour is thankfully quite bland, with a faint sweetness and not much else.
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;"Bottle (341ml). Shared with blankboy and GregClow - tupalev MADE us drink it, at gunpoint beyotches yï¿½all. Pale gold, not much head, looks pretty limp in the bottle. Strong, nasty aroma, cheap rice and corn - blah! Pretty awful taste, too - harsh corn, sharp alcohol, stale bitter ""hop"" oil coating my tongue. Watery, boozy, harsh - just donï¿½t unless youï¿½re a ratings slut like me."
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;Standard gold appearance and aromas of cardboard, stale malt and green apple, plus ominous sharp alcohol. Drinkable palate and low flavour profile. Could use more hops to offset the stale, bitter alcohol finish but is borderline bearable as is.
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;NOT that bad, but still being a lttle cheap flavour, too strong and nothing special on it. ONly for those who get drunk.
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;holy crap does this beer ever suck. if you want a strong beer that kicks you in the butt. go right ahead. i rather get drunk off of a beer tasteing beer
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;Beer like this has to be judged with the competition in mind. For the price ($24 for 24) I do not think it can be beat (although I will keep searching). Admittedly uninspiring aroma, the strong alcohol content contributes to a fuller flavour. If spending twice as much there are many better beers of course, but value for money counts for something.
Laker Strong Premium Lager;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Waterloo Brewing Company;"341ml Bottle: Brick has always been my favourite Canadian brewery but if they continue to be responsible for stuff like this I might have to rethink that. I should have looked here first and noticed this ""beer"" was a malt liquor. Smells like rectum, looks fine with the exception of the frothy phlegm-like head that runs along rapidly. Tastes like a combination of rubbing alcohol and metal. I can still taste it 30 minutes later, and thatï¿½s not a positive thing. Premium lager my white a$$."
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Un-natural bitterness and sweetness. Though I felt good value for Red and Lager of Laker 's beer, I will never try this one again.
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;great beer!! just sad they stopped putting a free can in the case.It was a great bonus
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Can. Clear golden body, small white head with decent retention and some lacing. Aroma of wet grains, cardboard, cheese with some metallic notes. Taste of sugary malts, corn, wet paper and same harsh metallic notes. Not terrible.
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;cereal, basement aromas, pale, clear, minimal head, lightly sour, salty, thin feel, flat. Basically what you would find at your standard Northern Sports Event(s). But for 1.95 a can its expected. Typical Cheep Canadian Beer.
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Somehow this is significantly worse than both Laker and Laker Light [both of which I enjoy]. You can really taste the alcohol, if you like bocks you might like this, I very much don't like either.
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Canned. This is some nasty stuff. Looks like a lager, smells like glue, tastes like corn syrup and finishes with gasoline. Wow. Iï¿½ve never used these words to describe beer before.
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;473ml can pale pour corny aroma, pretty metallic, corn not the worsk shit. ok.
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;This smells something like yeast and garbage. Itï¿½s sort of metallic, light bodied but still quite sweet and corny. It has creamy carbonation which makes it oddly pleasant to drink, which is strange because it tastes disgusting.
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Rather bland beer with low drinkability. The color was rather pale around 4.5 ebc. Foam and cling was low. There was a hint of mercaptan and sour after taste. There was also moderate astrigency.
Laker Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Can. A clear, pale golden beer with a small, off-white head. The aroma is rather weak, but some grains, hay and corn escapes the glass. Itï¿½s faintly fruity on the palate, thin on the palate, and soft. Grains, some notes of corn and fruityness and a touch of hay in the flavor. Maybe some bitterness too, at least in the finish. Fortunately it doesnï¿½t smell of taste much, as what is isnï¿½t very interesting or good. 150618
Algonquin Dark Cream Ale;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;Nice and tasty , loved the dark sweet bittery flavour. Also nice tingle on the tounge. Also found it a bit dry.
Algonquin Dark Cream Ale;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;Sweet roasted malts aroma, also scent of fruit. Deep amber, creamy head. Bitter sweet, roasted malt and fruit. Tongue tinglingly good. Fair.
Algonquin Dark Cream Ale;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;More bitter than those cream ales I ve tryed in past . Aroma of plum was replaced with oak-like . Average ale look , thick small foam . Not im my style , watery and one sided . Not to complex , Simple bitternes with water .
Algonquin Dark Cream Ale;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;Dark golden - auburn color. Smacks with Goldings I believe, burnt hop taste. High carbo, very dry.
Algonquin Dark Cream Ale;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bland, adjunct-laden........................................................
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Light toasty aroma. Clear amber brown with small off-white head. Vaguely sweet flavour seems quite watery and has no real bitterness. Light body with low carbonation makes it feel watery. Not really bad, but not really worth the effort of drinking it either. Bottle. Entered from notes.
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Tastes like bad iced tea. If you see it in plastic bottles then get away, it will be completely and totally flat. Not good...way too watery.
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;"Not like the Black & Tan''s one would get in Ireland which would consist of mixing a Guinness and Harp Lager; or in Northern Ireland mixed with a Bass Pale Ale. Nice try though..."
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Toasted malt, nothing special...............................................
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Light toasted malt nose.Easy too drink but has no character...watery........
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Roasted malt aroma, deep clear garnet colour, medium toffee head. Caramel, and roasted malt flavour, good bitterness. A bit watery, average.
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Decent beer nice overall flavor. Good roasted bitters with a clean and crisp mouthfeel and finish. Pleasant beer.
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Aroma was not bad at all. Complex dark roast with sweeter accents. Creamy oily mouth feel not to bitter not to sweet. I could say strange is some sense. I am not specialized wit stouts so can say much else. I shall seek the truth ... Thanks Damon!
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Dark red color, tan foamy head. Little aroma, some roast, semi-sweet malt. Not much here. Basically just a watered down stout, which is what they were aiming for, so I guess it's true to style anyway.
Algonquin Black and Tan;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;This is a very enjoyable black and tan......................................
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;Bottle (Old Notes-Brewed by Algonquin Brewing)-Pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma of grains and sweetness. Taste of the same. This is just another Canadian Pale Lager.
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;bottle from the beer store. Pours light yellow aroma of malt, grainy, thin bodied with light carbonation. flavour is sweet. no metallic notes, no hops. Not a bad macro-style beer. inexpensive.
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;Originally rated May 2006. Silver Medal at the 2006 World Beer Cup in the American-Style Premium Lager category. Bought this one in a 28 pack. Pours a pale golden colour with a small white head, not much retention and no lace at all. Carbonation is active, but not too crazy. The nose is pretty malty with hints of spices and apples. Typical watery mouthfeel of a lager. Some sweet malts, with some slight apples and a dry finish. Really not a bad brew, with no corn to be found, but nothing really exciting. Good decent swiller beer.
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;bottle. Poured clear pale amber with a thin white head. Grainy adjunct, rice aroma. Creamy, average bodied pale lager. Fruity, slighty vegetal flavour, but otherwise a nice macro lager for the price.
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;Bottle. Boring light-gold appearance. Aromas of boiled white rice, stale cracker and rain water. Easy drinking, goes down well, but almost neutral in flavour with just hints rice plus a metallic edge. A boring beer by the end of the bottle.
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;pretty decent for a macro type beer. some sweetness and fruityness from banana it seems. not bad
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;Ok beer, it tastes like what you would expect from any other pale lager, it has almost a banana like taste and it is not bad, I would drink again
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;341mL bottle from a mixed-6, from the breweryï¿½s retail store. Pours out a nice lively gold with a large frothy white head. The aroma is alright, some decent cereal grain malts, but with that signature Formosa Spring water touch that puts a lot of people off. Itï¿½s hard to describe, but itï¿½s sort of a minerally character that can seem a bit off. The flavour is more of the same with a nice sweet finish. I wouldnï¿½t be at all surprised if there were adjuncts in here but they are not very apparent or offensive. Seems like a blend of JR Brickman Pils with their Red Baron lager, and knowing Brick that might literally be what this is. But all things considered it is quite drinkable and borderline mildly tasty.
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;a nice easy drinking lager. nothing to complain about but offer zero complexity. very typical of the style but probably the best value out there right now.
Formosa Springs Draft;Formosa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Formosa Springs Brewery;meh......nothing special. wasnt sure if i was having labatt blue,ormolson canadian, or coors light........seeing how that all are awful beers,how good can this be?

Firestone Walker Lager (-2007);Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Poured a slightly hazed golden color with a small off-white head white head.

Firestone Walker Lager (-2007);Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Probably my least favorite of the Walker Brewing family. Not a bad beer but when drank after the IPA or Double barrel it pales in comparison. I havenï¿½t had a lot of different lagers but this was tasted odd, for a lager. A good beer none the less but if your going to get a FWB beer, IPS is the way to go.

Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;Review from notes, sampled 1/17/2008 Pours a solid black with a tan head that leaves some lacing on the way down the glass. Aroma is malty with some caramel and coffee mixed together with a little fruit. Taste is a creamy coffee with some fruits and a citrus hop bite at the end. Medium body and mouthfeel. Very easy drinker, I could not notice the alcohol. Great brew, I hope its not really retired because Iï¿½d love to enjoy this again.
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;Pours with an opaque black body that throws up a tall tan head. Coffee, chocolate and roast malts all come easily to the nose. Starts sweet, then roast malt bitterness becomes the finish. Smooth and creamy.
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;Dark black pour with a tan head. Rich, creamy stout. Regular stouts that arenï¿½t imperial donï¿½t get much better than this. Rated 5/13/04
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;Bottle, why do i have a feeling this will show up as a scratch recipe, pours a black body with a tan head. Malty body some caramel, roasted malt, hints of chocolate and a light pine notes. Oats some light lactose and a mildly bittering finish. Good shit.
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;Thanks to Todd for the retired bottle! Poured rich, deep black with just a dusting of off-white head. The aroma opened with sweeter chocolates, molasses, and maybe a pinch of honey.. had some age to it, but still had and intriguing impression.. not much to speak of in terms of hops.. moderate roast to it. The flavor had sticky chocolates, coffee, and molasses at the core paired with a touch of lactic sourness.. a bit of coffee bitterness and tobacco on the edges.. finished tacky with toasty chocolate milk. Medium-bodied and sticky on the palate with some creamy feel on the middle.. decent mouthfeel, but Iï¿½m guessing it was better a couple years ago.
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;bottle at the deli inpart of a meet the brewers night in state college pa. This pours a very dark brown almost black color wih an off white head. The smell is toasty and chocolate. the taste is of chocolate and bitter hops a surprisely good combo.
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;nice black pour with a light mocha head...retention and lacing are just okay. aroma is very sweet and caramely with little hop presence. tastes malty and sweet...reminiscent of vanilla extract with noticeable oatmeal and milk flavors and a touch of coffee near the end. found it in my cellar a bit too late maybe? motuhfeel is a bit creamy and the finish lingers for a bit with roastiness and coffee. wish i found this in my cellar sooner...
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;Poured a nice black color with a tan head. Aroma really draws you in with a nice balance of sweet chocolate, roasted malts and hops. Flavor is more of the roasted coffee flavor but with a doubling balance of sweet chocolate and bittering hops. Although I like the dead reckoning porter a lot. its a shame it replaced this great beer.
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;Pours dark brown, opaque, with mahogany translucent edging. A firm, tan head rose to a half inch with an aggresive pour, and quickly receded to a placid surface. A few errant dots of lacework and a ring around the edge of the glass was all that remained. Aromatics are subdued, but the oats and chocolate are still evident. Slightly biscuity and bready, with powdered dark chocolate and granola. Mouthfeel is faded and heading for flatsville. Not quite full bodied and lacking enough viscosity to seem thinnish. The pallet is fairly middle of the road, with a decent enough mix of bitter chocolate, roasted malt, and some mild coffee grounds. Bitterness is right on, and balances nicely with the residuals. Finishes slightly bitter with a fading Coca-Cola note and some faint warmth. This particular bottle was picked up about a year ago, and Iï¿½m sure it would be superior if fresh. This oneï¿½s a yawner though.
Trï¿½egs Oatmeal Stout;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Trï¿½egs Brewing Company;good, not great, not the best stout Iï¿½ve had, not the worst, itï¿½s a mediocre stout from a wonderful brewery
Brick Bock;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Waterloo Brewing Company;Some spice and a full fleshy body, this has some nice dark fruits in the nose and to taste and just a tad too much acidic kick. Still an awful lot going on here compared to this breweryï¿½s other products.
Brick Bock;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Waterloo Brewing Company;1994 red wax dipped bottle. Drank with TomThompson, Jason 7 Carter from Camerons. Pretty sure this is the oldest beer ive had to date. Murky muddy brown pour. Taste has somewhat stood up for 15 years. Notes of chocolate, some dried fruits. I definately feel this is past its prime but IMO it has hed up remarkably well. Seemed like an old SA Chocolate bock
Brick Bock;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Waterloo Brewing Company;Wow !! So good Thanx to Mike from Cameronï¿½s at the Cask tasting. Shared a 1994 adition, wow was that nice Dark brown color, malty spicy sweet aroma. Flavor similar malty some smoke, sweet dried fruit a little alcohol. Wow so good for a 14 year old beer. Very lucky to have got to try this.
Brick Bock;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Waterloo Brewing Company;1993 bottle shared courtesy of MDS, thanks for being so generous Mike! Deep dark chestnut pour unleashes a nice size mocha froth and puts lots of sediment in my glass. The nose is of huge caramel malts with plenty of black cherries, wood smoke, nuts, sherry and a blast of leather. Quite big and assertive. The flavour profile is a bit weaker than the nose would have led me to believe. It is quite malty sweet with hints of sherry and dark fruit. After that, there is a roasted nuttiness followed by a sharp metallic twang lending itself to the finish. Bitterness lingers, and the finish is a touch watery. All in all I am impressed. This beer has held up very well over 15 years. Iï¿½ve been wanting to try this for years, so thanks Mike for giving me the opportunity to do so, I appreciate it.
Brick Bock;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Waterloo Brewing Company;A revival of ratings, thanks to Pootz opening up his cellar on this. He has given me the 2001 edition. I found this to be in good shape overcoming it not being intended for so long. While the carbonation has gone out to a significant extent, the beverage was still tasty and interesting with a dark brown colour sans the head, and a malty treat to smell sans much yeast. It was not to sweet, and yes there was a pungency and mid-sip spiciness, bittersweet chocolate, mollasses in finish.
Brick Bock;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Waterloo Brewing Company;"2000 edition sampled in 2007 Poured a dark chestnut color in the glass..light needed to see through..has ruby highlights. Thick sticky 3 finger mocha colored cap that lasts relatively well then settled to a rich surface foam that imprints lace on the glass as you drink. Aroma: a tad 2 dimensional but still wonderfully pungent...figs and chocolate in spades with a light whisp of wet hay. Medium bodied, silken mouth feel and pungent dried fruit toasty-nutty character. Starts wuth a nice bite into Christmas cake then the dried fruit (figs/dates) and cocoa tones dominate without cloying...mid palate the hops show to create an interesting mix of medicinal/herbal bittering offset to the toasty-nutty malts with dried fruit (figs) from yeast esters plus the coca tones from black patent malts....complex blend of mellow flavors but not overly complicated ( which is a plus for drinkability in a dark bock)...mellow, slow finish runs like bittersweet chocolate on raisin toast with a light herbal-woody bittering just at the end that tails off into the after taste. WOW! Age improved? dunno... but not oxidized and certainly a drinkable sturdy bock of old world dimension and taste. We have got to beg this brewer to make this beer again...probably the best dunkler bock I have tasted in Canada if not the US as well...Shinerï¿½ bock has niothing on this...neither do Stoudtï¿½s or Calument...this is very close to Weltenburger bock...but better IMHO................................................................................................................................................................. Bottled. 2003 edition.... Poured a deep dark ruby-cola color with soft carbonation which produced a good frothy 3 finger sand colored head.... Aromas sweet malts..chocolate, ripe cherry, molasses with some walnut notes. Buttery mouth feel full of complex malt flavors; burnt toffee, smoked caramel...some fig and licorice...then a long liqueur-like finish where the sweet toffee malts give way to the hops and leave a lasting impression of tart spiced rum as the alcohol warmth kicks in."
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I first tried this years ago. The gold triple X sitting upon it's dark backdrop was daring and ominous. Years later after many disappointing tasting experiments I got XXX again. It has a strong, dark, rich flavor and a pleasant aftertaste.
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Backlog, clear golden with a medium head. Notes are rubbing alcohol i clean my cannabis pipes with, skunk, cereal, and heavily sweet malting. Medium body with active carbonation. Bad
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bigger can poured into a snifter. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. Sweet and floral. Fairly sugary. Bigger body and medium carbonation.
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours clear, pale golden with a two finger, white head. Aroma is corn syrup and light skunkiness. Taste is sweet corn syrup, moving to some minuscule hope presentation. Finish is all corn. If you love corn syrup, this is your beer. If not, there's not much reason to drink it.
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. A 2"" sudsy white head drops slowly with some mild lacing. Color is slightly hazy gold with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aroma of toasted malt, corn, floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with a lingering boozy finish. Flavors sweet corn, yeast rolls, and floral hops. Overall: it is a bit cloying and sweet, but that is not unusual for the style."
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can. It poured clear gold with a white head maintained by good carbonation. Malty aroma with cereal and caramel notes. The taste is moderately sweet. Not bad.
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 6/18/2018. Pours crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with light honey, nutty, corn, and herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice aromas with pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with light honey, nutty, corn, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with light honey, nutty, corn, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Lightly increasing warmth of 7.3% after the finish. Overall this is a good malt liquor. All around nice robustness of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, clean, and easy to drink for the ABV. Very clean and rich barley flavor profile, with decent earthy hop balance. Not overdone on corn/adjuncts at all. Pretty similar to Regular and Ice, with more barley flavor and body as expected. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example."
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 oz can. Drank from the can. Has the typical grain alcohol malt liquor flavor. Smoother than most malt liquors. The 7.3 ABV is not hidden and becomes more obvious as it warms. Best enjoyed ice cold.
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I poured it from the bottle into a pint glass. It pours golden with a white head and decent lacing. The aroma is faint corn and grain. The taste is apple, corn, and grain. The sweetness fades into some bitterness. The alcohol was hid well. This was okay.
Molson XXX;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Clear yellow color with a tall, stable off-white head. Some pale malt and floral hops. Light peppery alcohol. Smells like I would expect a decent malt liquor to smell like. Pale malt sweetness. Some dough and bits of spicy alcohol. If I had to live on malt liquors, this would be near the top of the list. 4/13

Catamount Pale Ale;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Catamount Brewing;Had this beer a few years ago at a friends wedding in Vermont. He had worked a seasonal job at the brewery. I loved this local favorite! I brought some back to Ohio with me.
Catamount Pale Ale;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Catamount Brewing;Had this beer on 6/17/2000. Aroma is a nice hoppy scent. Color is a clear golden brown with good carbonation and head. Taste is refreshingly hoppy. Starting with a light body it goes down with a crisp maltyness. The finish is a nice pale malt flavor backed by a very good hop flavor and nice bitterness. Very well balanced, refreshing and perfectly hoppy.
Catamount Pale Ale;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Catamount Brewing;I am reviewing this entirely on memory. Catamount Pale Ale was the first micro brew I ever tasted back in 1985 or 1986 when the Vermont brewery first opened. I was a reporter at a local radio station covering their grand opening for a news story (great gig eh?). Up until that point I was drinking mostly the Canadian stuff with occasional orders of European ales. Catamount introduced me to the world of real beer and for that I am forever grateful. I remember this having a great aroma, an attractive look, and a great taste. I wish they were still around.
Catamount Pale Ale;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Catamount Brewing;A clear amber color, below a fine snow-white head. Nose is fresh and fruity, wafting out suggestions of peach, citrus, apricot, cherries, hell, everything nice under the sun! Plus a whiff a sea-foam. Palate takes a great hit of hops, but becomes mellow and smooth thereafter. Wow, this is awfully tasty, as delicious as all the get-out on Godï¿½s Green Earth! Medium body, nice texture, delicious finish. Singularly hoppy and palate pleasing, this is a very well-produced and satisfying pale ale
Catamount Pale Ale;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Catamount Brewing;(Bottle) Amber/orange in color with a white head. Some hop aroma and flavor, but not nearly enough for my tastes. Not my favorite IPA. No longer produced by Harpoon/Catamount.

Low expectations given how awful their pale lager is but itï¿½s actually fine.

Quilmes Bock;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);The beer has a beautiful dark color. The color is a perfect ruby red and the beer has a lovely red glow. The beer is crystal clear. The beer pours a decent amount of slightly tinted foam. The bulk of the foam collapses very fast, but a tiny drape of foam remains on top of the beer. The smell of the beer is very nice. The smell is a little bit creamy. I also smell some roasted barley, some licorice and some cherries. The later isnï¿½t that strong though. I smell a little bit of alcohol. The taste has a little bit more of the roster barley. The beer has a nice bitter taste, but it is balanced nicely by a sweet fruitiness. You can taste the alcohol better than you could smell it. The beer has a lot of roast aromas and flavors for a bock beer and fewer sweet caramel and syrup aromas and flavors, however, this isnï¿½t disturbing at al. It is a nice variation.

Norte;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);In Can. Pale gilding, with a head white enough and thin. Without aroma, probably anything of herbs, but little. In the palate, the flavor is insipid, some kind of hoppy, with slight bitter, and acid enough in the finish. Watery and weak body. It is not special.
Norte;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Bottle. Again another product of the giant brewery Quilmes. Itï¿½s the same beer with different names. Watery, overcarbonated, no aroma, no taste.
Norte;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Bottle.(alu) Golden colour with a white head. Aroma is alcohol, malt, hop. Flavour is watery, malt, hop, alcohol.
Norte;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Weird aluminum bottle. Pale, golden body with a thin white head. Slightly unclear. Nearly no aroma at all, maybe a little hint of hops and some traces of alcohol. Insignificant flavor, if I dive really deep down in the bottle as Yngwie obviously does, I must agree there could be some lemon feeling here as well. Another meaningless beer in a designer bottle.
Norte;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Bottled (alu). A clear, almost golden beer with some microfloaties and a white head. Weak aroma with some hops to start, then malt, some alcohol and lemon-hints shows up. Weak flavor too, with malt, hops and some citrus. Thin body and a hoppy finish. A boring beer in a fancy bottle, probably meant to serve ice cold. (070119)
Norte;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Bottle Macro adjunct pale lager. The thipycall sympthoms for the style: no color, no taste, no bitternes, no body, just bubbles and alcohol.
Iguana;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Color dorado, filtrada sin sedimentos, buena carbinatacion, espuma cremosa pero poco duradera. Aroma y sabor a Malta. Interesante al principio, luego deja ver un poco de oxidaciï¿½n. Bastante plana, pero refrescante. Muy buena para el verano pero para los consumidores mï¿½s exigentes, no es mï¿½s que otra cerveza industrial poco representativa de esta bebida.
Iguana;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Bottle 970ml. clear glass. [ As Iguana Summer ].

Iguana;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Pale yellow, little head, no smell, waterish taste....a very light beer, nothing special...
Iguana;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Palid yellow color, regular carbonation, light body, white non lasting foam, no aroma, intense black olive taste. Bottle from supermarket.
Iguana;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Just looking at the label you know something is wrong when itï¿½s called Iguana and thereï¿½s a photo of a gecko. And it goes it all goes downhill from there. Sour, half rancid taste of nothing, watery colour. Bad.
Iguana;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);"Purchased in Buenos Aires and poured from a liter bottle into a wine-style glass to drink. The beer had a clear, light-gold color with a small, bubbly white head that had little retention and only slight cling. It had a faint grainy and grassy hops aroma with a little bit of malt. The taste was not very good; it was mostly bitter and grainy with a sour effect coming in late as well. It had a thin, light, and dry body with very little carbonation. I was not impressed by this beer."
Andes;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Litter bottle. Super average lager with some kick i n the taste. I guess with a good argentinian asado this is great
Andes;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);"it's a sturdy beer, with a pleasant aroma, signifying the promise of an awesome tomorrow. pleasing to the tongue, dressed in an amber coat, that sits gorgeously in a glass or a (chop) pint,as is the commonly acknowledged term, or any other instrument of your choosing . A beautiful light kiss that asks nothing and gives everything and anything you should require of it ( keep in mind its just a beer, no chores or heavy lifting duties), its cold, refreshing and smooth as ""f$#k""( no I am not being paid to promote this beer, it is what it is). Una Cerveza, muy bien toma!"
Andes;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Bottle at home. Clear blonde, poor white head. Cereals, malts, corn, light hops.

Imperial (Argentina);Santa Fï¿½, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Santa Fï¿½ (CCU Argentina);Una lager comercial bastante comï¿½n. Sin nada para destacar. Una de las mï¿½s correctas de Argentina. Lï¿½pulo, maltosidad y refrescante.
Imperial (Argentina);Santa Fï¿½, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Santa Fï¿½ (CCU Argentina);Bottle in BA - pale yellow color, white head. quite okay for a simple lager. I think I like the Imperial family. I mean, they are average, but that's at least something in South America.
Quilmes Light;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Bottle in Buenos Aires. Watery lager with fruity taste. Goes ok with warm weather I guess.
Quilmes Light;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Pours yellow with a tiny head. Aroma of wine and grass, very faint. Taste of bog standard lager. Very poor.
Quilmes Light;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Draft pour at kraken bar in buenos airies. Golden with white head. German beer aroma like a Heineken. A sort of skunky lager. Not good
Quilmes Light;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Bottle. Pale yellowish colour with hardly any head. Weak aroma of grain. Waterish though sparkling crispy flavour of grain. Very thin brew!

Mild, citrusy, aroma; otherwise non-descript, but not offensive. Perfectly-balanced, but thin and watery. Light-bodied with lively carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish.

Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);Liter bottle at Vea near Palermo BA - but Iï¿½ve also seen this at Carrefour. Pours golden with substantial head for the style. Nose is bread dough yeasty with just a touch of off-aroma, and some notes of other cereales, but not overwhelmingly so. Flavor is simple and ok - really it just tastes like cheap pale barley malt, a little bit of off-putting saccharine sweetness, with a touch of bitterness at the end that tastes a bit like the herbalish dutch style lager hops. Iï¿½ve had bad cheap lagers in China, Mexico, Eastern Europe and elsewhere, and this certainly is not bad - itï¿½s just a simple and inexpensive barley-dominated beer. Iï¿½m leaving Argentina in two days - if I would have known I would have sought this out for the rare times when I wasnï¿½t in the mood for local - extremely cheap and good - wine.
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);Tiene un aroma particular como a pan o maï¿½z y un muy leve aroma a lï¿½pulo. De color amarillo muy clara y con espuma blanca poco duradera. De sabor seco bastante suave y de final seco. Ligera y con alta carbonataciï¿½n.
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);Itï¿½s the OK beer to have at big parties. Somewhat watery and plain but the price is good (around 0,75 US$ for a 1 litre bottle). Ice-cold serving makes it a bit better too.
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);In Can. A flat beer. Pale, regular head, rather frothy. Flat aroma, Flat Flavor. Watery and light. An equal beer to the majority of the pale beer. Plain.
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);Can, 345 ml: Typical pale golden appearance with lots of bubbles. Big white, fast diminishing head. Aroma is mostly adjuncts, with notes of corn syrup, glucose, rice, corn chicha and faint metallic, skunky and herbal hints. Horrid...Iï¿½m afraid of giving it a try except for a tiny malty hint that resembles of a beer-like smell. Flavor is sweet, with notes of pineapple, vitamin C tablets, chemicals and cooked vegetables. Annoying and crappy but maybe Iï¿½ve tried a couple of worse tasting beers. Watery texture, light bodied. Fizzy lager. Dull, boring without a distinctive character. It shares its place among the sea of bad crafted South American macro pale lagers. Many thanks to Lilith for sharing this can
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);Macro-lager appereance. Aroma is disgusting, cooked vegetables(corn, broccoli, cauliflower and......eewww something I cannot even describe) and metal. Flavor is worst, sweet, like medicine. Can shared with Panzerfaust
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);Big Bottle. Pale yellowish colour with very short head. Weak aroma of malt and a little fruitiness. Moderate malty though still waterish malty flavour with weak hoppy dry finish.
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);Macro Pale lager, iï¿½m shure you know it, it has relatives all around the world!!
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);More of the same thing. Seems like in Argentina every beer comes from the same tank and they only change the label. Plain, watery, I agree on the strong carbonation.
Bieckert Oro;Lujï¿½n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecerï¿½a Lujï¿½n (CCU Argentina);Light yellow beer with a thick, white head. Lightly (very) bitter. Strong carbonation.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;A soft taste with a little body for a rubia. Some small cascade hops presense but not much. Alright for a blond beer. A small cereal taste present. Had on tap at South bar.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Poured a hazy yellow color with a medium sized white head. Sulphur hits the nose first, yeasty. Sweet and tart malt. The flavor is of tart malt but over the flavor is light as is the body.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle shared by maxxdaddy. Lovely hazy pale yellow, hazy beer with a thick pillowy head... it goes off the rails right after that. The aroma is wheaty and quite sulfurous. Tart and vegetal with a rancid soured pickle character. Like a mix of pickle juice and sour mash stank. Absolutely terrible.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle as Rubia, shared by Maxx. Pours a completely unfiltered pale yellow, like a wit, with a decent head. Actually looks quite good. Everything good ends there, though. Nasty band-aid and socks aroma, slightly sour (infected?), trash, soy bean. Yuck, Afraid to put it to my nose. Taste is not much better. Quite nasty, in fact. I see no semblance of a pils left, more just like a really fucked of wit. Disgusting.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. Golden colour with an off-white head. Aroma is sweet, malt, butterscotch. Flavour is sweet, malt, butterscotch, caramel, hop.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. Clear, golden beer, with an off-white head. Some hops in the aroma, but caramel and butterscotch dominates. In the flavor, the bitterness is overpowered by the sweet caramel and butterscotch. Medium body. Decent, but too buttery, Quite interesting in a way, but Iï¿½m not quite sure what I think of it. (070914)
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Appearance: blond color. Medium head, white foam and low persistency. Aroma: malty, yeasty and citric-fruitiness with reminiscences of grapefruit and lemon. Soft hoppy smells, with notes of herbs and aniseed. Flavor: too much citric, maybe infection problems. Peppery yeasty, typical of the ï¿½Cervecerï¿½a el Bolsï¿½nï¿½. Aftertaste with intensive bicarbonate notes. Palate: light body and watery. High carbonation.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottled. Hazy golden, rocky head. Citric nose. Dryish and lemony with medium body. Low on hops, some passion fruit, some signs of very early infection. Low bitterness.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Mine was a touch sour and I wondered if it was supposed to be that way. Fairly light malt and hop body. Not really an amber at all, more of a wheaty lager by my reckoning.
El Bolson Blanca Tradicional (Rubia);El Bolson, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Hazy straw. Toasty and a little dry. Some off-flavours indicate perhaps a little old. Light, starter micro beer.

El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Smells sweet, fruity sweet. A light bitter taste. Although it doesnt have a huge body I still preffered it to the extra invierno. On tap at the Bolson Beer garden in the center of E Bolson.
El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;A dark brown beer with a beige head. Aroma is roasted malt and chocolate. Tastes is also roasted, notes of coffee and chocolate. Some burning alcohol but well balanced. Sweet. Full bodied
El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle at Cruzat. Pours an opaque dark brown color with a slight head. Well-carbonated, with a light-to-medium body, dark malt flavor with chocolate notes, slight hop bitterness, hint of coffee and very clean overall. Nice.
El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Thanks to El Gordo for this taster!--Poured a deep dark brown with a thin taupe head. Coffee, bitter nutty chocolate sour aroma. Too sour for its own good. Acidic, bitter all the way through. Mildly sweet, but overall too acidic and sour. Aged too long. Hmmm...
El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle conditioned, very dark brown with a thin tan head. A strong bitter coffee aroma. A good bitter coffee flavour as well, with a delicious bitterness. Very good.
El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Appearance: dark brown with red touches. Medium head, beige color, medium consistence, persistent. Aroma: sweetness of toasty malts, candy, sweet chocolate and toffee. Slightly smoked. Flavor: Sweet and similar to aroma. Toasty malts, candy, grain coffee, chocolate and toffee. I remember the liquor of cacao. Sweet start ï¿½ toasty and smoked end. Only in the finish Iï¿½m feeling a low presence de hop. The sweetness hidden your alcoholic level Palate: Great body and oily texture. Low carbonation. Advisable, a of the best beers of ï¿½Cervecerï¿½a Artesanal el Bolsonï¿½. (sorry for my english)
El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. Dark Brown body-hue. Hazy clarity. Good mostly lasting head. Strong aroma of roasted malt and chocolate and also some honey! Moderate bitterness with tastes of roasted malt. honey and some chocolate to it. Bit sweet in the so nice long finish. Great dark brew! The bottle I had said 6,2% alc.
El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;I liked this one. Obviously I am quite the authority on Argentinian beers these days (equal #4 rater on the site!) so my liking it must mean a lot to the El Bolson people. Pours like a soft drink with that fizzing noise as it hits the glass. Just like iced coffee, only with a bit of rum and chocolate. Smells better than it tastes - whilst itï¿½s sweet itï¿½s never too sweet. No hop at all. Thin as thin body. Doesnï¿½t have any of the weird Belgian type stuff that all the others had. Nice.
El Bolson Negra Extra;El Bolson, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;A very malty sweet schwarzbier w/o the smoke added to their Ahumada Negra brew. Same beer base, I suspect, just one has smoke added. Very nice. I could drink this all day! Rich and sweet yet not all that thick.
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Cervesa amb bon aroma, en boca ï¿½s lleugera amb un final fumat. Cerveza con buen aroma, en boca es ligera con un final ahumado.
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Strong taste of alcohol, strong smoked wood with soft carbonation. The smoke seems to waft through your nostrils. Got this on tap at teh Bolson beer garden right in El Bolson.
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle conditioned, black with a filmy beige head. Athe aroma was not so smoky, but more a charcoal aroma with some astringency. A little like marmite yeast. The palate was very astringent. Sweet malt and cherry flavour, hoppy as well. They havenï¿½t quite pulled off this one for me.
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Appearance: black reddish. Medium head, beige, of low density. Aroma: smoked, sweet toasting of candy, humid wood, tones of coffee of grain, The smoked is intense, reminiscences of vanilla. Low hop presence. Flavor: smoked enough, hop without major presence. Reminiscences of coffee, candy and wood. Smoked long aftertaste. Palate: Medium Body, oily texture. Carbonaciï¿½n low. Advisable South American version of the style Rauchbier. (sorry for my english)
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. Pour a dark brown almost black color with a longlasting tan head. Roasted malty and smoky aroma with hints of licorice and chocolate. Roasted malty smooth smoky flavor, with lots of chocolate. Warming malty finish with some hints of smoke in the aftertaste.
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Yeehaaa, queeee sabor! Great smoky unfiltered brew! Not so so much, not too little either. Bottle. Cloudy black body. Heavy roasted malty flavour. Surprisingly not so smoked a taste as one would suspect though somw what bitter with a nice chocolate touch to it. Good average aftertaste.
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Deep dark beer with a thin moka head. Light chocolate aroma, with smoked peat notes. In mouth, dry chocolate malt with light bitterness, light floral hops, light bodied. Not bad, but this isnt a Rauchbier. Bottle bought at Supermercado Todo, 4.39$AR.
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Black and opaque, fizzy with no head retention. Smells distinctly like Trois Pistoles (and more generally slightly Belgian)! Aroma of cookie dough, honeycomb, malted milk and mild, woody smoke. The aroma gave me hope for something special, though I could tell it was gonna be sweet. Unfortunately in the mouth it really just turned out to be bland, watery and sweet. Thereï¿½s some toast, butter and marmite but itï¿½s really lacking any roasty guts. Quite boring and definitely less interesting that the Estepa Roja which was half the alcholic strength. At least I can now say Iï¿½ve had an Argentinian Rauchbier! Thanks Gilesy!
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Yumm. Basically the same beer as their Negra Extra, just with smoke added. Very lightly smoked, so donï¿½t be scared off. Schwarzbier body. Excellent. A real Argentine surprise but try the Danskeren beer, itï¿½s EVEN BETTER!
El Bolson Negra Ahumada;El Bolson, Argentina;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottled. Black with beige head. Vinuos nose. Lightly malty and roasty, not very soft mouthfeel. Hints of wood and smoke in the finish. Many thanks to Oakes, Linc(?) and especially Canada Post for letting me sample an Argentinian rauchbier...
El Bolson Frambuesa;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Strong raspberry beer that taste natural and sweet. Very good ï¿½ one of the best fruit beers Ive tasted. Very soft on palette. I actually enjoyed this more than most of their dark beers.

El Bolson Frambuesa;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;A sweet fruit beer. Lambi-ish. Consumed at brewery. Not really my style, but a nice deviation. Distribution issues in Patagonia with bottles.
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle: Positively surprised. well balanced fruit & sweetness lasts until last sip. Starts strong with fresh red berries and ends dry almost wine-like.
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. Amber colour with a beige head. Aroma is raisin, black current, malt, yeast. Flavour is sweet, raisin, black current, yeast. Ok to have tasted this one, but nothing more.
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. Hazy red/brown body with a big and fast disappearing red/brown head. Aroma is sweet fruity, acid and Cola actually. Flavor has also this weird Cola taste with sweet slightly roasted malt and a fruity acidity. A bit weird, but I also enjoyed this strange brew.
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. A dark brown beer with a beige head. Cola, roasted malt, berries and sweetness in the aroma. Pleasant, but nothing more. The same goes for the flavor, but the sweetness is not as evident. Berries, some cola and roasted malt. Sugary, medium body. Nice in a way, but I wonï¿½t miss it. (080215)
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Drunk at brewery. Very sweet, like the other El Bolson fruit beers. Sweeter than the cherry or the raspberry, so be expecting. Not horrible, just different.
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle drunk at Santiago airport, thanks Cristiï¿½n and David! Doesnï¿½t look too bad and smells fruity, but itï¿½s basically a load of syrup poured into a beer which gets totally swamped by all the sugary-sweet fruitiness. Yeuch!!!!
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Appearance: Color dark ruby. Medium head, slightly consistent and low persistence. Aroma: sweet tone of red wild fruits, yeast and something piquant. Low presence of hop and of the malts. Flavor: beer or fizzy juice?. Acid touch of cassis and of other red wild fruits. Excessive presence of yeast, piquant tone. Low presence of hop and malts. Palate: light body and low carbonation. Not advisable. (sorry for my english)
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Nice darkish red-purple colour, clear with bad head retention. The cap had a weird grey-yellow deposit where the liquid had touched it. Did not look good. Aroma of grainy chocolate, sour cream, diacetyl, vague Ribena. Something is wrong - my guess is a phenolic infection but itï¿½s unlike anything Iï¿½ve known. Itï¿½s kind of like wood-plastic-hair I guess. Thereï¿½s something like a megalager in there too. Tastes sweet, like dark grape juice with an acrid roastiness, bandaids and astringency. At least itï¿½s good to know itï¿½s not just Aussie micros that have QC issues.
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottled. Chocolate brown, very muddy with creamy head. Looks like hot chocolate with whipped cream and a fruit drink poured into it. Big black currant aroma. Sweet and fatty, completely dominated by sugary black currant. Just bizarre.
El Bolson Cassis;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Imbibed in December 2002. Fruity (cassis) aroma. A clear dark ruby color tinged with strawberry edges. Thick whitish red head consisting of large bubbles. All I tasted was cassis. Basically a fruit pop.

Club Pilsner (Uganda);Jinja, Uganda;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nile Breweries (AB InBev);Taster, courtesy of SinH4. Pours almost clear golden. Aroma is honey, flowers, bread, but all quite farfetched. Body is completely flat, thin and watery, low sweetness, again hints of honey and flowers. Not much there, though. Inoffensive, a plus.
Club Pilsner (Uganda);Jinja, Uganda;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nile Breweries (AB InBev);Clear yellow. Aroma is tobacco leaves, honey, green leek, some ash, some honey. Taste is watery honey with more ash and quite much sweetness. Not too bad apart from stale and boring.

Club Pilsner (Uganda);Jinja, Uganda;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nile Breweries (AB InBev);Bottle sample, many thanks Erzengel! Clear golden color with small white head. Aroma is fresh wort, rice, corn. Taste is corn, sweet, unattenuated, but still somehow clean. Typical country tick, but at least neither expired not lightstruck.
Club Pilsner (Uganda);Jinja, Uganda;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nile Breweries (AB InBev);Many thanks to Beerhunter111 for sharing. Sweetish grainy nose. The beer starts thin and grainy. Watery sweetish grainy aftertaste with no bitterness.
Chairman's ESB (Uganda);Jinja, Uganda;Pilsener - Imperial;Nile Breweries (AB InBev);Bottled. My wifeï¿½s cousin was given this beer, and immediately thought of me. Good man! ESB stands for Extra Strong Brew. It is not an ESB as we know it. A very pale lager with a nice big white head. The aroma has grassy hops and a fair amount of alcohol. The taste is suprisingly smooth. A bit of buttery malt and more grassy hops. The alcohol doesnï¿½t intrude. Pretty drinkable to be honest.

Light taste, some malts, and slight hops. Light body. Somewhat typical of American mass produced beers. Another bad attempt by a macro to try to make a micro.
Killarneys Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Back before I knew what craft beer was, I used to find this quite drinkable. As mich as I hate to admit that. Amber coloring( food grade caramel coloring ), with a fizzy and quickly fading white head. This is no longer enjoyable.
Killarneys Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Draft. This sure wanï¿½t a Killians, wasnï¿½t even close. However, it was drinkable, not very enjoyable, but drinkable nonetheless.
Killarneys Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Tried this long ago and it was a poorly made rip off of Killians. sad when a huge company like AB canï¿½t get it right..

Killarneys Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);If its sold at the supermarket id rather have this than any other macro. Its light bodied and light flavored and the color is probably faked too. But its not that bad, has some hopiness and caramel malts, good carbonation and dry finish.
Killarneys Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);bottle - Can A-B any more obviously try to rip off Killianï¿½s? Itï¿½s a decent looking beer, amber with a bit of a head. The aroma and flavor are dominated by malts. The body is thin and the finish short and clean. Itï¿½s okay, but Iï¿½m not impressed. I havenï¿½t seen this beer much lately so Iï¿½m guessing the attempt to market it like a Killianï¿½s clone didnï¿½t work out too well for A-B.
Killarneys Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Pours a nice medium amber color. Aromas of malt and maybe something sweet. Flavor is bland, watery, and bland.

Church Brew Millennium Trippel;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Church Brew Works;Pours a glowing, hazy, pale amber with a moderate head. Quite fizzy. Aroma is fairly faint for the style, giving spice notes over doughy yeast and a touch of citrus. Tastes hoppier than expected, but not overwhelmingly so. Savory and sweet, with mild bitterness. Finishes dry and sharp. A well executed text-book trippel that doesnï¿½t try to be too much.

La Caracole Nostradamus;Falmignoul, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie Caracole;2016 bottle. Pours a dark brown with a big foamy off white head and lots of sediment. Lightly tart aroma of Belgian spices. Very smooth but lacking any real flavors. Pretty plain and ordinary. Not as good as I expected. Hides the alcohol well. Not bad but it could be the age that made it seem flat.

La Caracole Nostradamus;Falmignoul, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie Caracole;330ml bottle from bottle shop in Dinant - deep mahogany body with a frothy white top. Gusher. Not getting a lot out of the aroma, a bit sweet and a bit of aniseed. That aniseed lifts it in the taste and has a decent amount of yeast there too. Big alcohol burn at the back, almost Benadryl in texture. I didn't see that coming, who would have predicted that?
Rogue Chocolate Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Flavored;Rogue Ales;Pours deep black with the requisite foamy brown head. Nose is lots of dark chocolate, cocoa, and just the barest hint of vanilla. Taste is generic, semi-bitter malt, which quickly gives way to chocolate. Semi-sweet maybe? As before, the barest hint of vanilla. A disappointingly light body with very moderate carbonation. It'd be creamy if it weren't so watery. Very drinkable, a pretty decent base beer with good chocolate notes. It's not special, but it's not bad.
Rogue Chocolate Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Flavored;Rogue Ales;Nice stout, you definitely taste the chocolate part of it. Well balanced, great company in a beautiful fall day.

Rogue Chocolate Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Flavored;Rogue Ales;Bomber pours nearly black with a three finger puffy brown head and excellent lacing. Aroma is coffee, dirt, chocolate. Initial impression, overly bitter, not enough sweet, and slightly sour which I don't care for here. The chocolate taste is of the very dark variety.
North Coast Old Stock Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Old Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;2014 Bottle at home on 9th November 19 from the fantastic Biervana, Munich, this is aromatic, bitter sweet and burnt caramel, really smooth, lovely barley wine.
North Coast Old Stock Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Old Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;Bottle (2018). Lovely brownish pour with even prettier tan frothy head. Lucious aromas of dates, figs, warm bakery, toffee, and caramel. Doesnï¿½t exactly taste like it smells. Lots of raisin and dates, but super thick and syrupy. Alcohol burn is pronounced. Not as mellow as I thought it would be. Great sniffer, though.
North Coast Old Stock Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Old Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours a prune orange with a tan head that goes quickly. Almost no lacing. Scents of dried fruit, raisins. Taste is nutty with raisin and prune notes with a distinct alcohol bite. Low carbonation and a short sharp finish with following alcohol warming.

Carlton Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Pretty standard but this beer is the taste of the footy in melbourne and therefore the memories attached make it a quality pour in my eyes
Carlton Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Pours golden with a decent head. Best served brewery fresh (unpasteurized). Mild hops, not fancy.
Carlton Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);This is a simple beer. It doesn't claim to be a crafty, hoppy beer. But for what it is, it is the best. An incredibly easy drinking lager, with unparalleled appearance in the pint, the carlton draught it a staple of any pub or bar.
Carlton Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);just marginally better than VB, but still at the very bottom of my list. Will only drink if there is nothing else.
Carlton Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Poor taste, aroma and flavour. This is a sorry beer that is still a huge winner with others.
Carlton Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Cheap go-to option if you're having a BBQ. Doesn't generate conversation because it really is your standard average lager.
Carlton Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Amber coloured, thin creamy mouth feel. Elements of staleness. Malt driven, minimal hop character
Carlton Draught;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Draught. I used to drink this beer a lot and since then have gone on to discover much better beers in quality and flavour. Decided to go back to the old faithful and try it again. Noted almost no aroma other than a slight chemically smell. Taste agreed with the aroma and I noted more of that chemically taste. There was some carbonation but basically no lager flavour that i've grown to love. I put it also down the venue and not keeping things clean but definitely will be the last time i drink it.
Carlton Cold (4.6%);Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I used the love this stuff in the early 90s. Been a while since I had one, but I remember pleasant things about it.

Carlton Cold (4.6%);Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Serve it really, really cold and you can drink this and it will be clean crisp and refreshing. But donï¿½t let you glass stay full for long or it will warm up enough for you to really taste what it is like. Serve cold, drink quick or choose something else.
Carlton Cold (4.6%);Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I donï¿½t understand all the hate for this beer. Clean, crisp and refreshing... One of my all-time favorites and there perfect for hot Aussie days...
Carlton Cold (4.6%);Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);OLD RATING OCT 14, 2003 Really have no idea why people buy this anymore. Watery, horribly skunky, as per most Carlton macro swill. With Carlton Dry out there why does this even exist? Probably the closest thing youï¿½ll ever hear to a compliment to Carlton Dry there...
Carlton Cold (4.6%);Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I had four of these at a backyard in Sydney about ten years ago, felt like I was going to die. I would drink this if I was loving in 1976. No taste, pure horror.

McNeill's Firehouse Amber;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McNeill's Brewery;On tap at brewpub in Brattleboro, Vermont. Pours amber with a tiny spritz of light tan head and lacing. Aroma: faint caramel, fruitiness. Flavor: caramel, figs, dates raisins.. Mouthfeel: light-bodied, a bit thin.
McNeill's Firehouse Amber;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McNeill's Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a murky semi-dark burnt amber to red color. Quickly dissipating fingerï¿½s worth of bubbly (with slight foam), and no lace. The aroma had some sweet cooked corn edged with sharp burnt cake batter, weird. The flavor was sharp burnt sweet cake batter with an extremely soapy aftertaste and finish. Got extremely hard to put the rest down my throat. On the palate, not as sessionable as one would like for an amber ale, that soapy feel is smooth - Iï¿½ll give it that, but who wants spaciness to smooth out a beer. Low carbonation. Overall, wow, what an awful beer. Really think McNeilï¿½s should toss in the towel. Canï¿½t hang in this state anymore and nor the business.
McNeill's Firehouse Amber;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McNeill's Brewery;Pours a nice amber color with a medium white head. Mild hoppy aroma somewhat resiny. Malty at the front with a well balanced hoppiness leaving a nice hoppy aftertaste. Def a good canned beer.

Belikin Stout;Belize City, Belize;Stout;Belize Brewing Company (Heineken);284 ml bottle. Pours a very dark mahogany with a tan colored head. Aroma of toasted grains, brioche, toffee and toasted bread. Medium body with a soft carbonation, a medium sweetness and a medium bitterness, which increases unpleasantly towards the finish. In the end it is some kind of burnt bitterness. Flavor of coke, burnt wood, ash. Beside the burnt notes it reminds me of a colored pale lager with added caramel color. Really strange and not good. After some time the flavor of cardboard joins. Really not good. Whatever it is, for me that is not a stout. Aroma: 3 Appearance: 3 Taste: 4 Palate: 3 Overall: 3
Belikin Stout;Belize City, Belize;Stout;Belize Brewing Company (Heineken);Bottle from market in Belize city. Brown color, off white head. Malts, sweet, bread. Meh
Belikin Stout;Belize City, Belize;Stout;Belize Brewing Company (Heineken);Total Wine not to far has had an expansive selection of Central American beers lately, and almost all are inexpensive, which is good, since I take about three sips and throw the rest out. This one was different. To be fair, it's not the world's best stout, but it is a serviceable, drinkable beer that is OK. Pours black with a medium head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is brown sugar and caramel. Taste is molasses and caramel, warming to roast. Finish is uneven and slightly bitter. All things considered, not too bad.
Belikin Stout;Belize City, Belize;Stout;Belize Brewing Company (Heineken);Appearance: Dark opaque brown body with a thick 3 finger brown (really brown) head that clings to glass. Looks good. Smell: Not much, very light malt-like aroma. Taste: Not aggressive at all, nutty character with slight bitter aftertaste. Almost light in taste (for a stout that is). Mouthfeel: Slight chocolate overtones, nut-like character remains. Though light in taste, it has that nice stout aftertaste. Finishes a bit roasted. Drinkability: Alcohol content well hidden, easily could have a few of those. Reviewed on: 02-13-2008

Nose heavy on the caramel/crystal but also somewhat citric with medium wood, sweet dough. Pour is opaque copper that picks up a little ruby in its undercarriage, head beige on the way to tan and sudsy. Low bitterness, moderately dry, very full body consists mostly of flabby malt and caramel, with medium pine and some dough. Strong carbonation but somehow not crisp. Subtle roast and herbal notes, bland and vaguely caramel finish and aftertaste. Hops have abandoned on this one, but the rest of the cast isnï¿½t pulling weight. [2017.06.30: 2.4]
Raleigh Tavern Williamsburg Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Mother-In-Law brought me a bottle as part of a variety six pack, after a trip to Colonial Willamsburg.

Raleigh Tavern Williamsburg Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Mom brought this one back from a trip to Williamsburg. +++ Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a bright orange-caramel color with a large creamy-soapy orange-white head that lingered and left a bit of lacing.

Ipswich Nut Brown Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Reviewed from notes. Thanks Nicole. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Thereï¿½s some nice lightly speckled lacing weaving down the sides of the glass. The smell had a nice roasted nutty toffee with a nice backup by some caramel and bready notes. The taste was sweet, nutty, bready with a rich caramel and toffee combination. On the palate, this sat about a light to medium with a nice sessionable aspect about it. The carbonation was right where it should be for the style and for me. The way this one rolls across my tongue is spectacular as thereï¿½s a really nice creamy and nutty sweetness that really makes this one be a really good one. Overall, one of my all time favorite brown ales that I truly miss when I lived on the East Coast, one day I hope to see you again...one day.
Ipswich Nut Brown Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz bottle in a shaker. Pours brown with a lacy, light beige head. Aroma of caramel and lightly nutty malts, plus a little floral hops. Flavor about the same. Average texture. A decent beer.

Color is dark like rootbeer. Aroma of sweet nuts and malt. Taste is malt in the front and walnuts in the finish. Crisp carbonination. As it warms the nuttiness is more apparent in the finish.

Ipswich Nut Brown Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Served from a 12 oz bottle thanks to JT. The appearance is a hazy nut brown with a medium light tan head. The nose has some nice English hop aromas, caramel, a toasted malts. The flavors are light with English hops, some tea leaves, and nutshell flavors. Fairly bitter for a brown ale. A light-to medium bodied mouth makes for a refreshing drink.
Ipswich Nut Brown Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Big thanks to LilBeerDoctor for helping me procure this sample! Smell is simply clean. Nice looking darker beer. Taste starts off like wet roasty old campfire wood. This elevates to a medium back of throat bitterness. Later, this beer comes across almost like an ESB or sumthin. A smoother bitter drink that possesses a creamy CO2 feel. Mild at times and at other times a bit more personality. Finish is somewhat hoppy for lack of a better description. Lots of personality on the finish too, has a little more wake up than most nut browns. Very glad to have had the chance to taste this, thanks LilBeerDoctor, you rock!
Victor Beer;Johannesburg, South Africa;Traditional Ale - Other;Egoli Brewery (UNB / Delta Corp. - AB InBev);Comes in 2l Plastic container with 'breathing hole' in the cap. Pink-white. Very opaque. Thick like drinking yoghurt. Grainy, sourish nose. Off-putting thick consistence, but tastes freshly sour. No bitterness. Unusual to say the least...
Victor Beer;Johannesburg, South Africa;Traditional Ale - Other;Egoli Brewery (UNB / Delta Corp. - AB InBev);The aroma is really offputting: like Prohibition-style toolshed scrumpy. The appearance is really cool - thick, opaque, kind of milk-like, with the consistency of guava juice. Flavour: more cidery, but also a sweet, almost cream-like graininess. Palate is both thin and thick at the same time (don't ask), and quenching. Overall, I think it does its intended job, but man this stuff is really different and I think it would take quite a bit of it to adjust your palate. Westerners would likely hate it at first, but it may very well get better. Besides, it's not brewed for Westerners, so who cares what we think?

Cains Triple Hop;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cains;"Hoppy aroma just leaping out of the glass, giving it that lockerroom-sprayed-with-industrial-air-freshener smell that gets the testosterone humming.

Light yellow color (no marks there) but an appropriate level of carbonation and a meaty flavor, suggestive of cottage pie or perhaps an artificial interpretation of ""meat"" flavor (e.g., chicken-flavored crisps/potato chips) (on tap at Turf Tavern, Oxford)"

Sweet aroma of caramel malts. Medium body with average carbonation. The flavor was crisp and clean. It was the best of the tasting. I purchased a can. Just an average beer.
Weeping Radish OBX Beer ( 6% );Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;16 oz can. (Chipï¿½s Wine & Beer) Kill Devil Hills, NC. Cloudy golden colour with a small white head. The aroma is citric acidity and sweet caramel malt. The flavour is absolutely horrifying... malt, wort and citrus. Really bad. I though it would be nice to drink some OBX beer while here in the OBX but it was a mistake...
Weeping Radish OBX Beer ( 6% );Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;16oz can. Poured a clear yellow color with a small white, fizzy head. Aroma was crisp lager notes, some floral hops, light malts. Flavor was clean, crisp. Pretty tasty compared to many of the reviews.
Weeping Radish OBX Beer ( 6% );Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;22 oz. bottle. Clear light amber color. Caramel malt taste with a smooth finish. Good beer for the price!
Weeping Radish OBX Beer ( 6% );Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;6/9/2010. 22 oz. bottle bought at a local grocery store. Golden yellow with a white head. Malt and light fruit aromas. Seem a bit watery and lacks flavors.
Weeping Radish OBX Beer ( 6% );Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;Bottle. Clear light yellow gold with a small whit head. Slightly sweet malt aromas with hay and a cream corn note in the aroma. Flavor is quite odd while being sweet, almost in a malt liquor kind of way, and there is a bitter and slightly sweet-sour finish. Light body and very fizzy.
Raleigh Tavern VIRGA Wheat Beer;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);One of two beers brewed by Old Dominion for Colonial Williamsburg, sold and served there alone. Pretty standard wheat beer. Crisp, clean taste, not to sound too cliched. Tastes like a wheat beer should. Good, but not great.
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;Bad bottle here. Vigorous head. Roasted dark, burnt malts mixed with sour aromatics. Definitely not the intended profile.
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;Pours black with brow highlights and a creamy tan head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee with a hint of licorice. Chocolate flavor with some roasted malt and coffee. Really nice beer.
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;The beer pours dark chestnut black with a decent tan head. The aroma is smoky and a bit of roasted malts. The flavors bring notes of coffee, bitter chocolate, and smoke blended nicely on an easy body. The beer is delicious overall.
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;Bottle: Poured a dark porter with a super huge medium brown foamy head with super great retention and lacing ï¿½ almost to the point where I am wondering if something is wrong. Aroma of sour roasted malt is not very enticing and smells like an infection. Taste is way too sour or style. Unfortunately this one is infected and I will have to re-rate at some point in time.
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;"On draft at Pickering Creek Inn. Disappointing. I had this and a pils that Copper Crow offered and both had very astringent, bitter palates. Could be infection or just poor brewing habits. Pours black, head quickly fades. You can tell something isnï¿½t right in the nose, there are hints of roasty malts and cocoa, but it smells ""off"". It continues to the palate, hopefully they get it sorted out."
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;Pours almost completely black with a slightly fizzy mocha head that recedes to a thin collar. The aroma has chocolate, vanilla and toasted malts. Thereï¿½s also a little bit of tartness in the nose. The taste has an initial tartness that may indicate a little infection but there is still plenty of thick chocolate malts and coffee underneath. Itï¿½s got an excellent body for the ABV and I imagine it was an exceptional porter in its prime.
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft. Pours near black with a thin beige head. Roasty and sweet malty aroma with some mild nutty notes. The flavor has roasted and lightly burnt malts, coffee, and a light sweetness. Decent.
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;From a cask at the General Lafayette Inn and Brewpub. Coffee and sweet malt aroma, black pour with light orange hilites. Full and flavorful, a bit dry. Very nice porter.
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;Bottle at home ... black ... huge brown foam head ... slightly sour roast malt ... little chocolate nose .... over fizzy ... definite sourness ... has the bottle turned ... i certainly think so ... some roast malt ... some chocolate but ruined by sourness... bugger
General Lafayette Chocolate Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Crow Beer Company;Bottled. Poured deep brown with a tall, dense, well-retained cap of dark tan head. The aroma picked up sweet, toasty, milky chocolates with accents of vanilla and some cocoa.. sweet and entirely desserty. The flavor found a blend of milk and lesser dark chocolates at the core.. vanilla and cocoa bitterness on the edges.. lactic sourness rolled off the edges joined by prickly carbonation and burnt earth.. just slightly vinegary at the end. Medium-bodied with way too much carbonation on the palate.. the sweetness and sourness were balanced well on the front half, but the sours took over at the end.. all in all a very tasty brew!
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;A: Rich crimson body, thin offwhite head S: Raspberries, sweet non-descript sugars, hint of booze T: A nice semi-sweet, yet tart raspberry flavor dominates, not quite as sweet and fruity as a lambic, more rustic and earthy M: The finish is a bit thin, but the front end of the sip has a nice smooth medium body feel O: Like many meads, i just canï¿½t finish this despite really enjoying the first half
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft at Caponeï¿½s for his Black Friday Event. Pours a dark amber body with no head or lacing. Aroma is light fruit. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, lacking flavor - pretty much just notes of raspberry and honey.
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;On draft at capones. Oddly carbonates mead. Sweet raspberry, malts, rice, honey.
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;Clear golden pour thin white head .... aroma of honey and raspberry .... more honey in the taste with a hint of raspberry and a dry honey bitter raspberry finish .... not bad but definitely needs more raspberry
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft. Pours amber with a thin head. Light fruity sweet aroma. the flavor has a fruity and honey like sweetness with notes of raspberries. Decent.
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pink-golden with no head. Smelled mainly of fresh raspberries and the flavor was very similar. Very dry with little honey flavor beyond all of the fruit. I enjoyed my little flight glass of it but probably couldnï¿½t drink a whole glass of it.
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;Clear amber color with sweet perfume-like raspberry aroma with hints of honey. Flavor of honey, raspberry, and a touch of grain.
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft at General Lafayette. Poured amber in color with a small white whispy head that left little lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet raspberries, honey, cereal. Tastes is very sweet with notes of honey, raspberries, light alcohol in the finish and mildly tart.
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;(11/12/08) Draught sample at the brewpub in Lafayette Hill. Hazy golden. Aroma of fruits, honey, malt and yeasty notes. Sweet flavor with honey, hints of raspberry, biscuits and some yeast. Medium-bodied.
General Lafayette Raspberry Mead;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Copper Crow Beer Company;On tap at the brewery. Has a funky not quite skunky raspberry pale fruity aroma. Tart with a little rot and some floral notes. Mild hop bitterness, too. Clear golden amber with light haze, topped with tiny bit of white head. Medium watery body with light carbonation and some vapory notes. Starts fruity with nice notes of raspberry juice and some sweet honey. This is tasty but I donï¿½t know if Iï¿½ve ever had something like this. Bit of an alcohol kick with some estery fruity vapors. Overall, itï¿½s a nice little quaff, and the alcohol could easily sneak up on you. Dry honey-wheat after, with no bitterness.

Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Nice refreshing Australian lager in cool long neck bottle. Very hard to find in NZ at the moment.
Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Taste like a soap for me. Packaging was very nice and presentable and look elegant like a crown casino but the taste was terrible.
Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);If this is the best offering from CUB they should close the doors and wind the brewery up now. A shiny gold label and fancier shaped bottle does not guarantee a good beer. Doesn't taste any different to VB. Apparently it is the same with one extra hop addition. No good
Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Mass production. Easy to drink none the less. Pours golden with a small white head.
Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Peachy pines with a hint of Sarsaparilla on Rocket salad. Peppercorn notes are nil. Plum with light tones of Bacon amid moccha tannins with mild hint of strong aromas, Indica sweetness and glorious malt with a generous blend of hops. Dazzling carbonation gets eyes watering with lazy chilli bitterness at the mid end just before the crisp bold alluring finish .
Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Fles 33cl thuis. Licht bitter. Vlak, weinig smaak. (6-2012).---------------.
Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Bottled, Sydney. Pours a pale and thin yellow gold. Funky and sweet malt notes. Sweet malt, bread, grain and mild straw flavours. Thin bodied. Over carbonated. This is pretty average, borderline undrinkable. You must be pretty deluded to think this is a good beer.
Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);There is no other Beer on the market which goes any where near it in every respect. All the so called modern beers are nothing more than fruit drinks which you can buy at the Milk Bar.
Carlton Crown Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Pours clear straw colour with a small head. Sweetish and malty aroma. Taste is malty too but finishes with some moderate crispy flavour. Medium carbonation. Nothing special but a decent bulk lager anyway. (375ml bottle at the hotel lobby bar in Sydney)

Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);0,3 l Flasche. Riecht und schmeckt nach Sauerkirschen, dazu Karamell. Alkoholisch im Abgang.
Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Bought the bottle at a small Hoogvliet in Zoetermeer/Holland. The beer has a light amber clear appearance with almost no head. Malty and alcoholic smell. Sweet taste with a whisky note. Long bitter aftertaste. Almost no carbonation going on.
Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Kanon (Cannon) is the heaviest beer ever made by Grolsch. But that doesnï¿½t mean itï¿½s automatically the best beer theyï¿½ve ever made. It has hints of bread and malts with an overpowering taste of caramel. Also a longlasting metallic aftertaste. Not bad at all but not very good either.
Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Can acquired at Schipol Airport. pours like yellow stuff with gold? tastes like rice, oil pineapple, toffee. booze finish.
Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Bottle. Pours dark gold colour with a thin white head, malt aroma with a hint of sugar, the taste is medium bitterness with a dry finish.
Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);"clear darker golden colour, medium sized dense white head, which lasts for quite a few minutes leaving back some white lacing;aroma of toffee, slight grassy and citrusy notes, maybe some apple and spicy alcohol; taste of malty-caramel sweetness, some cardboard and metallic notes and also hoppy bitterness - the high ABV is surprisingly hidden, it can only be felt in the aftertaste; obviously not a perfect beer but definitely the best malt liqueur I've tasted so far - at least it is drinkable"
Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);"Bottle from Albert Heijn, Bennekom. As 'Krachtig Kanon'. Pours clear dark golden with a lasting, small, unstable, frothy, off-white head; lots of lacing. Aroma of apple sauce, ripe banana, white bread, wet grain, jenever, cooked cabbage, clove, tooth paste. Taste is light fruity sweet, notes of banana, apple & pear, thrown together in a disorganised kind of way, lots of apparent white breadiness & white sugar, retronasal effect of DMS as well (cabbage); bitter tones provided then by clove-like phenols, juniper, pepper, 'crude' grain, the alcohol warming up already and a weird note of mint. Dryish, grassy hoppy finish, grainy & clove-like, white sugar resting on the tongue and warming, not too subtle alcohol (say, cheap gin). Medium body, slick-oily texture, lively carbonation. I've had worse in this segment (think Gordon Finest series) but still, it's a painfully bad beer."
Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Bottled, 300ml, aged 9yrs from a Supermarket in Harderwijk, Gelderland, Netherlands. Gold with white head. Oddly the ageing does seem to have improved this beer. There are smooth alcohol notes, peach, apricot the fiery impact has dissipated. Some caramel flavours, some smooth brandy hints. It's okay.

Grolsch Het Kanon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Malt Liquor;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);The third and final 'Park Bench' beer I shared with my son at a family gathering on 6th April 2019, my back garden. No bench or paper bag in sight. Why do Dutch breweries do this? Extra strong lagers for drunks isn't the way forward. At least this was better than the two Bavaria (Lander Brau) cans we had before, but this is just a sweet, malty alcohol hangover like they were too.
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;huh! guess i got a bit of a find here, anyway beery and malty with small moderately intense carbonation this brew is a bit sweet and sour and a bit slick. barely moderate body it tastes and wafts kind of old as in old leather in an old unused home. some flaky floaties with an off perhaps grape turning into raisin or prune/plum flavor. tangy with a barely discernable chalk character that was probably more pronounced when younger. thank you!
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;Bottle poured a dense (not hazy) iced-tea-brown body with an orange glow and a short, creamy, ecru head. Tasty caramel malt aromas with brandy & sour cherries, underpinned with smoky and earthy notes. Good balance... flavor started sweetly malted, finished sour, and lingered with a dirty, sour, bitterness. Dry textured with lightly astringent effects. Foremost Liquors, Oak Forest, IL
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;Well-aged sample: Translucent chocolate. Thin but beautifully persistent head of fine bubbles. Extremely earthy nose comprised of sherry, fruitcake, dates, and leathery yeast. Smooth, feathery soft carbonation. Immaculately conditioned. Firmly dry leathery yeast stance paves the way for ensuing fruitcake and sugared date richness. Relaxed tartness and oxidation lends sharpness to the already-firm minerally astringency amid sharp dried leather and softening background notes of smoky peat and vanilla. As with the massive dryness, phenolic hints engage to temper the beefy malt. Insistently barky malts resound as it approaches the extremely leathery, woodily dry finish with growing notes of dates and caramel lingering. Complex and appetizing. An aged wonder.
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;Hazy brown w/ frothy, pale tan head. Malty aroma of caramel, licorice & molasses w/ notes of leafy tobacco. Medium-Full, chewy feel. Malty flavour of licorice & molasses w/ lightly smoky notes of leafy, earthy hops.
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;A wine-like, hoppy with molasses aroma and other spices. Rum colour with nice lace. Full mouthfeel, nice by itself, particularly during winter. More malty than sugary sweet. Satisfying. A surprising find, at Chesterï¿½s in Hamilton, thanks to Doug Shoemaker.
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;Cloudy brownish red color with a quickly dissapearing head. Aroma is pungent malt and metallic. Taste is full of malt and sugars, musty leather and a certain sour grape that Iï¿½m not into.
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;This promised better than it delivered. The reddish/amber coloring was good and the aroma was good and malty. There was little, if any, head and very little carbonation. The taste was more bitter than malty, leaving a sour palate. Perhaps I had a bad bottle, as there was an unusually heavy amount of residue at the bottom.
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;I got this at the bargin bin of Jungle Jimï¿½s, and I couldnï¿½t be more pleased with it. Rick brown color, opaque with a small white head. Smooth carmel aroma, slighty buttery. Flavor is fairly sweet as fly noted. Sweet, buttery finish. It is one of the better scotch ale that Iï¿½ve had.
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;So hard to say anything against this as I stare at the pooch on the label and think of Asta, if the Thin Man ever meant anything to you. I lkee this yar beer. Perhaps a tad sweet, but thereï¿½s so much more going on that melds with the sweetness. Tartness that I can never quite describe. SO I wonï¿½t. Iï¿½ll just say I like it.
MacAndrews Stock Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Samuel Smith;"when i first joined ratebeer, i listed 'scotch ale' as my chosen favorite style-- and this beer alone comprised the reason. with the move to samuel smith, it became very scarce, and thus i haven't had it in years until tonight. i myself have moved on-- on to favoring the stronger styles, yet this one remains indeed a great friend. it's a dense pour of osage orange-- ruddy copper tones as thick as carrot cake. an oat colored froth covers the top of the brew with loyal vigilance. an enormous aroma of peat and hearty burgundy, of musty old bookstore leather, raisins, scotch and vanilla soaked fruit cake. a charming libation to sip, this old dog, the scotch flavors permeate the earthy malts-- malts that seem to nearly creak with antiquity: old cellars, parchment, cracked steamer trunks and cobwebs. the bitterness seems to derive from a sour tincture of sugar maple roots, with a chocolate cherry liquer and praline sweetness. okay-- perhaps it's a trifle too sweet, like the maudlin notes of some silly old love song; but i'll honor it still, to emulate the fedelity of that noble terrier, the memory of near perfection is hereby enshrined."

Hogtown Gold Lager;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hogtown Brewing Company;Toronto Festival of Beer 2001 - Pretty average. Hints at a fruityness in the background?
Hogtown Gold Lager;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hogtown Brewing Company;Fairly middle of the road - quality, well-made. But not overly flavourful. I mean, there are some crisp hops and a kiss of malt, but it doesn't make an impact. Respectable, though.
Hogtown Hemp Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hogtown Brewing Company;Toronto Festival Of Beer 1999: Amber colour, slight bitterness but not really. Nothing special, but worth trying. It's my first Hemp beer so I don't know if it is indicitive of that type or not.
Hogtown Hemp Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hogtown Brewing Company;Me and my pals drove up to Canada last May, and thatï¿½s where I feel in love with Hemp beer. The people at the Hogtown Brewing Company really outdone them selves with this one. Made of highly prized Hemp seeds and premium malt this ale rocks the house. By looking at the bottle it looks like some guy was making this stuff in his back yard, however inside the bottle is pure gold. If I could only find this stuff in the States I would be reunited with an old love.
Hogtown Hemp Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hogtown Brewing Company;Not much to recommend - light, amber ale with no trace of hops. ...........
Hogtown Red Rocket Lager;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hogtown Brewing Company;Toronto Festival of Beer 2001 - Went with the Red Rocket mostly because the Cask Ale wasn't there yet. The Red Rocket is decent, but not at the top of my list. Sort of caramelly, with an ok aftertaste its enjoyable though.

Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;"""i wanted to LOVE this beer and ended up just liking it. i got more vanilla (especially in the nose) than many of the previous reviewers. I wanted it to be a tiny bit bigger with the roasted malt, and maybe more hop balance, but MAN did that vanilla smooth things out nicely!"""
Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;Pours very dark and thick with only a slight tan head that fades rather quickly but coats the glass just a bit. Aroma is burnt coffee, hazelnut and vanilla. Vanilla comes across as the major flavor along with coffee and perhaps some chocolate. Not what I expected but strangely enjoyable.
Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;Weird Belgian-like nose with strong yeast and some weird overcarbonated flavors of bad milk, burnt milk and butter. Strange, unenjoyable. Stout?
Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;RBSG 2004: Black with a good sized light-brown head. Vanilla with a touch of chocolate in the aroma. Ends sweet.
Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;I think it says VANILLA Stout. Yes there is aroma of stout(coffee and cocoalate) and vanilla. Iï¿½ve had a stout or two and some of those say vanilla, but this one excedes them all, very vanilliaish with stout mix. Milk body. Sweet finish. Get this one if you can. Thanks Beerguy101!!
Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;Hazelnut, vannila, and rosted malt come out of the thin tan head. First sip gives you roasty malts, vannila, and earthy hoppyness. Well balanced for a vannila stout with jsut a touch of tannins and a full real vannila flavor rounded off by a thick mouthfeel. A bit hoppyer than expected in the finnish.
Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;This stout pours with a black body topped by athick brown head wtih a good amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet, malty and full of vanilla with slight roasty notes and a touch of coffee. Great aroma. The flavor is slightly sweet yet bitter and very hoppy with vanilla notes and a nice roastiness. Full bodied, slightly dry and relatively smooth.
Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;This beer was sampled at the San Diego Real Ale Festival 2004 thanks to Beerguy101. When this bottle was opened up, the wafting vanilla aroma enveloped our entire table within about 30 seconds. This beer poured a jet black color with a thick, creamy tan head. The aroma was heavy vanilla as the name would suggest with hints of cinnammon, ginger, chocolate and cocoa as well. The taste is VERY smooth but loses some of that vanilla quality in mid-taste. Nice grainy chocolates, but what really stands out is just how damn hoppy this stout is. The finish is nicely bitter and filled with fresh hops and slight choco-sweetnesses. Dry and malty with a touch of hops is the perfect description. A great beer...thanks a lot mitch!
Hangtown Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout;Hangtown Brewery;thanks to beerguy101 for sharing. Gorgeous vanilla nose, medium bodied w/ a smooth finish.

Blatz;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 10/14/2019. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit too fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a delicious pale adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great clean pils malt/grain showcase, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the better AAL I've had, as expected of Pabst."
Blatz;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;My favorite inexpensive beer. Very unique and pleasant taste compared to all the discount beer out there. Great blind taste test beer, your friends will be fooled.
Blatz;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"VERY crisp, very competent. On my Wisconsin beer journey, this is in the top 3. Slightly malty, some corn, little hops, platonic ideal of beer ""savory,"" different from Miller/Budweiser because it's less sweet, similar to New Glarus Two Women/Totally Naked but like 10x cheaper. Good name and a good-looking can. (Special Export still looks the best). Watery but not as watery as other beers at same price-point."

Blatz;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I grew up in Milwaukee drinking Blatz on draft and also in bottles. I personally think can beer sucks. I still buy Blatz bottles in the case and I truly enjoy the flavor. I know it's not the microbrew of most people's choices but knowing the history of Valentin Blatz and seeing it in my Grandpa's refrigerator back in the 1970's gives me a greater appreciation of it than most people have. It's a nostalgic heritage type thing. The flavor us refreshing and brings me back to a greater much simpler time. I imagine everyone has a beer like that in their lives.

Blatz;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I know beer snobs are going to beat up on Blatz...Iï¿½m a microbrewer who sometimes like to sit down and drink the heck out of some vintage beer, and without a doubt this is my go-to! Blatz is the first beer my dad ever let me sip, and Iï¿½ve been chasing that flavor like Captain Ahab ever since. I canï¿½t get it where we live so whenever we go to Wisconsin I load up...I guess you could claim Iï¿½m a Blatz smuggler! Anyways...try one, and cheers!
Blatz;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I was suppppeerrr freakn stoked to see this at my local store.

Andrew's English Pale Ale;Lincolnville, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Andrew's Brewing Company;Bottle. Iï¿½m qualifying this rating by saying I got an old bottle. It almost feels like they gave me the sample bottle above the bar. Why do they keep these so long? Anyway, it was cloudy and had a bit of phenolic flavor that was off putting. I think I would like a fresh one though as I like the lower amount of hops used on the English Pale Ale than the typical APAs.

Mickeys Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Hey, my can says 5.8%, is this a different entry? Maybe I have the barrel aged version. Can from ABC Wailua on InBev dominated Kauai. Clear yellow color fluffy white head. Lemony cereal aroma. Taste is spiced cereal light body.
Mickeys Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From Jun 2007 This pours from 22oz bottle(best by 06 18 07) a very lively and clear medium gold with a smallish head of foam. That soon shrinks to an island in the middle with a little lacing. The smell has that typical big brewery nose to it. Sweet malt, maybe a bit of corn. The taste has a mix of sweet malt, corn and some harsh hop bitterness that starts in the background and ends up in the finish...not a very good aftertaste with this one but thankfully, it's not long lasting. Right about midway through, the flavours really fall flat and it becomes very watery in body. I like the regular Mickey's more....I can't recommend this at all.
Mickeys Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Pale yellow gold color. Brief white head. Faint sweet malt nose. Zesty sweet malt flavor is cloying. Excessive carbonation.
Mickeys Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can. The following is a compilation of a dozen peoplesï¿½ thoughts who shared this brew with me at my first (and perhaps last?) Malt Liquor Dexterity Games Tournament to celebrate my birthday. Keeping in mind that most of the participants are not regular beer raters, here we go: clear medium gold, corny cereal, cardboard, relatively clean actually, do I get a t-shirt for this?, Iï¿½m so tired, hmmmmm ok, seriously not impressive, forgettable, maybe Iï¿½m drunk but this is drinkable, hated this Disney ice capade show, Iï¿½m done.
Mickeys Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From a can. Pours clear gold with a very thin head. Tastes like corn, dough, and pale malts. Light body and low carbonation. Smells like pale malts, corn, and dough.
Mickeys Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can. Pours clear gold. Aroma and flavor are corn, pale malt, funky lager yeast, and faint floral notes. Medium body.
Mickeys Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);710ml can thanks sledutah. This is an unfortunately elusive malt for me as it is not available in anything besides cans and quarts and is not available anywhere near me. It is a shame because this is a grizzlier, rougher version of mickeys. Mickeys is definitely brewed in multiple facilities and this tastes like non-grenade mickeys. This is very similar to any mickeys you will get in cans just a bit bigger in corn/malt taste. Re-rate 40oz green bottle. Pours gold. 5.8% abv. Aroma is prickly and malty more grenady in aroma. Flavor is corny and a touch nutty, smooth, pretty good malt.
Mickeys Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ok. So for what this is, not bad. The aroma is the worst part. Grassy with some chicken stock notes. Smells worse than it tastes. Pours an attractive deep golden with a big resilient frothy white head. Some light malty notes with a small amount of grassy hops. Finishes clean and dry. Itï¿½s a malt liquor, but not nearly the worst one. Better than the non-ice version of Mickeyï¿½s.

Calumet Bock;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;My thanks to Skyview for sharing. Malty like a bock should be. Some caramel, sugar. It is definitely bocky overall, with all of the standard qualities. Very good, but it canï¿½t compete with the best doppelbocks. Sweet, smooth finish.
Calumet Bock;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Fourth stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 and one of 11 brews offered at this small town brewpub. Pours a very dark brown brew with a near white thick head. In light background there are some mahogany red highlights. Aroma picks up smoky toasted barley malts with scents of chocolate, nuts, and llight coffee. Taste is smooth with roasted and bitter malts in this medium body bock and a creamy finish.
Calumet Bock;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;pours dark brown with a small head. a bit of something floral with the sweet nose. woody and smokey flavor with a lingering roast sweetness. a bit metallic in the finish but an enjoyable brew none the less.
Calumet Bock;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap at brewery. As Bob says this is as dark a coal minerï¿½s rear. Pours a swirly brown and whitish head...all of Bobï¿½s beers seem to have a true creamy head. Fragrant, but not that typical sweet malt aroma. Full bodied, welll balanced, with that distinctive spice that sets these beers apart. I disagee that this beer is of a dessert quality. I found it inviting, complex and very unique. With anise, black pepper, and cardamom. Great even on a hot day in July.
Calumet Bock;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Deep chocolate brown with scarlet hues when held up to the light. Smells of sawdust, chocolate malt Whoppers, Hershey syrup and hay. Flavor is rich and sweet, with a touch of astringency as it slips from the center of the tongue. Some aspects remind me of a key lime cheesecake I had with chocolate icing dripped over it. The lime aspects account for the slight acidic lick on the sides of the tongue. Palate is a little thin but not distracting. Syrupy cola finish.
Calumet Bock;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Tap at the American Club. Dark ruby color with offwhite head. Smells of chocolate, light roast, and caramel malt. Mildly hoppy.
Calumet 1876 Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;This red had a creamy head, with a nice caramel scent and flavor. Not too complex, but a good solid beer.
Calumet 1876 Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Very full flavor, very malty. Dark amber hue. Rich burnt caramel flavor and aroma, just a hint of bitter.
Calumet 1876 Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Toasted light ruby color with a small cream head. Good malty aroma and flavor backbone. Well-balanced with a touch of German hops. Good malt and good beer.
Calumet 1876 Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;"Very red, little tiny head. A bit of a caramel nose (imagine that!?) but a good deal more floral & bitter than any of rowland""""s others. Definite hop presence. Hints of vanilla followed by subdued floral notes & a nice bitter finish. Good balance of course."
Calumet 1876 Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;"It''s an ale, so I''m not surprised that its a little heavier and fuller than most of the Calumet lagers; but it''s missing the characteristic strong malty sweetness and light tanginess that I like in most of the Rowlands'' other beers. Stick to lagers, Bob!"
Calumet 1876 Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Try it......................................................................
Calumet 1876 Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Once again Rowland's brews another quality beer. Very malty a little on the bitter side, but I still like it.

Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Draft. Amber pour, it is on the thin end of an oktoberfest, caramally, not too malt heavy which is nice but it isnï¿½t that great.
Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Clear amber pour with a small white head. Smells like an alt - some bread/caramel with slight hop. Semi-creamy palate. Caramel and bread taste.
Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber with a white head that dissipate yo the edges and remains thin. Aroma has sweet grains with a bit of bread and a bit of sweet fruit. Flavor stats with sweet with grains and hay with some caramel in the finish.
Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;"On tap at Rowlands Calumet Brewery. Clear amber with a thin beige head. Aroma of caramel, toffee, toasted malt, swamp water and mild butter. I clean my palate between each beer and yet the buttery diacetyl seems to keep coming back beer after beer. This one just tasted wrong with butter, light caramel and something else strange, perhaps infection. I see all the good ratings for their beers and know better days for Rowlands once existed. Unfortunately, I did not get to try their beers ""back in the day""."
Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, pours a clear deep scarlet with little head. Aroma is of wort, taste is of malty wort with a semi-bitter finish. Not a huge fan, but not bad.
Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap at WI Microbrewerï¿½s Fest. Pale orange in color. Mostly caramel malts in the aroma. Very little hop aroma. Taste again is mostly malts that lack impact. Very little on the bitterness end. I love a good Oktoberfest, unfortunately, this is not it.
Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Thanks to Hopscotch for this growler. Unfortunatelty, itï¿½s a big butter bomb. Nice dark gold pour. Aroma is a big fatty stick of butter. Taste is pretty bad, too. I know it could be better, Iï¿½ll have to wait for a fresh growler.
Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Growler fill from the brewpub - Overall a fine beer and one that I could drink a decent amount of. Pours dark amber with a small cream-colored head. The aroma is sweet caramelly malt, and the flavor is the same. Itï¿½s weird though--while the flavor is sweet, itï¿½s not syrupy or cloying. Itï¿½s a bit grainy too, and the finish doesnï¿½t hang around too long. Iï¿½d like to try this one again, though it might be awhile til Iï¿½m through Chilton again.
Calumet Oktoberfest;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Growler courtesy of Skyview. Copper color with a medium head. Light, buttery aroma. Extremely earthy taste. Strong grain, a little corn and some mushroom.

Calumet Wheat;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, pours a clear pale orange with no head. Good banana and yeasty notes in the aroma, but the taste was not as good. Just ok, more an American wheat.
Calumet Wheat;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;I donï¿½t know i would consider this beer a hefe. Light bodied, dark golden colour with a mildly astringent but pleasent wheaty character. Initial taste of fruit, plums and grapes with scattered lacing around the glass like cloud art.

Calumet Wheat;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Not your typical wheat, more likely your grandfather or great-grandfatherï¿½s wheat. When I see the old pictures of turn of the century (not the last one, but the one I think of). breweries and the employees holding up dark brews this one fits right in. Light chestnut color with a moderate off-white head. Light sweet wheat, with hints of dry grain and brown sugar. Dark cream of wheat flavors. A touch of what seems to be black malt acidity. Interesting ur-weiss. I think the yeast stain is a little to reserved for this style, but still once again, very drinkable.
Calumet Wheat;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Fourth stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 and one of 11 brews offered at this small town brewpub. Pours a hazy light coppery amber with a heavy off-white foam head. Very nice lacing. Aroma has malted wheat, caramel, with a touch of citrus. Taste is smooth and not so much yeast and gritty wheat malt compared to other weisens. Donï¿½t even think of placing a lemon slice with this one. It does not need one.
Calumet Wheat;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Distinctive spiciness to Bobï¿½s wheat. Nutmeg? Banana bread? Poured hazy dark straw. Maltiest wheat around. Didnï¿½t taste much in the way of citrus. Different, which is always good.
Virgin Islands Blackbeard Ale;Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Virgin Islands Brewing Co.;Zeer weinig tot geen schuim op te kriigen als je het uitschenkt. De smaak is koffie-achtig
Virgin Islands Blackbeard Ale;Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Virgin Islands Brewing Co.;Had this in St. Thomas. It was creamy with some roasted malt flavors. It was easy drinking, not bitter. It was better than many of the lagers that were floating around.

Virgin Islands Blackbeard Ale;Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Virgin Islands Brewing Co.;Bottle. Super cool label. Pours brown with zero head. Smells like pickles? It's a sweet brown ale. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Virgin Islands Blackbeard Ale;Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Virgin Islands Brewing Co.;Bottle watching the fire ladies on St Croix. Initially big mouthfeel, tastes more than the standard lagers in these parts. Eeek sugary malty sweet. Agree with the review that says underfermented, actually tastes like homebrew from a cheap extract, doesnï¿½t ferment out fully. Quite cloying, not ideal for the local weather. The fire dancers were good though.
Virgin Islands Blackbeard Ale;Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Virgin Islands Brewing Co.;Bottle from Bumpaï¿½s in St Thomas September 2013. Hit the spot on a hot day. Malty with some biscuit aromas.
Virgin Islands Blackbeard Ale;Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Virgin Islands Brewing Co.;Amber in color with an offwhite medium head. Slightly bitter taste. Overall ok, but far from great.
Virgin Islands Blackbeard Ale;Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Virgin Islands Brewing Co.;Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a nonic glass, thanks for sharing, Tony. It poured a clear amber colour with weak off-white foam. Very sweet, which is apparently the popular local style in the Virgin Islands. Reminiscent of caramel candies, corn syrup, molasses, rum. Medium-heavy body, sticky mouthfeel, lots of residual sweetness into the aftertaste too. Decent and drinkable, but not my kinda thing.
Virgin Islands Blackbeard Ale;Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Virgin Islands Brewing Co.;Light brown. Very sweet. Almost tastes underfermented but might be t the style they like there. Not too heavy. Thanks Tony bretz.

Golden in colour, with a thin white, head and moderate carbonation. A touch of grassy hop, sweetish malts, hay some stone fruit, giving way to a lingering, bitter finish. Fine.
Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Tap at Doolyï¿½s, Summerside, PEI. Nice red-amber colour with a small head. Earthy malt in the aroma and flavour. Flavour also has some roasty notes and caramel sweetness. Thin body. Finish is surprisingly well-hopped. Not quite up to the level of a good micro product, but still much better than I expected.
Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);DMS with some industrial caramel in the nose. head drops quickly, nice colour, good presentation by bartender. Finish is thin, with a faint hint of hops and brewers caramel. Tastes like Olands Export with some colour and caramel added. Not real.
Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Clear red/amber colour with an average size off-white head. Sourish, yeasty aroma. Lightly sweet cereal start, then finishes slightly dry and bitter. Watery mouthfeel drying out on the finish.
Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Oland's Red is a very clean, dry tasting red. It goes down very smooth with almost no aftertaste. great if you are going to have more than one or two.

Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);This is a decent Maritime-Canada style ale. You''re not going to get dry hopped hop power, you''re not going to get 100% malt taste, but what you get is well balanced and a good quaff when chilled. This is what I order when I travel back to Halifax.
Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);"A real stand out for a Canadian beer. This is a perfect color and great taste. It is a little weak on the ""bite"" but maybe that is just me. After Schooner, the Red is my next Olands choice."
Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);"Really nice deep ruby red color(like all the adjectives I used?). Goes down very easily with hardly any aftertaste. Very ""Crafty-Tasting"" ale."
Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);I love the color of this ale I could sit and look at it for hours in the glass but why waste time doing that when there is so much of it out there to drink ? To bad you can't bye it by the case!
Olands Premium Red Draught;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);A little creamy ,great first impression .I must investigate further and more often . The best Red I have had yet.
Granville Island Bad Dog Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);No head, poor aroma. Average taste and poor after taste. Not hoppy at all. Decent beer but nothing special
Granville Island Bad Dog Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Amber with short white head. Light malt nose. Smooth malt flavor with a short hop finish.
Granville Island Bad Dog Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);In contrast to most of Granville Island's other beers, this is quite good. Nice balance between caramel malt and delicious Northwest hops.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);A limited release from Granville Island, for winter. Pours with a very dark, impenetrable colour and a foamy head, but not as good a head as a Guinness. Aroma was malty with also some chocolate and perhaps coffee. Taste was a bit thinner than the better stouts Iï¿½ve had (again, the famous one from Ireland). I was a bit underwhelmed by this one.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Thanks to Mark for the bomber! Poured healthy deeper brown with a short cap of medium brown head. The aroma picked up dry-roasted chocolate and light sour lactic notes with toasted barley and a hint of coffee behind.. sweet, succulent milkier chocolates and a touch of licorice for undertones. The flavor had moderately-roasted darker chocolates, cocoa, and licorice at the core with dry coffee and earthy bitterness on the edges.. finished lightly sour with a a brighter bitterness. Dry and light-bodied on the palate, lacking substance at some times.. other than that it felt pretty good.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);V - watery black pour with a two-finger light frothy head that doesnï¿½t cling much to the glass. A - malt and espresso mix of aromas T - malt, dark coffee, little bitters and a little fizz P - bit watery, even moreso than Guinness Draught.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Very dark brown, modest tan head. Chocolate, coffee, and roast aroma, a little ashy. Same flavours come through, along with some raisin/prune fruit, and a balanced bitter finish. My only criticism is it feels a little thin in the mouth, but otherwise very nice.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Smooth, dry with a solid roasty backbone. Fairly straight forward and typical stout, but enjoyable.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);650 mL bottle from a BC Liquor Store in Vancouver, served cold in a small tumbler. App.: Very dark, opaque cola brown-black, with a moderate, frothy mocha head. Aroma: Greenish dark-roasted coffee, dark chocolate and cacao. Ashen, hints of ï¿½realï¿½ black licorice. More dark malts as it warms, some dark, dried fruits and molasses. Palate: Fairly full body, kinda smooth and syrupy, low but sharp carbonation and a bit astringent. Flav.: Surprising hop presence, floral and green, some of the dark malts, but not as much as expected. Some lactic tartness. Mouth-coating and lightly bitter finish. Interesting. I like it.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Pours a beautiful black with a thick tan head with great retention and lace. Not a strong aroma, but definite aroma of oats & graham crackers, dark malt & fruit as well. Great roasty dark malted taste, plenty of hops, but a certain metallic flavour too - makes me think of those big copper tuns at the Island location. Iï¿½m definitely not liking the orange-pith bitterness of these hops, either it was too late an addition, or just the wrong kind. Body is thick and chewy, creamy and delicious. Carbonation perfect. I really wish the hops were different, otherwise this is a great stout.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Cocoa, chocolate, raisins and roasted malts are apparent in the lightly grainy aroma. Opaque black body is topped by a generous and long lasting, fine bubbled tan-brown head that leaves some lace. Milk chocolate sweetness contrasts nicely with roasted malts. Chocolate is up front and roastiness is lingering. Medium bitterness is never overwhelming. Medium body is fairly dry but not astringent. Fair to moderate carbonation. Simple but enjoyable and just in time for St. Patrickï¿½s! Tulip glass. Cellar temperature. Bottle (Brewery Creek, Mar-07).
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);(650ml bottle) Purchased at BCLS at the Bay Centre in Victoria. Pours a large brown head with an opaque body. Nose of pennies and cocoa powder. Flavour is very bitter, roasted nuts and water coffee. Not bad but a tad thin in texture and taste.
Granville Island Killarney Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Deep darl stout with a thick creamy moka head. A cold coffee and light chocolate in aroma. In mouth, light bitter powdery chocolate and roasted coffee beans, with lingering burned bitterness of roasted malts. Good but light stout. Bottle from JM in BC. Merci encore!
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;"Pours a small offwhite head, minimal retention. Clear copper colored brew. Nose of caramel malt and a light spiceyness. Light bodied. Nice, unusual herbal ;} flavors, earthy with notes of toasted grains. Finish is dry and crisp. Thanks Cliff! Have,nt had a Hemp Ale in awhile."
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Pours the colour of golden syrup with a big frothy head. Ginny notes in a hoppy nose. The body is as creamy as the name suggests, with some pine and grapefruit characters and a late, dry finish. A little oiliness in the mouthfeel may come from the hemp? (Bottle)
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;(Bottle) Golden orange color nice big head hoppy aroma with a soap or odd smell in the background. Nice malty flavor with some nice bitterness. Really has a creamy mouthfeel a little oilly. Finishes with a odd flavor must be the hemp also accounting for the oddness in the aroma. I did like this beer but I think they could do much better brew replacing the hemp with rye.
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Bottle. Pours clear amber with a slight red tone and a large white head. Malty aroma with definite hop nose and somewhat woody/herby notes as well. Burst of sweetness right up front, with the bitter hops and astringency of the hemp coming on soon after. Leaves a lingering bite at the back corners of the mouth. Light to medium body and gentle carbonation. Really interesting beer.
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Not sure what hemp tastes like. That seems to happen to me often when tasting these experimental beers. Surprised that Big Rock still makes it. Told to pour vigourously by a friend and got a very large creamy head and a good amount of lacing. Interesting tinted amber colour. Creamy mouth feel and an interesting oily nutty (or seedy) quality. A nice beverage.
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Light straw colour with a thin white head that quickly fades to nothing. Cascade hops are evident in the nose with some sweet malt. The body is quite creamy. There is a good balance of malt and hops throughout this one. Decent malty taste is balanced by nice oily and grapefruity hop flavour. I'm not sure where the hemp comes from though since it seems more like a regular APA to me.
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;As a chronic kinda guy, I bought this beer just cause it said 'Hemp', but its actually a tasty beer. Kind of nutty, and the hemp seeds make it amazing.
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Yellow/orange color with a small white head. It smells a little sweet, sort of similar to cream soda but more subtle. Definitely hemp seeds were used. You get that oily flavor-texture on the finish that is very unique to hemp seeds. Some malt flavors come out also. Smooth and fairly watery, but there is enough flavor to keep it from being boring. Slight metallic edge on the nose but i don't notice it in the flavor. Interesting.
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Interesting beer. I did notice the texture from the hemp seed but didn't really notice the change in flavour. Still a nice smooth cream ale.
Bowen Island Hemp Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Slightly bitter and hempy (no, really). Overall, quite flavorful. A pleasant surprise, all things considered.
Bowen Island Hemp Lager;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Nasty mix of influences. I donï¿½t get a lot of hemp aspects but the ones I do taste are not pleasant. Pretty bland and boring beer.
Bowen Island Hemp Lager;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;This is nowhere near the quality of the hemp ale. Quite bland...............
Bowen Island Hemp Lager;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Unfortunately devoid of hemp seed, malt, hop, or anything else you''d want in a beer. This tasteless brew has more green apple sourness than anything else.
Bowen Island Hemp Lager;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;A decent lager with light hemp flavour and aroma. Their hemp cream ale is better, though.
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Cut and paste all these mass produced beers would have a hard time telling any of them apart
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This is literally a fart in a can. Does not smell good, does not taste good. Just plain awful. Like drinking water with unmalted grain in it.
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz can (Old Notes)-Pours a clear yellow. Aroma of corn and grains. Taste of the same with a bit of hops thrown in. This light bodied brew was not as offensive as I thought it should be.
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz can. Watery thin body. Inoffensive because there is just nothing there. Embarrassing, but not horrific.
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Tasted blind. Pale yellow with a thin foamy white head. Nose is sweet honey and light corny malt. Taste is sweet light pale malt with a touch of honey. Thin and bubbly, smooth and soft.
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I drank it in 15 seconds, it was no more offensive than club soda. The can was much more informative than the oskar blues cans.
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Got this can from a buddy, so I said I would review it. Poured into Sam Adams Sensory Glass. Color is a clear yellow. Pours a thin white head. Very light and it fizzles down very quickly, leaving no lacing. Smell is very grainy. I really couldnï¿½t distinguish any particular hops or malts. Taste is the same, just grains. It has a very bland flavor that relates to the typical American Macro Lagers (light). Mouthfeel is very crisp in an uninviting way. Goes down somewhat smooth. Overall, this is a pretty easy to drink beer, because it is so light, however I really wouldnï¿½t want to drink a lot of these. Serving type: can Reviewed on: 01-05-2009 17:46:45
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;A decent light beer, although there are a few others I would probably pick before this one to keep on hand. Taste was of light malt and corn with mid hop finish.
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Obtained from Jmerritt. Pours a vibrant yellow, very clear, very high carbonation and a quickly fading white head. Aroma is pretty grainy, very sweet corny note, low hops. Flavor is really sweet, a slight metallic ending and not much else. Not much else there to rate. This brew has not much there to really offend anyone, plain, boring and can be drank by the sixer pretty easily.
Blatz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;One of the better light beers. Could only find in a small wisconsin town so had to try. Not bad but I like non light better

Dirty lacing. Fairly excessive carbonation. Aromas of light roasted malts, strong citrus and earthy hops. Flavours are earthy hops, some spices and sort of a rusty like taste in the finish.

Tree Hophead India Pale Ale (Raw Series No.1);Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Tree Brewing;Orange-gold body with good head. (Thatï¿½s what she said! Ha!) Malty hop aroma, not too bad, not too expert either. Flavour is soft hops and weak hint of malts. Very subdued, preferred the double better. Give this to your friends at the barbeque and keep the strong one behind the bar for yourself.

Shaftebury Easy Honey Pale Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);341 ml bottle brouht back from BC. Amber pour, aroma of cheap cereals, sweet malts, and wet cardboard. The honey just adds body and a touch of sweet maltiness. Light grassy finish with more sweet malts. Meh.

Colour: Mostly mid-yellow but hints of orange as well. Nose: Bready malt, doughy yeast. Faintest of faint trace of honey, and only after much swirling did it appear. Taste: Light sweet, light bitter, light sour. Again - very faint trace of honey (I guess thatï¿½s why they call it Easy Honey), triscuit, hint of peppermint, grassy late. Finish has a distinct caramel softness.
Shaftebury Easy Honey Pale Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Nice sweet flavour profile, though back in the day I found this to be too sweet. Had a dry finish, okay aroma. Really fell down on my list once I started comparing it to English honey ales, but itï¿½s all right when youï¿½re stuck with no other choice.
Shaftebury Easy Honey Pale Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Pours a crystal clear burnished gold color with a one finger rocky cap. Fair head retention and lacing. Aroma is lightly fruity with a musty sweetness to it and leafy hops in the background. Light palate, soapy mouth feel, modest malt spine, fruity lightly bitter soft character. Up front you get some modest biscuit malts and a splash of light sweetness (honey?) then mid palate the hops shift from herbal to lightly bitter then dominate the flavor profile to the clean dry finish, A light slightly dry pale with a light kiss of sweetness...not bad... pleasant but unmemorable.

If there was honey added it fermented out dry. Light body with an easy carbonation. Tastes little like any amber ale Iï¿½ve had. More like a mainsteam pale lager.
Okanagan Extra Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);Not a huge cider person but this was impressive. On the sweet side, but very enjoyable. Tasty and crisp enough.
Okanagan Extra Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);Rating #875 - December 29, 2013 - 341ml bottle from Depot, 7%.

De Bie Zatte Bie;Wakken, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij de Bie;12 ounce bottle in Brussels. Darkish brown pour. Not a big body. Some taste of cocoa cola.
De Bie Zatte Bie;Wakken, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij de Bie;Gekocht op 16-08-2018 bij Dranken Geers in Oostakker. En thuis geproefd op 14-12-2018. Zatte Bie is een helder donkerbruin biertje dat bij het uitschenken een normale hoeveelheid wit schuim produceert in een dik-wollige vorm. Het blijft op een normale wijze aan de glaswand kleven en is vrij stabiel te noemen, na een tijdje ligt er nog steeds een fijn laagje schuim op het bier. CO2 pareling is niet te zien wegens te donkere kleur. Het aroma van Zatte Bie is honing- en karamel zoet, fruitig met kers, rozijn en vlierbes, moutig met chocolade en wat geroosterde mout en een houtachtige kruidige toets. De smaak is bitterig en zoetig met honing, zoethout en karamel, fruitig met opgelegde kers, rozijn en vlierbes, een gebrande mout-toets en een alcohol-sherry toets. In de mond toont Zatte Bie een volle body met een olieachtige textuur en een normale CO2 prikkeling. Een fluweelzacht complex biertje. De nasmaak die wat plakkerig aanvoelt vloeit lang uit, is wat bitterig en zoetig met zoethout en karamel, fruitig met opgelegde kers en vlierbes en nu een Porto / Sherry alcohol toets die ietwat verwarmend voor de dag komt. Geen slecht biertje, zoetig, fruitig en met een leuke verwarmende alcohol toets op het eind. Foto's en info bij: http://www.beersfrombelgium.eu/nl/Zatte_Bie-b-279.html

Crannog Red Branch Organic Irish Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Crannog Ales;On tap at Hops Northwest in New Westminster. A nice dark brown ale with a tan head. Tastes of malts and caramel. Sweet and mild. Not a lot going on, flavour wise. Average sums it up.
Crannog Red Branch Organic Irish Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Crannog Ales;"Draught at St. Augustineï¿½s, Vancouver Hazy dark amber color, with creamy head. The aroma is mild, caramel, a bit dusty. The caramel flavor provides a rather dry mouthfeel, also because of some roasted malt, and a moderate yeast touch, that at least makes it taste more real; roasted nuts in the bitter final. Average."
Crannog Red Branch Organic Irish Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Crannog Ales;On tap at Rogue in Vancouver. Hazy deep amber, light brown cap, small and good lacing. Very deep malts - caramel, bit of chocolate, candied orange peel, very rich, interesting spice - one that is very unique, raspberries. Big malt and fruit taste, light spice and perfect amount of ï¿½herb, weak pine and mulled orange??? A bit of bread also. Medium bodied and a nice lightly numbing feel. Long finish. Excellent beer and highly drinkable.
Crannog Red Branch Organic Irish Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Crannog Ales;I recently enjoyed this ale at the Irish Heather GastroPub in Vancouver. This is the best ale I have ever tasted and look forward to tasting more brews from Crannog.
Crannog Red Branch Organic Irish Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Crannog Ales;Draught, Cafe Deux SoleilsBright amber colour. Aroma is light - fruity, toasty, caramelly. Fairly light, mild, vaguely caramelly flavour with smokey, metallic undertones. Brianï¿½s beers always walk that line between being tasty session beers and being a shade too bland. This one is the latter, unfortunately.
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);Appearance: Light golden, clear. Ok amount of off-white head. Aroma: Slight hops and malt, some sweetness. Taste: Better than the non-export, but quote light on the hops and malt, and this one not a bitter either. Info: 355ml can, 29/5-2013, BB: 25/10-2013
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);Make this short and sweet. Had several good cans while in Fiji. Not A beers but C- area on this beer. Very similar to the Flagship beer of CUB Pacific in Fiji, Fiji Bitter. Just a little sweeter and not as cidery as FB is. My Export bitter was just bad, awful bad. Vinegar and plastic smell and it went from there. Undrinkable. Sour vinegar, burnt plastic and scorched vegetables. Returned to bar and got a Fiji Bitter. Was good in a Hammock on South Sea Island and that is OK with me.
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);Despite being a very crap beer this was a life saver! Crisp and cold, that's all you need in Fiji ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);Bitter?!?!?! Donï¿½t know where they get that other than a pure marketing gimmick as thereï¿½s only a smidgen of bitterness thatï¿½s dominated by wet carboard, spoiled fruit and old bread dough sweetness. Poured at a good temperature and with a foamy, frothy, off-white head that soon settles and some lace. Color is an 18 k gold with a couple of bubble trails. Aroma was sweet and had the above qualities a bit muted. Body is a little thick and the little bitterness there is clashes in some odd ways with the carbonic tang and cloying sweetness. Finish is not short enough. I need the medicinal effects so I will soldier on thru this, tough guy that I am.
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);"Clear golden coloured body with a white head and a little bit of bubbles rising from the bottom. Mild malt and cardboardie smells with a touch of light sugars. Light-bodied; Some mild malt notes with a very subdued sweetness and no complexity at all, just watery tastes. Aftertaste shows almost nothing except for cool ocean breezes and a touch of water - maybe a touch of malt and alcohol. Overall, not very good and very passable - once again, Fiji Bitter was better than the other three (including this) that I sampled. I sampled this 33 cL can sampled at the Octopus Resort on Waya Island (Yasawa Chain) in Fiji on 15-20 August 2009 on my honeymoon."
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);This is widely available in can form all over Fiji for not much money. Exactly what you would expect from mass market beer. Pretty much tasteless. When you taste this you can understand why this particular beer hasnt broken out of Fiji.
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);375ml can. Pretty much what I expected however it did carry a bit more body and colour than expected. Amber gold with a sudsy soapy white head. Grassy cereal aroma and thin in the mouth with a sweet dry finish.
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);Can. Pours a light golden with a short-lived white head. Not much difference between this and the domestic Fiji Bitter. Slightly more grain and slightly less sweet when consumed side by side. Tastes a bit thinner.
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);Fiji Exportï¿½very similar to Fiji Bitter, but a tad less sweet (or should that be a tad more watery?) with a metallic tinny note in the finish. You would think that being available only in cans should add points for freshness in a tropical climate. Nope.
Fiji Export Bitter;Walu Bay, Suva, Fiji Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Paradise Beverages Fiji (Coca-Cola Amatil);This was a watery mess. Not even the chemical tastes of normal Fiji Bitter. Water and some malt. That is about it. Stick to the better Fiji Bitter if holidaying in fiji.
Victory V1009;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Interesting, yeasty spiciness. Has some characteristics of both a dubbel (dark and very malty) and a tripel (spicy, yeast and a dry finish). A good and very interesting creation.

Blue Collar Hopalong American Pale Ale;Vineland, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Collar Brewing Co. (NJ);Another perfect brew from the boys at BCB. This APA is so hoppy it makes Sierra Nevada PA taste like Bud Light. I believe it's one of Michael Jackson's favorites. (For you not in the know, I am NOT talking about the so-called king of pop.) This brew has a refreshing taste, clean and crisp with the right amount of bitterness: ALOT.
Blue Collar Hopalong American Pale Ale;Vineland, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Collar Brewing Co. (NJ);Citrusy and very hoppy, as you'd expect. Nice malt backbone. Nicely done.

General Lafayette Churchills Dark Mild;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Copper Crow Beer Company;Cask-conditioned. Golden-amber body with a velvety, cream-colored head. Malty, sweet tea aroma with cigar notes and a touch of apple. Flavor has some nice depth of malt, a little bit of graininess, and is medium sweet with modest, but deceptive bitterness. Ample flavor, but light bodied with very delicate carbonation. An enjoyable mild ale, especially on cask.
General Lafayette Churchills Dark Mild;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Copper Crow Beer Company;On tap at the GLI.

Crannog Hells Kitchen Organic Irish Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Crannog Ales;Tasted at 2007 Organic Brew Fest in PDX--A well-balanced dark ale that I would never have guessed was made with potato. My Polish friends loved this yummy beer that was decently hopped. Who could resist a potato brew? Not me, and I am glad I tried it!
Crannog Hells Kitchen Organic Irish Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Crannog Ales;Had on tap in Vancouver, BC and loved it. Itï¿½s not everyday you drink beer made with potatoes. It should be done more often. They hop this one nicely, which makes Hells Kitchen a balanced beer and one of my favorite beers from Crannog (and in all of BC for that matter). I only wish it were available on tap at more places but I think they drink most of what they brew out there in Sorrento...

Mac and Jack's African Amber Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mac and Jack's Brewing Company;Well here's a beer I never thought I'd actually try. But there it was on the tap list at my first stop in Seattle. I imperceptibly jumped off my stool. In the end, slightly underwhelming because while it did live up to the hype, it sorta didn't. By that I mean, its surely the best amber ale I've ever had. But also, it's just an amber ale and hard to get terribly excited about that. But still, it was pretty good. Notes of tobacco, earth, caramel, and black bread. Very balanced between a pleasing maltiness and the tobacco hopping.
Mac and Jack's African Amber Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mac and Jack's Brewing Company;Pours a nice light brown with a thin cream-colored head. Nose is almost non-existent. Taste is malt, a little sour, mild but with some hops. Crisp mouthfeel. Simple, and elegant. A good no-drama beer.

Post Road India Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IPA;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Not to much to it. The color is cloudy pale yellow, not to intense. A small nose of bittering hops. Somewhat salty. I was disappointed in the bitterness. The hops were not strong for an ipa. Would not drink again.
Post Road India Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IPA;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);On tap at Brooklyn Brewery, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY. Clear amber hued ale having lasting white head with good lacing. No discernable carbonation. Some hop aroma. Medium bodied that starts with slightly sweet malt with some nutty flavor. A notable off-flavor (oxidation product?). Finishes with lingering hop bitterness. A rather mediocre beer.
Post Road India Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IPA;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);"Dude....I think something was wrong with my beer. It tasted sour, but I don't think it was skunked. Maybe just slightly expired or something. No ""best before"" date. My score is boosted a little to compensate for the geriatricy or whatever. From what I could make out, it didn't have as much hops as I'd like."
Post Road India Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IPA;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);I have to agree with all that's been said already.This could be a nice session ale for me(if it had to be) but I wouldn't crave this as I would other offerings.

Post Road India Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IPA;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);A largely middle-of-the-road IPA, lacking much in the way of outstanding bitters, hops, malts, body, or much of anything else. Quite drinkable, but just nothing interesting about it at all.

Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);From can stamped 17199 (July 18, 2017). Light-bodied and nearly flavorless, neutral saccharine/toasted grain effects, and enjoyably frothy for its size. Surprisingly no fault or flaw, even as it warms. Like moderately bitter off-dry mineral water, faint corn syrup, almost a touch of plastic/malt liquor in the nose.
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12 oz can. Pours clear pale yellow with a bubbly white head and poor retention. No lacing. High carbonation. Sweet beerish watery flavor with a strange tinny background taste. Marginally better than water. I love Busch Light, but this isnï¿½t close.
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Can. Brilliantly clear light straw. White foamy head. Aroma is light grain, not much else. Flavor is smooth, faint grain, slight corn notes. Finishes crisp. Very similar to Busch Light.
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);can @ Party Town / Florence KY --- Aroma of wet cardboard. Clear medium amber, off-white head that quickly sinks to thr rim, waves of lace. Odd taste: light malt that grows into sweet corn. No bittering. Simple, obviously not an alcoholic beverage. Pretty low end.
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Can into pils glass, bubbly clear pale golden color with off-white head. Aroma notes of cardboard and faint grain. Taste adds corny sweetness. Light body, heavy-moderate carbonation, crisp with clean finish. No idea how fresh this is, if that makes much of a difference.
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Can. It had a semi sweet corn flavor with little nose. It was ice cold at first bit as it warmed it got a little funky.
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Not bad for a non alcoholic beer. Hard to rate this but it has a decent lager flavor. Thereï¿½s a lot worse out there. Nice carbonation.
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12oz can, thanks to chudwick. Clear orange color. White head fizzes loudly. Fades to a minimal amount quickly, fading to nothing eventually. Wet bread flavor, maybe some corn. Not nearly as much of the offensive burnt popcorn flavor I was getting from other NAs that I recently tried. Maybe the can format has something to do with that? Another win for cans... Other than that, the flavor is pretty minimal. Carbonated water, with a touch of beer flavor. I much prefer this to the other NAs though because it isnï¿½t offending me, just very very plain. Stronger, kind of sharp forced carbonation impedes drinkability unfortunately. Light body. Moderate sweet taste, light bitter bite, touch of acidic. Overall, one of the better macro NAs Iï¿½ve had so far, but thatï¿½s not saying much.
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"""Pretty sure I had this plenty o times in my younger years. Gets the job done as a lawnmower beer, but thatï¿½s about it. Too thin and watery (and flavorless) to make any kind of mark."""
Busch NA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12oz can into a tall kitchen glass - all of the .5 ratings must have been made by blind folks or more realistically by heavily biased posers. Nose is floral grain. Sip adds light caramel and hints of citrus. Light body as is expected. balanced taste but barely pronounced. Way better than the Old Milwaukee NA. Very clean overall though the nose is a little off-putting.

Has a medium-full body with a creamy mouthfeel and a mostly sweet, slightly warming, long, lingering finish. Overall, a tasty, pretty complex, winter sipper that defiantly improves with age.
Yards Trubbel de Yards;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Yards Brewing Company;Fruity aromas, raisiny, red apple, light banana.

Yards Trubbel de Yards;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Yards Brewing Company;Bottle from my brother. Initial pour and aroma brings out the dubbel characteristics.

Warmth comes on very late, mostly sweet finish.

Triumph Gothic Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;Sampled at Triumph. Iï¿½m still being amazed by these beers. A gruit! And well executed. It poured a hazy deep orange with a creamy thin, white head that left excellent, sheety lace. Very intense aroma full of lavender perfume, cloves, cinnamon stick, nutmeg. Taste is full of cinnamon and lavender to the point it is almost numbing on the palate. But it was not the gross herbal bomb I was expecting. There is a nice caramel malt backing and a sticky sweetness that cuts through the herbal medley. Well done.
Triumph Gothic Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;Pours a reddish brown. Aroma is earthyness and spices (but they were faint). Taste is sweet and spicey. Very creamy, coats the tongue and leaves a sweet aftertaste. Nice.

Triumph Gothic Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;On tap at the Princeton location. Poured a deeper amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of earthiness, some toast, and caramel. Tastes of the same earthiness, caramel, and some herbalness.
Triumph Gothic Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;Cask at P-town. Pours a deep mostly clear woody copper-brown with a thin to no head. Aroma is diacetyl , but light and still able to get past it- some lighter than expected herbs and spices- very un-gruit like- some light ginger , pepper and grassiness. Flavor is also a slight ginger, some grassy yarrow, and a medium toffee munich- toasted malt, light burnt hint, more butter which makes it finish a bit slick. Odd- even for a gruit, but still good- herbs are restrained throughout.
Triumph Gothic Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;@Princeton-on hand pump-pours a disappearing offwhite bubbles with amber color.

Triumph Gothic Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;Cask at the Manhattan Cask Fest. Always good to see a gruit being made, though this hardly tastes like other versions Iï¿½ve had. Sweet rosemary and thyme aroma, malt and black pepper. Mild wintergreen and juniper flavor, cinnamon. Decent but a bit of a herb and spice sludge.
Triumph Gothic Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;Cask at 3rd Manhattan Cask Fest. Deep brown with a touch of ruby highlights. The aroma is very herbal. Sweet gale, rosemary, lavender and rosehips. Floral and spicy. There is a bit of astringency mid-palate that actually lends the beer a nice silky body. There is a touch of caramel through the middle that works quite well. It is light-bodied and quite refreshing. There seems to be a kiss of cinnamon as well that is quite different from most gruits Iï¿½ve had before. I like it.

Stone 4th Anniversary IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IPA;Stone Brewing;Thanks to EDA for sharing at the RNH Charity california beer event. This was like a mix between 2 and 3. Not quite as held up as the 2, and not quite as funky or lame as the 3. Cheesey cheddar, hops, garden spice, green grassy, metallic stale hops and a dull crackery malt. Flavor is more stale hops, green, grassy , chlorophyl astringency, light metal, some cheese, leather and earth with a decent bitterness in the end.

Stone 4th Anniversary IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IPA;Stone Brewing;Bottle shared by EDA as part of a complete vertical.

Stone 4th Anniversary IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IPA;Stone Brewing;From the tap at the Stone Winter Storm 2008. I had ordered this beer along with a Sawyerï¿½s Triple and both were served in a small glass of an estimated six ounces. I was a little upset though since the waitress had confused the two beers with each other and I had to do the math myself and figured out on my own which was which. Anyways, This was a crystal clear golden brass/blonde ale with a decent layer of foam and no sign of any sediment or dust. The aroma was a bold and lively serving of hops and citrus. The flavor was strong and held a fresh juicy grapefruit taste and tons of hops considering the few mouthfuls I consumed. Iï¿½d really like to see this and all of their rare anniversary ales re-brewed and bottled to let everyone experience what delicious beer recipes Stone has in their archive.
Stone Old Guardian (Vintages through 2003);Escondido, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stone Brewing;Pours a deep amber color, with a two finger off white head that had some staying power. Aromas of hops, sweet malts, and some more hops. Flavor isnï¿½t as sweet as I was led to believe. You can taste the alcohol from the get go, what follows is a nice mellow caramel/brown sugar (I Guess) sweetness that finishes with a nice bitter hop.
Stone Old Guardian (Vintages through 2003);Escondido, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stone Brewing;Bottle @ a recent bottle share... Poured dark, burgundy with a mild head. Surprisingly better than expected for a beer older than ten years. Oxidation was there, but not too forward. And some sweetness with a good mouthfeel.

Stone Old Guardian (Vintages through 2003);Escondido, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stone Brewing;"2002 Vintage. RBSG 2008. Smells of dried apricots, caramel, and cane sugar. The apricot is very full and awesome. Bright on the sip with warm fruit flavors over a winey complexion. Finish is long but delayed in layers, very very dry (which I like), and bitter -- I used words like ""damn"" and ""dope"" when describing the finish, so it must have been fabulous. Lingering fruit, black pepper, and peppercorn, and astringent. ""Refined"" comes to mind."
Stone Old Guardian (Vintages through 2003);Escondido, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stone Brewing;2002 Vintage. A: The beer pours a hazy amber color with a finger or so of tan colored foam. S: Starts off with caramel and citrus, mostly oranges, along with a nice sharp pine note. Thereï¿½s a bit of vanilla in there, but also some cardboard, unfortunately. Brown sugar provides some more sweetness. T: Still quite bitter with a lot of pine and citrus peel. The vanilla is there again, as is a strong flavor of toffee. Grapefruit, pine, and grass add some perception of hop character. The cardboard is here, but itï¿½s fairly minimal. M: The body is medium to full with a moderate level of carbonation. D: Not bad for a nine year old beer. I prefer it fresh or with a year or two on it, but still not bad.

Squatters Off Duty IPA;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;IPA;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);From Dec 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle(room temp) a clear medium gold with a large head of foam that shrank slowly and left a solid layer with lacing. The smell has a really nice hoppy nose to it. Nice notes of grapefruit and some floral tones dominate. More sniffing pulled out a touch of malt... The taste is big on the grapefruit up front followed by a good injection of sweet malt to somewhat control the hoppiness. Nice balancing job! A few more sips into it, the balanced flavours are more pronounced making for a real treat for my palate. The finish is on the dry side making for a real crispness. The only bad thing I can say is that it's kind of thin body wise but it's still a nice IPA. Bottom line: A well balanced American IPA that I'd have no hesitation drinking again and again. Highly reccommended! Thanks to Wasatch for this excellent IPA. It's a winner!
Squatters Off Duty IPA;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;IPA;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Bottle, 355 ml, somewhere in US. Pours clear orange with medium white head. Citrus, grassy, moderate hoppiness, caramel malty, moderate bitterness in finish. Medium bodied. OK.
Squatters Off Duty IPA;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;IPA;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Pours a honey golden color. Lightly hazy with slight particulates floating about. Nice, thick, tight eggshell colored head, about two fingers. Big ol bubbles. Pretty good longevity, good retention, good lacing. Aroma is phenomenal. You donï¿½t get a lot of this in IPAs, at least, not like this. Lots of fresh fruit, especially orange. Fresh orange, fresh pineapple, fresh mango. Very fresh, itï¿½s so unexpected, so delectable. Any hops in this will go unnoticed, because of this fresh fruitiness. Taste is much of the same. Have you ever bitten into a fresh, and I mean fresh, orange? So sweet, and yet underlying bitterness. Sweet orange, bitter orange pith. It goes so well together. Light honey. Bread crust. Floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Dry. Bitter, but barely. Finishes clean and fresh. Odd that the malts really only come out in the finish. Overall, this is really good. One of the best IPAs Iï¿½ve had. I expected mediocrity, but was surprised. Not a hop biting, hop forward IPA, but certainly solid. Yes, I would buy it again. I would encourage you to buy it and try it!!
Squatters Off Duty IPA;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;IPA;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);"Hazy golden coloured body with a bright light bronze coloured body and a touch of an orange tint. Aroma of citrus, resin, alcohol and a nice smooth malt note - strong. Medium-bodied; Sweet flavour of honey, grain, citrus, pine and a good bit of floral elements- nice and smooth throughout the flavour. Aftertaste shows some rich sweetness, a bit of honey and caramel with a nice hop flavour of flowers, grapefruit and light herbal notes with some residual alcohol and bitterness. Overall, a nice IPA with a smooth flavour and lightly bitter flavour that goes down easy and shows some nice characteristics. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Cash Wise Liqours in Minot, North Dakota for US$1,99 on 04-October-2016 sampled a day later in my hotel room here in Minot, North Dakota on 05-October-2016."
Squatters Off Duty IPA;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;IPA;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Gold pour with off white head. Nose of light grapefruit and orange. Flavor has a bitter bite of citrus, grass and touch of malt.
Squatters Off Duty IPA;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;IPA;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Chris brought this one for me from a trip to Utah. +++ Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a bright yellow-gold color with a huge foamy yellow-white head that lingered and left good lacing. The aroma was sweet and fruity with notes of mango, papaya, pine and honey. The flavor was sweet and tangy with sugar, mango and papaya elements. Long finish. Medium body. Solid.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;From old tasting notes. Amber, red color. Bubbly beige head. Subtle herbal malt nose. Bittersweet toasted malt flavor. Crisp dry floral hop finish.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;On tap at brewpub (Wachovia Center). Poured a hazy deep amber color with modest tan head that lasted. Very minimal malt aroma. Taste has some caramel notes along with toasted grains. Light body that goes down smooth.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Poured in glass. Has a nice bronze color. Medium thick head that is soon gone. Kind of a sweet smell to it, but not always (kind of different from bottle to bottle if you ask me). Bitter and hoppy front to the beer, but not really hoppy, then after that, the beer just goes down smoothly down me throat and I smile because the beer is a beer that is not too shabby.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;THOGHTS: The aroma wasnï¿½t unpleasant, but just hardly there. Not really much in the way of flavor either ï¿½ it was a bit watered down. The best part of this beer was the carbonation bubbling up from the bottom in varying sizes. I could look at it all night, like a flute of champagne, but it wasnï¿½t the kind of beer I wanted to savor so it was gone too soon. I just finished it as soon as possible so that I could move on to the next beer. A little run of the mill. TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a sparkling, light to medium yellow with a small whith head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was light to moderate rasted malt. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and bitter and sour, while the finish was moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter and sour with a short duration. The body was light to medium and dry and watery with a slightly metallic finish.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;From a bottle. If you want something that tatses like a beer, this is it. Amber, dark in appearance, has a strong aroma to it that I canï¿½t put my finger on. Is this really a lager? I obtained some of this on a whim.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;If you told me I was drinking another boring run of the mill amber ale, I wouldï¿½ve believed you. This had nothing lager crisp about it. Caramel malts with a touch of bitter hops in the finish. Snore fest, medium to full body. Snore.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;cloudy amber appearance, aroma wasnï¿½t the best... after the first sip, this lager does get better however, very smooth.... just wanted to try something new
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Bottle Pours a hazy amber with a fizzy off white head. The head lasts well and turns creamy. Also produces good lacing. Has a decent aroma of malts and nuts. Taste is pretty good, has a creamy texture with a good duration. Has a lively carbination, with a nice bitter finish. A light to medium body. This beer fooled me. I didnï¿½t expect to be this good.
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with hopdog, thanks Steve!) This is quite aromatic, but so is dog poop, and Iï¿½m pretty sure I donï¿½t much like this aroma either. The nose is dry and toasty, but the beer also smells like a wet cardboard box thatï¿½s held vegetables and had some time to ""ripen."" Or maybe something else entirely, I donï¿½t know, this isnï¿½t an odor I try to keep at the forefront of my memory, and donï¿½t want to. The flavor is also kind of unpleasant. Minimally sweet, with a mild toastiness, but the principle flavor is, hell, I donï¿½t know, cardboardy and vegetal? I donï¿½t think Iï¿½ve tasted (or smelled) anything like this, and itï¿½s not enjoyable. In fact, itï¿½s easily on the unpleasant side of ""average"". Medium bodied. Deep ruddy amber color, just a tad bit of chill haze, but clearing as it warms, and topped by a small, but very persistent off-white head. Not a good beer from historic Brewerytown."
Red Bell Philadelphia Original Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Out of a bottle. Itï¿½s amazing when you arenï¿½t planning to drink different beer until someone hands it to you. Aroma was ok real light malt scent. Nice amber pour to it. Taste was malted mainly a slight hint of black cherry and caramel. Palate was enjoyably light. Overall a tasty interlude when you are expecting swill.

Dark ruby brown, small head. Sweet berry flavor barley aroma, quite juicy. Smoky fruity malt taste, nice wood notes, light dry finish. Like a good wee heavy, but without the high alcohol, I can't believe I've never tried it!
Wellington Iron Duke Strong Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Wellington Brewery;Enjoyable dark beer for me. From a Wellington 4-pack sampler. Looking forward to the others now...

Has a fairly dark amber appearance. Weak lacing. Aromas of toasted malts, a little woodsy, subtle spice notes. Flavours of roasted barley malt, strong dry fruit notes like raisins and plums.

Wellington Iron Duke Strong Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Wellington Brewery;Bottle from 4-pack sampler. Pours a deep chestnut brown. A very chewy ale. There's a lot to sink into with this one. Dark sugar, a hint of rum, & stone fruit. A nice crispness despite the sweet character of the style. Hops are bitter but not abundant & I usually crave more but it's kind of ok with this brew. Good stuff.
Hoppeland Bier Light;St. Sylvestre-Cappel, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. Sylvestre;From bottle at GBBF, day 3 on 3 August 2006. To be honest, I have no idea where this beer appeared from - it certainly wasnï¿½t on offer at the festival. Thanks to whoever brought it along anyway. Unfortunately I canï¿½t find too many good things to say about the beer. Stale light malt and corn aroma. Very weak and watery. Distinctly unpleasant.
Hoppeland Bier Light;St. Sylvestre-Cappel, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. Sylvestre;Bottled. A dark orange beer with a dying beige head. The aroma is sweet and very lightly beery combined with light hoppy notes. The flavor is a mixture of acidic and sweet - but in a very subdued way, combined with light notes of malt, and fruit, but no real signs of hops, though the end is still nicely bitter. The carbonization tickles the tongue.
Hoppeland Bier Light;St. Sylvestre-Cappel, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. Sylvestre;Bottle (GBBF 2006): Fizzy gold. A bit bland. Would be nice chilled as a lawnmower beer. Light spice and biscuits. Drinkable.

Hoppeland Bier Light;St. Sylvestre-Cappel, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. Sylvestre;Bottle at GBBF 2006. Golden with thin white head. Perfumed nose, bit over carbonated. Bit thin on malts, some citrus hops on end. Bit of sickly malt too. But mostly an empty beer. Carbonation is too much.
Hoppeland Bier Light;St. Sylvestre-Cappel, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. Sylvestre;Bottled ï¿½ GBBF. A light copper coloured beer. The aroma is sweet and corny. There is a lot of unpleasant plastic charcter. The taste is also heavy on the plastic. Tinny, carboanated and dull. Nothing nice about this one.
Hoppeland Bier Light;St. Sylvestre-Cappel, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. Sylvestre;[Bottled at GBBF] Clear golden, creamy head. Some citrus. Fairly soft despite weak maltiness. There is a hint of metal but no bitterness. Slightly better than average commercial low alcs.
Skol (Europe/Asia/Caribbean);Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Oct 2019. Can from a shop in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. Drunk cold in an air-conditioned hotel room with Zelie as part of our snacks and beer evening. This is the rare Malaysian Skol (4%), one of the few beers brewed in Malaysia. It's thin and crap. Barely beer. [1.9]
Skol (Europe/Asia/Caribbean);Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;I will buy it again because of its price and sweetness, just cause i like this kind of beers not because of its body and look.

Bock Du Moulin;St. Sylvestre-Cappel, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;St. Sylvestre;0,75 ltr: Clear golden not so heavy lager from French Flanders, if the Bierwinkel, Leiden sells this it must be good. Expect nothing so the surprise of the taste quite amazed me. Taste slightly bitter, also watery but not annoying. But most beers of this low alcohol are quite boring.

Calumet Amber;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Draft. A basic amber beer, maybe a touch tart ,this brewery is definitely stuck in the early 90s as their offereings have a homebrewish quality.

Squatters Captain Bastards Oatmeal Stout;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);"From Dec 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a very dark brown with a large head of foam that quickly dissipated leaving a very broken fine layer with no lacing. The smell surprised me. I note a very citrusy nose that reminds me more of a hoppy Pale ale or an IPA. The taste has some good roasted flavour to it up front with a heaping helping of citrus..mainly lemon...especially in the finish. I can't detect much of an oatmeal flavour to it; maybe the hoppiness is blocking it out? Pretty unusual tasting Oatmeal Stout that I can't say I favour that much. It *just* doesn't hit palate right."
Squatters Captain Bastards Oatmeal Stout;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Tap. Pours clear mahogany, large creamy beige head, good lacing. Aroma is quite roasty, lactose. Flavor is medium sweet, light bitter. Medium plus body, creamy. Send like a milk stout to me.

Squatters Captain Bastards Oatmeal Stout;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Draft at restaurant location in Salt Lake City. Appearance is good for this style of stout with a rich foamy head. Taste is on mark, but I think the 4% Utah alcohol limit results in a thin palate.
Squatters Captain Bastards Oatmeal Stout;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);On tap @ Squatters. Black in color with some tan foam. Has a bit of a toasted marshmallow smell to it. Lots of ash and roast, too. Tastes quite bitter and a bit acidic. Itï¿½s very thin and watery on the tongue. Somewhat nutty, I guess...a bit of an astringent tea quality as well. Started off well and faded fast.
Slavutych Klasychne (Slavutich Classic);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Bright straw color with just a lid of white bubbles. Lots of yeast in the aroma, with hints of grain and corn and even a touch of alcohol (rather heavy for the ABV). Light and bubbly. to the point of being fizzy, in feel. Barley pop really comes to mind with this one. Chalky malt and a simple sugary flavors dominate. Some mild floral hops seem to add to the sweetness, rather than offset it. Grassy, somewhat unclean finish and linger. Blah!
Slavutych Klasychne (Slavutich Classic);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);this tasted like ass. well, actually, it had no flavor at all. reminder to self: never actually pay for this beer.

Slavutych Klasychne (Slavutich Classic);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Of the Ukrainian beers this was always a stand out for freshness. Very little skunkiness and quite crisp. Low in carbonation with a good clean head over an amber body this is a good beer for the warmer weather. No lager really goes down well in temperatures of minus 20c. Good blanace too
Slavutych Klasychne (Slavutich Classic);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Orange color. Not very carbonated for a lager (good thing). Nice citris element, grassy and prevelent yeast. Creamy finish.
Slavutych Klasychne (Slavutich Classic);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);This is the third beer I have had from this Ukrainian brewer and the best to date. Fresh tart aroma - hint of ale to it. Cloudy light orange appearance. Very light, white, quickly dissipating head with no lacing. Bit of a complex flavor - hint of citrus, yeast and biscuits in the flavor - blends together well - very tart. Nice smooth mouthfeel, kind of a thick texture to it - creamy. Stays strong to the finish.
Slavutych Klasychne (Slavutich Classic);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Hazy gold beer. Pretty good lager, a little tart and yeasty. Very good buttery mouthfeel, nice mildly bitter and tart finish. Ale-like.

Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle- This bottle was given to me by a co-worker. According to her, someone had brought this over to her house a few years ago for a party, and left some behind. She doesnï¿½t drink beer, so put them in her cellar room and forgot about them. We got talking about Rickardï¿½s White at work a while back and she had mentioned that she had some of this from years past......I doubted it was the gold she had, but she assured me it was. After receiving not one but TWO bottles of this from her, I was sure this would not be in a state to drink, and therefore not in a state to rate either. But after cracking the seal of the first one.....I heard a lovely fizz and a quick blast of air escaping. Could this have held up in her cellar room? It certainly did. Pale gold pour with a thin white head that is quite short lived. Nose of muted grains and cardboard and a weird fruity component. Tastes of pale malts and sweet grains with just a bit of stale cardboard bitterness.Fizzy, quick finish. Not that good, but I wasnï¿½t expecting much.
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);like iï¿½ve said in most of my other molson ratings, i swear they have one MASSIVE vat, and they brew all their beers in that, and leave it up to the marketing department to sell the beer, this stuff is awful.
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Never to be an exception for having Rickardï¿½s Red. I avoid this one most of the time.
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Maybe Iï¿½ve been hoodwinked but I was impressed by this from a macro. Nice thick white head o a golden body. Aroma and flavour hint at a Belgian taste, almost like a home brew Leffe. Nice body with a hint of yeast in the finish and a sugary nose. It is not a great beer but above average for Molson. Not sure that the average macro drink would ever have a second one of these.
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A beer that was obviously produced more by the marketing department and the bean counters than by any true brewing craftsman.
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Worse than Rickard's Red. One gets the feeling that Molson has a giant vat that they use to fill the bottles of all their brands. Nothing to recommend at all.
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Most canadian beer is crap and this beer is no exception. Tastes just like bud light but probably worse.
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);(Bottle) Another terrible beer by Molson. Pours a thin, white head and a golden body. Lime and corn aroma. Flavours of slight hops and malt in an ocean of water. God, I hate the Canadian Marcos!
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Similar to regular Rickards Red but not as toffee like. A little bit of cream is noticed but except from that its pretty watery.
Rickard's Gold;Montrï¿½al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Just another losing entry in the race. Watery...............................
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Mild malt aroma. Terrible light yellow color. Flavors were muted malt. Body was light and watery.
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Low carbonation, thin aroma. Taste is weak with distinct bread notes. Palate is similar to that of a pilsener, but slightly watered down. Refreshing, not awful.
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Like a Bud but with flavor. The first is just as good as the last. Highly drinkable from a summer Day to a holiday get together, always good.
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;On tap no other beer comes near Schafer. German, Holland, or USA nothing has more drinkability than Schafer on tap. Canned Schafer does not rate quite as high however if you can find longnecks your going in the right direction.
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;A great classic lager.brewed perfectly to style and enjoyable.pabst has done a great job with this one.tastes very much like the original
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Not good. Was watery and generally water like. Left me wanting more. El cheapo cerveza. Seems to only be in 40 oz bottles where I'm from. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Simply the best. Liquid nostalgia. Clear pale yellow pour with a white head and decent retention. Very good lacing. Clean, crisp, sweet light lager taste. Super refreshing.
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated on 2/6/08- I have family members who bring this stuff to gatherings and i have to say i am glad they wasted thier money instead of mine. This beer is not something you want to drink.
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;One of the better variants of the style. Nothing offensive, nothing great either. Just a very well priced adjunct lager designed for mass consumption. If the Coneheads drank beer, this one would be it.
Schaefer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12 ounce can. Can says brewed by the F&M Schaefer Brewing Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Pale gold color. Big creamy white head. Faint grainy malt nose is barely negligible. Thin watery grainy malt flavor(?). Notes of hay and lemon peel. Pale and sickly, as old American lagers go. Had to revisit this old friend from my youth. Meh! Stay away.
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Ok with all things being relative, it isn't an apples to oranges comparison to some of the many fine craft brews. But, for a ""daily"" drinkable light beer, (in the Coors, Miller, Bud Light arena), I keep going back to this. It has a few more calories and carbs, and more flavor and body than the above mentioned, I consider it a ""semi-light"" beer. Sure I love various craft beers here and there, but for a light lager, I love it."
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"From Oct 2008 Typical straw yellow colour with a good head of foam. The smell is also typical for the style. Grain, a wee bit of malt and some slight hoppiness. The taste is lightly flavoured with some grain, light malt, and some slight bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is as thin as it can be and gets very watery. Another ""winning"" light beer. Btw, I used enjoy a few regular Schaefers when it was around."
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;355ml can. BB Dec 2016. This is not a great one, even when stale you can tell it was bad fresh.
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated on 2/6/08- For some reason my great aunt loves this stuff, I tried it when visiting her and am glad to say the company was much better than the beer. This stuff really isnt worth drinking.
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz can (Old Notes)-Pours a very light golden with a small white head. Aroma of corn and grains. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew again filled the need in high school.
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Across the board gross. Worst beer in existence. Pours with barely any color and a bit of foamy head on top. Aroma is weak watery corn adjunct, hay, water, blegh. Flavor follows this with a dirty gag-inducing finish. Light on the palate and the only flavor is the lingering vomit flavor that makes this not drinkable even for beer pong. Handed it out to plenty of people who came to our place for a party though.
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Schaefer Light is the hidden gem of American light lagers. This stuff actually has some body. Letï¿½s be honest, no one cares about the pour - it is meant to be drunk straight from the can. Itï¿½s a bargain at about half the price of Michelob Light or Amstel Light which are the only two light beers I can think of which are better. The distribution is very limited and even in the midwest spotty at best.
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours a pale yellow color. Smell is very mild, a touch of grains. Taste is very weak, beer flavored water, not much of anything. Overall there are better light beers out there.
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12er of cans from a Wal-Mart near Lake Texoma. Consumed at Eisenhower State Park with a bottle coozie slipped on the can upside down. Aroma is metal, sweetness, and corn. Taste is metallic and grainy. Sure is a lot of metal in this brew. I was still very sad when the park ranger interrupted my dinner to make me pour out my last can of it. Very sad.
Schaefer Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"This is probably one of the best ""cheap"" beers Ive had great for a college party."
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);One of my favorite cheap brews. A very nice, crisp refreshing beer. My only complain is that it could be a bit less sweet, but otherwise I definitely enjoy kicking back and enjoying some nice cans of Hamm's. Definitely a nice classic American lager.
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A refreshing beer whether youï¿½re chilling at home or having a get together with friends. Itï¿½s also nice how cheap it is for a six pack but the taste is just as good as any other domestic brew.
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);For six 16 oz. beers for under 5 dollars this beer is great I love the taste and its not over powering. Great on a hot day a hidden gem in my book.
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Not bad at all... has a clean taste but a little bitter.... i am not a micro-brew guy....cheap beer never gives me any problems can't say that about those fancy high priced brews!!!!!
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);For my money this is the best of the American AALï¿½s Looks and tastes like beer I remember from the 1960ï¿½s when many American beers were quite good! You can buy this in 12 and 16 oz cans. A 30 pack of 12 oz cans can be had at Festival Foods for $10.99 plus tax today. No - itï¿½s not a glamorous import or boutique craft lager which I also enjoy at times but for the buck this refreshing brew canï¿½t be beat! Prosit!
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Regular light beer with a bitter end. Low abv. Cheap. Honestly thought i would get more from it.
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Refrigerated 12 oz. aluminum can poured into a glass. Aroma is light adjunct, light body, medium/light carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is light adjunct.
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can shared at Lucky Bamboo. Pours a clear gold with a finger of white foam that dissipates. Grain and corn syrup aromas dominate the nose. Palate is a bit thin with more sweet corn and grain. No real hops on the finish.
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"16 oz can on 13th March 2019. Drank at my daughters place in California. Got to love Millers for not mentioning their name on this bland and boring beer. Pale golden pour, clean and clear; fast fading white crown. Malty front to the nose and what taste there was, thin mouthfeel. Another Miller product that helps to keep them as my lowest scoring brewery in the world."
Hamms;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It's not even close to the best, but it is undoubtedly the cheapest. Light, easy to drink, and costs less than 50 cents per 12 oz can when you buy a 30 pack. Unfortunately it doesn't smell the best and has a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste. It is an extremely crappy beer. If you don't have a lot of money or just don't want to spend a lot it is actually a pretty decent option.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can from Patï¿½s. Pale gold pour with white head. Nose of bready corny malt, watery taste, not good.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I used to hate regular Hamms but my father-in-law would leave some in the fridge for himself and Iï¿½d drink it just to spite him. Developed a taste for it. This is more metallic tasting than the regular version, so itï¿½s not as good. But itï¿½s not horrible either. Malty, hoppy, and inexpensive for what it is.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);(can 7/31/10). Clear pale yellow color. Small white head. Light grainy aroma, with very light sweet corn and citrus. Flavor of the same. Short duration. Light dry finish. Thin texture. Moderate to high carbonation. Spare lacing.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);In the can thanks to Hurrisnow. Pours a medium golden color (not pale) with a bright white head. My can exploded upon opening and gushed out. Bit of a soapy aroma. Flavors are an unfortunate detergent, metallic and finishing lemon sourness. None of these were likely intended by the brewer.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Hammï¿½s Golden Draft is very similar to Miller Genuine Draft in appearance, smell, taste, body, and even can design. It has been a Miller product since 1999, by the way. Hammï¿½s G.D. has a thick, white head and a very clear, yellow-golden color, with some lacing. Carbonation is very high. The aroma is almost nonexistent. Taste is good, with grain predominating. Some very faint hop notes can be picked up. There is a semi-sweetness underneath. Mouth-feel is light and watery, and this beer finishes crisp and refreshing. H.G.D. would be a good price-conscious substitute for M.G.D., and I enjoyed it. Iï¿½d definitely buy this again and would recommend others give it a chance. This is not sold in Louisiana; I bought it on a road trip to Chicago in July, 2010."
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Iï¿½m a long time fan of good, balanced cheap lagers. This one takes the cake. I got this from my fiance. She had a chest of random, old beers and being the Hamms fan I am I decided to pick this one up. Itï¿½s very flavorful for a cheap lager. Crisp and refreshing...if I could find this more often you have my word that I would buy a case of it almost every week. By far the best macro lager I have ever had.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Hamms is the beer refreshing when youï¿½re a poor sumbitch like my roommate. This is a slight notch above many cheap beers, but still pretty weak and corny.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Oh yes. Canned. The body was pale yellow with a thin white head. The aroma was meaty with bologna and lots of grain. The taste was grainy bread with some iced tea. There was also some raw potatoes. Drinkable, but far from a pleasure.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Gold color with a white fluffy head. Aroma is slightly metallic and corny. Taste is a bit deeper than regular Hamms and maybe a touch sweeter. Good fishing beer when served ice cold from the can.
Hamms Golden Draft;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Just a really poor beer. I would take a cold Busch, High Life, or Bud can over this anyday. Even regular Hamms. Corny, grainy, over carbonated. Lagers suck, yada yada, we ALL chug them on backup or hot days. Drink another Miller product out of Milwaukee and this canï¿½t taste too far off.
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz can (old notes)-Pours golden with a white head. Aroma of corn and slight alcohol. Taste of the same with some sweetness thrown in. This light bodied ice brew brew was not bad.
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Not as good as Hamms draft or regular Hamms, but has some taste to it better then a lot of Mass produced. OK on the pallate take it over many other choices in maga-brews.
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Poured very pale with little to no head. Corny aroma and flavor. corn corn corn Good to get you drunk is about all. Serve very cold. Not as bad as some others.
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It doesnï¿½t taste like much, but if youï¿½re up for some serious drinking thatï¿½s a good thing. This beer packs a punch w/ its 6% alcohol and goes down like water (in fact it kind of looks like water). It is hands down my favorite gettinï¿½ drunk beer. Sadly, I canï¿½t find it in my area anymore.
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Used to get this for about $5 for a 50-pack or something...My friend needed large amounts of booze and he didnï¿½t like spending cash, so this was his choice...
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours a pale golden yellow. Aroma of corn, grains and some hops with a watery flavor muddled with some hops and a slightly bitter finish.
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours a light golden yellow. Aromas of minor hops, corn, grains. Flavor is light, crisp, watery with a little hop and not much else. More flavor in the Hammï¿½s products than most others.
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Opening the hunting camp in the fall is a magical experience: the musty smell, the Hammï¿½s signs dusted with cobwebs, the brisk autumn air...The leaves crunch under my feet as my worries disappear in that Upper Michigan wilderness. An owl can be heard in the distance. Back at camp, the sauna and barbeque get lit, and a cooler of Hammï¿½s and ice takes center stage. The sun goes down, and coyotes howl at the full moon. I climb into my down sleeping bag, gullet full of Hammï¿½s. I wake up and have Hammï¿½s and eggs for breakfast. The road hunt is on, with good cigars, hardroll sandwiches, Waylon Jennings on 8-track, and plenty of ice cold Hammï¿½s.
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);my buddy gave me one of these and you know i would take a steel reserve over this crap this is just fowl and wrong may god have mercy on the brewers soul that made this stuff
Hamms Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Hey this isn't so bad,nice golden color small univiting head that disappeared faster then a New York mugger.The aroma was light malt and corn,lots of corn with a very mild hint of hops and the flavor comes off much the same,BUT it was very thirst quenching and well worth the cheap price and since i'm a firm believer in drink cheap until you feel like going exspensive this will definately do it for me.Save the good brews for a good occasion.
Granville Island Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Nutty malt nose. Carmel malt flavor with medium alcohol heat. Thick and chewy
Granville Island Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);This had a nutty flavor to me. and it was strong............................
Granville Island Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Liked the taste of the caramel, but it was a little to strong of a taste....
Granville Island Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Even people who understand what the term 'cream ale' means in British Columbia will be confused by this thick, richly caramelly, strong beer. I'd call it an Old Ale if anything.
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;Sampler pack. Pours a dark copper with a thin tan head. Aroma is sweet and malty. Toasted malt flavor, some vegetable and a bitter finish. Lingering malt flavor.
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;The beer is neither too sweet or too bitter. Itï¿½s in the (almost) perfect middle. Ciule have more body but otherwise very good
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;Backlog, bottle that pours an amber golden with a medium head. Notes are slightly oxidized: some toasty malt, metal, corn, caramel, and pine. Average carbonation on a medium body
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;"One of four samples from the 12-pack variety pack. Ho-hum for a Pale Ale/Extra. Balance is a little off, but overall decent flavor. Wanted some more hops. Light orange color with off-white head. Liked their IPA better, which actually seemed more like a hoppy Pale Ale, or what an ""Extra"" should be."
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;This is kind of like a hopped up pilsener. If you are used to IPAs and want to back down to something smooth, lower alcohol, but with something that still has a little kick to it, this is a really good choice.
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;Nice drinkable beer. Not too hoppy, which is probably why I like it. Nice balance between the malts and hops.
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;Drank this one out of a cab so didn't get a lot of aroma. Nice and bitter piney flavour though. Lots of taste for a lower abv beer
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;Draft at Maynards in Rogers, MN. Pours a light amber, wispy white head. Aroma of grain, light florals. Crisp and fresh on the tongue, caramel, lightly toasted malts. Not bad but nothing distinguishing about it.
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;12 oz single bottle from Hy Vee Wine & Spirits - Council Bluffs (Madison Ave). Golden amber appearance with slight haze, a white head and light lacing. Aroma of bitter hops, toasted malt, biscuit, light pine and a hint of citrus. Similar flavor, adding mild hop bitterness (earthy) and a light grainy sweetness. Medium to light body with a balanced finish. A smooth, easy drinker overall.
Summit Extra Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale;Summit Brewing Company;A good pale L but not great flavor is a bit Donald I think it could be more robust more flavorful bitterness color aroma mouth feel all good. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Apollo Pilsner;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bryggeriet Apollo;Sample @ Flakhaven. Pours clear golden with a White head.

Lagunitas Dogtown Pale Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);This was the last of Binny's stock (Lincoln Park) that they were getting rid of on the build-your-own-6-pack section.... and then I held it for a few months. To me, the hops were still fresh... just too bitter. Seemed to follow the classic West Coast lines. Interesting to compare to the new varietal.
Lagunitas Dogtown Pale Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Bottle. Golden color, lush white foam. Aroma: nice, flower-citrus hops, fruits, a little grassy. Taste: very clean, a light malt, citrus, some fruits, very drinkable.

Fat Cat Pilsner;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fat Cat Brewery;Needs more hops, rather boring. Tastes like an intermediary beer for the macro drinkers.

Fat Cat India Pale Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Fat Cat Brewery;(Bottle) Pours clear amber. The aroma is rather caramelly with oxidized wet cardboard notes. Hints of floral, earthy and maybe some apricot-ish hops. The flavour is light to medium sweet and light to medium bitter. Tea-like and caramelly. Undertones of chlorine, wet cardboard, alcohol and metal. The mouthfeel is astringent. Quite off-tasting. Light to medium bodied.
Fat Cat India Pale Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Fat Cat Brewery;Old rate. Bottle from BC Liquor in Vancouver. Pours a medium amber with fluffy, off-white head. Malty aroma of caramel & toffee w/ notes of leafy tobacco. Hops seem absent. Flavour is sweet & malty w/ a moderately dry, peppery bitterness. Not really up to the standard Iï¿½d expect from a west coast brewery. Tame IPA.
Fat Cat India Pale Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Fat Cat Brewery;650mL bottle, pours hazy orange with a tiny white head. Very weak aroma of spicy hops and caramel. Flavour is stronger - caramel, cinnamon, spices and hops of course. Interesting, but not particular invigorating.

Taste of butter, a bit lactic, fruit candy, cardboard, metal. Bitter finish but not much of flavor or aroma hops.
Fat Cat India Pale Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Fat Cat Brewery;"A nice enough beer that poured a well-carbonated, clear dark amber and a short-lived tan foamy head; no lacing to speak of. Far too dark for an IPA, as was the aroma: mostly malt, no hoppiness to speak of. Taste was pleasant enough but I thought I was drinking a brown ale as I could mostly only taste malt but for a suggestion of hop at the end."
Fat Cat India Pale Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Fat Cat Brewery;650ml bomber from a BIF : Lightly hazed amber-gold with a good 2 finger cap that lasts and laces. Aroma is citrus, floral, caramel sweetness with some earthiness. Sweet malts disappear almost immediately and it turns pleasingly bitter, a bit fruity and dries out in the finish. Good solid brew pub fare but slightly two dimensional
Fat Cat India Pale Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Fat Cat Brewery;Light amber color. The light malt aroma has also some strange (but not nice) honey and flower touch. It has a better flavor, malt caramel and strong hopping. Considering what I have been drinking so far in BC (and Victoria), I have to enjoy it.

Fat Cat Pompous Pompadour Porter;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Fat Cat Brewery;Bomber. Pours nearly opaque with a scant tan head. Aroma of baking chocolate. Medium body and carbonation. Mostly chocolate in the aroma, a dash of caramel with a lightly pine-tinged overlay. Just a little ashy on the finish but otherwise a decent by-the-book brown porter.

Fat Cat Pompous Pompadour Porter;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Fat Cat Brewery;Far and away the best of the three Fat Cat beers Iï¿½ve tried! The head is a dark tan and quite foamy, nice lacing at the end of it all, and this pours a very dark, non-transparent amber. Iï¿½m reminded of a thicker cola when I look at this one. Aroma is mildly malted, and right away the first thing you taste is coffee. I like this one very much. Too bad about the artwork on the label, though. It looks like a Hanna-Barbara knockoff (think Top Cat or similar cheesy ï¿½60ï¿½s animated character).
Fat Cat Pompous Pompadour Porter;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Fat Cat Brewery;Chocolate aroma, sweet. Clean dark brown. More chocolate in the sip, this hit me very well. Good character and consistency.
Fat Cat Pompous Pompadour Porter;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Fat Cat Brewery;Courtesy of mgermani. Pours a dark ruddy brown and holds a two finger thick, somewhat bubbly, tan head. The aroma is lightly tart/lactic but also features chocolate and stewed dark fruits of the raisin and prune variety. Some very mild dirty/dusty notes to it. Sweet malt and fruit fore. Mild roast, more pronounced toasted malt. A little cocoa and a decent hop kick. A hoppy brown porter with some distinct cocoa and raisin nuts, but muted roast notes though it is fairly toasty. It develops a very unpleasant, stale, rotten twang to it as it warms that is very unpalatable.
Fat Cat Pompous Pompadour Porter;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Fat Cat Brewery;Bomber. Poured deeper brown with a dense, well-retained cap of beige head. The aroma picked up roasted darker chocolates and brown sugar with a sour air throughout.. nice malt bill, but quite likely an infection going on. The flavor had darker chocolate and soy on a weaker base.. left a scorching, dry burnt feel on the finish.. the sourness was present again, which hurt the drink slightly but didnï¿½t completely kill the enjoyment. Medium-ish bodied with a dry and increasingly spicy character to it.. sour fruits on the finish.. OK, but again probably infected.
Fat Cat Pompous Pompadour Porter;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Fat Cat Brewery;A well drinkable porter yet really sour on top of medium body and little head. The lace is there and this was fairly fresh. OK as a porter and beer, but the sourness must be accepted.

Fat Cat Pompous Pompadour Porter;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Fat Cat Brewery;Deep, dark ruby brown, clear. Chunky flotsam almond coloured head displaying excellent retention and scanty lace. Chocolate, cream, brown bread, raisins are all in the nose. Rich chocolate malt, a touch of coffee roast, some vanilla, some cookie, sweet figs, and a faint whiskey-soaked wood element that lends a pleasant sharpness to the finish. Tremendously flavourful, medium-bodied, and sheer joy to drink! Among the very best porters Iï¿½ve had.

Aroma has a hint of wheat, and a herbal whif, mixed with a strong maltiness.

Served with an orange slice. Pours a cloudy almost orange color. Nose has some slight citrus notes to it, which I was able to get independent of the fruit.

Elliott Bay Alembic Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Bar pour yields no head and had a hazy reddish color with barely any lacing. The smell had a earthy / grassy / herbal / baked caramel bread. Interesting, to say the least. The taste was basically the same. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat there and was good for the style and to me. Overall, I say it was a decent amber that I might have again.

Elliott Bay Dark Star Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;"Sampled @ Elliot Bay, West Seattle, April 2007 This is a very light colored Porter; it has a burnt, ruby-amber color that is just dark enough to be opaque if I donï¿½t hold it up to the light. It is topped by a wispy, weak, tap derived, ring of a head. The aroma has notes of roasted raisins, caramel and toffee. The aroma is actually fairly fruity with a solid berry note. The taste is quite a bit roastier than I was expecting, and it has a nice toasted grain character to it as well. Notes of coffee, toasted biscuits, and burnt caramel round out some rich malty flavors that while noticeable are quite dry and light somehow. This is a very quaffable brew, it is quite tasty and a great brew to have a session over at the local pub."

LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;On draught at the micro-brewery tavern/campground near Unity, Wisconsin. Pours a dark copper amber brew with a creamy off-white head that has some nice retention and excellent lacing. Aroma of rich caramel malt, a touch of brown sugar, some apples, roasted nuts and milk chocolate. Taste is medium to full bodied, light carbonation, with flavors of rich semi-sweet dark malt, brown sugar, roasted nuts and some roasted dark grain. Finish is semi-sweet with a caramel and brown sugar aftertaste. The nut brown ale is a major improvement from its old location. A little more maltier than the past recipe. The campground uses this beer with their fish fry. Definitely worth trying.
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Decent brew. Pours beautifully with a light brown body and big fluffy almond coloured head. soft sweetness and nutty character all the way through. Aroma is sweet, taste is of honey roasted peanuts and apples.
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;"Clear mahoganey brown color; red hints. Minimal creamy off-white head. Fruity chocolate aroma. Flavorï¿½ nutty malt, chocolate, dark berries. A bit thin and the berries give it a slightly sour finish. But overall, not too bad."
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Reddish brown body under a light tan head. Aroma of dark caramel malt, milk chocolate, and a touch of nuttiness. It was rather thin and watery and lacking in any real depth but wasnï¿½t awful, either.
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Very dark brown body. Not much in the way of carbonation or red coloring. The head is thin and slightly khaki. The armoa is typical with caramel and a dose of chocolate. There is also some hints of wood. The taste is old dry wood with a little bit of day old coffee. There is also some very subtle note of chocolate, but it is overwhelmed by the wood and old coffee. Bad finish.
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with hopdog, thanks Steve!) Not much going on with this beer, not much flavor for a nut brown, and what flavor there is isnï¿½t especially pleasing. Moderate sweetness, chocolaty and light toasty maltiness, and by the power of suggestion, I think I detect a hint of nuttiness. A bit more nutty in the nose, but again, Iï¿½m getting mostly sweet chocolate. The body is way too thin for the style, bordering on watery, especially in the finish. Light-medium brown body is capped by a standard size off-white head that settles to a wide ring, leaving bits and pieces of lace on the glass. Much better than the other LogJam beers Iï¿½ve had, but thatï¿½s not saying much. Even though this one is palatable, I still wonï¿½t drink it again because itï¿½s below average for the style.
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;The best of the LogJam bunch (but youï¿½ll note my rating is mediocre), this has a nice pour, a reddish brown color with a bubbly (if short lasting) light tan head. The aroma is a caramel malt, slightly nutty, with a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel is LogJamï¿½s signature Watery. The flavor is a thin, sweet maltiness with some chocolate and vanilla, sadly bereft of any hop presence. The finish is water. Thanks & a tip oï¿½ a tree to El_Borracho and RAYBOY01.
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Finally a beer by these guys that is not like the other three they have available by the bottle. Has a good dark brown body and pretty good malt aroma. Flavors of nuts, malts, roasts, and caramel are present. This is a beer that I might want to revisite on my next trip up to the land of cheese.
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;I feel I must pay tribute to new Ratebeerian and most recent new member of The League of Strange Beer Drinkers, El_ Borracho, who went well beyond the call of duty when asked to bring back a few beers from his last trip to the northwoods, and came back with 18 sixers of various brews from northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. The LoSBD is in your debt...a debt we may never be able to fully repay! A surprisingly drinkable brown from this brewery and easily their best brew. Some sweet roasted malt flavor and a hint of nuttiness. Perhaps a touch of vanilla as well. But quite thin and watery and basically insubstantial.
LogJam Nut Brown Ale;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Poured a medium to deeper brownish color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of nuts, toasted and roasted malts. Tastes of bread, nuts and light toffee. Watery body.
Thisted Limfjords Porter;Thisted, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Thisted Bryghus;0,33 l. Bottle. Dark color with light brown head. Dark malt and coffee aroma. Chocolate, coffee and bitter taste.
Thisted Porse Guld;Thisted, Denmark;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Thisted Bryghus;"02-11-2018; bottle; at home (bought at an unknown location). The looks of the beer are simple. Golden yellow, very pale and on top a soft white layer of foam that collapses quickly. Not a lot of bubbles can be seen in the beer. The beer is pretty clear. So not to special. The beer has a simple aroma. Hops are just giving some rather ready touches. Not bad, but simple. The hops are quite nice. They give some herbal aromas and some nutty touches. It reminds me a bit of the German Warsteiner and Jever beers. I like this. It gives the beer something interesting. Without it it would have been a very plain lager. Now it has something to it. Yeast aromas aunt strong. In the distance there might be some fruity esters which are nice. The taste of the beer is average. It is a bit mild. Some sweet malts, bitter hops and a slight sour note of yeast in a far distance. The nutty flavour gives something extra. It is rather nice. I like it. The palate of the beer is fine. Rather light body, slightly sticky texture, but also rather thin and high carbonation. The finish isn't bad. It has some alcohol in it, these nutty notes and a fruity yeast ester. Quite nice. I even think that the finish of the beer might just be the best part of it."
Thisted Porse Guld;Thisted, Denmark;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Thisted Bryghus;Bottle, kept in my beer cellar for two years, as I was nearly sure I had rated the beer before. Pours clear golden with stable white head. Clear aroma of yeast and malt, with notes of hops. Bitterish flavour of hops, with sweetish notes of yeast and some malty and citric touches. Hints of herbs, probably bog myrtle. Estery aftertaste with mild notes of malt and acidic hints. Well, not that bad for the style but not quite my favourite beer.
Thisted Porse Guld;Thisted, Denmark;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Thisted Bryghus;On bottle @Skaal. Pours clear golden, with small foam. The scent is lightly bitter - ginger? The taste is weak, watery texture - pilsner like, not as crispy though.

Thisted Thy Pilsner;Thisted, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thisted Bryghus;Bottle (from random grocery store). Pours golden. Aroma and flavor are hoppy, grainy, malty, some fruits. Overall: drinkable, not bad for macro lager.

Thisted Thy Pilsner;Thisted, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thisted Bryghus;Sampled on draught at the Jernbanecafeen with Jan Magnus in Copenhagen. A lightish Pilsner-style beer with very little character. Rather thin and watery with little hop taste. OK, but not great. Not as interesting as the clientele of the cafe.

Thisted Lys Thy;Thisted, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Thisted Bryghus;Light golden with a nice head. The aroma has notes of malt and metal, and I find the same notes in the flavour. The metallic notes disturbs the experience on my behalf...
Thisted Lys Thy;Thisted, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Thisted Bryghus;Yellow with an average fizzy white head. Aroma is maltish and hoppish. Flavour is waterish, bit hoppy and a little maltiness. An ok tasting light beer.

Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Aroma and flavor is medium wheat, spices and a hint of bananas. It was very drinkable and smooth but it was not anywhere close to being a hefeweizen.
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Its been a while since I had this. Based of some previous notes I had It poured cloudy amber with a white head. Aroma of wheat and spices. Taste of yeast, grain and spice
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);My tasting notes from 2001. Bottle from Michelob Holiday Mix-pack. Poured a mostly clear golden color with thin head which dissipated quickly, no lace. Not cloudy as a hefeweizen should be. Slight yeast aromas but nowhere near enough pepper, clove and banana. I can taste mild malt and some muted wheat, but the impression is pretty similar to every other over-carbonated, over-processed, metallic-tasting Anheuser Busch brew. Not true-to-style.
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Hefeweizen Wheat Ale--1998 12 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV. (2.25 / 5.0) Light bodied and over carbonated at first. Mildly flavorful with Wheat bouquet.
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"The only reason to drink a beer of this class is... actually there is no reason to drink this beer. I am tired of people saying things like ""I like the price on the shelf in times like these"". If you cant find a better beer for only one dollar more in any local store/bar, the problem is no longer the quality of this beer... its YOU."
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);i think i got a bad bottle on this one. tasted so bitter that i was craving saltwater. the carbonation was like putting 5 mentos in my mouth with a swig of 7 up. happy retirement.
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);All I can say is that this was one of the worst hefeweizenï¿½s I have ever had. Thank you AB for retiring this worthless brew.
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Kudos for this effort...not a grea beer by any means, but at least they try. Just not enough body or full flavor to consider this a good brew. The really only time I have been in disagreement with Michael Jackson.
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I was reviewing old family videoï¿½s recently when I saw that I had gotten a Mic variety pack for Christmas ï¿½01ï¿½ with this beer in it. I remember enjoying this one. I added a lemon to it and it did help.
Michelob Hefeweizen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I thought this was a decent kristall hefe with allot of the usual characters in a German wheat beer. Page 314 of Michael Jacksonï¿½s Great Beer Guide and 165 of his Classic Brews to go.
Hacker-Pschorr Kristall Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Sweet citrusy aroma Light white head that dissipates quickly Milky amber color Slightly smooth but bright citrus taste Little to no aftertaste ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Hacker-Pschorr Kristall Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);From Oct 2007 This pours from 500ml bottle a slightly hazy medium gold with a large thick head of foam that shrinks to almost a solid fine layer and it has plenty of lacing. The smell is of wheat, banana, and other fruit. The taste has notes of wheat, banana, clove, fruit, and right near the finish, it has a real earthy taste to it. The body is medium light and the carbonation is medium. Good tasting and very drinkable Weizen and one that I'd buy again. I see on the label that it says produced on 04.06 April 06 or June 04? I doubt the latter as this tastes reasonably fresh to me.
Hacker-Pschorr Kristall Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Pours a nice golden yellow. Aromas of of citrus, fruit, and a little yeasty. Flavor is crips, almost pilsner like. A little hops at the end.
Hacker-Pschorr Kristall Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500 ml bottle.

Clear golden color, medium sized white head that lasts for quite a long time. Smell and taste wheat, yeast, lightly sweet, a hint of orangepeel in the distance. Suitable soft mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Not bad.
Hacker-Pschorr Kristall Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);"Awesome head typical of a well made weiss. Cloudy orange-amber color. Leaves a touch of lace on the glass. This has a very clean smell. There are some notes of lemon and orange zest as well as all spice and nutmeg. The wheat aroma predominates throughout. Strong orange flavors appear in the wheat taste. There are anise like touches while hold the liquid in the mouth. Not as sour as some wheats. And I would describe the flavor as slightly muted compared to other ""louder"" weiss beers. This is a full bodied beer with a high level of carbonation. All in all a very clean and refreshing wheat beer."

Hacker-Pschorr Kristall Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Clear golden, nice foamy head, good lacing, wheat and yeast nose, banana, hint of clove, bread, dough, citrus, sweet fruity taste with spicy notes, light body, mild malty finish with hints of sourness, crisp and refreshing
Hacker-Pschorr Kristall Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500 ml bottle. Paid 6.60 U. S for a six pack. The mug showed thick, full, lasting head on top of a Hazy, golden color. Very nice Presentation.ï¿½ Nose and taste is traditional to the style. The taste is well above average for a Kristall. Decent wheat yeast, banana and a mild clove note. A bit more malt then I was expecting for such a light style. The body feels heavier then it really is. Drinks really well for me. Finish is short and clean. Damn nice flavors for a bottle. Thisï¿½is fresh with question.
Hacker-Pschorr Kristall Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Comes out of the tap a hazy honey golden with a fine-bubbled eggshell head that leaves some good lacing. Wheaty, yeasty aroma has a strong citrus overtone and is quite inviting. Wheaty flavor has a strong lemony note, more sweet than sour, and a yeasty underpinning. Overall it is quite refreshing, perfect for a sweltering summer day. Fizzy texture has average body and leaves a wheaty and fairly tingly finish. Prosit!
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;This bottle is from the time it was being brewed in Monterey County, CA. Pours orange tinged gold with a small white head. Smells a bit fruity over pale malt. Medium body with mild carbonation. Flavor is a bit bready, and the hop is rather fruity. Better than many. Clear bottle, but it had been stored in a dark room, and it wasnï¿½t skunked at all.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Pours a hazy light golden yellow. Aromas of straw/grass/hops. Flavors of light fruitiness, caramel malts, mellow hop finish.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Lots of sediment in the bottle, so I poured carefully to keep the beer clean. There is alarge white head with a light gold body. The aroam is old apples and sweat socks. There are also some carrots and celery in the aroma. The taste is honey with some light corn and grass. This is decent. After rating, I poured the rest of the bottle and the floating material broke up and just caused a little cloudiness in the glass. It did not seem to affect the beer in any noticeable way.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Thanks to obeygiant for this. I didnï¿½t like this one. Some hopcit in aroma and taste, and slightly better than BMC swill, but I wouldnï¿½t drink this again. In the words of Dr. Seuss, I drank this to increase my ratings, wouldnï¿½t drink it again if I was dehydratings.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;12.20.02 12oz clear bottle. Pour looks the same in the glass as in the bottle. No head. Aromas of straw and raw grain. Sweet and corny like MGD, looks a bit like MGD, is it? Good beer to buy on sale and give to beer thieves at parties.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;"(12 oz bottle) Mildly flavorful for a pale lager, but still nothing worth a damn here; Quite sweet and mild corn flavor ""dominates"" because there is very little hops presence or bitterness; The finish is extremely weak like a light beer; Mildly malty nose, but mostly just a corn aroma; Yellow color and slightly cloudy from fine sediment; Pours a fairly large head, but the fizzing is like a Coke and disappears to nothing about as quickly"
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Well, this is definately the best looking lager I have experienced. Thatï¿½s a good start, it pours off a hazy gold color, large head initially that dissipates down to a mere skim but that sticks around throughout. detect some malts and hops in the aroma, though not strong. Very very smooth mouthfeel, wow, thatï¿½s good. Flavor is a little vague, should be a bit more immediate but aftertaste is what one should savor with this beer. Great lager from a great brewery.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;bad orange yellow color. Smells like corn and fermentted fruit cocktail. Horrid taste, nearly spit it up, i expect better from spanish peaks, 2nd taste, this is still god awful.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Nice golden color,small white head that faded fast.The aroma was lightly malty hoppy and a slight citrus like apperance as well.The taste was mild at best,malty sweet taste,lemon grass and mild hops with the finish being light and highly drinkable.This is nothing special but would still make a decent hot mowing day brew.Mine seemed to be fairly decent but some others have stated a slight skunk to there brew.Not the case here,it was quite decent at the tasting.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Lager;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;I hate clear bottles. Also- there was almost no head. Flavor was slightly watery with some maltiness to it without too much presence of hops. Overall, I didnt like this beer too much , but it did have a nice malty aroma to it- kinda like sticking your head in a big 25 kg bag of marris otter.
Albani Odense Classic;Faxe, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Royal Unibrew;This pilsner type beer has a more intense, maltey taste than the original pilsner this company produces. The corn is stated in the ingredients, which gives it a tiny, specific bitter aftertaste. Not a strong smell, not very hopped. I would classify it as simple and easygoing, but still pretty enjoyable due to the corn-barley taste.
Albani Odense Lager;Odense, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Albani Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Odense, DK Bottled. Full bodied with an aroma of wet cellar and caramel malts. Low hoppied at for an Albani
Albani Odense Light;Odense, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Albani Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Odense, DK. Bottled. Thin - a hint of malt but as for Albani products very little hop character
Albani Odense Light;Odense, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Albani Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);(Bottle 33 cl) Pale golden with a small head. This resembles a standard lager in both aroma and looks, but donï¿½t get fooled - this is a watery and thin affair. 240800
Albani Odense Light;Odense, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Albani Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);An orange beer with a small disappearing white head. The aroma is sour and brewmashy - I think both the low alcohol content and the corn used gives it this sourness. The flavor is of corn with a little hint of malt, before a quite bitter, slightly stinging metallic hoppy end sets in. The body is very thin.
Albani Odense Light;Odense, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Albani Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Golden with a short lived head. Weak malt aroma. Watery, with a only a weak cardboard flavour and a hint of something sour.
Albani Odense Pilsner;Faxe, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal Unibrew;Aroma and taste is of hops and malt. A kind og boring pilsner, but when in need of a cold beer, with friends on a hot summer day, Odense will not disappoint.

Albani Odense Extra Light;Odense, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Albani Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Bottle @ fonefan tasting. I must say that this is a foul beer. Thin watery and all malty.

Faxe Fad;Faxe, Denmark;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Royal Unibrew;This beer is too thin and somehow gives the impression of artificial hopping. Not a very nice beer. I donï¿½t like the label either, the all too emphatic lettering seems stuck in the seventies or so. Then again, so do many Danes.
Faxe Classic 1901 Amber;Faxe, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Royal Unibrew;Originally rated February 2005. This Danish Amber Lager poured an nice amber colour but the head did not have much retention. Carbonation was medium and some lacing was left on the glass. Slight aromas of sweet malt.

Faxe Classic 1901 Amber;Faxe, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Royal Unibrew;500ml Can: Poured a clear and light amber color beer with a big white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of nutty malt is the only noticeable thing. Taste of lightly sweet nutty malt with a clear finish which very little or no hops included in this beer. Overall, this is a bland and boring but refreshing Vienna.
Faxe Classic 1901 Amber;Faxe, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Royal Unibrew;Old notes: Plain taste of lager beer, just sweeter and with a little more hops in the finish, but that is typical for Faxe, who in my opinion brews the best commercial danish beers. Maybe a little spicy too. Actually a fine beer, but not very special.
Fuglsang Pilsner;Haderslev, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bryggeriet S.C. Fuglsang;"10-07-2018; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Hirtshals, Denmark). The looks of the beer are good. Perfect for the style. The beer is a nice golden yellow brew, clear with lovely bubbles floating towards the top. On top of the beer there is a lovely frothy layer of white foam. Foam retention is quite good. The smell of the beer is near non-existent. It is extremely mild. I hardly smell anything at al. There are some herbal hop notes and some touches of malts, but thats about it. The smell isn't unpleasant, it is just so mild there is hardly anything to smell. Should be better. The taste is comparable. Very mild and watery. There are some sweets, but they give a slight adjunct impression instead of maltiness. Slightly dryish rough bitterness. Not very balanced. It is simple and not to good. Palate is below average. Very light body, thin watery texture and medium carbonation. The finish of the beer is short, rough, unbalanced and has some bitterness to it. All in all, not the best beer. I finish it, but I wouldn't order another one. There are plenty of better beers available."

Michelob Golden Draft;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Watery yellow beer with a lot of carbonation. I do have some lacing that seems to hang around a little. A good balance of malt and hops, but somewhat watery. A clean, refreshing taste.
Michelob Golden Draft;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12 ounce can. Pours a very clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is clean with just a touch of malt. The flavor is OK and just like any other mass produced adjunct lager in the world. In any case, it is a lot better than Michelob Golden Draft Light, but it still tastes like Budweiser. So, I did a side by side comparison with Budweiser and indeed, the Michelob Golden does have a slightly thicker mouthfeel to it. It says 4.6 ABV on the Michelob can and 5% ABV on the Bud can, so it seems to me that the percentage of malt to adjunct, in this case corn, must be a bit higher in the Michelob in order to produce the extra body, although that being said, the two beers are extremely similar. If you like Budweiser, give this a try, but if you like Michelob Golden Draft Light, you will not like this.

Pours clear gold with a small, fizzy white head, short retention with spare lacing. Aroma is Pils and grain malt with spicy hops. Flavor is malty, clean character with light hops and bitterness with a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.
Mt. Begbie High Country Kolsch;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Pours a clear pale gold with a frothy white head. Aroma of subtle sruits and some pilsner malts. Taste is bready malts that are soft but attenuated with some fruity sweetness. OVerall this beer is smooth, crisp and sessionable. Havenï¿½t had many Kolschs but this is a classic example of the style.
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;On tap at Mt Begbie, pours a clear golden blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out cereal malt, straw and a touch of sweetness. Flavour is clean and fresh, with sweet cereal malt and straw. Simple and clean, but forgettable.
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;473 ml can poured at home. Day 11 of the Costco beer advent calendar. Pours clear golden with a ring of white head. Not much in terms of smell. Sweetish finish. Pretty simple and bland. Meh.
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;This thing looks like a lager with barely any head and bright copper body. Smells of rotting cabbage and sugar. Flavour is fermented frosted flakes and cream of wheat. Cloying finish. I can't believe how bad this is, I sure hope it isn't skunked as it was bought in a local liquor store. The whole thing just seems off.
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Gold, white head. Nose of dirty socks. Vague boring palate. Beer of the year ? Bullshit
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Drinking from a 650 cl bottle. A sweet honey aroma. The clear yellow beer has a small white head. A nice creamy mouth feel, some bitterness but also the sweetness of honey. Low carbonated
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Aroma is honey, cream, sweet malts, and caramel. Taste is sweet malts, caramel and a somewhat bland bitterness that overall leads to a dry and lightly creamy finish. Appearance is a clear gold with a thin pearl head that retains fairly poorly.
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Tap at last drop Revelstoke. Pale golden, low offwhite head. Straw malt and pleasant cookie dough notes, restained hops. Medium light creamy (yes really) body. Mellow finish. A few citric hops in this and it would be a really great little brew.
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;A fairly simple beer, golden colour with a thin white lace on top. Had a good balance of malt and hops on the nose. Flavour is also good, with the slightly fruity maltiness balanced by just the right amount of bitterness. Finish is crisp, but without much obvious hoppiness. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Thanks to a friend whoï¿½s not on rate beer. This actually sucks. Aromas are some faint grain. Some fruity flavors and then a watery finish. Not good.
Mt. Begbie Cream Ale;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;A pretty boring cream ale. Some slight sweetness thanks Sam for the sample.

Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;"A nice ï¿½8ï¿½; poured well with a nice head and not too much ""smokiness"" but enough to let you know that this is not just a porter. Very cool label, as well."
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;"Cherry brown with very thin, quickly dissipating head. Dominated by sweetness and almost a ""soda"" smoke like beverage taste. Like a mix between flat pepsi and a light smoked porter. Incredibly light roast for a porter of any sort. Blah. Thin."
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Bottle: Poured a light black color porter with a big foamy head with some good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of subtle smoked malt with some roasted malt notes in intriguing but maybe a tad weak. Taste is also dominated by the roasted malt notes with some medium smoky notes. Body is definitely too watery and filtrated for the style with some good carbonation. A good base with some nice characteristics but lacking a bit of power too makes this truly interesting.
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;A beer that I often pass by on the shelf but would do well to revisit. Marked smokey aroma and a coppery-red hue like barbeque sauce. The head disappears too fast and there is no lacing. Perhaps I have served it too cold in the past. I noticed that it tastes much better as it warms, and the aftertaste comes through more. Kids, take it out of the fridge before you drink it. It does make for fine cooler-weather beer.
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Light roast under dry smoky aroma with an underlying nutty sweetness apparent in the aroma. Clear ruby brown body with a low, fizzy, off white head that recedes to ring. Mild smoke and mild roastiness in the flavour but overall this one is very sweet. Medium-light body is somewhat watery in texture despite the sharp, pointy, prickly, fine bubbled carbonation. Bottle sampled with beerbuzzmontreal, ClarkVV, Goldorak, MartinT, muzzlehatch, Olivier_MTL, Rastacouere and Yowie.
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;2004 bottle shared with the Montreal crew on 11/6/05. Pours a clear muted orange-amber with some drab olive-like brown notes as well. Beige head fizzles rapidly to ring, with no lacing. Aroma has your typical smoke and phenols nose, like you get in the Schlenkerlas, though the smoke is dryer, more thin, and not even a tenth as powerful or rich. But itï¿½s there. Some salty, lightly chocolatey roast, no hops or alcohol. In the flavor, the smoke seems fairly tame, only adding a bit of dry charred wood, a hint of smoked gouda and plenty of sweet, creamy sugars, light milk chocolate and a watered down roastiness. Very simple, waxing too sweet, with the smoke character beginning to dry on the finish and then a sudden kick of blandish, almost dirty/earthy yeast. Very loose consistency, thinned out but yet the carbonation is sharp and prickly. Loose texture with a sharp carbonation is about as disconcerting a combination as you can get. Reminds me considerably of Alaskan Smoked Porter. Sanitation and bottling needs work.
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Pours a burgundy brown color with no head. Aroma of band-aids and smoked malt. Flavor of smoked malt with some sweetness and band-aids. Light to medium body with an oily texture and low carbonation.
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;Color located somewhere between red and brown, depending on the light, so it looked a little like cola. Like the stirred cola my mom used to give me when I was sick, because it was just as flat. It lived to itï¿½s name, because you could smell the smoke, it was a mellow, smoked cheese aroma, but it might have been a little past itï¿½s prime, it had a little mediciny twang to it. Rancid macadamia nuts, the kind you get for 6$ form a hotel minibar, it tasted a little overcarbonated (wasnï¿½t expecting this at all) and it was prickly like sour skin milk. Iï¿½d be curious to taste a fresher one, but I wonï¿½t go out of my way for it.
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;22 oz bottle (1 year old) shared with Da Montreal Crew at Fantï¿½mes and More! tasting. No head topping the dark brassy translucent body...lovely smoky-cheesy nose, gouda with hints of molasses, all glopped onto the BBQ for a touch of hickory...body is not up to snuff alas, sour strawberries and liquid smoke, little roasty porter character and a too-thin body, bit lactic with a cheap caramel quality towards the finish...seemed more like a smoked amber to me. Nice try guys, I guess.
Mt. Begbie Ol Woodenhead;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;"The Lure: A smoky earth reveals nutty sweetness when turned. Some fruitiness is provided, and sesame seeds divided in equal parts throughout. Not as raunchy (or rauch-y) as I would have liked. The Festivities: Greasy caramel smoke teasing the roasted malts. Low carbonation offers pointy effervescence which carries salty cubes. All is done carefully but without love; this is too humble of a flavor display for the intricacies which could inhabit it. Transcendence: An overcast sky."
Mt. Begbie Selkirk Cherry Stout;Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Mt. Begbie Brewing Company;On tap at St Augustineï¿½s in Vancouver. A black beer with a bit of pale head and a faint nose of cocoa. Yes, there's a fruity note up front, but I wouldn't have guessed cherry, except for the brewer's notes. The chocolate note is there, but the body is thin, watery and unsatisfying. 3.1

Lagunitas Olde GnarlyWine;Petaluma, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Bottle shared at Cotteridge Convention 23/06/18. Many thanks! A clear reddy amber coloured pour with a halo of beige head. Aroma is mixed brown malts, amber notes, spicy, floral notes, brown sugars. Flavour is composed of nice medium sweet, nutty and toffee malts, jammy berries. Palate is super sweet, sticky, moderate carbonation, oily, sugary sweet.
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Description = Strong American Ale. Taste = nailed it. Interestingly, where does ï¿½nailed itï¿½ come from. I have my suspicions = Jesus/Kanye?
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Not a bad strong ale. Dark amber brown, has a nice mellow sweetness, some peppery and pine. Tried for the first time in 2011 and only now getting to the rating.
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);bottle - Amber brown pour, aroma of caramel and dark fruit. The flavor is on the sweet side but well hopped enough to keep it from being too sweet. Caramel, a little fruit and some earthy character, some alcohol presence... it's solid.
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);The taste and aroma are powerful but not so strong that it overpowers your taste buds. It's just hoppy enough, and not that flat tasting stout. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);If thereï¿½s one thing that Lagunitas does really well itï¿½s pairing big hops and big malt together. So many of their beers can only be given the catch-all Strong Ale designation, yet theyï¿½re all so unique from one another. Hairy Eyeball, at least in the variant I tried, was a surprisingly approachable West Coast Ale. Yes, this brown-colored brew does have a fruity, floral, and herbaceous hop profile, but I mostly picked up on the malt character. Caramel, succulent dark fruit, and brown sugar. The booze is well-hidden on the palate but puts a little pleasant warmth in the stomach.
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);The appearance includes a medium sized semi-fizzy ivory head that is mostly lasting, mahogany body, slow rising carbonation observed, and a fair amount of lacing. The aroma is toffee, alcohol, dark fruit, earthy, and caramel malt. The flavor presents toffee, alcohol, dark fruit, earthy, sweet, caramel malt, and a semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation with a warming effect. This beer is medium-full bodied. This is another good beer from Lagunitas. It is a tasty sipping beer and very malty tasting. This is a good winter beer that is worth trying and a beer that I would drink again.
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Draft. A- Fruity, caramel.

Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Another strong beer. This one has some very spirit like flavors. Strong with the hops and alcohol. Alcohol comes through. The body is malty with some wood and spice.
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Review is of a bomber about 2 years old. Pours an extremely dark walnut body. Head is beige and 1/5th of an inch. Smell is heavy on toffee, caramel, biscuit malt, and chocolate malt. Smells like somewhere between a bock, dubbel, and barleywine. For 9%, alcohol isnï¿½t very present, neither are hops. Taste is a big malt bomb. Getting some fruity esters similar to a dubbel, but less spice. Caramel, toffee, burnt biscuits and light char take over as beer warms. Alcohol is there but not too overpowering, no hops at all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated with a nice head that stuck around for awhile. Overall this beer was unique and one note at the same time. Got a ton of malt from the beer, yeast strain must have been something Belgian, dont know where else the dried fruit characteristics would come from. Even though it was very sweet and malty I think itï¿½d make a good dessert beer.
Lagunitas The Hairy Eyeball Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);sweet malty caramel and fruity aroma maybe some citrusy and or piney hops evident too but way in second..very nice reddish dark brown clear liquid with filmy off white head some lacing..tastes like it smells sort of a fruity barleywine style maltiness with some tingly hop presence not bad at all..thick and slightly oily on the palate though not sticky with a slightly dry finish that lingers..overall a cross between a strong barleywine and a sweet brown ale with just enough hops good stuff and not expensive either

Valley Forge Stool Pigeon Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Draught @ Brewery: Smelled malty, fruity, and sweet. Poured dark black.

Overall, one of the better beers I have had here in a while.
Valley Forge Stool Pigeon Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Ahh the reason to go to VF.

Valley Forge Stool Pigeon Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Draft at the brewpub over Christmas.

Dense palate, with great balance and complexity. This is a top notch Imperial Stout. My compliments to Michael, the VF brewer.
Valley Forge Stool Pigeon Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valley Forge Brewing Co;On tap @ Valley Forge Brew Pub. Poured a dark black with a reddish hue on the edges when held up to the light. Average to large brown head. Aromas of roasted malts, chocolates, light alcohol and a little smoky.

Valley Forge Stool Pigeon Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Poured an opaque black color with a medium sized tan head that left nice lacing on the glass.

Valley Forge Stool Pigeon Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Re-rate: more of a sweeter malty aroma, jet black in color, beautiful tan head, very powerful malty flavors, the bartender said this beer is now at 9.1% ABV which you could definitely tell the difference, a lot more powerful of a beer, much better imperial stout than before
John Harvards Dry Irish Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the Monroeville Pittsburgh location. Big and black with a reddish tinge. Creamy head that does not fade. Roasty irish stout aroma. Completely flat. Just like the real thing. Taste is roasty and dark. I know this style does not normally have carbonation per se, but I wish it did. Above average for the style.
John Harvards Dry Irish Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Extreme coffe aroma and taste. Roasty flavors. Something was a little odd with this beer. I beleive the brewer added a spice to give it a unique flavor. Not very desirable.
John Harvards Dry Irish Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"July 2005 - Called ""Dublin Black Irish Stout""...Iï¿½m assuming thatï¿½s the same thing. Oh who cares, all their beers stink anyway. Poured dark brown with a fluffy head that lasted throughout (nice lacing, too). The small was coffee...a deep dark roast. The flavor was coffee and nothing else...no complexity at all and kind of overdone on the coffee. No character to this beer at all."
John Harvards Dry Irish Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Cask sample at the Pittsburgh location. Pours flat black with a thin beige head that dissipates quickly. Slippery lacing. Aroma of coffee and malt. Medium, smooth body with a roasted coffee character. Cask-conditioning really brings out the coffee-ness of this Stout. Some malt and hops bitterness are buried in the flavor too. The finish is bitter and roasty and stays with the coffee theme. There really isnï¿½t enough alcohol in this beer to give it a real kick but it is still pretty tasty.
John Harvards Dry Irish Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Nice stout from a local brewery/restaurant that I got on their sampler.

John Harvards Old Willy India Pale Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Cask at the Lake Grove location - since this seems to be a name used at many JH locations, I wonï¿½t bother entering a new Old Willy that is Lake Grove specific (although Iï¿½m fairly certain the recipes are different) - anyway, this beer is cloudy copper out of the cask - itï¿½s got an almost metallic character in the nose that I got past surprisingly quickly - beyond that, some biscuity british malt - this is not nearly as hop-forward as the IPAs they usually make here - instead, the hops add an earthy character to the british maltiness, as well as a moderate fruity character (not citrus, but more of a cherry/ berry flavor) - gets a little coppery/metallic at times, which does diminish enjoyment, but itï¿½s a decent beer.

A hint of resiny aroma as well. Falvour is surprisingly good. (Iï¿½m only surprised because I expected so little from this brewery). Woody flavour with a good amount of resinousness. Very leafy and bitter. Toasty with some sweet caramel maltiness as well, but this one is definitely leaning toward hoppiness Long lingering bitter finish. Solid brew.
John Harvards Old Willy India Pale Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap@John Harvards, Bsoton, Ma. Full on hopleaf flavour, quite earthy. Some sticky pine-sap characters, odd burnt character, quite leafy and floral though, pretty strange.
John Harvards Old Willy India Pale Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);tap @ brewhouse: typical IPA body. Aroma isnï¿½t extremely hoppy, but thereï¿½s enough there. Also fruit, grapefruit and caramel in the aroma. Finishes with some hop bitterness but is also fruity, grapefruity, and of course some caramel there too. Not dominated by hops like most IPAs, but still enjoyable.
John Harvards Old Willy India Pale Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On draught at the Harvard Square location, 5/30/2005. Hazy, chartreuse-orange, with some light ruby highlights and a small, but moderately well-retained light beige head, slight lacing left behind. Aroma of bitter and flavorful hops, caramel, light creamy sugar notes and hints of cherries and oranges. Bits of earthy yeast and leafy, floral hops linger. Flavor is citrusy, and creamy all at once, with a soft, silky palate, medium-full body and juicy hops flavored finish. Amarillo-like hops fruitiness, light acids that are held in check by the ample malt. Crisp finish, very quenching bitterness that is not over-the-top. Rerate. Cambridge location again. Much more watery, less interesting hop complexity. Malt is caramelly-sweet, heavy and simple.

John Harvards Loch Lanier Scottish Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);July 2005 - Dark pour with no head or lacing. Had a rich malty flavor and was pretty sweet. I never would have believed this was a scottish ale. Had a touch of the cough medicine flavor that was present in the awful dunkelweizen. I wouldnï¿½t go back to this one.
John Harvards Loch Lanier Scottish Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sample at the Pittsburgh location. Brownish-amber color with a medium light tan head and thin lacing. Aroma of toasted malt and caramel. Medium-bodied and on the sweet side with earthy malt and chocolate flavoring. Some mild hoppiness is in the background too. The finish is lightly bitter hops and a touch of caramel. Pretty straightforward and good.
John Harvards Loch Lanier Scottish Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);As with all John Harvards beer, I have no idea if this is where it should be, but whatever. Tap at the Lake Grove location. Garnet tinted dark brown beer. Thin tan head. Sweet nutty aroma, dark rye toast, woody Fugglesish aroma and some dusty UK malts as well. Flavour is much fruitier than it probably should be with abundant cherry/berry flavours mixed with the deep dark toffeeish malts. Lingering earthiness with a touch of brown sugar sweetness.
John Harvards Loch Lanier Scottish Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Jeez, John Harvardï¿½s got a crapload of beer. Iï¿½m going with this one since itï¿½s got the most ratings and was only identified as ï¿½Scottish Aleï¿½. Pittsburgh. Clear, dark walnut stain coloring with no head. Dry, cereal malt aroma, which would be fair enough for another style, but the complex aroma is a hallmark of Scottish ales, so dings here. Light creosote and patent malt. Dry, lightly tart. Boring. Medium body. Tartish roast finish with faint chocolate.
John Harvards Loch Lanier Scottish Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Had this one in early 2005 with a colleague from Germany. Poured standard dark brown with red tinted edges. Mouthfeel was thin and the flavor was somewhat sweet with burnt coffee shining through. Iï¿½d have it again, but I wouldnï¿½t seek it out.

John Harvards Wee Heavy;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Growler, courtesy of DYCSoccer17 (Manchester,CT location). Deep garnet pour with a small beige head. Sweet caramel toffee aroma. Some smokiness, and lots of malts. Fairly strong hop presence, still malty and toffee like. Some pipe tobacco. More hops than I like in my Scotch Ales, but a good beer, none the less. Thanks bro.
John Harvards Wee Heavy;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Manchester, CT locale. Sweet aroma with mild caramel hints. Really a small aroma that I would like to be more pronounced. Moderately hazy mahogany colot with a robust yellow/tan head. Sweet, sugary notes to start. Turns quite roasty and chocolately like a scotch ale should be towards the end. I find this quite enjoyable and representative of a good scotch ale. Needs more aroma.
John Harvards Wee Heavy;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"NY location. This beer was sweet, but the body wasn't too heavy or thick with molasses. Brown sugar notes in both the flavor and aroma. Roasty and toasty. The resturant claims that it's ""strong"", but I don't really detect any alcohol presence or anything. Smooth finish."
John Harvards Wee Heavy;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Called Strong Scotch Ale at the New York location, I figured it was the same beer - actually much better than I was expecting - smoked malts and syrup sweetness, mostly - decent body, but thin finish - good, but not something you'll run back for another pint of.
John Harvards Wee Heavy;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);The Wee Heavy tasted like a thick syrup. It's for those of you who like thick malty beers. I'm not a malt person, I'm more for hops so this didn't do it for me, though it was pretty good.
Hancock Sorbits;Skive, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Hancock Bryggerierne;Vintage 2002. Weak pepper mint aroma. Strange flavour with an unpleasant salmiac aftertaste. Chewing gum and beer together is not a very good idea.

Erie Brewing Railbender Ale;Erie, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Erie Brewing Company;Bottle at home. From one of those beers of the month things that my company signed me up for. Poured a dark, almost ruby brown color. Aroma was dark, sweet malts. Flavor was about the same - a touch dryer than many Scottish ales, which made it more palatable than most in the same style.
Erie Brewing Railbender Ale;Erie, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Erie Brewing Company;Appearance: Hazy dark copper. Thin head of tiny white bubbles. Nose: Medium roasted malt. Some caramel and roasted nuts. A touch of hop bitters Taste: medium roasted malt forward. Caramel leading into deeper roasted and earthy tones offset by some herbal hops that donï¿½t mesh well. Body: Lighter for the style. Aggressively carbonated. Parting thoughts: Decent, if slightly below average. Not terribly distinct.

Erie Brewing Mad Anthony's Pale Ale;Erie, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Erie Brewing Company;Pours a hazy amber with a slight white head. Aroma is nice but not exactly representative of an APA. Some citrus, a touch of pine, and malt. Medium mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Flavor is good but again not like an APA. Tea, lemon, and some sweetness. No hop bite to speak of. Not bad...just not an American Pale Ale.

OCCASION: just returned from the Relay For Life event tonight... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky Tavern.. APPEARANCE: strong, effervescent, light golden body... thick, white, crunchy crags of head solidify with resilience... equally thick, equally resilient lacing... beautiful, full rings create a rib cage around the glass... AROMA: punchy watermelon, grapefruit, and some sour elements.... slight bread malts bring some balance to the aroma... PALATE: medium-bodied, slightly acidic impact... long, metallic draw as an aftertaste... TASTE: the pineapple and watermelon are pleasant enough, while the lightly toasted bread balances... some off-color flavors that detract from the experience, and few other dimensions to entice seeking it out... serviceable... OVERALL: the quintessential ""average"" American pale ale... more malt than the average, perhaps, but enough citric hops to make clear its pale ale appellation.... useful, sessionable, and flavorful enough to engage the palate, but blends in among the many other pales offered..."

Looks like itï¿½d be very refreshing on a hot summer day. NOSE- light bitter hop scent a bit grassy. FLAVOR- what youï¿½d expect for a light ale. Slightly bitter at the end of the sip.

New Glarus Spotted Cow;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;New Glarus Brewing Company;A classic delicious Wisconsin beer, maybe my favorite beer. Very nice refreshing ale with bright fruity notes and a decent bitter bite. Perfect with bratwurst during a Packers game!

New Glarus Spotted Cow;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;New Glarus Brewing Company;Great one, Classic, pure style. Pours almost clear bright yellow.

New Glarus Spotted Cow;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;New Glarus Brewing Company;The famous beer of Wisconsin. A wheat beer that has subtle flavors that linger on your tongue.
New Glarus Spotted Cow;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;New Glarus Brewing Company;Aroma: Smooth malt aroma, hints if lemon in the background, a touch of yeast noted as well, and on the edges a light hint of soured milk. Hops are low only providing three brightness lifting the malts but not strong. Appearance: a light blond beer, hazy in appearance with a thick white head that persists. Head retention is strong, the texture is mostly medium to small bubbles. Flavor: Hints of banana, low levels of caramel grin the malts with low levels of crackers and lightly toasted. The hops provide a refreshing crispness to the beer, a low level of lemon and a pleasant level of bitterness towards the back of the palate. Mouthfeel: Medium body, with high carbonation. No alcohol warmth noted, low astringency noted from the bittering hops and a slight carbonic bite almost reminiscent of seltzer water. Overall: A very refreshing, crisp beer. Easy to drink, and very enjoyable. Encourages me to grab a beer after a very hot day.

John Harvard's Pilgrim's Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"Here is the cask-conditioned version of their ""standard"". As a friend of mine said, ""this is closer to a stout"". I agree, this is firmly on the border between the two style. I like the cask version as it is closer to a homebrew with a notable amount of yeast flavor. Lots of black patent malt in the flavor which provides some of the bitterness. The rest comes from some balancing (and peppery) hop. Full-bodied as expected. An easy beer to have a second."
John Harvard's Pilgrim's Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Enjoyed this brew in while touring Harvard Square. Good looking beer, black with amber head. Good lacing. Heavy aroma of coffe. Thick mouth feel with standard coffee and chocolate flavor with the hops coming in at the end.
John Harvard's Pilgrim's Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Iï¿½m 95% sure this was the Porter I sampled at the Wayne, PA location. Black medium bodied with black patent, roast, chocolate malts and additional coffee and bitter finish. Well done porter, hopefully this is a regular in the line-up so I can take a growler home with me.
John Harvard's Pilgrim's Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sampled @ John Harvards Brewhouse with the Mad_Indian.

Pours deep brown almost black with a light red hue, light brown head. Roasted malt aroma, a hint of coffee. Roasted malt flavoured, almost coffee like. Has a minor orange note to it. Chocolate and malty sweet to dry bitterhops finish. Nice.
John Harvard's Pilgrim's Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"This beer had a fairly weak aroma. It had a sourness immediately when it hit the tongue--one might say ""tangy"" as a euphemism. I however am not a fan of the sourness. There is a strong roasted flavour to this beer, with some complexity to the beer. This one is moderately bitter but the hops donï¿½t really stand out, and I donï¿½t taste much malt outside of the roast. The sourness of this beer made it less enjoyable--without it it would be one of the better porters Iï¿½ve had, but as it stands the sourness seriously detracts from my enjoyment of it. From my experience, most of the John Harvards beers share this mild but unpleasant bitterness."
John Harvard's Pilgrim's Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Not bad at all. Nice deep color, aroma, and flavor. Most noticeable are chocolate, roasted malts, and some burnt flavorings, though I could have used a little more bite.
John Harvard's Pilgrim's Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);I enjoyed this one from the local John Harvardï¿½s. Nice dark brown color with a head that wasnï¿½t sustained. Modest burnt taste predominated by the chocolate / coffee undertones. Finished nicely with light hops.
John Harvards Raspberry Red Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the Monroeville location. The bartender said that 42 pounds of raspberries were added to produce a dangerously drinkable and scrumptious fruity delight! Very sweet delicious aroma. Pinkish brown color with very little head, slightly hazy. Sweet, but not syrupy sweet. Just the right amount of fruitiness for a fruit beer. Has some mild building bitterness that builds during the session that detracts from the fruit. Mild creamy carbonation. Mild to medium processed bitterness manifests itself on the palate during the finish.

John Harvards Raspberry Red Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Nice heavy unfiltered appearance with a strawberry amber tint. I was hot to try this wheat beer after the server told me it was only lightly fruited. Well, the raspbery was too strong and disappointed. However, each sip managed to finish with a hefeweizen aftertaste, despite the strong raspbery start to each sip. If only these fruit beer would back off a tad, they might get it right.
John Harvards Raspberry Red Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer pours a moderately dark red-brown color with a small white head.

A bit malty and nutty on the finish.
John Harvards Cask Conditioned Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"Served correctly at just below room temp.

John Harvards Cask Conditioned Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Very very very smooth. No after taste. A very non traditional ale........
John Harvards Cask Conditioned Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);This is perhaps the hardest beer I've ever had to rate. It looked like beer. It kind of smelled like beer. But it didn't have any taste. And aftertaste ... it was devoid of that as well. It was lack a failed homebrew. Served @ 55 degrees (intentionally) to preserve the little bit of taste it had. It reminded me of a very weak 3 day old cup of tea.

One of the better hefes Iï¿½ve had.
John Harvards Hefe-Weizen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sampler @ Framingham brewpub. A beautiful beer, pours with a very nice murky yellow but just a vibrant shade. No clarity at all, looks almost like a concentrated hefe. Thats the best part and it really doesnï¿½t go anywhere good after this. Aroma is high in the spicy character of hefe but is then mixed with a sort of Miller Lite - macro thing. Nothing in there that I usually enjoy in a hefe (not estery enough). Taste is lemon centered with more of that macro-corn flavor. Zingy mouthfeel and a slightly hefty body for a hefe. Ample carbonation, seems to be going in the Blue Moon direction.
John Harvards Hefe-Weizen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);At the Monroeville, PA location. Part of a large sampler.

John Harvards Hefe-Weizen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the Springfield PA location. Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a smaller bubbly white head. Aroma of banana, clove, yeast and some citrus. Flavors of the same. Not a whole lot to say about this one...not one of the better Hefe I have had.
John Harvards Hefe-Weizen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sample at the Pittsburgh location. Surprisingly clear golden color with a medium and frothy white head, and patchy lacing. Aroma of bananas and wheat. Light body with a wheat and yeast flavor, along with some fruit and zesty spice. The finish is midly hoppy with more banana in the aftertaste. Nothing stands out as particularly good or bad about this beer.
John Harvards Hefe-Weizen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Medium-light haziness, medium gold. Good esteric aroma. Prominent banana, lightly sweet, spicy tart. Doesnï¿½t quite all come together. Fizzy. Acidic finish, with a decompressing fruity aftertaste. Not nearly as good as the Penn Brewing Hefe that I had across the river yesterday. Pittsburgh.
John Harvards Hefe-Weizen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Old notes from 7/2/2005 at Framingham locaton. Pours a rather lucid, hay yellow, moderate cloudiness, with a whispy white head consisting of large bubbles, very small and shortlived. Some bubble trails hang on the glass on the way down. Aroma of weak banana, dry clove and mostly just watery sugar. Donï¿½t find any hops in the nose, nor in the flavor. The biggest problem is the large amount of wateriness. Not sure if they are just trying to cater to the bmc crowd with this one, but the body leaves alot to be desired. Other than that, just a standard dry banana and light clove, with light pale malts and a touch of drying wheat. Moderate carbonation of very large bubbles adds further problems to this. More bland as it warms.
John Harvards Hefe-Weizen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Pretty decent Hefe here. A little more yeast than I expected. Banana and clove aroma throughout. Springfield, PA location.
John Harvards Hefe-Weizen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap in Lake Grove, NY. Hazy pale yellow. Light aroma of clove and banana. Flavor same just bigger with some pepper spice on finish.
John Harvards Mid-Winters Strong Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Draught sample, Pittsburgh. Mild fruity notes, dull malt and some sour tanginess, rye. Hazy amber dull with no head. Dull carbonation in watery body. Starts with mild acidity, light fruitiness, and a little rye sweetness. Finish has a bit of sweet maltiness, but little bitterness. Horse stall, hay. Average ale. Hard to believe the abv is as high as 8%.
John Harvards Mid-Winters Strong Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"Had me confused at first, as the Harvards that I was in didn't use the ""Mid"" in front of the name. BIG BEER! This was about as close as you can come to a barleywine without being one. The sweetness steps all over any hops that might be in it. It seemed a bit stronger than the 8% listed, but alchohol wasn't really evident in the nose or taste. If it is really 8%, they should give you glasses bigger than the 10 oz. ones, so you can have a bit more to enjoy!"
John Harvards Mid-Winters Strong Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);What an ale!! Barlywine tasting strong ale. Dark ruby in color, almost no head. Absolutly loved this beer, but than again, im easily pleased. It did have a big malty taste and wow, couldnt belive JH put out something so nice...bout time!
John Harvards Mid-Winters Strong Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);An excellent seasonal strong ale, a burnt hue to the already dark golden/light amber color, very little to no head retention, floral aromas, big malty flavors that were balanced nicely, they certainly didn't have to go out of their way to serve this in a special 10oz glass but evidentially they believe this to be a very strong beer (and I know we've all had bigger), but this was an excellent sipping beer, very good for after my dinner

John Harvards Celtic Strong Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap at JH. Aroma of sweet, bready malt. Flavor adds some nice spicy hop character to the bready malt. Not very complex, but the two simple components are both solid in their own right and work remarkably well together. A pleasant surprise to be sure.
John Harvards Celtic Strong Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Hazy reddish beer with a thin white head. Caramel and toffee-coated nut aroma. Lightly sweet and fruity with some berry and apple. A bit of toffee and caramel/butterscotch. Some honeyed fruitiness. There might be a bit of vanilla and chocolate as well, but the beer is just far too sweet for me.
John Harvards Celtic Strong Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Pint pour @ brewpub. It pours dark enough that one cannot see through it. Its actually a dark reddish-amber color. Has a strong but small head. Aroma is lightly fumy/ashy. with the staple JH mineral and a spritz-y maltiness. A bit of a fruit off-aspect. Taste is similar but a bit wattery. Itï¿½s not malty enough to be an Irish Ale, more like a dark Amber.
John Harvards Celtic Strong Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap @ Lake Grove: This poured a mostly clear chestnut color. The aroma and flavor were pretty much the same. Decent toasty and caramel malt with some mild fruitiness to it. Mildly sweet on the flavor. Light peaty notes. Light to medium bodied.

Blackberries dominated the aroma with a little touch of malt underneath. Good smooth, fruity flavor. You can really taste the blackberries. Mixed well with the maltyness of the beer and left a very pleasant sweet taste.
John Harvards Blackberry Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);A very drinkable fruit beer. I like the blackberrys but it was overdone and didn't mix all the well with the beer. Not bad all and all.
John Harvards Blackberry Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Not a bad beer. Reminded me of Red Stripe w/ fruit juice in it. Actually looked rather sickly and there were very small bits of berries at the bottom of the glass. Interesting but kind of off setting at the same time.

John Harvard's Oktoberfest;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"Pours out a cloudy amber with a decent tan head that fades a small cap. The aroma is slightly metallic and dusty, as it has that characteristic ""old penny"" smell, signifying oxidation. The rest of the aroma is of earthy caramel and muted nuts. The flavour has notes of butterscotch and caramel with a very long toasted nutty finish, mostly almond and praline. There is some bitterness from whatever hops were used (noble?) but the acidity is very low, which is expected. Its pretty drinkable, but what okt isnï¿½t."
John Harvard's Oktoberfest;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);This beer pours a cloudy amber with a head that fades rather quickly. It has an aroma of nuts, yeast, and caramlr hops. As you drink it there is a nice bitter initial taste and it has a good caramel coating in your mouth. The palate is very smooth and has a nutty finish to it. You can really taste the flavor of the nuts for quite some time after you drink it.
John Harvard's Oktoberfest;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the monroeville brewhouse. Mild actoberfest smell, slightly sweet in its own way. Darker than the ubiquitous pale yellow beer, just a little more orangy. Perhaps some ruby colors in there too. Mild carbonation greets the palate. Nearly flat. A rather lighter fest beer for a change. Lacks a lot of the bitterstuff Iï¿½ve been tasting lately that falls in this style. Many of the others come across rather oprressive, almost like a bitter ale. This one is well mannered and enjoyable to the palate. Overall a pretty decent example of the style that can be enjoyed even by lager lovers.

Deep orange-amber coloured beer with a thick off-white head. Deep rich malty aroma, some caramel and toffee with a touch of vanilla and tiny hint of nuttiness in the back.

John Harvards Holiday Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);OK I guess I am the first. A nice spiced ale. Had hints of ginger mixed with this noticibly malty beer. A little sweeter than their other offerings but more than drinkable and with a slight hoppy finish. Not bad.
John Harvards Wayne Export Stout;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;Draught@Cambridge location (Aug 07ï¿½). Looked very nice, pretty deep brown to black (quite hard to tell definite colour as its quite dark in the pub). Lots of nice tarry, roasted malt notes and some chocolatey bitterness. Served a touch to cold i thought, but once i let it warm it got better. Nice stout.
John Harvards Wayne Export Stout;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;"Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Billed as ""XX Export Stout."" Opaque oily dark brown pour with a thick, foamy tan head, lots of coffee, bitter almonds and bitter chocolate in the nose, very strong, coffee and plum in the taste. Strong finish. Another great beer from Harvardï¿½s."
John Harvards Wayne Export Stout;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;On tap in Wayne, PA... Appears pitch black with a dark, caramel brown edge when held to the light. A fizzy cap of dark tan foam quickly fades into a mild cap. Scattered bits of lacing are left around the glass. Smell is of cocoa, mild fruit, yeasty dough, roasted nuts, mild citrus hops, light espresso, cream, & brown sugar Taste is of the mentioned aromas. Nice blending of sweetness and cocoa stand out of the mix. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and running semi-dry in the finish. Really enjoyable...if only it hadnï¿½t taken over 10 minutes to get to me during a relatively slow lunch at the bar. The good news is that the bar guy didnï¿½t let me pay for it.

Waiter said the name was the Export Stout (but Iï¿½m not 100% sure this wasnï¿½t their Irish Stout - it wasnï¿½t on the menu or chalk board and just tapped so I guess Iï¿½ll have to take his word for it). Poured a dark black with brown edges and a small sized off white head. Aromas and tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, and some light coffee. Some lacing left on the glass.

John Harvards Peachtree Honey Wheat;Washington DC, Washington DC, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvards Brewhouse Washington DC;(CapCityOktoberfest04) (DC Location) Cloudy straw body with white head. Aroma is very sweet peach. Taste is medium sweet, peach, some wheat, light berry, no bitterness. Light body. Not bad, and thankfully, not nearly the sweetness the aroma suggests.

New Glarus Uff-da Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;New Glarus Brewing Company;"Got in a trade with The-Adjunct-Hippie. 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 2/19/2017. Pours sightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red, light copper/brown color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, and apple; with lighter notes of nuttiness, roast, toffee, molasses, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roast malts and light earthy hop/fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, and apple; with lighter notes of nuttiness, roast, toffee, molasses, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. herbal/grassy hop and roast bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, dark fruit, nuttiness, toffee, molasses, light chocolate/coffee, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roast malts and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Minimal dryness. Nicely clean on lager flavors, not too fruity/yeasty. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6.7%. Overall this is a very nice traditional bock. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roast malts and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mildly bitter finish. Rich, clean, and complex Dark/Munich malt complexity, with some mild earthy hop balance; and complimenting dark fruity notes. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."
New Glarus Uff-da Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit.Sweet coffee (hints of roast) with fruit and chocolate in the taste.
New Glarus Uff-da Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Another old bottle I have been staring at and not drinking, approximately 10 years old. The aroma is figs/dates, some caramel and hints of coffee and chocolate. Pours very dark, almost black held up to a light. Light tan head fully diminishing and very good lacing. The taste is non-descript, probably umami or sat on it too long :(. The body is medium/light, the texture creamy, the carbonation average and the finish non-descript. I know people love this and I wish I hadnï¿½t sat on it for so long. Still for 10 years in the fridge this has held up very well!
New Glarus Uff-da Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;New Glarus Brewing Company;"I got this in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! This pours a dark brown with reddish hues and a very large head of tannish foam thatï¿½s trying to overflow but...weï¿½ll have none of that! Excellent head retention and plenty of nice lacing. The smell is nice. Iï¿½m getting some biscuit, a touch of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, and some dark fruit. The taste starts of very sweet. The caramel and chocolate and some biscuit are pretty bold up front. Another sip in and thereï¿½s a touch of hop bitterness just before the finish and I can also taste some other bitterness most likely from a dark chocolate influence. This is nice. The body is on the thin side but it seems to be filling for some reason; the carbonation is also light. I donï¿½t notice any of the alcohol until long after the swallow; thatï¿½s when I get a bit of warming. Bottom line: This is quite the tasty Bock. The only ""bad"" thing I can really say about it is that I couldnï¿½t drink more than 1 at a sitting.(see my comment about it being filling)"
New Glarus Uff-da Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Ever since spotted Cow I've been a fan.

New Glarus Uff-da Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Had a pint of this on the brewery tour. Bock is one of my favorite styles.

New Glarus Uff-da Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Thanks Danny Mom! Bocks arenï¿½t always my thing but this is a really nice solid one. Caramel, mild roast. Balanced sweet and bitter. Creamy mouthfeel. Good stuff.

Valley Forge Cranberry Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Unfiltered german wheat that was a hazy gold in the glass. Not much of an aroma to speak about and the flavor was very yeast with almost no fruitiness to it. Very Disappointing.
Valley Forge Cranberry Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Very well crafted, but not my type of beer..................................
Valley Forge Cranberry Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Valley Forge Brewing Co;A very good example of a fruity German style wheat beer, it was unfiltered, a little bit of a purple-ish tint to the color, nice soft lacy head, very cloudy appearance, lots of cranberries in the aroma as well as the flavors, the cranberry flavor was not too overpowering though, all round a great wheat beer
Southampton McSullys Dry Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Southampton Publick House;Almost jet-black with a nice tan head. Awesome strong coffee aroma. Big sweet coffee taste thats mellowed out by the sweet chocolate. Just freakin great dry stout at 4.8%. Very low carbonation.
Southampton McSullys Dry Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Southampton Publick House;Black wiht a thick, brown head. Chocolate, toasted bread, coffee and slight hints of cardboard. Smooth, creamy body. Very light bitterness in the flavor with the right combination of coffee and toast. Tasty, but not the best dry stout I've ever had. The right flavors were there, but maybe I'm a slut for bigger flavors. The low alcohol doesn't bother me, but everything was just a bit diminished.
Southampton McSullys Dry Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Southampton Publick House;Ny biggest complaint about this beer is definetly the low alcohol content. Otherwise, this is a very pleasant stout, much better than Guinness or Murphy's really. Very roasty flavor, nutty and very good dark chocolate present in the flavor/aroma. Smooth and creamy palate. No sour finish like Guinness and some other dry stouts have. Nice!
Southampton McSullys Dry Stout;Southampton, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Southampton Publick House;I have to agree with mittenstein - this is the best dry stout I've ever had. It is a classic. Perfect dark body, though a little lacking in the head department. Roasty nose. Lots of roastiness in the flavor, with some chocolate, but a very slight sweetness. Coffee undertones. Nearly perfect dry finish. Zero bitterness. This was my first sample in this evenings Southampton beer voyage, and it got me off to a great start.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;Tap @ Brewpub one summer. Had this along with the light, was familiar with Anchor at the time so went for this. Flavor had some light malt and a faint bitterness, clean, reminiscent of a pilsner bitterness. Balanced and drinkable and not heavy at all. Wish they would make this again.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;Tap at blind tiger. Pours a ligth amber with a foamy sticky off white head. Aroma of lightly toasted malts, some caramel, ligth toffee, and nice lightly floral and metallicy citrus hops. Good crisp malt flavor- light cookie, caramel, and toast with a good clean bitter finish. Similar to Anchor, but more body, and flavor.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;Draft at SPH - Amber, white creamy head with perfect lacing. Nose was fruity citric-like and slightly peppered. Flavor was well balanced with a nice hop bittereness getting just enough sweet malt to round it off. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, dry finish. Good session ale...
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;Currently on tap at the SPH. Pours a clear medium gold with a medium/large biscuit white head that lasted through most of the glass. Very light aroma of grapefruit and a touch of malt. The flavor is initially a bit malty with some light pine at the finish. As the beer warms, the pine flavor is more pronounced and the finish becomes more bitter. In addition, the bitterness lingers for perhaps 10-15 seconds beyond the swallow, which I wasnï¿½t crazy about. OK, but nothing special.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;On tap at the brewery - a nice idea of a steam beer. Very dry, yet malty flavor and aroma. Brightly flavored. Looked great: yellow body, foamy head. Easy to drink, and went very well with my lunch. The lager qualites really come through on this.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;On tap at the pub - another great session beer from these guys - lively carbonation, woody, spicy and dry throughout - the finish starts dry and hoppy, but then a lasting, gentle, sweet maltiness lingers on the tounge, leaving some nice fruity esters behind it - I could drink this all day long and not get tired of it.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;On tap at HDG. Copper in color with a nice off white head. Fruity and malty aroma. Pine, earthy and citrus hops. Nutty toffee flavor. Citrusy notes. Medium bodied. Finish is dry. Nice beer.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;Poured a copper color with a medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of pine, citrus fruits, grassy hops, toffee, and some light lemongrass. Taste of toffee, was somewhat earthy, with nuts, citrus, and light pine, with a dry finish.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;Tap at SPH. Pale amber colour, thin white head. Earthy hop aroma, maybe goldings or fuggles. Lean malts, a bit grainy. Low esters. As the beer warms the bitterness really kicks up. Well-hopped (tastes like 60 IBUs) but not good hops. Low aroma, kind of harsh and astringent. Not for me at all.
Southampton Steam Beer;Southampton, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Southampton Publick House;Mellow gold color. Subdued fruits and slight bitterness in aroma. Some apples and berries. Taste is hop-centric. Heavy resin notes, light citrus, some grassy-ness. The piney taste isnï¿½t doing it for me. Bitter aftertaste. Dry finish.
Southampton Montauk Light;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southampton Publick House;Your typical adjunct lager taste and smell: rice, corn, grain and grass. A dull but very easy drinker.

Southampton Montauk Light;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southampton Publick House;Quite flavorful for a light beer--very refreshing and drinkable, but definitely not watery and bland. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Southampton Montauk Light;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southampton Publick House;On sample at Southampton publick house. It is a typical pale lager which means watery, sloppy and quite boring. This one however has a bit of taste and is fresh and cool quite enjoyable
Southampton Montauk Light;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southampton Publick House;Light toasted malt. Clean-clear golden in color. Refreshing but super light and still a lager, though one of the better ones Ive had for the style.
Southampton Montauk Light;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southampton Publick House;I donï¿½t like this style of beer at all. But is was offered as part of a sampler beer platter at Southampton PH. Aroma: Malts. Appearance: golden light honey. Taste: malts and simple hops, nicely carbonated. Palate: light, like water. I would drink this over all the other light beers out there, although I am not sure I can tell to much of a difference since I usually stay away from light beers.
Southampton Montauk Light;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southampton Publick House;Tap. Garlic, celery, corn aroma, bright and spritzy and very vegetal. Slightly muddy, flavor has notes of celery. Bleh.
Southampton Montauk Light;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southampton Publick House;Tap at the brewpub: Headless very pale golden color. Adjuncty aroma- ricey with some chicken feed and brewing cereal. Fizzy and vacant feel. Papery flavor with mild corn and sulfuric notes. Hardly hopped at all. Quite macro feeling. Why does a quality brewhouse even bother with something like this? If theyï¿½re looking to cater to the masses their Golden Lager does just that, and that one is a decent offering.
Southampton Montauk Light;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southampton Publick House;Draft. A simple pale lager light malt with a simple hop bitterness with accents of grass and citrus. Simple and plain.
Southampton Golden Lager;Southampton, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Southampton Publick House;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a light golden copper color with a cap of a little white head. Sliding lace. The aroma had some sweet grainy to doughy/breadiness with a light crisp clean grassy hops underneath. The flavor sticks to the sweet portion of the doughy/bready malts and then wraps itself around some light hops to meld into the aftertaste and finish. The feel was light bodied, extremely sessionable, with a crushability able to take down probably four growlers in a session and not feel a thing. Overall, think I liked this one and goes great with brats being shoved down my throat. Make sure that extra spicy mustard is on the brats, because that and this is great going down, but just donï¿½t think about the next day (call your local sewer plant before you go to the toilet, just saying).
Southampton Golden Lager;Southampton, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Southampton Publick House;Light toasted malt aroma. Golden in color with soft white head. Hints of citrus at the begining with a light hop finish.

Southampton Golden Lager;Southampton, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Southampton Publick House;Tap at the brewpub: Light golden pour with great clarity and a white film of head. Clean grainy aroma- some pale Munich malts and dry doughy hints. Crisp feel with a clean flavor. Soft doughy pale German malt sweetness but it remains fairly dry. Mildly hopped but itï¿½s very clean so it makes a decent German session.
Southampton Golden Lager;Southampton, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Southampton Publick House;20080713 Tap at Capones. Fair golden with sticky, lasting white froth. Aroma is biscuity, mildly herbal, diacetyl hints. Body is medium with pleasing eff. Finishes quick and quenching. Nice enough, but the light buttery notes are enough to make it a slight bummer for me.
Southampton Golden Lager;Southampton, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Southampton Publick House;(10/25/08) Draught sample at the brewpub in Southampton. Clear golden color. Buttery aroma with some malt. Sweetish flavor with quite a bit of diacetyl, some malt and a rather dry finish. Quite light in body. Not very good.
Southampton Golden Lager;Southampton, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Southampton Publick House;"4 oz. sample, on tap at the brewpub. Consumed on 7-31-08. Listed variously as ""Southampton Lager"" and ""Southampton Gold"" at the brewpub. Bubbly, pale gold appearance with near-white head. Some lacing on the glass. Buttery aroma with a touch of dry, noble hops in the nose. Buttery, sweet taste of caramel. Interesting flavor and easy to drink. I rather like it. Light to medium body. Creamy with some crispness in the palate."
Southampton Golden Lager;Southampton, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Southampton Publick House;On draft @ Capones with Mad_Indian. Pours clear golden with a fair size white head. Aroma of sweet malts, biscuit, citrus, and grass. The flavor is biscuit, honey, and a grassy finish. Not the best style in the world.
Southampton Golden Lager;Southampton, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Southampton Publick House;On tap at Capones sampled with Stegosaurus. Clear golden pour with a grassy aroma and taste of like a weird herb and bread. EHH it was ok for the style.

Very refreshing and was a lot better then I was hoping for.I should of just stuck with this one instead of branching out.
Southampton West Indies Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Southampton Publick House;Did nothing for me. Soft and creamy, a more interesting mouthfeel than many Pales, but not a lot of flavor, fair hoppiness.
Southampton West Indies Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Southampton Publick House;Cask: Light copper. Fat spongy foam. Diacetyl laden aroma, with some straw, melon, flowers, dough, and vinegar. Soft, filmy palate. Buttery, caramel malt start followed by a metallic tinge and grainy hay notes. Soft barnyard finish accompanied by lemon rind, vinegar, and green apple. A rather hoppy and flavorful Pale Ale.
Southampton West Indies Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Southampton Publick House;"From the Cask -conditioned collection: Too yeasty to be enjoyable. It was served at ""cellar temperature"" which was a little different, but aside from that, it was very vinous, wine-like in its grape-like character. Thank goodness for 4 oz. trial glasses! Soapy looking froth on top of an amber body."
Southampton West Indies Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Southampton Publick House;Cask, at publick house - Cask conditioning made this the most yeasty beer I've ever had, and I'm still not sure if that was a good thing. Nice clarity and head. A good amount of hops for a mere pale ale. This tasted like a liquid loaf of bread...literally, only with some hops thrown in.
Southampton West Indies Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Southampton Publick House;Red or dark copper with big hoppy nose. Hops range from dry and grassy to grapefruity and piney. It's all hops on the tastebuds with no malt to ease the assault. Seemed a bit soapy, too. Very dry end, again gritty.
Southampton West Indies Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Southampton Publick House;Pale golden hue with a short white head. Flavor just not quite right--though mild in flavor, has a cloying sweetness, a touch of butter, and a dry mustiness that I couldn't quite place.
Southampton West Indies Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Southampton Publick House;Thought that the old ale was better. Pale brown color. Some walnut, chestnut flavors, but mostly hoppy with some floral tones.

Cottrell Old Yankee Ale;Pawcatuck, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cottrell Brewing Company;This is a backlog rating fromï¿½2012 from a bottle shared by Tmoney99, fromï¿½notes.ï¿½When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are toasted malts, caramel, mild hops.
Cottrell Old Yankee Ale;Pawcatuck, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cottrell Brewing Company;New England Run Sample #4.. I wasn't feelin' this that much. I see it got some good reviews, but seemed just average to me. We went to a lunch place in Providence where you can bring your own beer (which don't exist where I live), so maybe having this paired with Asian food drinking it out of the bottle wasn't the best idea. But still, I'd figure something would stand out....just eh. Tasted and seemed more like a lager. My next review (Geary's) will describe more of what I was looking for. I may give this a 2nd chance, but probably not unless choices are limited. Btw...beer is expensive up here!
Cottrell Old Yankee Ale;Pawcatuck, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cottrell Brewing Company;Scents of bisquets malt and a little yeast. Pours red brown with slightly off-white head. Substantial persistent head with light lacing. Tastes sharp and dry with a alkaline mouthfeel. Balanced and nice.
Cottrell Old Yankee Ale;Pawcatuck, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cottrell Brewing Company;Brassy body, super poofy nose. Astringent, bitter hop nose and flavor. Out of balance--could use more of a malt backing.
Cottrell Old Yankee Ale;Pawcatuck, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cottrell Brewing Company;Picked this up at the brewery. Pours a clear amber color with a thick, slightly off white head. A minute later itï¿½s gone leaving minimal lacing. Aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate, harvest, and cocoa. Medium bodied. Flavor is of malts, chocolate, caramel, dry hops, and some earthiness. Leaves a roasted, burnt, malt chocolate finish. Meh.
Cottrell Old Yankee Ale;Pawcatuck, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cottrell Brewing Company;Taster pour at Craft Beer Race New Haven. Appearance is hazy light brown (like a cider) with ring of head, mild lacing and sparkle. Aroma is bready malt. Taste is malt dominant biscuit/cracker with some caramel.

Nodding Head Old Willys Ghost;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Nodding Head Brewery;Cask at the Grey Lodge in Phila. Nice solid barley wine. Smooth with a hint of hops.
Nodding Head Old Willys Ghost;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Nodding Head Brewery;Surpisingly light color for a barleywine, some hoppiness, doesn't do a great job masking its alcohol, but its decent none-the-less. Very smooth, and almost buttery, great to keep you warm on a cold night. Sadly, only served in small brandy snifters at the brewpub.
Nodding Head Old Willys Ghost;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Nodding Head Brewery;Typical barleywine for the most part. It might just be me but I'm beginning to notice pretty uncanny similarities in the yeasty flavor of most Philadelphia-based beers.
Nodding Head Old Willys Ghost;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Nodding Head Brewery;Mild hoppiness. Quite smooth, with a deceptively high alcohol content.

Blicks Misty Flips Red Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blicks Brewing Company;Had this beer on 10/23/1998. Color is a dark reddish brown with very low carbonation and no head. Aroma is faint with malty tones. Taste is flat. Starts with a medium body that goes down a bit heavy. The finish is malty with a very light bitterness. There is no carbonation and the malt flavor has an odd roasted taste to it.
Blicks Misty Flips Red Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blicks Brewing Company;Draught. Pours mahagony with a thin off-white head and creamy spotty lacing. Light toasted caramel malt (meal) and yeast (sour horse blanket, sweat) with some faint light cocoa notes. Creamy and tart lightly acidic hoppy malt and yeast (sweat) flavors. Medium and thin moderately acidic palate.
Blicks Misty Flips Red Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blicks Brewing Company;Easter Sunday tasting w/ Ernest, Aubrey and Brian. Dark red. Interesting, somewhat tart nose with hints of caramel and fruit as well as a strange spice element. Sweet caramel, chocolate flavor that remains somewhat tart. Not bad.
Blicks Misty Flips Red Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blicks Brewing Company;Growler. Virtually no head. Body is hazy medium amber. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel), with light notes of cherry, cask wood, allspice, and balsamic vinegar. Flavor is lightly sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. A bit bland, but seemingly has some potential.
Blicks Misty Flips Red Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blicks Brewing Company;Cloudy red brown, no head. Caramel, sugary aroma. Slightly sour taste, like unripe green apples almost. Medium sour finish, slight bitter notes. Body could use a lot more maltiness.
Blicks Misty Flips Red Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blicks Brewing Company;"Murky burgundy-brown. Light body; pretty easy to drink. Malt flavors have notes of powdery caramel, cookie dough, and a hint of sugar water. Curious element of cinnamon. Fruity notes of grannysmith apples, grapes and pears. Pinch of vinegar. Nice level of sourness, adding an element of interest. In that respect, itï¿½s kind of like a ""mini"" La Folie. Pretty good stuff."
Blicks Misty Flips Red Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blicks Brewing Company;This was a very crisp ale wit a delightful fruit twist. A carefree tang tickles the tongue on the way to a smooth finish. Very reminiscient of Rodenbach Grand Cru, though not quite as good.
Quilmes Cristal;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Thuis uit een flesje. Helder geel, wit schuim. Fris pilsje, mis een goede bitterheid, nasmaak is er nauwelijks.

Wolaver's India Pale Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;IPA;Otter Creek Brewing;Pours a hazy gold with a fluffy white head which lingered.......aroma of maltiness.....taste is mild grassy notes, maltiness, bittering in the end which lingers. A fair example of a British IPA more so than an American and definitely not a West Coast. Decent for the style.
Wolaver's India Pale Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;IPA;Otter Creek Brewing;amber-orange, hazy with fine particulate sediment floating around. Yellow condensed-milk head, medium fine with moderate-slow rate of decay. Aroma is bready caramel, earthy, leafy pine forest, rye bread. Iï¿½m going to pretend this is a pale ale and not an IPA. Body is medium, syrupy, somewhat oily. Carbonation is fat, light intensity, with light, tingly burn. Flavor is a bitter sour dough bread, bitterness is slightly metallic. There is a hint of tart orange with lemon in there. Bitterness lingers a bit, not overwhelming. Overall, a disappointing IPA. I wish I hadnï¿½t gotten this one.

Olands Export Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);May just be a maritimer opinion, but definitely the best beer Iï¿½ve ever drank

Long Trail Tram Ale;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Long Trail Brewery;Greatest thing known to Jay Peak. Thereï¿½s no mountain without the TRAM!
Long Trail Tram Ale;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Long Trail Brewery;"Poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a ruddy burnt amber color with a slim transparency about it. Carbonation can be seen rising at a moderate pace. Slim fingerï¿½s worth of white foamy head dissipated at a nice pace. Messy lacing. The smell started off with some German yeasty breadiness (kinda like an altbier), but wait, then thereï¿½s some diacetyl, hmmmm...intentional? Me, Iï¿½m not so sure. The taste still had that dry German yeasty/bready sweetness like an altbier. Sweet earthy/herbal/bready aftertaste. Wet sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability to it. Dry to sweet yeasty/bready malts hit my palate. Overall, hard to really rate with what Iï¿½m assuming some age to it. But this will stand for now and Iï¿½ll give it a ""holler at"" next ski season."
Long Trail Tram Ale;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Long Trail Brewery;Bottle. Pours amber with an off white head. Light sweet malts, grain, and faint earthy hops. Mild, balanced, inoffensive, drinkable.
Long Trail Tram Ale;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Long Trail Brewery;From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped 01/08/14-3353-B. The pour is a good looking amber brown color with a quick lasting off-white head. Aroma of muted of caramel malts and earthy hops. Pretty basic for the style. The body is is light to medium with a level of acidity. The taste is pretty basic with caramel malt characters and a moderate hop finish. This is one of those beers that is brewed by Long Trail (I suspect) to make people think they are getting something unique while visiting the Jay Peak Ski Area. There is nothing wrong with that. But it is very typical for the style.
Long Trail Tram Ale;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Long Trail Brewery;Pours deep mahogany into a shaker.

Church Brew Playoff Lagr;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Church Brew Works;Going through old ratings. A light czech lage. A little bit of a hop flavor, but is mostly a poor pilsner. A little to sharp with a bad aftertaste
Church Brew Playoff Lagr;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Church Brew Works;This beer is now known simply as their Czech Lager. Very hoppy. Almost too much at first. It mellows w/ several sips but not something I'd order again.
Church Brew Playoff Lagr;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Church Brew Works;I should give it high points just for the name of it. It's a Czech Style Pilsner, so its inspired by Jaromir Jagr (who is Czech). I thought it was a bit too hoppy though it is light in color.

Aromas of sherry, carmel, molasses and figs. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a warming finish. Flavors of carmel, fig, molasses and toffee with a smooth warming lingering bittersweet finish.
Wild River Cave Bear Barley Wine;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild River Brewing Company;This was quite different than what I was expecting. Not a NW style barleywine at all. This was thick and syrupy and cloying and did not have an enjoyable mouthfeel at all. On the positive side, it did have some light complexity, among all that I just described, there were some decent flavors of spice and dark fruits, but alot of that gets washed out by the aclohol. Almost tastes aged, at times it has that past its prime vinousity.
Wild River Cave Bear Barley Wine;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild River Brewing Company;Brown/mahogany with sparse head and lacing. Sweet caramel aromas with raisins or figs. Candy like aromas come out with gummi bears and bubblegum. Bitter hops with some citrus. Flavors are sweet and bitter with figs and caramel. Lots of flavors. Gummibears with some alcohol and spice. Very sweet. Thick and cloying finishing with a bitter kick of malt and alcohol.
Wild River Cave Bear Barley Wine;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild River Brewing Company;Sampled draught at Wild River Pub, Grantï¿½s PassAmber color, light head. Nose is hot with a distinct ethyl alcohol bite. The taste is sweet though, mild hops, massive alcohol. Not very balanced & lots of flaws. Barleywine for sure but finishes even a bit vinous.
Wild River Cave Bear Barley Wine;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild River Brewing Company;"It's a shame to call this a ""beer"" -- it's almost a food group in and of itself. Only available in the dead of winter at this small brew pub in southern Oregon, it's worth a trip just for a taste. Highly complex -- even a bit more so than Old Nick. Best barley wine I've tasted."
Brew Moon Big Bad Brown;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Brown Ale;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;Well balanced with lots of hop flavor - nice aroma and appearance...........
Brew Moon Big Bad Brown;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Brown Ale;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;(Sampled at King of Prussia, PA) Plenty of flavor and nicely balanced. Nice toasty malt flavors, and medium hop flavor. Very easy drinking. Good brown coloring. Short head.
Brew Moon Gravitator Double Bock;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;Blech. Weirdly salty, and sour. Like medium-bodied, beer flavored pickle juice. Couldn't stand more than 4-5 sips - that was enough to convince me I wasn't hallucinating about that flavor. Each sip made my face contort. (from King of Prussia, PA locale)
Heilemans Old Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Draft at Wrigley Field. Your typical gahbage AAL. Clear yellow gold with a fading white head. Aroma is grainy with chemicals. Flavor is grainy with chemicals, slightly sweet. Light and fizzy. If this is old style, then unlike Romey Rome, I'm from the new school.
Heilemans Old Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Found from can. Almost not even worth rating. A very unpleasant pungent smell with a taste to match. The aftertaste is even worse and hangs on for way too long.
Heilemans Old Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Not a bad beer at all this at a local shop here in Tennessee decided to give it a shot. Smell of fine barley and a hint of cereal. Taste like a beer my grandpa would have been pround of. I don't care for fancy beers that cost 13.99 for a 6 pack and has orange slice mangos in it, if you enjoy these please send your man card in. But anyways for what it is; it's not bad, I would recommend and drink it again alot better than bud light. I prefer hamms myself, but this will do and I will enjoy again at a later date. Not bad old style."
Heilemans Old Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Colour...clear gold with no head. Nose...what nose?? Well...a smidge if wet corn and a whisp of cut hay. Palate.. what palate? Well...creamed corn and then itï¿½s gone.
Heilemans Old Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;not sure the knock on this beer. It was the number one beer in the city for a long time for a reason. People seem to brush it off, but Chicago is a city of history and this was it's beer.
Tree Spiced Midwinter Porter;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Tree Brewing;Spiced malt nose. Whatever flavor there may be is covered by the spice, and the alcohol heat

Bear Brewing Rethink Beer;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Bear Brewing;Golden color, pours with a rich and frothy head.Subtle but rich aroma similar in character to wheat beers: a yeasty, alive bouquet, slightly sweet and fruity. Hints of hop. Surprising woodsy character in the taste that yeilds to some bitterness on the back of the palatte. Lingering fruity, herbal aftertaste. There is something medicinal about this beer, with its botanical taste. Highly carbonated.

Cantillon Lou Pepe Gueuze;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Cantillon;750 ml bottle vintage 2003, shared by Werckmeister, many thanks! Pours a clear dark golden with a white head. The aroma is funky, moldy, cellary and lightly cheesy with wood, some green apples, some white grapes and some fruity tartness - very smooth. Medium body with a light to medium acidity and a medium tartness - very well balanced. The flavor starts with some acidic notes, lots of wood, leather, light mildly funky notes, some citric notes, green apples and grape skin. Finishes dry with lots of wood and tart. Overall very smooth with a good complexity. Aroma: 8 Appearance: 4 Taste: 8 Palate: 4 Overall: 17

Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Beer at the hotel bar Port Au Choix NL Mostly clear deep golden almost amber in color with a bubbly off white head that persists. Rich bready malt with a hint of caramel and some earthy light pine hops to counter. This brewery reminds me so much of the 603 Brewery in NH. They make clean beer but its so gateway and mediocre that its hard to enjoy them.
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Sample at the source. Pretty golden color. Subtle aroma. Subtle herb and caramel taste. Mildly interesting.
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;This is our favorite beer from this popular St Johnï¿½s NL Brewery. It has a clean taste, refreshing, no bite, and a lovely amber color. Nice palate, quite drinkable. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Bottle at a brilliant hotel in Port Rexton (the Fishersï¿½ Loft) that will hopefully be allowed to sell the local brews some time soon. Marginally the flabbier of the breweryï¿½s top two ales. Tastes like a beer that wants to be unchained. there is good technique here, just not enough spiky ingredients. I was really not sure what it is trying to be.
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Draft - Caramel and biscuit with a touch of vegetal notes. Clear gold with a rich white head. Light vegetal notes and pale malts.
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;One of the best from Quidi Vidi. Knowing Newfoundlandï¿½s preference for light beers, it makes sense that most of Quidi Vidiï¿½s line up are lagers. But glad theyï¿½ve started to expand into darker beers.
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Appearance: clear pale to medium amber with a short loose foamy ivory head diminishing gradually to nothing, no lacing. (3/5) Aroma: caramel, bready yeast, grassy. (6/10) Taste: moderate sweet, mild bitter. (6/10) Palate: medium body, moderate carbonation, short duration off-dry finish. (3/5) One of their best, second only to their British IPA (which when fresh is in my opinion world-class). This isnï¿½t world-class, by any means, but itï¿½s solid. The malt profile leads the way, but the caramel aromas donï¿½t translate into sickly sweetness, and thereï¿½s appropriate grassy bittering in the finish. I wouldnï¿½t call it my ï¿½go toï¿½ but if faced with the typical choice of local product, this is the one Iï¿½d take. (12/20)
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Aroma of malt and grain, pours a dark amber color with a thin white head. Taste of roasted malt with a light to medium body and a roasted malt finish.
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;341 ml bottle via DB. Pours a light amber with a mid-size white head. Aromas are grainy, vegetal and a little like an empty plastic garbage bag. Tastes are dominated by caramel maltiness but it is dry, not sweet. Medium body and carbonation, short malty finish. I could enjoy one but definitely not a go to.
Quidi Vidi 1892 - Traditional Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;This was wayyyyyyyyyy better than the Iceberg one I tried but still just ho-hum. A copper pour with a thin head. Quite malty, caramel, bread, grains and some light nutiness. I wish it was a bit hoppier to keep it balanced. It has got a nice flavour, I would enjoy it more if the feel was a bit thicker to match the malted goodness.
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;4 or 5 year old bottle courtesy of my dad. I donï¿½t think itï¿½s stood up that well against the test of time. Cream soda body that lacks carbonation. Flat , flat, flat.Cream soda and apples in the nose, with a slight old rotten cherry aroma. Sweet boozeyness fills the mouth, and its only 5%. Avoid this one.
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Wow...How can something with such a powerful aroma have absolutely no taste? This beer looks like a mix of half cream soda and half Alpine. Pinkish brown (is that possible?) in colour with a thin fizzy white head. The aroma is powerful cough syrup and sour cherries, with the tiniest bit of bitter hops. After smelling it, I was bracing myself for a violent cough syrup taste, but no, to my surprise there was no taste at all. Very weak cherry flavour, otherwise bland, maybe a little bitter, but not hop bitter. Very dry palate, not pleasing at all.
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Kriek?????????? My *ss! Cheap light beer with a little bit of cheap cherry extract intended to flavour Gob Stoppers. Very artificial almost cinamin-like cherry flavour. If you made the same mistake as I did and bought two six packs of the stuff without trying it first, and just before taking the ferry from Port aux Basques to North Sydney (so you cannot return it) then you're as foolish as I am.....
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;"tried this awhile ago and I didn't like it. tried it again and I still don't like it. it doesn't taste much like a kriek. style aside, it's too freaking sweet. if they called it ""marachino cherry ale"" I might give it a 1.8"
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;dark orange colour with almost no head, cinamon, cherry icecream-like and unfermented malt in the nose, sweet, buublegum with a terrible, awful finish - what is this ?!?
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;You guys are rough. It's really not such a bad beer, just very average. Some would still find it enjoyable: it's a refreshing strawberry-blonde brew with a hint of Frangelico or amaretto notes. Unimpressive, but what do you expect from Newfies?
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Hazy, sparkling yellow color. Sweet marschino cherry/cream soda aroma. Artificial candy cherry flavors, faint hop bite. Very dry and overall, just not very appetizing. But hey, my girlfriend might dig it, she can have th second one.
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Egad! this beer taste a bit like bubble gum meets flat Molson Dry beer...not very original, lacks real punch and way too much fuzz...most likely to be found at stag parties in Nfld
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Puke. Cream soda at the beginning. It tastes like someone took very bad beer with no taste or mouth feel (say, Coor's Light, with all the flavour taken out) and then tossed in a dash of vile syrup.
Quidi Vidi Kriek;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;"They cannot possibly intend it to taste like this. Colour: pale, unexciting; Nose: like cream soda Flavour: awful. sickly sweet, cream soda again, and the fruit (if you can call it that) completely clashes with the cheap, grainy lager; Palate: sickly sweet, thick, syrupy, overcarbonated Overall: One of the world's worst beers. Try it side-by-side with its evil twin Magus Mary from Estonia - same awful concept, same awful result, two very different places."
Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Beer at the hotel bar Port Au Choix NL Mostly clear deep yellow color with a frothy white head that persists. Bready lightly fruity maltiness with bits of floral and earthy hops to counter. Not too bad.
Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Bottle at The Crow's Nest. Clear golden color white edge head. Aroma of light cereal. Taste is light light lager. Fortunately Joy's stories about the role of the pub during the Second World War, and the massive collection of memorabilia it houses, took my mind off this beer.
Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;341 ml bottle. Pours a clear gold with a large but short-lived, large-bubbled white head. Aromas were a little odd. I said fresh peas and my wife said apple juice. Tastes are malt forward with a lightly sweet grainy bite on the back end. Light body and carbonation with a short finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy
Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Blind tasting at a friendï¿½s home. Fresh bottles. Oh dear. I thought he had poured me a Bud.

Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Bottle - Light corn. Clear gold with a rich white head. Light almost honey like notes and some Apple.
Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Bottle at Fishermanï¿½s Landing Restaurant in Rocky Harbour NFLD. Golden yellow with a white head that disappeared completely. Vaguely creamy mouthfeel. Little to no flavour. Very faint aroma of flowers and honey. Better than Black Horse, but the bar is low.
Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Creamy mouth feel expected from a cream ale but not much on the flavour end. Itï¿½s nothing too special but certainly not terrible.
Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;This is my favourite beer brewed by Quidi Vidi. Pours a golden colour with a small temporary head.

Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Hardly creamy at all. Pours amber. Sweet beer aroma. Mild, sweet flavour. An above average beer.
Quidi Vidi Eric's Cream Ale;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Cream Ale;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Pint at Celtic hearth. Minimal cap on a clear yellow sea of sucky. Aroma of malty cereal. Taste of sugary water.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;"17th Feb 2012: The Cock Hotel, Wellington Shropshire. Hand pulled pint. Amber body with a cream coloured head that stayed the distance. Mixed aroma and taste: blended combination of hops, yeast and malts; just like a beer should I suppose. Each flavour seemed to have equal billing and this made the beer a bit underwhelming at first. I then found a nutty, woody content which I latched onto: this helped me enjoy the beer more as I concentrated on the slightly different tastes Iï¿½d found. Valentines Day beer it may be but my wife would have turned her nose up at it."
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Bottled, Pasteurised, 500ml Dark amber with short lasting head. Malty, caramel beer with some body and a litlle grainy fruitiness. Litle hop character, but reasonable enough. Thank you to my wife who bought it for me, not sure of the sentiment, Get Knotted having more than one meaning.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Bottle 500ml.Bronze in colour,poor head,quite malty,some hops,space dust on the tongue,oh well.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Fairly standard taste. Euroale. More malty than hoppy with touch of acidity in the end.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Amber, clear body. off-white rocky head, fully diminishing, fairly lacing. Hoppy and yeasty (spicy) flavour. Ligtly bitter initial flavour, moderately bitter finish. Long finish.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Flat dark caramel beer with a very strong dryly hopped aroma with a touch of caramel. The flavour is strongly alcoholic and dry. Overall a simplistic dry ale.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Golden hue with virtually no head. Not and caramel nose. Quite highly hopped taste with a mild bitter finish. Crisp dry with a light sparkle. Standard stuff.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Bottle. Amber beer which sits dull and reluctant in the glass. Malty nose. Prickly mouthfeel on the surface - quite dead beneath. Cardboard. Not good at all.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Not a bad beer. A lot of bitterness, maybe too much it seems to outbalance the malt somewhat. Ok but nothing special.
Woods Get Knotted;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woods Brewery;Bottle. Amber, poor white head, low but fine condition. Fruity caramel and flowery hops in the nose, full bodied caramel and toffee with a good level of hop flavour in the mouth. Caramel and delicate hop bitterness in the finish.
Granville Island Emily;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Bought a bottle of this back before I was seriously reviewing beers, it was a very limited release to help the local art school on the same island &#40Granville Island&#41 that the brewery sits on &#40my old alma mater in fact!&#41. Unfortunately the beer isnï¿½t anything special, a dark-ish brew with a few unique hints of flavour but not unique enough to be memorable, or to buy a few extra bottles of it.
Granville Island Emily;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Canï¿½t believe that only one other person has rated this beer! Like many of the Granville Island special beers, the Emily is better than most from this brewery but none are outstanding. This one has a decent alt flavor. I sampled it at the Autumn Brewmasterï¿½s festival.

Hansa Pilsener (South Africa);Sandton, South Africa;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);"When I first bought this, I thought ""ha ha, funny"" as Hansa is the second most drunk lager in Norway. Also, the place I was at were sold out of WIndhoek and Castle Lager is close to poison to me. Well, I did have some hopes this would be a proper lager as there wasn't much else going on beer wise. But, the sweet cardboard smell did put me off a bit. First taste, well, like most beers served in RSA it was very cold, so quite refreshing, leagues nicer than Castle, but ah, there it came, that sweet buttery corn. I must say, yes, it does help beers become crisp, as if that is the biggest be all of beers in warm countries, but I find it mildly sickening to be honest. Still, a lot more was had, fun night, good music, and it didn't not give me that dreadful Castle hangover."

Castle Milk Stout;Sandton, South Africa;Stout - Milk / Sweet;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);Sought this out due to a recent Zythophile post. 340ml bottle, 9C. Very dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma of caramel/ butterscotch and heavy roasted malt. Some spices and maybe a little cardboard. 6+ Interesting - a big buttery caramel syrup note but it's really not sweet and the roasted/ burnt notes achieve balance nicely. I'm a sucker for a finish that's different but works. bb 8/19 but seems pretty fresh.

Castle Milk Stout;Sandton, South Africa;Stout - Milk / Sweet;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);Bottle, pours a deep dark brown with a small beige head.

Weyerbacher Wit;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;"Thanks brother Jim for the gift --- dates (?) 04/08/15; 09/08/15 --- Aroma of lemon and orange along with light malt. Cloudy light orange amber color, effervescent white head that disappears like a cola, no lace. Iï¿½d say Iï¿½m a year late on this, as there is little going on here. Light malt, no spice, no carbonation, a little citrus. Doesnï¿½t work. Maybe some other time with a fresh bottle."
Weyerbacher Wit;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Draft at the Lehigh Airport. Bright yellow pour with a thin white head. A light bodied, refreshing take on the style. Mellow yeast profile with just a vague hint of the classic banana, clove, bubblegum flavors. High carbonation. A bit grassy, peppery, crackery, and some minerals and lime. A really great summery quencher.

Weyerbacher Wit;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Pours a hazy straw color with thin white head that mostly disappears. Smells of pepper, lemon, other citrus and a bit of licorice (star anise?). Mouthfeel is a bit thin, there is not much going on in that regard. I really enjoy this beer, I am a bit surprised at the low-ish ratings. It is a solid Witbier, but offers something a bit different. There are more flavors at play than just the usual coriander/lemon/pepper/etc. combo you often get with this style. I am not that familiar with grains of paradise (or star anise), but I really like the refreshing end result. Pretty good stuff.
Weyerbacher Wit;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;A bit surprised by the low ratings. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a thin white head.

Gale's Conquest Ale Masterbrew;Horndean, Hampshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gales;Lucked out and found this lurking at the back of the store. Pours hazy sepia with no head, but this beer is 18 years old. Shy aroma offers - well, a bit of caramel, a bit of wood. Flavor presents roast malt, woody and boozy notes - this probably tasted better when it was fresher. Texture provides OK body and weak fizz. Still, I'm glad I got what just might have been the last bottle in Atlanta.

Gale's Conquest Ale Masterbrew;Horndean, Hampshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gales;"2nd go. The first bottle was a big fail. It pours a hazy orange w with no foam and, duh, no lacing. Age has taken an obvious toll on the beerï¿½s smell and Iï¿½m sure taste. Smell is of vinegar, which isnï¿½t so bad, but thereï¿½s a chemical like aroma that is very off putting. Taste IS better. Loaded with the vinegar sourness, gots some soy, and way way deep in the background, the slightest hint of what this may have tasted like. ..an Old Ale? Light bodied with ""some"" carbonation. I fully blame the crumbly cork for not protecting the contents. :^("
Gale's Conquest Ale Masterbrew;Horndean, Hampshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Gales;bottle @ Sergioï¿½s / Louisville KY --- Garnet color, no head, no lace. Very still brew. Taste is sugary malt that includes dark dried fruit and earthy biscuit as it moves through the palate to a finish that is mostly alcohol. Iï¿½m certain the fact that this was brewed in 2001 puts a damper on its condition today. Fair, not in any way recommendable.

Sherry persists in the first sip. Abundant raisin as well as some apple/pear. A strange leather like flavor appears upon exhalation. Relatively full mouthfeel with no carbonation. Leaves kind of a slick on the palate. An interesting, strange beer. Iï¿½d be interested to have tasted it 7 years ago or so.

Dass das Bier eigentlich von einer belgischen Brauerei kommt und vermutlich in ï¿½gypten unbekannt ist, will ich mal vorlassen -aber das Rezept soll aus ï¿½gypten stammen. Und da ein in der Ukraine gebrautes Heineken auch als hollï¿½ndisches bewertet wurde, werde ich dieses Bier als ï¿½gyptisches zï¿½hlen. Von der CO2-Bilanz ist es sowieso besser so. Jedenfalls wieder ein Land mehr fï¿½r meine Rubbel-Bier-Weltkarte. Es wirkt fast wie ein typisches belgisches Gewï¿½rzbier, wie man es oft zur Weihnachtszeit bekommt, nur mit weniger Alkohol. Die mitgebrauten Datteln und Feigen geben dem ganzen einen angenehmen sï¿½ï¿½en Touch, wodurch der brotige Emmer-Geschmack nicht so stark wirkt. EIgentlich ein ganz gutes Bier.

Upfront hop bitterness with a subtle orange flavor. Clean fermentation character. Full caramel flavor. Finishes dry with a lingering bitterness. Medium-full body with a slight warmth. This beer is good, itï¿½s got flavor and itï¿½s drinkable, however, the hop presence is lacking. There is bitterness and not much else. This beer was well made, good head, no off flavors but it misses the mark on style for a ""California Pale Ale."""
Evans CPA (California Pale Ale);Irvine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Evans Brewing Company;Large bottle consumed on my daughters balcony in Newport Beach on 12th March 2014. Light amber colour with a good, lasting crown of bubbles. The aroma was of mild hop notes and light maltiness, the taste more subtle than robust, and again a gentle blend of hop and malts. fairly smooth feel to the whole thing and I preferred it to most of ï¿½the in your faceï¿½ over hopped brews that seem to be the norm in California.
Evans CPA (California Pale Ale);Irvine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Evans Brewing Company;Rated on 7-05-2009 (Bottle) When poured, this beer forms a medium frothy off-white head that mostly diminished, lots of floaties, cloudy orange golden body, and one ring of lacing. The Aroma is caramel malt, grassy hops and fruity. The Taste is bitter, caramel malt, hoppy, and fruity. The Palate is tingly and this beer is medium bodied. All-in-all, this beer is nothing to get excited about as it lacks good flavor and character and is easily forgettable.
Evans CPA (California Pale Ale);Irvine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Evans Brewing Company;Has one of these while vacationing in Sacramento. Has a golden orange color with a thick white head. Aroma is of hops, malts, and leaves. Tastes the same but not in a good way. The hops donï¿½t have a bitterness or sharpness to them. Itï¿½s a pretty worn down tasting IPA. Leaves a hop finish. No balance to this beer.
Evans CPA (California Pale Ale);Irvine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Evans Brewing Company;Will never order again. Brewmaster sucks. Not sure if this was a bad batch or not. Donï¿½t risk it.

Evans CPA (California Pale Ale);Irvine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Evans Brewing Company;Bottle: light amber with thin white head. Aroma is odd with an allspice and clove note. Flavor follows with a pumpkin pie spiciness and a little caramel. Not a fan, too weird for me.
Evans CPA (California Pale Ale);Irvine, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Evans Brewing Company;Aroma of weak citrus and pines.

Neversink Delicious Brown;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);This is a darkish beer (well I guess brown as in a Brown Ale I'd guess).

Hofbrï¿½u Mï¿½nchner Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hofbrï¿½uhaus Mï¿½nchen;"500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.1%. Murky orange. Banana and wheat aroma. Decent head, OK duration. Medium carbonation. Relatively highly carbonated weissbier, as per the proclaimed ""characterised by its sparkling"" - this combined with lemony hops to give quite a spritzy punch turning into classic tangy creamy, somewhat foamy weissbier banana yeast and rusky wheat. I prefer to let this one stand for a few minutes to take the edge off the carbonation, but regardless this is a very classic-tasting weissbier that fans of the style should appreciate. Flavours are all well-balanced, the texture is good, and all boxes are ticked, so to speak."

Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;Sampled from a bottle this beer poured a black color with a small beige head that faded and left a bit of lacing. The aroma was dry, dusty, roasty and woody. The flavor was dry, woody, roasty and dusty. Long finish. Medium body.
Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;Bottle at home. Dark pour minimal head. Nose is oatmeal, cola, fruity. Tastes of cola, plum, oatmeal, light chocolate. Bitter.
Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;"Has a very dark brown appearance. Pours with hardly any head, as the carbonation is sort of low on this one. Maybe similar to an ""old style porter"". Taste is semi-bitter at the start, but then settles into a sweet, malty, oatmeal aftertaste. I just bought a single of this along with Smuttynose's Robust Porter, and I think I like this one better. The quality and crispness might be a little less on this one, but I liked that flavor better, which is usually more important to me. I would definitely buy a 6'er of this to have another try."
Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;Found in bottle. Beautiful dark appearance. Really well done as it hits many flavors without any being overly dominant. My go to local winter beer but refreshing enough to drink in early fall and spring as well.
Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;Pours a very dark (almost black) amber with a creamy, light-tan head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is of sweet chocolate with hints of caramel. Taste is sweet to start with but then has a slight amount of bitter-sour for the finish, which makes for a nice contrast. The beer has a medium body with a silky texture. A very good Oatmeal Porter.
Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;Very good beer. Rich taste, creamy, hints of chocolate and not too thick - good consistency. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;From Nov 2007 I got this one in a trade with autumnaldave. Thanks Dave! This pours from 12oz bottle a clear dark brown with reddish hues and a 1 finger head of tannish foam with lots of lacing and it shrinks to a fine layer by the end of the session and there's still some lacing. How cool. The smell has strong but nice notes of coffee and chocolate. The taste on first sip brings a big roasted coffee flavour and some nice dark chocolate in the background. Very smooth and thickish mouthfeel to this one and it has a very nice bitter finish from both the coffee flavour and the chocolate. A few more sips in and I'm noticing how I really enjoy this Porter...I'll be sad when my session is done because this certainly is an easy one to kick back. Oh, and when I let a sip sit on my tongue for a bit, I could swear I'm tasting some dark fruit. Delicious. Bottom line: Porters are a *great* style of beer when made properly and this sample from Highland fits the bill nicely!(no pun intended) Thanks again, Dave!
Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Dark brown pour with a thin tan head. Dark chocolate and malt nose. Lightly roasted flavors, creamy chocolate, coffee, toast. Light-medium bodied, silky smooth finish.

Highland Oatmeal Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Highland Brewing Company;Bottle from Harris Teeter, Hampstead, North Carolina. Extremely dark red with a small head. Its dark malts have a small grittiness to them, but no real roasted malts found here. There is a smoothness within its texture.
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 7/27/2017. Pours slightly hazy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pear, citrus peel/zest, pine, toasted bread, light honey/caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pear, citrus peel/zest, pine, toasted bread, light honey/caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel, floral, grassy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pear, citrus peel/zest, pine, toasted bread, light honey/caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.1%. Overall this is a delicious American pale ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and never watery for the ABV. Classic Cascade hop profile on a nice bready malt backbone. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;Another decent brew by Highland. I noticed the lack of hops on this one as well. Had the typical appearance of a pale ale, golden-orange hazy color. Taste was on the sweeter side, sort of like a honey beer with slight hops. Was enjoyable, but a little different than most pale ales. Also noticed the same aftertaste as the highland oatmeal stout. Maybe some kind of extract they use? Tasty and refreshing and worth the try, but will probably move on to other things.
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;Found from bottle at Ingles in Franklin, NC. Enticing appearance. More malt forward than anything else. Good early fall pale ale though.
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours hazy golden orange with a white head. Orange aromas and flavors, with light notes of caramel and resin. Light bodied with average carbonation. This is pleasant and drinkable light style APA, a good choice for summer at 5.2%
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;Picked up a very fresh bottle of this beer, was excited to try another of Highlandï¿½s classic brews, although this one proved to be not as exceptional as some of their more well-known flagships such as the oatmeal porter or IPA. Poured a standard pale copper color, a good bit of fresh lacing, steady thin white foam. Aroma is slightly herbal and definitely has a recognizable Cascade hoppiness, with a slight sweet malty grain contrast. The flavor follows as a simple cascade-centric pale ale profile, but is exceptionally and uniquely crisp and light for the style. Finishes clean with a light bitter grapefruit note. Light-bodied and very refreshing, although it seems to trade away flavor intensity and complexity for drinkability. Enjoyable and is light enough for a casual afternoon, but thereï¿½s not much to sit and savor.
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;Bottle from Crown Wine & Spirits, Cookeville, Tennessee. Golden with a small head. Crisp, with its strength only a factor in giving it a good body, otherwise its taste is a pleasantly hoppy with a gritty edge to it.
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;Kroger bottle. This one better be good. Iï¿½m irritable and could go for a good beer today. Aroma is meh. Light citrus, malt. Flavor is also meh. Very light, watery citrus, honey, roasted malt. Boring.
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;bottled - cloudy golden color. Slight hop and malt aromas. Decent hop flavor.
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;Fairly weak pale, missing much of the sticky, Pacific Northwest Cascade hop loveliness they crow about on the label. Starts almost like a straight golden ale, apple esters and bright, biscuity malt adding a fruity, bread-n-butter front, only to see a mild floral bitterness round out the middle. Finishes dull, the hops adding a touch of piney bitterness but mainly rounding out a middlinï¿½ beer. Textureï¿½s a bit light, nose leans towards bready malt. Makes me appreciate Sierra Nevada Pale Ale all the more.
Highland St. Tereses Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Highland Brewing Company;The aroma is a little hoppy - spruce. Pours a clear light yellow/orange with a small white head mostly diminishing and good lacing. The taste is bitter. The body is light, the texture creamy, the carbonation lively and the finish bitter. A good beer.
Highland Kashmir IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Highland Brewing Company;Yeah, this is an average IPA...nothing really to write home about. Im surprised that there is hardly any aroma. Where's the citrus and pine? I taste it (a little), but I can't smell it. Appearance is the standard light orange color, hardly any head but a little lacing. Probably hopped more like a pale ale, but has some IPA characteristics. Could be the least favorite of the Highlands that I tried, but haven't found one yet that I don't like. I say it's worth the price, but there are better IPAs out there.
Highland Kashmir IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Highland Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Hazy golden amber with a sticky white head. Aromas of floral and citrus hops. Flavors add muted citrus and caramel. Light medium bodied, lingering mild hops finish. Good IPA, if a little understated.
Highland Kashmir IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Highland Brewing Company;Very light IPA smell...taste is like a smooth peppery and flower hops mix...good.... Light bitter on the finish, but not too much...decent IPA...some diversity but not a lot.. unfortunately it just finishes with bitterness and not much flavor...
Highland Kashmir IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Highland Brewing Company;Pours a medium golden amber color. Aromas of citrus and fruit. Flavor is a big hop presence with subtle tastes of fruit and vegetables, then more hops.
Highland Kashmir IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Highland Brewing Company;Bottle split at RBWG ï¿½15 hotel lobby share on the final night, from a bottle shop in Asheville, 21/02/15. Golden with a decent light beige cap. Nose is pale malt, caramel, straw, orange. Taste comprises toasted bread, caramel, orange pith, straw. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close with light hop bitterness. A rather pedestrian IPA which delivers little.
Highland Kashmir IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Highland Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours a golden orange with a white head and aroma of hops and pine. Taste is of hops, pine, resin, malt, and caramel with a bitter finish.

Highland Kashmir IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Highland Brewing Company;12 oz bottle - poured nice light Amber in color with medium head that ended in nice lacing. Good aromas and tastes of hops, malts, citrus and pine. Dry finish with hints of hops and citrus.
Highland Kashmir IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Highland Brewing Company;"Malty. Maybe Iï¿½ve gotten blasted with hops so many times by other IPAs that itï¿½s hard to enjoy the maltier ones. Aroma is nothing to emulate. Very faint hop aroma but itï¿½s mostly dominated by the brand flaky malt bill. Deschutes inversion IPA (although with more hops) has a similar type of aroma--think, total cereal. Taste is brand flakes, vitamins, oats, wheat thins mixed with a hint of honey and earthy hops. Finish is not that bitter. Itï¿½s more of that lingering malt feel you find in wheat beers. Overall, itï¿½s pretty much par for the course in terms of English IPAs--more malt, low hops. ""Ease up on the hops ole chap. We just want to keep it from spoiling not use up the lot."""
Highland Black Mocha Stout;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Flavored;Highland Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle pours a dark brown (nearly black) body with a one to two finger tan head of foam that dissipates quickly and leaves a lacing along the glass. The aroma is roasty with a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin. The taste is also somewhat thin but there are pleasant flavors of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, and a slight hoppy bitterness at the end. Overall, this is a decent stout that isn't overly sweet or artificial-feeling.

Highland Cold Mountain Winter Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Highland Brewing Company;Found on tap at outdoor 76 in Franklin, NC. This was the 2017 version I rated. Really evenly layered spices with a great dark appearance. Wish this was their standard.
Highland Cold Mountain Winter Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Highland Brewing Company;Draft at Craft Brewed. Pours a deep copper with a small bit of creamy head that lingers. Big vanilla forward nose with caramel, nougat and milk chocolate aromas. Smooth on the palate, sweet but not cloying. Vanilla really stands out in the front, but doesn't completely overwhelm. Nice low abv winter beer. Enjoyable.
Highland Cold Mountain Winter Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Highland Brewing Company;From Jun 2007 Obtained in a trade with Brentk56. Thanks a bunch!! To start off, I have the 1L taped swing top bottle ...it's very cool looking. It pours into my New Belgium chalice a very nice amber with a smallish head of foam. It doesn't stick around very long and I'm left with just a ring around the edge of the glass and there's just a tiny bit of lacing. The smell...I'm getting a huge whiff of vanilla, malt, and some other spices. The taste is also very big on the vanilla with a nice burnt caramel malt backing it up. Swishing the Ale in mouth, I get a bit of citrus tartness and some chocolate notes and that has me smacking my mouth. This is a very unusual tasting sample of the style and I'm liking it. The finish is on the bitterish side with flavours of hot cocoa and it leaves a pleasing long lasting aftertaste. I'm not getting too much warming so either the abv is fairly low or it's really well hidden. A *very* nice drop indeed. I'm glad I got this one in the trade. :^)
Highland Cold Mountain Winter Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Other;Highland Brewing Company;Tasted from a 22 oz bottle. Pours the color of a dirty penny.

Evans Honey Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;Tap at Claim Jumper. Poured a clear yellow with a little white head. Little to no lace.

Evans Honey Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;Light in color, small white head with light lacing. Aroma is cereal, bready, light sweetness, though not necessarily distinct honey. Body is light, with crisp carbonation and clean finish.

Not much else to it, however. M: The body is a touch on the thin side with an abundant carbonation which gives the beer an airy feel. D: Even for a blonde ale, this one was pretty bland.

Pours a cloudy yellow color with a very thin white head that does retain but leaves little in the way of lacing. Aroma is very strong of wheat, and smells very similar to a loaf of baked bread. There is also a little hint of something that smells sulfurous with a little bit of clove thrown in there as well. Not getting anything in the way of banana or vanilla. The flavor is much the same as the aroma, with a strong bready wheat presence, light lemon, and a faint flavor reminiscent of ketchup. Mouthfeel is very spritzy, somewhat creamy, and fuller than most wheat beers of this caliber.

Evans Amber Ale;Irvine, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Evans Brewing Company;Like every Bayhawk beer I have had, it has an aroma of butterscotch. It makes you think that it could be possibly be diacetyl. Perhaps the brewer does this on purpose. The appearance is a copper red that it clear with a foamy head. It tastes like caramel malt with a little hop crispness. It is between light and medium bodied and can be used in session drinking. A very average, albeit drinkable ale.

Evans Chocolate Porter;Irvine, California, United States;Porter;Evans Brewing Company;"""two problems with this beer (the second may be a brewery wide issue)...the lack of chocolate in this chocolate porter, and an astringency that just does not work in the style. otherwise, it could have been a nice, roasty, medium bodied porter, but those two issues with the aroma and the flavor just kinda ruined it for me. not impressed with bayhawk so far..."""
Evans Chocolate Porter;Irvine, California, United States;Porter;Evans Brewing Company;Dark brown chocolate body, with foamy, rocky root beer float head. Easy roast, some lactose and sourness and a touch of wood in the bouquet. Again, the lactose and chocolate color with palate along with twinges of sourness and wood.
Evans Chocolate Porter;Irvine, California, United States;Porter;Evans Brewing Company;I get chocolate and sugar in this dark brown brew with an off white head of tiny bubbles. A very tart choc brew with a choc aftertaste. The flavor is so tart it affected my gag reflex. Complete opposite what I was thinkin for a choc porter. No sweetness itï¿½s medium bodied. Itï¿½s a sour beer. No good. Bayhawk, donï¿½t know if u had a bad batch but this needs to be fixed.
Evans Chocolate Porter;Irvine, California, United States;Porter;Evans Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle from brokensail- thanks! I guess. Pours a deep brownish-amber with a finger of beige head that settles down quickly. The aroma is gross- leaves, chocolate and vanilla extract, sugar, and some vomit. Yuck. Flavor of toast, chocolate, dead leaves, earth, tea, and brown sugar. Light-bodied, with a dry, earthy flavor and low carbonation. The sickly sweet, bizarre aroma messes with this porter all the way through- not that the flavor was going to seriously redeem it. Terrible.
Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;"""Pretty tame all around. A hoppy blobdet, which I like, but neither the hop or malt aspect of the beer really stood out. Kind of generic. light citrus (lemon) and grass, and very light wheat(?) flavor and aroma."""
Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;Super light blond beer, on tap in newport beach, a little hoppy but nothing crazy, easy to drink.
Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;From tap at Yards, Pasadena. Pours clear and orange with a lacing white head. Light butterish aroma. Mild spiced and bitter flavour with a distinct butterish base flavour. Ends dry and solid diacetyl. Not good. They got 100 taps going - obviously too many to check daily for quality :(
Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;Draft at Yard House, Pasadena. A light golden beer with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet malty with light notes of citrus as well as a light skunkyness as if too little malt has been used. The flavor is sweet malty with light notes of butter and again a light skunkyness, leading to a dry finish with notes of both straw and the skunky note.
Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;On draft from a buddies keg-o-rator. Clear golden in color, head was very foamy and off white. Nose of spice, banana, and some citrus hops.
Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;On tap at Yard House, poured a clear gold, smallish white head that disappeared quickly, lace formed a velum like sheet. Nose sweet malt, crisp and clean. Start was sweet with malt, slight hop bite at back. Top light to moderate in feel. Finish had a biting acidity, the hops apropos to the style, dry lingering aftertaste, refreshing, but unremarkable.
Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;No real aroma to speak of except a slight diacetyl/butterscotch. Pale yellow gold with a small velvey head. I taste some butterscotch, some corn, some nice sweet malt, and some mild crispness. Pretty thirst quenching and pretty easy to pound. It is funny because every Bayhawk beer I have ever had has smelt and mildly tasted of diacetyl. Perhaps this is their secret to making mildly pleasant beers?
Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;Draught at Yard House. Didnï¿½t order this, tried anothers. Aroma was very light, slight hops and yeast. Taste was decent and easy to drink. Slight bitterness. Not much else going on.

Evans Beach Blonde;Irvine, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Evans Brewing Company;Draught. Clear golden color with bubbly white head that laced the glass. Weak grainy flavor and subtle sprucy hop nose. Decent beer but not much substance.
Evans O.C. Lager;Irvine, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Evans Brewing Company;"Pours dark amber, very clear, with a small head. Aroma shows nice use of Vienna and Crystal malt; good lightly toasted, bready character. Palate is a bit too light, even for the style, finishing quickly. Flavor upfront has toasted notes, complemented by some faint noble hops. Mid-body adds a touch of caramel-maple sweetness before returning to a bittersweet finish."
Evans O.C. Lager;Irvine, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Evans Brewing Company;Sweet grainy and plasticy aroma. Gold in color with a small white head and minimal lacing. Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma. It is crisp and refreshing. Pretty average just like every other Bayhawk beer I have ever had.
Evans O.C. Lager;Irvine, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Evans Brewing Company;Really weird smokey tangerine taste to this cloudy orange, no head beer. It may be one of the fruittiest lagers I have drank (drunk?). Is it supposed to have an orange taste cause it's made in Orange County?
Evans O.C. Lager;Irvine, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Evans Brewing Company;A nice bronze color. Impossible to get any head out of it, despite a hard pour. Smells oddly smoky. An extremely hoppy and flavorful lager. More like a Vienna, perhaps, due to its dark color.
Evans O.C. Lager;Irvine, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Evans Brewing Company;Clean, refreshing palate, shows faint flowery and fruit notes. A touch of orange soda adds a mild sweetness. Not very toasty, but pretty pleasing taste and refreshing.

Not much in the aroma, other than some sweetness and maybe a hint of earth tones. The taste was a bit sweet with some graininess and a bit of hops in the tail.

Wild River Hefe-Weizen;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wild River Brewing Company;This is more of an American style wheat as opposed to German. There was a big lemony aroma, lots of citrus but no hints of yeast. The flavor is really strong on the toasted malts, like a breakfast cereal, no spice, just a hint of bananas, very light, thin and watery. The finish was at least very clean and crisp.

Lemon was served in the glass, but was quickly thrown overboard. This beer was still very lemony, i think partly because of that lemon parasite that was discovered, but also just because of the beer itself. This beer should be put under the American Wheat catagory, cause there was no spiciness to it, very thin and mild wheatiness. Finish was a bit bitter with a light crispness.
Wild River Hefe-Weizen;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wild River Brewing Company;Cloudy, tan bubbly heffe. Citrus, fruit in the nose. Crisp, citrus... lemon flavor cut thin by some wetness. Little mouth texture for a hef. Sour finish.

Poured a very clear golden yellow with a small white head the settled quickly and left moderate lacing. A steady stream of tiny bubbles rose from the bottom of my glass, kind of like champagne.

Wild River Nut Brown Ale;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Wild River Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a dark, transulent red with a giant tan colored head. Lots of sickly sweet caramel aromas with some fruit undertones, as well as some nutty flavors. Taste is roasted malts and the caramel again, with a slightly hoppy finish and some odd, unrecognizeable (rather unpleasant, unnatural) flavors mixed in. What stands out is how watery the whole thing tastes.
Wild River ESB;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wild River Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub in Grants Pass OR. Pour was clear medium amber with little visible carbonation, a decent head and sticky patterns of lacing. Aroma: intersting complex aroma is more fruity than expected.

Wild River ESB;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wild River Brewing Company;12oz bottle from jake65 - thanks, Jake! Kind of a big body and nose for an ESB, but maybe thatï¿½s because itï¿½s not a prominent style in the US these days. At any rate, nice bouquet with some floral aromas and hop crispness. But what really stands out is a sweet (in many ways too sweet, heavy on the vanilla) malt flavors. Itï¿½s a bit too one-dimensional, but not bad.
Wild River ESB;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wild River Brewing Company;Bottle: Copperish amber pour with a large white head that dissapated quickly.

Pours a dark amber color with a big tan head. Aroma of tart fruits, oak, and toasted malts. Flavor of rust, apples, grapes, roasted malts, and berries. Yep, this one seems to be infected. Medium-bodied, with a tart mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Iï¿½ll give it the benefit of the doubt that itï¿½s better than this regularly but this one hasnï¿½t held up at all.

Wild River Double Eagle Imperial Stout;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Wild River Brewing Company;12oz bottle supplied by Mike and Janet. Rating #41. Not a jet black pour like most imperial stouts, but it was a dark ruby with a black background and a light tan head. Light roast and a little chocolate. Not a real heavy impy, but not too bad. A bit astringent maybe, a little chocolate, decent. (1220)
Wild River Double Eagle Imperial Stout;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Wild River Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with jake65. Pours dark brown that allows light pass through along the edges, with a moderate light brown head that disappeared after the first sip and left no lace. Pleasant aroma of sweet malt, raisins and a bit of rum. The flavor is basically cardboard and lacks any of the fruitiness or malty sweetness promised in the aroma. Dry, bitter finish. Imperial stouts are my favorite style. This one was disappointing.

Wild River Blackberry Porter;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Porter;Wild River Brewing Company;Tap @ Reno Festival. Black color with a light brown head. I was quite surprised and pleased with this porter. It was smooth with just the right amount of blackberry to make it interesting but not so much that it overshadows the beer. Slightly sweet and a touch of roasted malt. I had a nice chat with the owner who was staffing their booth.

Transparent copper pour with a smaller white head and some moderate lacing. Lots of maltiness overall, with some hops in the finish. Some light spice in the tail that I couldnï¿½t put my finger on. Maybe even a hint of vanilla. Body is quite rich and syruplike.
Wild River Oktoberfest;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wild River Brewing Company;On tap at the Wild River pub. Pours amber, very clear, with a thin white head. Malt up front with a big hop dose in the finish. The malts had a quick toastiness, but I couldnï¿½t get much flavor from it cause the hops overwhelmed the malt to quick.
Wild River Oktoberfest;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wild River Brewing Company;Slightly toasty malt aroma. Light bronze colour. Very spicy - anise and what is that? More toast malts in the flavour. Kind of thin and those inappropriate flavours detract.
Wild River Oktoberfest;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wild River Brewing Company;Draught at the Wild River Pizza, Brookings. Clear amber. Resiny hop aroma. Sweet with mushy, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Salt, sugar and resin creates a tastebud burning sensation. Lingering bitter finish. More of an IPA than an Oktoberfest, which is pretty much as far wrong as you can go.

Gaymers K Cider (US version);Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);"Had this guy a long time ago when I was roofing in the ghetto of Rockford, IL way back in 2003. The guy I was working with (true thug) was talking about it all day and used such descriptive terms as ""Fuck 211 dog, this shit will fuck you in the ass"". Needless to say, when we got done for the day I had to try one. We stopped at a drive-thru liquor store on the way to dropping him off and he bought us each a bottle for a ""road soda"". I remember it being sweet and dry at the same time. Wish I could still find it, because I would love to give it another try."

Gaymers K Cider (US version);Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Eh, I gotta tell ya, all these mass-produced ciders are starting to taste exactly the same. However, this one has a minimal sweetness and low carbonation. Itï¿½s fine for being handed to me by my boyfriend, but I probably wouldnï¿½t buy it. Thanks, boyfriend, for handing it to me!
Gaymers K Cider (US version);Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Hazy deep golden pour. Very light carbonation. The nose is is lightly appley with a weird plasticy maltiness. Some fairly oxidized character in addition to the light apple. Light astringency but itï¿½s the weird honey/malt sweetness that is the most off-putting. It gets less sweet as it warms up. A touch of acidity. A very odd duck ï¿½ meh.

Ginga Kogen Stout;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Brown Ale;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;The beer Iï¿½m drinking is labeled Ginga Kogen Beer STOUT. Black can with two caribou above the STOUT. Pours black with a thin beige head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Aroma is chocolate and coffee and and a little bit of bourbon. The taste is less than the aroma, sadly. The chocolate is there, and thereï¿½s also a nice sweetness, but thereï¿½s a metallic tang that is distracting. The body is thin. Carbonation is fine. This is a beer with a lot of potential, but itï¿½s just not there yet. Drank in Narita, Japan.
Ginga Kogen Stout;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Brown Ale;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Somethings not right here. Crude like, but with no body (?!), little carbonation and weak sugary flavour. THese guys do great wheat beer, everything else is a terrible miss.
Ginga Kogen Stout;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Brown Ale;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Two finger head, roasted dark malt with metallic tint. Tastes a bit over roasted like burnt coffee
Ginga Kogen Stout;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Brown Ale;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;I am not sure what Maekchu means, maybe he got an off can or something... 280 yen or so from Lawson. 5.5% can served in a glass beer mug. Itï¿½s ï¿½quite a good looking stout, deep black with a foamy beige head that left behind no lacing. The aroma is a mild chocolate with a bit of roastiness. Medium bodied the flavor is mostly lightly roasted coffee bitterness with a bit of chocolate in the finish. I think this is pretty good not terribly complex but alright.
Ginga Kogen Stout;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Brown Ale;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Can from local Yamaya. Sourish prunes, chocolate, and some definite phenolic notes. Thick brown, translucent at edges. Prunes and bitter bakerï¿½s chocolate / harsh hops and torched chocolate bars and phenolic crap / mercifully, these flavors fade out quickly in the finish. Thin-medium body. Pretty bad overall. Too thin and then phenolic stuff really interferes.
Ginga Kogen Stout;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Brown Ale;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;"0,35 l can. Ginga Gogenis one of the most available craft beers in Japan but for me this is the first time to try their Stout. Can looks stylish, black, some explanation about ""what is stout"". Beer pours out nice, beer is deep brown, almost black, some brown even in a foamy head. Well, that head disappears fast, leaving only few bubbles. Aroma is a bit too simple - it is possible tonote some roasted malts, and something soft - difficult to put my finger on it but it feels maybe like... raw potato? Something buttery in the aroma also. Taste is smoked malts, slight bitterness and somewhat sour finish. Body is light, not bad but also not entirely satisfying."
Ginga Kogen Stout;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Brown Ale;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Can from Yamaya. Notes of bitter chocolate, sour malt and soy sauce. Medium body, quite dry and creamy. Flavours aren't huge, but this was just what I was in the mood for. Not too bad for a canned stout.

(0.33l draft at Sunset Beer Garden, Sendai, Japan.)
Ginga Kogen Stout;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Brown Ale;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;"Dark beige head, fast gone over virtually black beer; shards of lace. (Wal)nutty, but also hazelnuts, perfumed in a very good way; roasted aromas. Sweet, liquorice, roasted nuts, black rice, walnuts. Not really well-bodied, but quite grist-slick. Not bad, just a tad too timid and sweet."

Carling Premier;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);Can, that I found on a train. I have no shame. Daft nitro pour. Daft looking lager. Smells and tastes of nothing. Feels fucking horrendous on the palate. Like drinking strained sick. Properly crap.
Carling Premier;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);Can't understand some of the lesser reviews, some obviously are used to crap beers and can't tell the difference, this beer is great, totally different to the standard Carling. I seek it where-ever I go.
Carling Premier;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);Love this lager. Pours great, nice head (dont be afraid to just pour it in your glass, it ll sort itself out). Not much carbonation which allows the distinct lager taste to come through. Its not heavy tasting, its not really unique, but its a bloody good lager from Carling. One of my favs.
Carling Premier;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);440ml can with nitro. Pours clear good with a tall and creamy white head. Aroma is corn, paper, malt. Taste is the same. Very watery. Very simple.
Carling Premier;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);It isn't very refreshing. Lots of gas is lost on opening. There for it is a flat tasting lager.
Carling Premier;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);I've read all the negative comments on this Lager and I have to say i disagree with many of them. Its a smooth stealthily potent brew that holds its head well. It cannot be compared to normal carling, they are different beers, I find this a pleasant change to the run of the mill brews on tap.
North Coast Black Hart;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;"""TJï¿½s special...$6 sixer. Not bad, though not a standout. very nice roasted malt aroma. good hop balance. flavor and body a little lighter but more than ample, especially for the price."""

The burnt bitter after taste tends to linger a little too long. Overall- Each initial sip is very good but the after taste really distracts form its drink ability. Would go with other stouts rather than pick this one up again.

Pours deep darkness with thin tan head. The aroma is rich and yummy initially as the freshly popped elixir fills the air with its goodness. I get chocolate, molasses, brown sugar and dark roasted malts all coming together in pleasing harmony. The taste is similar with black strap molasses, chocolate, dark roasted malts, dark roasted coffee and a sweet sense of vanilla. Nice.

Clear deep yellow with q off-white head. The aroma is like sour grains and cork. Light bodied, dry and overcarbed for me. The taste is sweet, cork and grains. Too gassy...

McNeill's Oatmeal Stout;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McNeill's Brewery;Bomber. Nose is slightly sweet, sultry dark chocolate, oily with hot alcohol fumes reminiscent of spiked truffles, plums and light brandy, tar and brown sugar at the back, rotting cherry, good slick roast and all kinds of cool burned and scorched notes. Viscous motor oil pour with a large and dense, jiggling light brown head. Smooth, very airy feel in the light body, moderately sweet (though the aftertaste is sweeter than that of most beers), roast and chocolate are almost all of what remains but theyï¿½ve started to slowly fade into the wall. Quite smooth, velveteen, deft hints of minerals but the fruitiness is muddled. Alcohol not nearly as prevalent in the mouth. A good offering, on the whole, different than most oatmeal stouts, bigger contribution from the yeast.
McNeill's Oatmeal Stout;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McNeill's Brewery;2013.04.08 - McNeills Oatmeal Stout - bottle about 4 months old (to me). Aroma: Oats, a bit of vanilla maybe, roasted barley. Appearance: Pours > 40 on SRM scale. Really dark and opaque. Typical stout caramel tan head of average size and longevity. Taste: exactly what you expect from an oatmeal stout, I reckon, however there is a bit of tartness like a cherry taste almost. Palate/Mouthfeel: medium body, not light but not super heavy. Pretty good, not remarkable, would be better with a bit less of that tart sourness. Aroma 7/10, Appearance 4/5, Taste 7/10, Palate 3/5, Overall 13/20
McNeill's Oatmeal Stout;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McNeill's Brewery;Bottle. Pours black with tan head.

McNeill's Oatmeal Stout;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McNeill's Brewery;Ok this was an infected bottle, but I am rating it anyway - their fault for selling an infected beer +++ Sampled from a 22 oz brown bottle this beer poured thick black and oily with a medium sized creamy very dark brown head. The aroma was strong cocoa, anise, port wine and vanilla. The flavor was bitter vinegar and port wine - obviously infected - with undertones of toasty malts and vanilla that hint at what could have been a decent beer sans infection. Long bitter vinegar, port wine and toasty vanilla finish. Full bodied and creamy. I have a feeling i would have liked this one if not for the infection.

It wasnï¿½t really a stand-out for me. I didnï¿½t find it to be special, just fine, but not special.
McNeill's Oatmeal Stout;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McNeill's Brewery;Aroma of coffee, chocolate, malts. pours black with thin tan head that lasts with some lace. Initial taste of chocolate, coffee, leather, somewhat thin and watered. then sour milk hits like a ton and stays on the palate, donï¿½t know but suspect spoiled beer here, but reading other reviews I just donï¿½t know because itï¿½s good up front but awful towards the finish, Iï¿½ve never had anything like that. This brewery hasnï¿½t lived up to the hype for me on any of their brews.
McNeill's Oatmeal Stout;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McNeill's Brewery;Gusher - 22oz. bomber gifted by bro-in-law. Big brown head on this bottle that even started working its way out of the bottle. Black pour that was thick and some flakes settled to the bottom of the glass. Aromas were subtle coffee grounds, malt, dark chocolate. Mouth was very smooth, creamy and full bodied. lt to avg carbonation. Definitely wait until this one warms a bit, thatï¿½s when then milk chocolatey malts shine through. Notes of espresso, dark chocolate, oatmeal and milk sweetness - nice balanced hops in the finish. Very nice overall.
McNeill's Oatmeal Stout;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McNeill's Brewery;I poured half into a glass. The other half is still on my kitchen counter. I have a hard time bringing myself to throw beer away, but I also have a hard time drinking this. Itï¿½s sour, I assume from infection. Iï¿½d hate to think this was the intent. Iï¿½ll re-rate another batch.

I couldnt tell if this was jsut a belgian spiced beer or more of a saison. Pours a hazy gold with a thin white head. Aroma is light but mostly spicy, coriander, citrus, lemon zest, lemongrass, orange peel, and some alligator pepper notes. Light brett on the aroma as well, and some of the crisp citrusy notes from the brett carry through to the flavor as well. More citrus, light wheat malts, and some orange peel. Finish is crisp and mostly clean, but a bit light on the body. Ok overall.

General Lafayette Matrimoniale;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Copper Crow Beer Company;What happened? Is the General feeling unwell?

Victoria Bitter;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Melbourne's favourite big brewery lager. Or it used to be. Now they hide it out back in the coolstore and craft beers line the shelves. Probably where it belongs but it's got more malt than a eurolager even if the initial sugar hit can be off putting. VB is not bitter at all, and there's no bitter after taste, just lingering malt as the sweetness subsides. Put it in a green long neck and it could rule at summer BBQs again. Fleeting head means it's best served chilled in the bottle. Worth a revisit.
Victoria Bitter;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Light malty body, with a bread aroma. Light bodied, this is a pale lager, not a bitter. Thin finish,

Victoria Bitter;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Boring but consistent Melbourne beer. Best cold - don't let it warm up.

Victoria Bitter;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Tried a few at the local dive, golden appearance, light on the nose. Slight bitter tasting lager, best real cold. Easily sessionable out of cans, bottles or tap.

John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sampled on draft at the Monroeville PA location this beer poured a hazy golden color with a large white head. The aroma was tangy artificial berry. The flavor was tangy, sour and vaguely bitter with a fairly strong Frankenberry like element. Sweet enough to still be tasty - but then again I have always loved Frankenberry.
John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sample at the Pittsburgh location. Hazy yellow/gold color with a thin white head with no retention. Very little lacing too. The aroma is akin to Frankenberry cereal. Light-bodied and sugary sweet with strawberry being the only flavor. The finish is short and sweet. This is a one-trick pony from beginning to end.
John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Strawberry Starburst aroma. Hazy yellow. Straweberry and vanilla, medium-light bittering. Frothy mouth. Floral finish. Different, but not my bag. Lingering, perfumy aftertaste.
John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On draft at the Union Station, Wash DC, brewpub, 9/2/05: Very fruity-tooty aroma. Flavor is like a big fake strawberry, like those roll-up candy deals. I think itï¿½s gross.
John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);From a sampler at John Harvardï¿½s in DC on September 5th, 2005. Hazed gold with a HUGE whiff of strawberries about it. Not quite as artificial as expected. Taste is wheaty and sweet with strawberries. I mentioned that this tastes like Capï¿½n Crunchï¿½s Crunchberries. My wife agreed. Some wheat and cereal like notes help confirm this. Body is light and kind of watery. Finishes much the same as the taste - strawberries, grains and cereal like notes. Meh.
John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);This was absolutely horrendous. Overwhelming taste of strawberry Robitussin and chalk. Blech.
John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Pale gold color, with aroma of slight malt, strawberries, and (gasp!) popcorn and popcorn butter. Other than swill, this is the first brewpub beer I have ever tasted with this type of defective aroma and taste. It wasnï¿½t horrible, mind you, but it was disconcerting. There was a very little strawberry flavor, and the finish was slightly dry. I wouldnï¿½t drink this again.
John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Looks like ginger ale. Artificial strawberry nose, like cheap candy. Very fake, very sweet. Reminds of of the generic brand flavored soda I my Mom would buy when I was a kid.
John Harvards Strawberry Blond;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);The color of this beer was almost clear, there was only a small little tint of yellow to it, very light head as well, very light bodied, watery & bland, a hint of strawberry came through in the nose & flavors but it just wasn't enough, if brewpubs are gonna make a fruity beer like this, they should at least make it taste a little fruity, this beer had very little berry qualities
John Harvards Black and Tan;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - English;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;This to me did not even really come across and was I expect a black and tan to taste like. Very flat and boring, just below average. Not recommended.

Maes Pils;Alken, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);"I don't understand the low score for this. For me it's a beer with a German bitter taste perfect for binge drinkers. It doesn't have a Belgian floral taste but if you are searching for something in between then it's a great beer. Really nice foam too, out of a can. I recommend it for hardcore drinking 7+beer cans. What I mean by this is that it's a really good price/quality range beer. Each drink makes you crave another one provided that it's ice cold. I stress this, Maes for me is best drank ice cold. I believe this is just because this website is run by elitist ""connoisseurs"" who don't know what actually getting drunk means. In a international way of course. ;) Also tasting a beer does not mean drinking one of that beer. In my opinion you should drink atleast 1 liter of the beer you are testing in a sitting, I mean we are talking beer here guys."

Gale's Pentagel;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;One of my favorite beers, although I havenï¿½t been able to buy it for about 8 years. Extremely smooth and tasty. Definitely try it if you get a chance.
Gale's Pentagel;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Picked this up at the Foodery in Philadelphia. The pours out a dark amber body with a slight off white head that leaves no lacing. Scents of malt sweetness mixed with a fruity tartness rise from the glass. There are also notes of a roastiness about it too that come through. The taste starts of with a light roasted malt flavor that is a bit sweet from caramel. Itï¿½s a bit syrupy going down and there are notes of various fruits throughout the flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body. Pretty good drinkability here if you in the mood for a really malty brew. Overall this is pretty good and would definitely be for the malt head.
Gale's Pentagel;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;12.08.04 330ml bottle. Got this (as a gift) from The Foodery in Philly. Seeing the status and that there were no ratings in the last two years is somewhat disconcerting....sweet tea colored brew with little head, lingering foamy ring. Caramel, earth, cherry punch aromas. Much darker and richer than I expected, vinous. Very sweet up front -- caramel and dark toffee. Some grassy hops. I think it might be oxidized, or Iï¿½m just not getting it, but itï¿½s a bit cardboardy. Some earthy acidity at the finish and lingering.
Gale's Pentagel;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Interesting friuty aroma, thin head, and copper body. I thought the beer tasted like an ESB, but needed more maltiness to improve the overall taste of the beer.
Gale's Pentagel;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;"Fruity, wine-like nose; orange-amber color; low head. Toaste malt flavors disappear quickly. Thin, but somewhat complex."
Gale's Pentagel;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Chocolate, portwine aroma. Red amber body. Chocolate taste, but thin and flat. Not very good.
Gale's Pentagel;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Malty and well hopped, but not to the point of being cloying. Clean flavor without much adverse yeast influence. Very nice Suffolk ale, somewhere between an ESB and a pale ale.

Columbus Brewing Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Columbus Brewing Company;(From 2011 notes). This is a nice hoppy APA from CBC. Nothing too unusual or bold here, although the beer leans in the bold direction for style. This is a very well brewed PA, with plenty of citrus and a bit of pine in the aroma, and this carries thru to the taste and finish. I appreciate the substantial hop flavor without an over-whelming bitterness. Looks nice too, being crystal clear amber with a durable head. Highly recommended!
Columbus Brewing Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Columbus Brewing Company;Bottle from Drygate bottle shop. Classic midwest pale ale - Iï¿½d be inclined to call it an IPA, such was itï¿½s hopping. But not hop-forward: that typical midwest balance of smooth malty hops and amber ale tendencies against a bitter and long after taste.
Columbus Brewing Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Columbus Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 9/1/2016. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, light honey/caramel, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt/fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, light honey/caramel, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus peel/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, apricot, lemon/orange peel, pine, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt/fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors lingering after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/sticky, fairly creamy/grainy, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is an excellent pale ale! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt/fruity yeast flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink. Very vibrant and pretty juicy on hop/yeast flavors; with a solid malt backbone that never feels too sweet. A very enjoyable offering."
Columbus Brewing Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Columbus Brewing Company;Boardman, Oh - Vintage Estate Beer and Wine - 12 oz bottle. Slight haze to the medium golden pour, soft,snow white head, light lacing. Aroma has some spearmint accents, some hoppy spruce accents.

Columbus Brewing Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Columbus Brewing Company;Good version of a classic american pale ale. Lots of citrus, mango and predominantly pine from the hops with a decent dry bitter lingering taste. Not too exciting but well done.
Columbus Brewing Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Columbus Brewing Company;Bottled on 062216. Nose classic Cascade grapefruit and lighter orange peel, fresh with hints of dank and wood. Pour is lightly hazy deep orange with slightly above-average carbonation and a large rocky off-white head, tight lace. Taste bone dry and strongly resinous, lets the strong bitterness shine through. Not tart at all, lightly woody, touch of deep toffee and much more earth, but no lighter caramel -- itï¿½s a good match. Could use a little more of a spicy aspect in the absence of juicier grapefruit, but the straight-laced dryness makes it super repeatable. Clean, smooth body a shade lighter than full. A classic of the style in line alongside the floral Sierra Nevada. [2016.08.09: 3.7]

Big Horn Steel Cut Stout;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Stout;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Well shit. Why not call it oaked Stout. The fucking server had no clue what it was called. She was more or less useless. She did have a big ass, so thats cool I guess. Nose of fresh oak, roasted dark malts, a littler bittersweet chocolate, and more fresh wood. Not bad. Pours black on nitro with a creamy tan head. Nice looking. Nice fresh oak flavors spicy on top of dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate. Nice oak essense. Smooth, very drinakble, I had two. Ram makes nice beer at Northgate.

Silky smooth on the palate with a long drawn out chocolate finish. This was suprisingly good for our local Ram.

Kraftbrau Winter Moon Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Deep lacquered brown in color with quickly cascading lace. Honey, caramelized pecans and toasted almonds comprise the aroma, while the flavor is less than gratifying. Piney, straight forward caramel. Some chocolate, tingling copper and pepper. Medium bodied, and in-and-out when it comes to the palate. Mildly spiced finish. Next?
Kraftbrau Winter Moon Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;This draft brew from the brewery poured a medium sized head of white colored frothy medium sized bubbles that left behind a transparent dark copper brown body with no visible carbonation and an excellent lacing. The aroma was filled with aromatic caramel malty notes but was yet on the mild side. The mouth feel was initially sweet and mild but semi-flat with a hoppy finish. The flavor was an interesting mix of malt and nuts but they did not seem to play well together and I found them distracting.
Kraftbrau Winter Moon Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap at Kraftbrau. Medium sized ivory head that mostly diminished, excellent lacing, fine-small sized bubbles, uncarbonated, transparent, and a reddish brown hue. Malty, caramel and sweet aroma.

Kraftbrau Winter Moon Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;Being ill and broke before Ratebeer was bad enough...Iï¿½m finally ready to give another beer a shot (dontcha love credit cards?). Pours a slightly hazy amber/copper with a ridiculous yet standard light tan head (meaning the first pour was 8 inches of foam, and the beer took 20 minutes total to pour). Not sure whatï¿½s up with the carbonation in their beers but it can be irritating. But I digress...toasty, perfumey/peppery hops aroma with plenty of yeast. Flavor was likewise toasty with plenty of bittering hops lending pepper and perfume flavors. Biscuity and yeasty as well. Light sweetness. Not too different from their other beers even though it is an ale.
Kraftbrau Winter Moon Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;A very drinkable ale. Smokey, malty beer with excellent grain presence. I enjoyed this beer. Thanks Urbn and PsychProf.
Kraftbrau Winter Moon Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;Thank you PsychProf. I sense a bit of wheat and taste a lot of spice in this winter ale. Perhaps a bit of smoke, too. I will stick with the lagers from this btewery, however.
Kraftbrau Winter Moon Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;"On tap at Kraftbrau. Dark, cloudy, and honey-colored, with a sweet nose. Scant foam - looked like a yin/yang symbol floating on top of the ale (because I was with my sweetie? :) This ale has a sharp, sharp, initial tingle, and is pretty hoppy (yea!) and is so fresh! Not quite as hoppy as the ""Summer Alt"" and a bit more consistently bitter, but still, quite a good beer. Recommended."
Kraftbrau Winter Moon Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Not the only ale Kraftbrau makes, but I do agree with P-tor44 that it""s a good one. An Amber Ale, at least according to the label, and one with a lot of malt action (some of it quite buttery, again, as 44 mentions). Hops bite through the finish, but this is a winter amber in the style of Siletz""s Winter Warmer (which I thought was a dry stout / stout / amber cross). Good. Now I get it...after looking up the beer on the website, I see it""s an Alt and I can see that. Yum."

Colt 45 Double Malt;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;24 oz can. Purchased in St. Louis. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a straw golden color. Lots of carbonation. About 2 fingers white rocky head. I'm surprised by the retention, but after a few minutes it fizzles away to just a film. Very light lacing except for the very top. Aroma is corn, and corn flakes. Grape skin. Taste is corn and touch of alcohol. Perhaps sweeter than regular 45. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Sweet, touch of alcohol. Overall, it's okay. Sweet even for malt liquor standards. Not my first malt liquor choice, not my last. I guess it's just average. I wouldn't recommend it, and will never buy it again, because well it's way far away!
Colt 45 Double Malt;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;can @ Party Town / Florence KY --- Clear light golden amber, soapy white head cover, dots of lace. I had a 6-pack as an under-aged college sophomore in 1970. I liked it. I got somewhat drunk (my first time for that), then decided that getting drunk wasnï¿½t worth the next dayï¿½s payback. Skip to 2015 - how could this mess be appealing - even to Billy Dee Williams? It is weak, ...more water than malt, not even corn or rice, and meaningless hops. Wow! How times change.
Colt 45 Double Malt;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;40 shared by noted businessman jackl, 4/10/15. Clear golden, thin fizzy off-white head, good retention. Aroma of skunky hops and grain. The taste is grainy malt, cardboard, corn, mild grassy hops. Medium bodied, high carbonation.
Colt 45 Double Malt;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;From the 40! Poured into a glass. Twist-off top with an OK crack off. Straw yellow pour with ridiculous white fluffy ice cream shake-like head. Busy carbonation. I pick up that corny, malty sensation that normally accompanies malt liquors but it does no seem substantially different from the regular Colt 45. The body is actually full compared to its competition. Not extra cold, which is what you need for malt liquors, but in one sense it almost enhances the drink. It gives it some character. Rating this as a malt liquor it is better than some. Rating this as a craft beer is a waste of time. But here comes the drunken headache!
Colt 45 Double Malt;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;This is a pretty reasonable beverage to get wasted on if youï¿½re in a pinch. It is yellow w/ a foamy head. Itï¿½s a bit sweet and fruity w/ only a little bit of weird Jolly Rancher/grape drink off flavors going on. There is maybe a touch of oxidated malt character but nothing too horrid. Good malt liquor, overall.

Colt 45 Double Malt;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;40 picked up @ Caponeï¿½s (really). Gold pour with a small white head. Nose isnï¿½t offensive. Cereal grains. Sweet honey. Nice and mellow. Not boozy or all that skunky. Taste is a little bit flabby. Honey nut cheerios. A touch oily. Dry husky finish. Sugary bread. Not all that bad. A good option if you plan on drinking under a bridge.
Colt 45 Double Malt;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"better ""body"" if one can call it that than regular ol ghetto Colt 45. Still not good. At all. Just less bad :)"
Colt 45 Double Malt;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Transfer from BA review on 1-9-13- I had to pour about 10 oz from the 40 into a pint glass to at least give the brew its fair shot. After that first 10 oz however it was all straight from the big, clear, glass bottle- just as it should be. Appearance ï¿½ The beer pours the same color as seen through the clear bottle- a medium golden amber color. Upon pouring there is a nice big white head. The head has a nice level of retention fading over ~ 3 min to leave a decent level of lacing. Smell ï¿½The aroma was most potent of a bready and corn smell. Mixed with these are some aromas of musty paper and a light metallic smell. Taste ï¿½ The taste, when cold, is quite clean actually. It begins very watery with a decent corn sweetness and light bready flavor. A light caramel flavor comes to the tongue in the middle of the taste and is accompanied by a light paper taste. Besides the sweeter corn and mild bready flavors all the other flavors are quite light throughout the taste and in the end leave moderately crisp taste on the tongue. Now when it warms up more however it is not as crisp. Some more papery and metal tastes come to the tongue in the middle and the end of the taste with a somewhat chalky and dry taste to be left on the tongue when everything is said and done. Mouthfeel ï¿½ The body of the brew is quite light in its creaminess and thickness with a carbonation level that is average to above average. The higher carbonation and thinner body are quite appropriate for the style making it a quick drinker. Overall ï¿½ Wellï¿½ it looked fairly decent and when it is cold, it drinks rather easy and crisp. Once it warms up some however it is not quite as easy drinking. Even so when warmer it is still a step above other malts as it doesnï¿½t leave a real offensive taste on the tongue.

Lancaster Milk Stout;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Pours a pitch black with a thin tan head and very light carbonation. Mild aroma of roasted malts and dark chocolate. Very light weak roasted flavor. Thin with a light coffee taste. Not very creamy or chocolately. Finishes smooth with a light roasted aftertaste. Not very enjoyable. Pretty ordinary.
Lancaster Milk Stout;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Tried their double milk stout first about a year ago. Found that to be about average for the style, so was hoping since this is a little lighter...might be better balanced. That may be so, but still seemed a little off ...naturally leaning towards the sweet side. Feel is ok and has a nice chocolate base flavor. Even for the low price, wasn't quite feeling this stout. Liking their IPAs better so far.

Clear medium amber with orange tinge, white hEad thAt settles to a cover, sheets of lace. Taste is semi-sweet malt that adds medium fizz and just a bit of berry in a finish never gets around to showing discernible hops. Probably some there somewhere.

Minnesota Brewing McMahons Irish-Style Potato Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minnesota Brewing Company;"I bought a can years ago this for a friend who collected unusual beer cans: As I remember it was a 330ml can served cold, hazy amber with a white head, and it tasted of a bland lager with potato flavouring.

Minnesota Brewing McMahons Irish-Style Potato Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minnesota Brewing Company;A fairly pleasant round, fruity amber malt taste, but it's rather faint and the body is very weak. I'm intrigued by the potato idea, but I think the only affect in this brew is an unfortunate veggie aftertaste. Interestingly, I had a cherry beer at the same session and both beers were identical in color, an insubstantial reddish brown.
Minnesota Brewing McMahons Irish-Style Potato Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minnesota Brewing Company;The scent of potato is noticed as you take the first sip. This is slightly darker beer than expected (light brown). The flavor, while somewhat different, is not overpowering. A nice, drinkable beer - good for the summer.

To be honest I canï¿½t remember that much of these beers, but next to the beers name I wrote a little bit of info.

It is for my own record, that I know I had tasted it once. Nice bitter but a bit watery.
Grain Belt Golden;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;Old rate from about 7 years ago.Golden color,corn and cerealish aroma with a teasing of hops.Tastes pretty weak with the grains and corn being the predominant flavor with just a slight more hops then the previous brews from these people.Ehhh.

Minnesota Brewing Brewers Cave Black Barley;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minnesota Brewing Company;It would be cool if this stuff was actually brewed in a cave. or maybe it would be cool to go into a cave and drink it. Either way the whole cave concept is the only thing truly enjoyable from this beer. I like their pigs eye better. I tasted average and had a strangly unique musty smell to it. kinda like a cave would.
Minnesota Brewing Brewers Cave Golden Caramel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minnesota Brewing Company;Not a fan of this beer.

Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Pilsner;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minnesota Brewing Company;"I had a can of this ""brew"" back in the early nineties. Kind of tasted a little like Pabst imho. Cheap buzz."
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Pilsner;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minnesota Brewing Company;Wasnï¿½t the best beer in the world of course. Although for the price, you got a good deal. ($10/case bottles). Minimal unique taste and pretty run of the mill for lower tier brands.
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Pilsner;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minnesota Brewing Company;This beer is malty with a bread dough flavor, a watery mouthfeel and little to no hops.

Aromas of pale malt, mild DMS, and a touch of earthy hops. Flavors are grainy and lightly acidic. Need to include some history. Pigs Eye is the local name for where the wastewater treatment plant and sludge burning was located in St. Paul.
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Pilsner;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minnesota Brewing Company;For a cheap beer this isn't too bad. I had some at a beer tasting and spoke to one of the owners who informed me they changed the hops from the original recipe and made it a bit better than it was. It does have some flavor which is decent, but could be a tad stronger in flavor but still decent. Poured medium yellow with some head that evaporated rather quickly but actually did have some lacing. Carbonation was decent as well. I wouldn't turn this down on a hot day as it could be a good thirst quencher. It's better than BMC or other ilk of that type.
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Pilsner;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minnesota Brewing Company;Hey, it's better than Bud. Or is it? Not sure how you'd figure out, other than price, but that and whatever alcohol you'll find in this made it a trusty companion once upon a time. My rating is from the returnable bottle.
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Pilsner;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minnesota Brewing Company;nothing special. slightly more body than a main stream lager................
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Pilsner;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minnesota Brewing Company;Definately nothing special ,or anything that stands out to make this anything better then a middle of the road pils
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Light;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minnesota Brewing Company;Bottle. Golden color with a laced white head. A slightly flowery aroma, but basically no flavor at all. Not offensive in and a touch of sweetness, but nothing to make it worth finishing. I was surprised to find this in California.
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Light;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minnesota Brewing Company;Really cheap. The taste is not all that great. The aroma is fairly weak. It is a little musty tasting and is really bad if your hungover.

Heard this was brewed in abrewery that shares an island with a nuclear power plant. Can you see me glowing?. . .Good.
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Red Amber;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minnesota Brewing Company;"For a cheap beer this stuff is a heck of a lot better than that Coors made ""Irish Red"". This is (or rather was) the best beer in the Pig's Eye line."
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Red Amber;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minnesota Brewing Company;With a foamy head and a rich flavor, this may be the best cheap beer in America. Best on tap at a ballpark -- the St. Paul Saints used to serve it at Midway. Too bad they don't any more, as it's hard to find on tap.
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye Red Amber;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minnesota Brewing Company;I liked the pig. It had a good flavor too it . Not a sign of weakness with this beer.
Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye NA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Minnesota Brewing Company;It has a sweet taste and a strong beer flavor, especially for being Non- alcoholic(NA). I would not drink this unless I were the DD.

Minnesota Brewing Pigs Eye NA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Minnesota Brewing Company;PISS! Even for near beer this is horrible. And I had it fresh from the source during a tour of the brewery!

Sweet, toasty nutty malty aroma has some fresh green English hops. Body starts with a good sweet dark caramel malty character with toasty nuts and a mildly bitter green hoppy presence. Has a touch of bready dough and licorice. A nice, very drinkable brown ale.
Columbus Brewing Nut Brown Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;12oz bottle from Ohiodad. Pours a dark brown color with a foamy light tan head that receedes to a light filmy covering. Nose is lightly hoppy, light nuts and slight malt hints. Nose is fairly bland and non existent.

Columbus Brewing Nut Brown Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;I drank this beer years ago, and just now started rating. I drank it at night, outside, so I donï¿½t remember the color very well. The aroma was kind of thick and nutty, which was good. The initial taste was pretty good, almost like a stout, but finished kind of like burnt hops. Not bad, but just not my favorite taste, I donï¿½t like a big hop taste. Overall, it was good and I would drink it again...
Columbus Brewing Nut Brown Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Bottle... Dark ale with a small, fizzy, khaki head. Robust aroma for the style... chocolate and dark roasted nuts. The well-balanced flavor is also fairly hearty for the style... chocolate, weak coffee, vanilla and mild caramel. Light to medium-bodied and lively. Short, crisp, grassy finish. Thanks go out to OhioDad for the bottle.
Columbus Brewing Nut Brown Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;"Thanks to OhioDad for this one. Poured dark brown with a tan head. Aroma had some nutty notes and a mild sweet chocolate scent. Tasted like watery cardboard with some dusty nuttiness. In my notes I have ""Was a Pile O Shit"" so I donï¿½t think I liked this one too much."
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours golden with crispy white head. Smells like malted grains. Tastes bready and citrusy. Crispy body, and goes down easy, theres not a whole lot of flavor.
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Clear amber color with a moderate frothy white head that diminished slowly. Light sweet aroma. Light to medium body with a thin texture. Light sweet citrus flavor with a short finish.
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Pours golden, minimal white head. Flavor is bready and citrusy, a little tart. Finish is slightly bitter and dry. This might be ideal for a hot summer day after mowing the lawn.
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with OhioDad, thanks Scott!) Let me cover the good points of this beer first. The clarity on this beer is very impressive; I can read the logo through the beer without even the slightest blur from haze. And so therefore, the steady rise of carbonation bubbles is plainly visible and makes for an attractive beer. The whitish head rises to the rim of the glass before settling to a ring. Unfortunately, things go down hill fast. Not only is the aroma not enticing, itï¿½s nearly effective as a repellent. Honestly, this beer smells like stinky socks, with grain and some perfume fighting through as well. The flavor is only marginally better because it doesnï¿½t taste like stinky socks, but it is quite grainy from start to finish, and itï¿½s not an especially pleasant graininess either. Slight sweetness early, but that seems to fade by the finish where the grain really takes control. Bitterness is very slight. Body is light-medium but doesnï¿½t stimulate the palate. Not a good brew at all."
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;12 oz bottle pours golden with a small white head. Aroma is slightly floral. Taste is light grains and lots of lemon. The first sip I thought tasted like dish soap but it does grow on you later into the bottle. On the palate this is light and definitely a summer beer. Definitely not CBCï¿½s best brew.
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;"Yellow color clearly; lightly veiled and much bubbly. Decided, attractive scent. Green apple aroma and wheat, intriguer. Round taste but not too much light. Fresh and of optimal duration with a sweetish end. Unusual."
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Deep golden colored liquid. Nice full yellow head. Nose is mildly hoppy and medium malt. Taste is full and malty. Small amounts of grain flavor. Texture is full, but not thick. Not really smooth.
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Golden in color, obviously. Mine had a head that left about a quarter of the bottle laying on the bar in front of me. I would attribute most of this to the subzero glass it was served in. After tasting I didnï¿½t mind that I lost part of it. My worst experience for a CBC brew.
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Bottle: Rating this while my head is a little stuffed up! Clear deep gold w/ a lasting white head. Thatï¿½s about where my admiration stops!!!!! All I could smell was diacety, diacetyl, and more diacetyl. I have a head cold and this was still offensive!!!!!!! Very little redeeming qualities with regards to flavor or aroma. Mouthfeel was appropriately smooth for the amount of diacetyl in this beer. Lighter but not watery body, medium carbonation. Did I mention that this beer is loaded with diacetyl?!!!!! Drain pour all the way....At least this 6er. I could not even get through a single beer. I might even try to take it back itï¿½s so bad. Iï¿½ll re rate if I get a better sample!!!! 2 more bottles...same six pack!!!! No Diacetyl in these. First 2 were offensively loaded with it. These next 2 were tomatoey and lactic!!!!! What a treat!!!! I just can't wait to see what surprises the last 2 bottles hold!!!!1
Columbus Brewing Golden Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;"Columbus Brewingï¿½s beers have recently reappeared on the shelves in NE Ohio, so i took the opportunity to try them all again. This is a nice mellow golden ale, sweet with lemon edges; a mostly dry and mildly hopped finish. Easy to drink and good looking too."

Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;"Canï¿½t believe Iï¿½ve never rated this one. One of my go-to local beers, even at Oï¿½Shaughnessyï¿½s where itï¿½s called ""Oï¿½Shaughnessyï¿½s Dam Good Porter"". This particular occasion was a pint at CBC. Darkest brown/black pour with a medium tan head. Roasty nose with some chocolate, a teeny bit of sweetness and some coffee. Malty flavor with chocolate and a bitter coffee finish. Semi-creamy mouthfeel. Very good robust porter."
Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;On tap at the CBC restaurant and brewery. Pours brown with surprisingly little head. Aromas were coffee and chocolate, and the taste was the same. Surprisingly light mouthfeel. I found this one a little lacking, and youï¿½d think the breweryï¿½s restaurant would know to serve their beer warmer.
Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;Tap at the brewery. Coal black with a tan head. A bit cold so a depressed nose. Taste is a bit chocolate, very malty and slightly bitter. Body is a bit thin and it was very carbonated. Not bad-drinkable but ultimately forgettable.
Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;Pours a deep brown with a thin tan head. Excellent blend of chocolate and coffee aroma and taste. Really outstanding porter. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this beer was. Had the Oï¿½Shaughnessyï¿½s Dam Good Porter which is an alias for this beer. Asked the waitress and she confirmed that this was from the Columbus Brewing Company.
Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;On Tap at the Columbus Brewing Co, Terminal B, Columbus Airport, Ohio 28/09/2009 Roast aroma. Beige head. Black very smooth and a little rich on the palate. Fruity with a crisp and slightly bitter coffee roast finish.
Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;On tap at the CBC. Dark beer with mahogany hues when held against the light. Thin brown head. Dark brown sugar nose with deep roasted malts. Toffee sweetness, big roasted grains, some chocolate and sweetened coffee flavors. Almost smoked bacon sense to it. I get burnt coffee beans when I inhale. Very flavorful porter.
Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;On tap a brew week in Athens. Dark brown and clear, with no head. Very light for a porter. Coffee is the flavor I pick out first. A little bitter, but not too bad. As the beer warms, more malt comes through.
Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;7/13/2009: Columbus 1859 Porter is a really nicely done, authentic robust porter. The aroma and flavor both have lots of darkly roasted grain and dark chocolate. There is some additional characteristics in the flavor including coffee, some slight mineral-like quality, and cocoa finish. The beer is very dark brown with a frothy, lasting tan head that leaves copious amounts of foamy lacing on the glass. This beer is also medium-bodied and smooth, but a touch more body/heft would have been appreciated. Nonetheless, this was a tasty, sessionable porter. Pint (draught) at Buffalo Wild Wings in Athens, Ohio during Ohio Brew Week 2009. Rating #27 for this beer.
Columbus Brewing 1859 Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Columbus Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Reddish black color. A little bitter chocolate in the aroma. Some bitter chocolate sweetness flavor-wise, but a little too watery and light. Smooth and drinkable, average example of a US Porter.
Columbus Brewing Apricot Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Columbus Brewing Company;On tap at Columbus Brewing Co, Columbus OH, on 12 March 2010. Pale amber in colour. Loose white head. Quite fruity aroma. More so on the palate. Slightly sweet but not too syrupy or artificial. Light mouthfeel. I donï¿½t usually like this sort of thing but this was OK.
Columbus Brewing Apricot Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Columbus Brewing Company;Sample at CBC. Clear yellow/gold with a thin white head. Aroma of stone fruit and malt. Apricot flavor with sweet malt and a sweet creamy finish. Not a bad summer beer.
Columbus Brewing Apricot Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Columbus Brewing Company;Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass it produced a finger worth of white head that settled to a thin lace. The body of the brew was a apricot color how appropriate. It had aroma of apricot and flavors of apricot thatï¿½s about it for this brew. Oh ya good carbonation and light in the mouth. Now I am not to keen on extract added fruit craft beers. Use the real thing brewers please it is much better, and more in the sprit of a craft product. Ok enough of a rant Serving type: bottle
Columbus Brewing Apricot Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Columbus Brewing Company;My friend Travis brought this one from out of state to the annual Memorial Day party. Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a caramel-amber color with a medium sized yellow-white head. The aroma was light sweet apricot. The flavor was tangy with faint apricot and a touch of nut. The beer turned a bit dry towards the finish and had light lingering apricot. Ok.
Columbus Brewing Apricot Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Columbus Brewing Company;Bottle at Hang Over Easy. Aroma is, obviously, full of apricot. Also notes of malt, but not much else. Taste is pretty heavy on the apricot, with some malts and a faint taste of hops afterwards. It was not unlike drinking a piece of toast with apricot jam on it. It wasnï¿½t overly sweet, so Iï¿½ll give it credit for that. Could have been better, could have been worse.
Columbus Brewing Apricot Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Columbus Brewing Company;On tap at the CBC. Gold color with a thin white head. Thick apricot jam nose. Tastes of oppresive fruit syrup over a light ale. This beer is all about the apricots. Not the nasty artificial flavors that ruin many fruit beers, but still not a compliment to me. There is some home made bread under the jam, but I find the apricot too heavy handed.
Columbus Brewing Apricot Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Columbus Brewing Company;"Bottle. Pours amber in color with a medium white head. Aroma of apricots, as one would think. Flavor is malty with a hint of apricot. Much better than some of the other fruit beers Iï¿½ve tried; this one is like beer with a hint of fruit - not fruit with a hint of beer. Not bad."
Columbus Brewing Apricot Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Columbus Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Filtered, slightly hazy orange color. Not aggressively fruited, the apricot is actually quite well incorporated. A nice sour tangy aftertaste. Easy drinking stuff. Sweet, malty, watery body. Unique.

Leinenkugels Winter Lager;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Good beer. Real dark appearance and bold smooth flavor. Best part is it isnt over powering just good.
Leinenkugels Winter Lager;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);This was an OK beer, although itï¿½s way more of a Dunkel than a Bock. Somewhat spicy, somewhat hoppy. Itï¿½s best served a little bit warmed, and I think I only drank it from a seasonal sampler pack.
Leinenkugels Winter Lager;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);located a bottle of this in the back of my uncleï¿½s fridge.. .I think its from last winter.. I dontï¿½ know and neither did he. Poured a brown color w/ a small tan head that laced ok. Smells a bit light slightly sweet malty with hints of some spice. Palate is very average. Flavor was bad.. I think this brew was aged to long.. a bit vinagarry over some malt and whatever not much worth a rating but I donï¿½t think Iï¿½m going to get this again.
Leinenkugels Winter Lager;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Usually only drink this when it comes in smapler packs with other Leines, but itï¿½s not too bad. Has a little spice and flavor, but nothing exceptional.
Leinenkugels Winter Lager;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);A mediocre lager. Drinkable but unmemorable in taste or aroma. A bit heavier in palate than other Leines (that is, less watery). They say this is bock?! Their brewmasters need to get out and try some real German bock. This aint anywhere close.
Leinenkugels Winter Lager;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);I am not familiar with other winter lagers. However, this is a decent entry for Leineï¿½s. Would like a bit more flavor of hops and spice.
Leinenkugels Winter Lager;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Not all that fantastic of a winter brew, but palatable. Once again, I'm not too into winter brews, but they are a nice heavier beer to try every now and then.
Leinenkugels Autumn Gold;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Amber gold color. Bubbly beige head. Sweet grainy alt nose. Zesty malt flavor. Brief malty finish is earthy and dry.
Leinenkugels Autumn Gold;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Had this a number of years ago. Was crisp and clean, malty. Not really unique, not nasty.
Leinenkugels Autumn Gold;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);This was good beer! Sitting on the porch in early October watching the leaves fall with one of these by my side. Not heaven, but fairly close. Full flavored and not overly complex. You could easily have more then a few of these while mulching the leaves on the old mower.
Leinenkugels Autumn Gold;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);More of a Vienna Style Lager this Autumn Gold is a nicely colored, full-bodied, malty, hop brew. Color is light glowing amber with a nice large, yellowish,frothy head when poured favorably fast. Smells of nice rich malt, somewhat spicey and has a sweet caramel note with some hop presence. Very good taste, echoes the aroma with well balanced caramel malt and light, airy hop dryness with a little spicey hint. Kind of creamy feel, bold, full to medium bodied with a dryish bread finish. This is some pretty good stuff, drinkable indeed, one of the better offerings that Leinenkugel's has put out.
Leinenkugels Autumn Gold;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);I've been to chippewa falls once and would visit again just for another Leinenkugel!

Leinenkugels Autumn Gold;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);I really miss this one. Lght amber color with a light faomy head. A vienna with crisp malt/toasty flavor. It WAS a nice fall quaff.
Leinenkugels Autumn Gold;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);This encapsulates the whole autumn feel: walking on crunchy leaves, partridge hunting in the cool Upper Michigan air.

Pittsburgh Augustiner Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Pretty decent lager. Tried in 2010 after the graduate conference there. Golden and somewhat dry. Effervescent and crisp.
Pittsburgh Augustiner Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Clear amber color, thin head, malty with low carbonation. On tap in a couple joints in station square in pitt.
Pittsburgh Augustiner Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Thanks to my good beer buddy Big D., for this one (actually 6 of them). The brewery recently moved from their longtime Lawrenceville home to Latrobe (the old Rolling Rock Brewing). I was told by several people that the beer taste different. After trying a few bottles, I have to admit the beer has a crisper, cleaner taste to it. I was told that the recipe hasnï¿½t changed. The beerï¿½s original recipe was to copy Yuengling Larger was it was in its height of popularity. Augustiner doesnï¿½t leave the aftertaste in the beer. Itï¿½s worth the try!
Pittsburgh Augustiner Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Lightly carbonated honeyed brass color with a thin, viscous head. Soft grain nose, whiffs of honey malt, and feint crisp hopping. I am pleasantly surprised at this one. For the low ABV% and considering the style, this packs a fine amount of flavor. Honey malted, crisp grain finish with just enough balancing hops. Thoroughly well-balanced and sessionable. Ranks very highly on the shortlist of top amber lager. Perhaps the poorer sister to Yuengling lager. The sum is more than the parts. An enjoyable lager.
Pittsburgh Augustiner Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Bottle. Clear, amber body with thin white head that rapidly diminishes. Notes of caramel, toasted grain, grass and nuts in the aroma along with hints of corn, canned vegetables and sulphur. The flavor is lightly sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly sweet and lightly bitter. Light to medium body, thin, watery texture and soft carbonation. Just short of drainpour, the vegetable notes in the aroma and taste, though slight, were enough to overshadow some of the better qualities ï¿½ like the caramel and toast in the aroma.
Pittsburgh Augustiner Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;bought a six pack of mixed domestic beers. I drank this one immediately after drinking Bud Select (not a fan) and I was so happy to be drinking this. A- typical golden lager color with a white head that fades. S- nothing special. hard to detect. malt. T- highly unoffensive. clean finish. O- this is pretty drinkable. I wasnï¿½t craving another when I was done but I would drink it again. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 04-12-2007 23:52:45
Pittsburgh Augustiner Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"Bought because it was $4.99 for a six-pack of bottles at a corner shop in Burlington, VT. Not terrible, kind of salty malt-ness to the flavor and almost no head-retenetion (as with most ""cheap"" lagers). Overall, itï¿½s a good beer to have after youï¿½ve had too many to appreciate good beer."

Old German Premium Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Poured from a 12oz can. This beer isn't going to blow your mind. It's not gonna make you start believing in the goodness of your fellow man. It's a beer that goes down easy and is fairly priced (10.99 a 30 pack). It has become my favorite low priced brew and in fact made me make an account so I could rate it. Give it a try when you need a cheap alternative to a craft beer.
Old German Premium Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;3/7/18 From can at spoof practice. Slightly funky lager smell. Taste is similar with funky malt and a hint of metallic hops. Not terrible but not great.
Old German Premium Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;can - pale/clear yellow straw color. Looks, smells and tastes like a cheap pilsner. With that being said, it's surprisingly refreshing and not as bad as you'd expect.
Old German Premium Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Probably one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. I have no idea what possessed me to purchase this. The beer pours bright, clear urine color with a small, sea foam type of head. There is virtually no aroma or flavor of any kind. This beer is basically carbonated, alcoholic seltzer water. No wonder it only costs about .50 a can.
Old German Premium Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Refrigerated 12 oz. aluminum can poured into glass. Almost clear, light body, lower carbonation. Taste is light malt.

Old German Premium Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"Can. Pours pale yellow. Aroma is biscuit malt and lager yeast with no off aromas. Flavor is clean and crisp with good pale lager flavors with the terrible off flavors that usually find their way into bargain brands; pleasantly surprised. Light body."

Penn Mï¿½rzen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Bottle. Copper color, clear, thin head. Medium body, moderate carbonation. A solid fest beer
Penn Mï¿½rzen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance ï¿½ The beer pours a nice deep reddish amber color with a two finger head of billowy white foam. The head has a lighter level of retention, fading rather quickly to leave some light levels of foamy island lace on the sides of the glass. Smell ï¿½ The aroma is sweet and malty with tons of caramel and doughy smells. Along with the caramel are other sweet smells with lots of toffee and some brown sugar. Other aromas of a light earthy and grassy nature are there as well, but these are quite light, with the overall smell being rather sweet. Taste ï¿½ The taste begins with a caramel flavor mixed with a rather decent sum of a lightly toasted bready taste. Toffee flavors are present upfront as well, but these seem to fade as the taste advances. Like the toffee, the roast seems to fade a bit as well, being replaced by flavors that are a bit more biscuit like in nature. While these transitions occur some light hop flavors of an earthy and grassy flavor also come to the tongue. The caramel surges a bit at the end, with the other flavors mellowing a little bit, to leave a moderately sweet and malty Marzen flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel ï¿½ The body of the beer is on the average, to maybe just above average, side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The lower carbonation is quite nice for the sweet and bready/biscuit flavors of the brew, while the average to slightly thicker body also upholds the malty and sweet nicely, but all the while do not take away from the drinkability of the brew. Overall, the mouthfeel is rather nice. Overall ï¿½ While not super extraordinary, this is a rather tasty Marzen. Very easy drinking, affordable and tasty. This brew actually seems like a better football weather brew to me as it is sweet, malty but not too big on abv. A nice one to try.
Penn Mï¿½rzen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Sweet malty bill. Very enjoyable and drinkable. Little bit crisper than some of the Oktoberfests

Penn Mï¿½rzen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Thanks to Cavie for sharing this bottle. Amber with a white head. Aroma is full of toffee. Flavor is toffee, grass and some light caramel. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
Penn Mï¿½rzen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Pours a clear reddish brown. Aroma of banana and syrup. Taste is smooth and well-balanced. Not cloying the hops are enough to balance the sweetness and make for a drier finish. Nicely done. I could get a case ad this. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Penn Mï¿½rzen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;On tap for Casperï¿½s Wedding. Pours a deep orange color with a medium white head.

Penn Mï¿½rzen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Bottle. Banana custard scent more akin to a Dubbel than an Oktoberfest with a dark bronze, low head dissolving to film, appearance. The light, crisp palate was refreshing as the grainy taste finished on a bitter note. I picked up grains all over the taste and aroma. It made me think of tortilla chips.
Foundry Irish Red;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Foundry Ale Works;nice smooth red. copper color with almost no head. floral hoppy aroma. nice malty taste that is cut through by bitter hops, almost like a malty pale ale. one of the better seasonals brewed here

Foundry India Pale Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Foundry Ale Works;While driving around Pittsburgh, I spotted this place and jumped out of the car to buy a growler to go - Drank it back at the hotel a couple of hours later. This is a nice IPA, although maybe it weighs in a little too much on the malty side - the hops were there in force, but the sweet malts kept winning. I'd drink more of this for sure.

Foundry Hoppin Copper;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Foundry Ale Works;I like the balance of hops and malt flavors in this beer, but it has a hint of sweetness that I don't appreciate. Other than that it's a very tasty beer.

Upstream Firehouse ESB;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Upstream Brewing Company;Poured hazy copper with floral hops and a little grainy malt in the nose. Flavor was nicely balanced bitterness and toasted malts.
Upstream Firehouse ESB;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Upstream Brewing Company;i tried this both on cask and on regular tap. The cask version was far superior with lots more hops character and my rating for it follows. The body was hazy dark copper with an off white head. The aroma was toffee along with some iced tea. The taste was bitter orange peels with some wood. This was solid with a smooth body.
Upstream Firehouse ESB;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Upstream Brewing Company;12 oz draft at the brewpub (old market location). Pour is slightly hazed orange copper with a small off white head. Aroma of mineral grains, toasted with some earthy British hops. Taste mirrors the nose quite closely, featuring mainly on the toasted grain. The hops give a slightly bitter crispness that leads to a quick finish. Palate is clean, and quite drinkable. This went really well with the excellent Pork Schnitzel.
Upstream Firehouse ESB;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Upstream Brewing Company;Draft sample at Upstream Old Market. Poured clear copper color with an average creamy white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate toasted malt and citrus hop aroma. Medium body. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met.
Upstream Firehouse ESB;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Upstream Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. This is the first out of six beers that have featured any significant head. It pours a hazy amber-orange with creamy off-white head. On the nose are toasty malt and an herbal hop note that reminds me a bit of juniper berries. Light to medium-bodied and slick with a moderately bitter hopped finish. Sweet, lightly toasty pale malt with an earthy hop finish that lingers a bit after the swallow. This is a decent brew, but Iï¿½d have to say, after sampling six of Upstreams brews, Iï¿½m left feeling pretty underwhelmed.
Upstream Firehouse ESB;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Upstream Brewing Company;Tap @ brewpub: Clear amber with an off-white head and lots of clingy lacing. The carbonation is plentiful with flavors of British hops. The aroma is pretty balanced, but the flavor has the typical sharp bitterness. It tastes pretty close to the Pale Ale. Ok.

Upstream Downtown Brown Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Brown Ale;Upstream Brewing Company;Draught: The beer pours a clear brown color. It has an off-white head that doesn't last long and laces down the side of the glass just a little. There is a very mild aroma to it. Some malt sweetness to the nose. The taste is medium-light maltiness, with a hint of hops. Slightly sweet. Somewhat boring.

Upstream Old Market Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Upstream Brewing Company;This is probably the best of the regular ales made at Upstream. Unfortunately, that is not saying much. Does have a roasted flavor, but there is very little stout to it. This pub brewery could learn to add a little more malt to its brews. Take it from the locals, just come here to eat.
Upstream Old Market Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Upstream Brewing Company;Nice stout. Attractive beer with nice roastiness, some smoky notes too, and depth of malt character. Hop balance as well.

Words to describe this beer are bland and forgettable.
Schell Zommerfest;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;August Schell Brewing Company;Rating: 89.3 The Current Kï¿½lsch, which is NOT the same beer (even though this site says it is). Same means same. Different means different. 5.0% ABV is different from 4.8% ABV. Anyway... Sweet, slightly hoppy aroma. Clear golden color with a white head that takes awhile to dissipate. Carbonation is evident. Taste is as expected from the aroma, nicely balanced. Initial bitterness that hangs around for the aftertaste. This is a very nice beer. Not as light as I expected, but probably more true to style.
Schell Zommerfest;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;August Schell Brewing Company;Pour from a tall boy can. Clear yellow pour with a white head that goes away pretty quickly. This is refreshing, slightly bitter, a little corn. Not bad.

O'Hanlon's Myrica Ale;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Mill At The Pier, Wigan 07/03/2002 Golden coloured and very sweet on the palate. Slight bitterness and dryness in a full hop finish.
O'Hanlon's Myrica Ale;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;(500 ml Bottle, aged 2 years, bottled for Vitis Wines as Bog Myrtle Ale (Drunkenmonk)) I have tasted a young version of this and the O'Hanlons own from cask and the beer is too tart but sweet. This aged bottle though has matured into a little beauty. The tartness develops into Peach / Apricot notes rather like Lindemans Pecheresse. There is a natural fizz throughout the glass, a pale orange body with a good thick head to it. All the oversweetness has gone and developed into a smooth mouthfeel. I reccomend thoroughly leaving this one to develop, from a cygnet to a swan.

Crisp, clean. A lovely pale ale. I imagine this was many people in Western Australia's first real introduction to hops and what they can do.

Little Creatures Pale Ale;Fremantle, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Little Creatures Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);This is a go to pale for me personally, and often have it in the beer fridge at home. Very balanced with slight hints of hops, pine and citrus. On the light end of medium bodied. Very Sessionable drop
Little Creatures Pale Ale;Fremantle, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Little Creatures Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle. Light amber colour with white head. Citrus hops, sweet malt, orange peel, tangerine, light bitterness, watery orange, light yellow grapefruit. Maltier and less hoppy than expected, this bottle might be a bit old though. Drinks more like a hoppier amber ale than a pale ale at this point, still works like this though
Little Creatures Pale Ale;Fremantle, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Little Creatures Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Good orangey gold body and okay modest head, smells of well balanced biscuity malts and sweet hops. Flavour is a vey nicely balanced hop and malt mix, soft sweet cracker and good oily hoppiness but not too overbearing. Full on the mouth. Really nice, well made pale ale with mass appeal.
Little Creatures Pale Ale;Fremantle, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Little Creatures Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Excellent pale ale, just the right amount of hoppiness for me. Very refreshing overall.
Little Creatures Pale Ale;Fremantle, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Little Creatures Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Out the can it's a nice average hoppy and malty mix of smells. Taste is the same, it's a really nice mixture of hops and a fresh tasting pale. I'd return to this even if it hit me.
Matilda Bay Redback Original;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);1 schooner on tap @ Ball and Chain. Pours clear golden with a medium head. Aroma is sweet malts with wheat and some banana. Flavor is sweet malts, wheat, banana. Pretty decent.
Matilda Bay Redback Original;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Bottle bought from an online antipodean supermarket. Sweet banana and clove aroma. Slightly hazy light brown. Thin translucent white head. Light bitter with a sweet edge. Banana and cloves. But muted and shandy like. Light-medium bodied. Slick. Flat carbonation. Slightly astringent finish. An old bottle discovered in the in-laws' fridge but I see comments are generally not great and remember being unimpressed when it was fresher. Weak here.
Matilda Bay Redback Original;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);"A refreshing Kristalweizen. ""Australian"" Weizen meaning Barrett Burston 'Ale' malt which aids a sweeter caramel note to the frain bill. Another Aussie wheat (BB or possibly even Joe White?) Aussie bittering hops courtesy of Pride or Super Pride. EU Saaz flavouring to a few IBU and what I assume is WB-06 weizen yeast which gives that more clovey aroma with a tart German finish. An old favourite of mine and brew at home quite often"
Matilda Bay Redback Original;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Aroma: wheat and cloves Palate: medium mouthfeel and carbonation Taste: good bubblegum flavours. Wheat. Clean palate. Low hop flavours as expected. Overall: good wheat beer

Fantï¿½me Saison;Soy-Erezï¿½e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantï¿½me;75cl bottle (BBF: end of 2020) from Rob the Gourmetsï¿½ Market in Brussels. F: huge, white, long lasting.

T: medium to full malty base, light orange, spicy, peach, bit herbal, dry on the palate, bit funky, higher yet not disturbing carbonation, aroma is bit better than taste but very good beer for the style, good balanced, fully enjoyed.

Hazy gold, hardly head. Light sweet. More sweet grain and cereal malts, caramel, molasses, sweet stone fruits, apricot, soft carbonation, medium bodied. Very nice. Draft at Independent Manchester Beer Convention 2019, Manchester.
Fantï¿½me Saison;Soy-Erezï¿½e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantï¿½me;Pours a clear, deep golden coloration with an amber hue, large, fluffy, stable head and visible carbonation. Smells of doughy, slightly grainy malt and strong fruity and slightly spicy yeast esters, with notes of green apple, pear, apricot, gooseberry, lime peel, clove and black pepper. Taste follows the nose, with some sweet'ish doughy, slightly grainy malt upfront, but being absolutely dominated by the quite complex and fruity yeast esters, with lighter spicy notes also coming through, as well as a very mellow tartness and just the merest hint of musty funk and a surprising bitterness in the finish, with notes of tart green apples, sweet pears, juicy apricots, tangy gooseberries, zesty lime peel, clove, black pepper and just a hint of star anise. Finishes with a light/medium bitterness and some fruity/spicy yeast esters lingering in the aftertaste. Sparkling, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and strong carbonation. While this is not quite what I imagined, it's still an excellent Saison that is a lot more tradtional and less funky than I expected though. However, there really is a marvellous depth and balance to the estery flavor profile here that is rather impressive, with quite vibrant fruity and spicy notes as well as a mild malt sweetness.
Fantï¿½me Saison;Soy-Erezï¿½e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantï¿½me;Bevuta alla spina al villaggio della birra. Aroma di campagna. Un po' amara. Fgp
Fantï¿½me Saison;Soy-Erezï¿½e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantï¿½me;Bottle shared at Hopa. I only took numerical notes while having this one. -
Fantï¿½me Saison;Soy-Erezï¿½e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantï¿½me;Draught at The Brewdog Bar, Birmingham. Gold with white head. There was some confusion in the bar as to exactly which Fantome Saison this was, but here goes. There is a fresh, tarty, yeasty character to this, sharp lemon notes with a white green grape flavour. Not sure that kegging this is the best option, makes it one dimensional, but it's drinkable.
Fantï¿½me Saison;Soy-Erezï¿½e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantï¿½me;For full disclosure a friend of mine bought this bottle and for one reason or another he left half of it at my house. I didn't want it to be wasted, but at the time of drinking it was of course refrigerated, but not fresh. That being said, onto the review... I have little experience with saisons, so I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one. Ugly peach pour with lots of visible sediments swirling around. Agitated it before pouring to alleviate some of this. Aroma is of sweet and sour berries. Tart raspberry, cherries and marmalade. Thin mouth was a bit funky due to not being fresh at the time of drinking. More malt than I was expecting, which allows this one to be balanced and prevents it from being overly tart. Not bad but unfortunately this was hindered by the lack of freshness I alluded to.
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;Pours orange amber with a quick disappearing white head. Aroma and taste are a decent mix of hops and malts with a crisp dry finish. Not a bad beer but nothing special.
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;bottle. Poured clear amber with a bleach white head. Aroma is faint and grainy. Light-medium body, crisp carbonation. Flavour of sweet malt, light bready-ness but still grainy, slight metallic finish.
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;Finally found a single of these guys at the LCBO. Clear yellow colour. Fairly mute aroma with a malt and grassy backbone that Iï¿½d swear were closer to a pils than an ale. Fast flavour profile, watery mid palate and a terrible experience over all. Why would anybody buy a sixï¿½er of these is beyond me.
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;Draft - Sweet malts and som corn. Pale clear gold with a small white head. Sweet corn, apple and pale malts. Much too sweet and light.
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;Bottle, brought to me by Robbie. Light golden, weak white head formation and retention. Old dirty dishrag aroma. Thin and watery with an unclean grainy profile. Didnï¿½t finish it-- not your fault Robbie!
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;Tap at The Social, Port Hope. Pours a hazy straw with a thin head. Aroma is slightly corny, ashy aroma. Light to medium body, medium carbonation. Orange, honey, candy caramel, popcorn, a little butter... Itï¿½s fine.
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;On tap @ The Boathouse Belleville. Pours a clear gold with a moderate white head. Aromas are sweet malts and corn. Tastes are adjunct (corn), grains, and the mildest hint of bitterness. Fairly thin and clean on the palate. Not a great beer but better than your standard mass produced swill, in particular, it doesnï¿½t have the tinny, alcohol finish I often notice. ---Rated via Beer Buddy
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;Bottled sample at Brothers Beer Bistro in ottawa. Decent tastin pale ale. Very drinkable
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;Pours a deep yellow gold, thin white head. Aromas of cereal and biscuit, some sweetness like cinnamon or vanilla hiding in the background. Moderately high carbonation up front, nicely balanced in the centre with a toffee chewiness to the malt side and some bittering hops (could do with an extra handful or 2!) which bring a crisp but not overly dry finish. Probably wouldnï¿½t buy again but could see this being a good session beer.
Church-Key Northumberland Ale;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Church-Key Brewing;"Draught at Cï¿½est What, Toronto Light amber color, clean. Light aroma of paper, corn, malt, cereals. Crispy mouthfeel, but the flavor has accents of cereals and hay, a bit strange; ordinary bitterness. Simple beer, but not too bad."
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;An ancient bottle. Clear pale yellow color, small white head. Aroma of subtle straw. Taste is bitter lemonade.
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;"On tap at Kraftbrau. Slightly hazy yellow body, thin off-white head. Light, sweet, biscuity aroma with grassy hops. Biscuity, grassy body with light sweetness, flavorful and crisp, with the ""lemon and cookies"" I expect in the better examples of this style. Light beer that is pleasing and tasty, and complex in its own right. It can be done, and Kraftbrau nailed this one."
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;That fuzzy, saaz hops mouthfeel is good. Sour, but well balanced. I didnï¿½t get too much citrus, but all together, atmosphere and beer came together for a good experience.
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;Pale orange hefeweizen look to the beer with a very frothy white head attached. Smells much like an IPA, grapefruit peel, coriander, slight banana/bubble gum. Very nice flavor. Some apple peel, a sourness in the back of the mouth, tangy, slightly citrusy, almost like the tang of lemonade presugared. Interesting because I can't recall ever having a Helles before and really don't know what to expect from the style. Hopefully this is what is expected. Enjoyable.
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;Beautiful beer. Nice white head. Smells like Deutshland. Very malty flavor. An awesome tasting beer.
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;Dark yellow and slightly hazy with a small head. Earthy spicy hop aroma and flavor, and strangely: notes of banana and phenols?! Almost like a Bavarian weizen mixed with Helles. Weird and unique but not bad. Sweetish flavor and balanced, almost alkaline finish - do I detect some lychee or corn like DMS components?
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;Courtesy of the esteemed Psychprof. Mine pours with a mega-foamy head, which others don't mention. Hmmm, hope this isn't off. Looks nice, anyway. Nice buttery fresh bread aroma, soft but noticeable. Flavor is mild,dry,fresh, grassy, slightly citrusy. Can't say after one that this is a world classic, but I'm not really that knowledgeable in the style and this is coming on the heels of a couple of intense stouts. Will save my 2nd bottle for a really hot day. Very nice dry slightly bitter finish, good body, a winner for sure.
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;This brew had a fruity aroma with a light orange transparent colored body. It poured a small head of white bubbles. It has a sweet carbonated taste and left a good lacing that stayed on the glass for a very long time. Overall it was very nice and very drinkable and left a dry aftertaste.
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;Just the slightest hint of cloudiness. Great aroma--a nice range fo bright hop smells. Malt character is almost perfect. Bright on the tongue initially, then it envelops the tongue with straw-like flavos and then lets you off at the end with another kiss of hops and that slightest hint of sourness that takes the edge of the sweetish finish. An almost perfet helles. Psychprof thanks for promoting and providing this beer. A standout.
Kraftbrau Helles;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kraftbrau Brewery;So I saved this one for last of the Kraftbraus I brought back from Kzoo on Eccentric day, under Michael's spell. There is a great beer store in Kzoo called by some woman's name Tracey's, Trixies? It's out west of town a bit. Anyway, they have a good selection of beers and claim to have more Kraftbrau readily availiable than does the brewery itself. Enough preamble: I make a little bread now and then and have a habit of slathering my rising doughs with interesting oils. If you chewed a bit of my rising dough recently coated in a flaxseed/canola mixture, you'd approximate the malty rise of this brew. But the beer doesn't quit there - as the good professor opines, there is plenty of Hallertauer flower power to balance and accent. It's a deceptively easy drinking brew - I finished the glass greedily - but, alas, I'd only brought one ... this becomes my new fave of the style, taking over from the wonderful Great Lakes version, which is a perennial standard in my fridge.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;some good malt flavor on this semi-local brew that pours an amber color and had the flavor hint of a red, albeit slightly so.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;tap at the brewpub - Pours dark amber. The aroma is a nice caramel malt and hop blend with a flavor to match. It has a decent hops bite to it. Good session brew.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;I enjoyed this interesting offering. Poured a dark red-brown, with a very thin off-white head and rather foul-looking yeast sediment. Strong toasty aroma. Flavor was very tangy and somewhat acidic, with toast, woody flavors, and sweet caramel balancing dark fruits and sourness. Poured rather flat (surprising considering many Kraftbrau beers are overcarbonated), which detracted somewhat from the palate. Munich Red is still a rich, tasty lager that deserves consideration.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;Very deep amber color to it, toward a dark blood brown. Very foamy cream head. Smells of hops, lemon peel, dirt. Burnt marshmallow flavor, an IPA grapefruit quality to it. Again the nose doesn't add to the flavor of the beer. It exists apart from the taste when it should compliment it. The aftertaste is a grapefruit peel flavor which is bitter and nice. OK beer but nothing too great.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;Dark reddish brwon hue with small head and some lace. Aroma hints of malty caramel, zesty fruity hops, sourdough bread, and earthy yeast esters. Taste starts malty but then a fruity twang helps balance palate. Minor acidic finish. Thi to medium-bodied with a fizzy and dry mouthfeel. A good session beer, nothing outstanding but nothing bad either.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;Draught at Kraftbrau Sept. 27th 2003. Dark amber, slight white head. Malt hop aroma. Lacking in body. Slight sour taste in background. Still decent and doesn't take much away from the beer. Almost has a slight burnt taste. Caramel notes. Cheers to Vale for being a great hostess that night, made my trip to Kalamazoo quite enjoyable.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;RBSG2003 (extended) (On tap at the brewery) Murky copper beer. Small, khaki-colored, frothy head with decent lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, yeast, caramel, dark bread, dark fruit and jalapeno pepper. The flavor is basically pink grapefruit juice... with fizz. That's all. That's enough. Delicious. Medium bodied with a watery mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, bitter, astringent finish... much like pink grapefruit juice. Grassy at the very end. Very good brew!
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;Small head full of small to medium bubbles that quickly disappear. It has a dark red transparent color. Its taste is carbonated and very smooth. It has OK lacing and a slight malty aroma. A nice brew, buy I found it's aroma and tastes hard to describe.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;Bottle, drank one day after picking it up at the brewery: Pours a reddish brown with a creamy tan head. Earthy malt aroma. The body is smooth, with some graininess, sourness, and a sweet tasty finish. I found this to be a very drinkable, good rendition of a seldom seen German style.
Kraftbrau Munich Red;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kraftbrau Brewery;Deep amber red in appearance. Nutty maltiness with a slightly dry, grassy finish. Quite smooth and a good body. I really like the lagers form this small brewery.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;very dark, sour nip..fruit..mild sharpness...toasty...eh, this brewery is filled with underage kids, why didnï¿½t I discover this 3 years ago, well iï¿½ve never loved their beer anyway.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Darker, amber color. Decent aroma, fuzzy hops aroma. Well balanced. Would go well with spicey food. Malts were smooth.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Unfiltered draft sampler at Kraftbrau. Iï¿½m a fraid this one struck an off note with me. The malt taste here was more burnt than anything else at first impression. That taste mitigates after a while, leaving a more pleasant nose of dark coffee. In other words, a lagered stout. The waitress said it may be off because the batch was just tapped the day I came in.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Out of a bottle (and Psychprof said it may be old). Dark amber in color. This is the second bottle I've had from Kraftbrau that is so overcarbonated that it took me quite a while to just get it into the glass. Very lively on the tongue. Some bready nuttiness, but lots of pungent sourness too. Unpleasant soapy tartness. Next time I get to K-zoo I'll make a point to try this again at the brewery.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Ruby brown hue with fizzy tan head and fair lace. The aroma hinted of sour apple, grape, biscuit, nutty malt, caramel, and soapy yeast esters. Crisp and lively mouthfeel lead to a initial taste of buttery burnt toast and acidic fruity character. Somewhat bitter on the short finish with an lingering wet hay taste. Different and initially quaffable, but the unique taste got boring quick. Nice to try once though.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Poured a dark red-brown color, with an intense (read: over the top) creamy tan head. Another overcarbonated Kraftbrau brew. Aroma of detergent, wood, and dark fruit. Flavor was haunted by a peculiar touch of wet socks, with tangy, earthy, woody malt flavors and a touch of dark fruit as well. Tart, carbonated mouthfeel. A medley of flavors to contemplate, but the palate seemed a bit confused. Refreshing but blah...
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Very hoppy smelling. Nice deep brown lager. Nice foamy tan head. Nice toffee flavor. Sweet and smooth. Maybe some chocolate, coffee. Nice flavor but again with Kraftbrau the aroma doesn't contribute to the flavor.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Draught at Kraftbrau Sept 27th 2003... Really dark amber. Beige head almost white. Not much identifiable in the aroma. Very slight bitters hitting the sides of my tounge. Malty. Cheers to Vale for being a great hostess that night, made my trip to Kalamazoo quite enjoyable.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;RBSG2003 (extended) (On tap at the brewery) Beautiful, deep, sparkling clear mohogany brew. Small head, quickly and fully dissipating. The aroma holds Russian black bread, smoke, tawny port and molasses. The flavor is of rich malt, but not much else. Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Mid-length, bitter and tangy finish.
Kraftbrau Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Deep red mohagony color with a nice sweet, roasted and tangy aroma. Good level of maltiness--chocolate malts present, also some toasted. Bitterness well balanced and a fresh and enjoyable beer.
Kraftbrau Blackberry Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Big surprise...blackberries dominate this one with caramel malts and bready yeasts in the background. An average beer that was not helped by the sub-zero temps outside. Perhaps this would have been better in the summer...perhaps.
Kraftbrau Blackberry Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Intense blackberry aroma. Munich dark malt lends a pronounced roastiness...caramel/toffee/chocolate with a hint of biscuit. Markedly over-sweet to my taste...and WAY too much fruitiness. Nice experimental effort, which Iï¿½d like to encourage, but the resullts here were spotty.
Kraftbrau Blackberry Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Prety much all blackberry aroma, tiny caramel bits float by. Nice body, flavor hard to get to! Lots of blackberry.
Kraftbrau Blackberry Dunkel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;I had this at Kraftbrau in Kalamazoo. Ruby red color with a thick creamy head. Extreme blackberry nose and taste. Almost overpowering. Super tart taste. For my taste it is overly fruity with no other textures to be found.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;Very smooth. Some hints of a wheat offering. Drinkable and a good starter brew to set up your palate.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;not a bad beer. rather simple, but certainly drinkable. typical dark malts in the nose and body with slight bitterness in the finish.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;Has a dirty copper body with abundant sediment and a thin off-white head. Aroma is sweet and fruity, with pears and spicy, grassy hops aspects. Body starts with fruity (pear) malts which are quickly followed by spicy, earthy hops and biscuit/toast. hennes is right- this does have a wheaty, tangy flavor to it. Luckily this bottle (along with my last Kraftbrau) was not overcarbonated. Has a spicy aftertaste. I'm not the biggest fan of the style but this is a decent offering.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;Fairly average to good across the board. A light malt taste is present, which adds to the beer's taste, but in no way, makes it a flavor powerhouse. Amberish in color, with some light caramel present. A good offering for new-to-micro drinker, but it could use a titch more flavor.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;Bottled. Thanks to PsychProf for this one. Cloudy amber hue, interesting aroma... Somewhat yeasty, perhaps, with a very mild fruity/citrus smell. Nothing like other Viennas I have tried. Very smooth drinking and nothing to smat the finish up. Pretty nice.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap in KZoo: Light amber hue with good head and lacing. Tart fruit, crisp yeast, mild toasted malt, and a hint of wheat aroma. Starting tangy and crisp, malt sweetness appeared on the finish to make this a nicely balanced and smooth Vienna style lager. Thin to medium-bodied, lively mouthfeel with a very slight metallic feel. Very enjoyable brew, if in the Kalamazoo area, would recommend giving this one a spin.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;Huh. This is pretty weird - the thing tastes remarkably witty and even has the rollicking cloudiness of a good wheat brew. The flavour has some wit characteristics, too - spice and yeast and citrus and a good peppery tickle in the throat. It has a medium body rendered light and delicate by the flavors. Probably it's main distinguishing characteristic, though, is it's explosive bottle conditioning. It reminds me a lot of my trading days and those over exuberant bottles of Georgia microbrew. The rise of lace just kept coming and coming ... inexorable and lively as the sediment flecked roll of clouds in the glass after.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;I like it too, Michael - it's the best of the beers Sean brought back from eccentric day, IMO. The flavour is big and spicy, and the cludy orange is delightful.
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;Rerate: On tap at the brewery. Definitely not spoiled as the bottles I had were. Has a really strong sourish malt component. Smacking hop bitterness rolls in a bit later. Good. Original: Dry with sourish malt components, plus a good hop bite. The aroma was fabulous, and promised a more normal, sweetish vienna than what was offered. Still, I liked it far better than the other 3 raters here. Not nearly as good (within style or overall) as Kraftbrau Helles, which is tremendous!
Kraftbrau Vienna;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kraftbrau Brewery;Light copper with the most head of all 12 Kraftbraus that I tried at their little brewpub. Nearly identical to the Mexican beer Negra Modelo except a bit fresher.
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub: Pours a yellow gold with a white head. Aroma, grassy and floral hops, some yeast and bready pale malts. Flavor, pale malts up front with some fruity notes, and a floral hop finish.
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;draft at the brewpub - Pours hazy gold and has a mild hops aroma. This one tastes very well balanced. Itï¿½s a fairly light flavor as befits the style and finishes clean and crisp. It wonï¿½t blow most people away, but itï¿½s a light, enjoyable session brew.
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;Decent, if unremarkable, Czech-style pilsener. Some fruitiness in the initial flavor...someone said tart cherries, I dunno, but iï¿½ll go with it. Could stand some more carbonation for my liking. Drinkable but better choices are to be found here.
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;Well balanced, proper amount of bitterness. Soft, fuzzy mouthfeel. A little bit a of a kick above typical pils. Malty, carbonated. Mossy.
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;Unfiltered draft sampler at Kraftbrau. Hereï¿½s the defining moment for a self-professed beer geek. Can I actually tell the difference between types of lagers at this lager-specialty pub? Maybe not in a blind tasting, but at least I could tell they were different.This is much lighter in hops and carbonation that the Down Home Brew I had before this. The head is thin and just wanders off its slightly hazy body. This has a very slight cherry tinge from the yeast. That settles down and it finishes more like a plain olï¿½ lager.
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;As much as I profess not to like Lagers/Pilsners, I must say that I'm not sure there's anything any more appealing than a Pilsner, fresh from the DBF, chilled to perfection, poured correctly into a room temperature Pilsner Glass, as it stands there all proud with its gold body crowned by a bright white head and the condensation forming and running down the glass, just makes your mouth water doesn't it? The beer as it excavates itself from the 12 ounce brown bottle is the quintessential pilsner limpid gold color with a modest bright white head that is semi-creamy in texture, the lace forms a velum like curtain to drape the glass. Nose is the prototypical pilsner sweet malt, quite crisp and fresh to the senses, the start is slightly sweet, nice malt presence, and the top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a moderate acidity, the hops personable in their spiciness, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste. As Iï¿½m on the ï¿½Fat Boyï¿½ program, and I just finished an hours worth of PT, thatï¿½s ï¿½Physical Trainingï¿½ for you civilian types, this beer sure does hit the ï¿½Bï¿½ Spotï¿½ and as I can have only one beer a day, I choose them quite carefully, and I must say a good choice on my part!
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;A tale of two Kraftbrau pilseners ended on this sad note. Bohemian is a boring lager, reminiscent of St. Pauli Girl, Beck's, or other cheap imports. It even had a skunky aroma, which was surprising as this poured from a brown bottle. Probably just the nature of the hops. Poured cloudy yellow-orange, with a white head. Bland, lightly spicy (and skunky) aroma ended with a floral, semi-fruity but unsatisfying flavor reminiscent of said overrated beverages. I'm sorry the tale began on such an optimistic note but ended in a less satisfying manner!
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;This looks like a belgium white beer. Orange cloudy beer with pronounced white head. Funny I read this below. It does smell like pepperoni pizza! Cheese, salt, sulfur. Tastes like a belgian white, lemon citrus flavor and wheat. Tastes better than it smells. Not the best but OK for Kraftbrau. Keeps them jumping with Bell's.
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;Straw hue with almost no head or lacing. Perplexing aroma of piney and spicy hops, toasted malts, cheesy yeast, salt and orange zest. Hints of a pepperoni pizza? Watery and fizzy mouthfeel leads to a grass like hop and dry malt taste. Short and clean finish. Salty tones are detected as well during the aftertaste. An okay summer quaffer, would rather have a true Czech Pils over this.
Kraftbrau Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kraftbrau Brewery;Got this in a growler two days ago, and finally got a chance to have it. Quite sweet really, rather watery too. Not much of a palate here, except for a slight hoppy finish, (very slight at that.)
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Got htis one on tap at the brewpub. Maroon-ish white head, nice amber body. Nice mild malty flavour, with just a little hops taste at the end. A quality doppelbock
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. This one was the best of the bunch that sampled. The ABV is nicely hidden in this malty brew. Toffee, dried fruit, plums, and an underlying sweetness to the finish made this one quite enjoyable.
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Poured ruby-colored with rich, golden highlights, mostly flat, with a thin line of halo above. A hint of fruit started the aroma (and I stand by my wifeï¿½s observation of ""cherry""). Additional aromas were light plastic and leather with rye, pepper and a sharp hit of alcohol. My first guess at this was a ""rye bock"" and it seems I wasnï¿½t too far off base. I simply loved the way this felt... starting lightly syrupy, moving to smooth and buttery, and finally finishing with astringence to cut it off sharply at the end. Flavor found sweet malts and light sugars with intoxicating fruity syrups to round it out. It was the alcohol that made me change my guess from ""bock"" to ""doppelbock"" and I surprisingly hit the nail on the head. At an improptu meeting of the LoSBD"
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;"At a mini-meeting of The LoSBD, RAYBOY01 imposed a blind taste test on MrsFrankenkity, frankenkitty, and me from a growler he brought back from a brews cruise. ""Guess the style."" Damned if I knew, and I wasnï¿½t alone in that. It looked like a reddish iced tea. The aroma was fruity, cherries, as MrsFrankenkity pointed out immediatey. Bananas as it warmed, but I believe I was alone in that observation. A bit of alcohol, too. A tad thin, but that might have been the result of its travels. The flavor was fruity, but more like dried dark fruits, along with a toffee-ish, sweet malt and dark brown sugar. Not a bad drink, but, DOPPELBOCK??? WTF! A growler tasting from El_Borrachoï¿½s and RAYBOY01ï¿½s Michigan brews cruise."
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Rich roasted malts with a strong caramel/toffee base...but also some dried fruits...raisins and figs...come along for the ride as well. Big abv pretty well concealed. Texture is slightly syrupy and the sweetness can push the envelope towards cloying, but generally a pretty good effort.
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Appears a mahogany color with a small head that fades quickly. Smell is of malty toffee with tons of sugary malt mixed sweetness and a slight sourness going on. Taste is of the same aromas with a breadiness that seems very authentic to me. Mouthfeel is smooth, bready, medium bodied, and pretty nicely done.
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;dark reddish body with minimal off-white head...aroma of roasted malts, faint hops, and a few spices...flavor is strong and was full of roasted malts and sugars, and a few other flavors that i just couldnt put my finger on...pleasant on the mouth
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Poured deep, cloudy red-brown with nary an off-white head (only a few bubbles). Tangy dark malt aroma, toasty with a hint of alcohol. The flavor never quite came together for me- the beer had a definite tangy character with a touch of caramel and fruit and a toasty character with just a hint of raisin. Alcohol wasn't domineering. Overall not a bad beer but not noteworthy or exceptional.
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Dark brown hue with little head or lace. Aroma is very amlty with hints of caramel, coffee, molasses, roasted nuts, biscuit, prune, and earthy yeast esters. The taste is very sweet and heavy malted. There are muted undertones of fruit, nuts, smoke and syrup. The alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is slightly sticky and soft, a bit coy. While this brew has some nice characteristics, it laces a hop punch to provide complete balance.
Kraftbrau Doppelbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;bery dark brown almost black, when held to the light a little ruby color shows through, small dark brown head, nice pleasing sweet malt aroma. full bodied and very malty with sweet caramel and chocolate malts, and a touch of bitterness in the finish. Very tasty
75th Street Good Hope IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;75th Street Brewery;Not a bad IPA. It has a a lot more body than Iï¿½d expected. Well balanced and even a little sweet. Tried for the first time in 2008.
75th Street Good Hope IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;75th Street Brewery;Orange amber color on tap at the brew pub, with a short sticky off white head.

75th Street Good Hope IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;75th Street Brewery;Not bad and a little above average. The aroma was of citrus and floral hops. The color a more ginger color with a white head. Crisp and carbonated palate that was relatively light. Good hop flavor that was not too harsh and balanced with caramel malts. Easy to drink and versatile with food.
75th Street Good Hope IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;75th Street Brewery;Cloudy apricot color. Good white head retention. Aroma of fruity esters. Fruity, floral hoppy taste. Incredible balance with just a touch of german malts on the finish. The balance makes for a superb beer. The heavy white lacing doesnï¿½t hurt either... always a good sign.
75th Street Good Hope IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear golden amber with a white head that lasts throughout the beer and laces nicely. Aroma has light tropical fruit and grass with a hint of pine.

75th Street Good Hope IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;75th Street Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured medium gold with a large white head that left some lacing. Aroma was floral hops, quite perfumey, with a touch of citrus and caramel. Flavor was floral, citrus, slightly spicy hops, caramel, bready. Nice English-style IPA but really juiced on the floral hops. Medium mouthfeel. Probably my favorite of the flight I tried there.
75th Street Good Hope IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;75th Street Brewery;Pours a lightly hazy golden amber with a medium creamy off white head that left sticky lacing. Aroma of orange and some other citrusy hop notes, bready cereal grain maltiness. Flavor of pine, grapefruit and lightly spicy hop profile. Malt profile is more on the cereal grain profile as opposed to much of any sweet caramel malt notes (which I prefer).
75th Street Possum Trot Brown Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;75th Street Brewery;Tap at brewery. Nose is nutty toasted malt. Palate is light, low carbonation. Roast character. Some faint baking cocoa. Finishes dry. Solid but unexciting.
75th Street Possum Trot Brown Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;75th Street Brewery;Drinkable but not too exiting. The beers here are average and in an ever-growing industry the beers need to be exceptional and unique. This is a safe beer. Mild roasted aromas. Dark brown color almost like a Porter. Thin and watery palate. Flavors are roasted and nutty with some chocolate character. Average at best.
75th Street Possum Trot Brown Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;75th Street Brewery;Enjoyed the first pour off a new keg. It was creamy and very hazy. Hints of caramel or toffee, but no sweetness. Amazing beer!

75th Street Possum Trot Brown Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;75th Street Brewery;Tap pours a dark reddish brown with cream colored head. Nice earthy barley aroma with light chocolate roasted notes. The flavor is rich with a nice roasted grain profile while being light and very approachable. A good bit of nuttiness with light bittersweet chocolate, some dark fruits, a funky cherry rhubarb, and a solid bit of drying earthy lightly herbal hops round it. The hops are nice not over their bounds for style but stretching the norm. Nice sparkling carbonation brightens the sense near creamy brew. Would like to try on nitro.
75th Street Possum Trot Brown Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;75th Street Brewery;Tap. Pours a dark ruby red color. Tan colored head. Aroma is malty, chocolatey and gentle roast. Flavor is roasty, perhaps a bit nutty, malty. Dry finish but not too bitter. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Aroma was malty, light roast, slightly resinous hops. Flavor was moderately malty, some nuttiness, faint chocolate. Mouthfeel was thin, a bit astringent, sort of fizzy. So-so brown ale.

75th Street Possum Trot Brown Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours a deep brown color with white head. Roasted, nutty, malty, toffee flavors. Pretty good brown, my favorite beer of their main beers.
75th Street Muddy Mo Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;75th Street Brewery;Dark brown. Very sweet, almost extract like. Not creamy at all. Pretty boring stout.
75th Street Muddy Mo Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;75th Street Brewery;Pretty average stuff here. If had an aroma of roasted malts but not much else. The color was a dark brown which was on target for the style. The palate was somewhat watery and finished dry. The flavors were of chocolate roasted malt and a little bit of hops. Decent but unexceptional.
75th Street Muddy Mo Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;75th Street Brewery;Smooth without being heavy. This stout has a nice flavor with hints of coffee. No trace of bitterness and it doesnï¿½t linger on your palate.

75th Street Muddy Mo Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;75th Street Brewery;Black and creamy, sticky tan head, with a pleasant, lightly sweet chocolate taste. Said to be Irish-style but this is more middle-of-the-road than dry. Easy to like. I believe the menu said 4.75% abv rather than 5.7%, but anyway I found it went down quickly.
75th Street Muddy Mo Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Comes almost black with an average tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee. Taste is malt, coffee, and a hint of chocolate. Fairly thin bodied. Pretty decent.

75th Street Royal Raspberry Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;75th Street Brewery;An okay, very sweet raspberry beer. Tried for the first time in 2008. Light and fruity. Raspberry comes through aggressively.
75th Street Royal Raspberry Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;75th Street Brewery;On tap at Yard House. Nice aroma with raspberry. Very light in color, and very light in flavor too. The raspberry was slightly present and I really did not get any of the wheat features that are present in most wheat beers.
75th Street Royal Raspberry Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;75th Street Brewery;Faint wheat and raspberry jam in the nose. Watery, light palate. Very light bready wheat backdrop with a splash of raspberry. The watery body is very distracting. It tastes diluted. Not good.

75th Street Royal Raspberry Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;75th Street Brewery;Least fav of all the selections at 75th Street. The raspberry flavor is not strong or particularly accurate/realistic. The wheat aspect is fair, but overall the taste of this beer reminds me of gym socks.
75th Street Royal Raspberry Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;75th Street Brewery;A cloudy lemon colored beer. White ring for a head. Nice raspberry aroma with a little bit of wheat malt. The raspberry taste is prominent and its clear that quality ingredients are used. A nice hopping balances things out. There is some tartness in the flavor. Its not too sweet. Not my favorite flavors but very well made. The soapy lacing decays slowly.
75th Street Royal Raspberry Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub.

Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);old school TJï¿½s beer from back in the day - just filling in backlog.

Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Tasted bottle from Trader Joeï¿½s into standard pint glass. Light amber color with weak white head. Bready, some caramel and fruit, clean finish. Not outright flawed, better than most light lagers, but generic. Not recommended.
Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pours quickly into a well-carbonated but quickly-dissapating and sad 1/4-inch head. Itï¿½s gone in under a minute, although the beer has a bit of bubble to it. Pours a typical amber color and has a forgettable malt aroma. Watery with a slight malt taste, followed by a mediocre and slightly bitter aftertaste. Remains on the palate and reminds me of every light macrobrew out there. Not a bad beer for 25-cent bottle night and not offensive, but i canï¿½t imagine anyone claiming this as their favorite after a few months of being the legal drinking age.
Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pours a copper or amber color with a medium head. Aroma of light caramel. Taste is somewhat malty with a dry finish. Light hops flavor as well. Smooth on the palate with light fizz. Ultimately a very drinkable lager, but would get lost in the shuffle.
Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Toast, caramel, and light cherry aroma. Clear copper, brief medium head. Lots of maraschino cherry flavor from start to finish. Decent balance. Pretty nice red ale. It isnï¿½t a style I like, but this one is well done.
Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Purchased at Trader Joe in Nashville on my trip there. Pours a dark amber colour, clean, with an off-white head that is big, foamy, with average retention and leaves great webbing. Yeasty nose with a little malt. Watery mouthfeel with a medium-thin body. I guess they have changed they recipe since the beginning, as this one does not taste much caramel anymore (like older reviews). Kind of boring, with a little bitterness. A little sweet malt. Mildly crisp, and still boring. A monster that does not scare at all.
Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Dark, extra amber pour with a creamy, off-white head that failed to last the duration. That will affect the final score. Malt is cheap and dying heads suck the big one. No flavor, little hops. Looks better than it tastes. The label brags about barley and caramel hops and Jesus coming back to forgive us all whatever other bullshit youï¿½re willing to believe! 2 out of 5 is a gift!! Iï¿½m tired of artificial crap that doesnï¿½t deliver.
Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Amber copperish pour in the glass. Sweet and somewhat spicy. Better than expected. Rated 3/31/04
Gila Monster Amber Lager;Monrovia, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);A deep amber pour with decent white head.

Abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru;Montignies-sur-Roc, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs;"Bottle from Hopt. Aroma is brown and dark malt with caramel, candy sugar, yeast, spices, dried red fruits, raisins, cognac, hint of cola and liquorice root. Flavour is big candysugar sweetness, body is just a little above medium. Very sweet and sugary, not as good as the ""Brune"" for me."

Abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru;Montignies-sur-Roc, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs;Great happiness with Abbaye des Rocs previously, I have held Grand Cru back until now. I got the 11.2 fl oz bottle from some nice people in Belgium that delivered, in all ways. Iï¿½m using my ABGB snifter for this sampling because it is my choice. Yep. I pour firmly and down the center, a nice caramel colored body and a strong tawny brown head that settles. The scent, inviting as I hoped, dates, cut hay and cane sugar. But the taste tops all of it. I find toffee, wheat bread, alfalfa (like I ever eat that), light syrup and just a bit of grape, where did that come from? Not my favorite dark ale but I am pleased.
Abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru;Montignies-sur-Roc, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs;Deep orange-brown, small off-white head. Hot fruity aroma, of brown sugar, orange, raisins... taste follows, with dates, figs, spices... to be honest not quite what I expected. Quite a bit thinner than expected, with associated drop in flavor profile. Not bad by any means though.
New Glarus Raspberry Tart;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Glarus Brewing Company;"The aroma of raspberry permeates just from opening the bottle. Pours slightly hazy raspberry hued amber; frothy head. Massive flavor - tart raspberry as advertised. Crisp, with a tart -sweet finish. It's a one trick pony, but it does that trick better than anyone else. It is a delight."
New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Glarus Brewing Company;I have had this on several occasions and it never disappoints. Pour is brown with a hint of red. Aroma of cherries. The flavor is of tart cherries. There is so much fruit it is almost like a wine. Delicious beer.
New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Glarus Brewing Company;Interesting sirup but some side flavor make it strange. Aroma weird of cherry but strong wet towel. Color great: red copper. Aroma of cherry, some sour milk and wet towel again. Slightly sour finish. Strange, which makes you want to have more. And kind of good, I guess... 5/5/5/4/14 ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Neglected to add this from a couple of years ago. Pours mid yellow with a nice head. It drinkws ligth and crisp in all aspects and sghows a decent finish even without the depth.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Had July of 2000. Crazy story for me behind this beer, it involved a Grateful Dead concert a 1982 BMW and another factor which will remain nameless. Very refrshing beer, nice amber color. Taste was somewhat earthy and herby with a light spice from the wheat. Fond memory-eh sort of.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;This is a VERY good beer for a hot night. Rated from notes, last consumed from the bottle in summer ï¿½06. Light yellow color, wheaty aroma and flavor with nice mouthfeel and finish. Nearly as good as Yokel, which evidently replaced this.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;In the bottle at the 2007 Baburek backyard vintage beer tasting. Pours pale yellow with a good white head. A very clear beer which was surprising to me. Really strong wheat flavor. I did not realize that this was a Landbier. I think that I really must like this style. Crisp finish. This was a perfect beer to have on a hot summer evening.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Pours an odd amber orange with less than an inch of loose suds that disappears immediately. No lace - not a speck. I catch some hops and a fleeting peach aroma in the first sniff. No more peach again throughout the glass. Mildly malty up front, but it loses the maltiness in the finish. Actually it finishes dry, somewhat like a rye beer. Light carbonation, light body, with a little bit of residual tartness - almost lemony.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Pours a hazy light copper color, thin white head. This was different it had a slight sourness to it and big apple flavor the whole time. Just a good easy drinking beer in itï¿½s own unique way.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Besides the famous New Glarus fruit brews, I think this is their best brew, especially among the lighter styles, pils, blonde, naked, etc. Crisp rich lager, and an excellent example of a rare style. If you find a six of this its around three years old. Considering the low alcohol you would think it would be done by now, but to my surprise its still drinkable, however fresh itï¿½s even better. It looks like the new brew called Yokel is a reincarnation of the brew. Itï¿½s about time they brought back this beauty. Hopefully Yokel is as good as this once was.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle pulled from the depths of my parentï¿½s basement refrigerator. Bottle conditioned. Hazy golden color with bubbly white head. Very grainy nose and flavor. Like an oat factory. There is a touch of sweetness on the tongue with a bisuity flavor complemented by a mellow yeastiness. Crisp finish.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Only beer in this style Iï¿½ve had was St. Georgenbrau Kellerbier. Better flavor, more drinkable and I donï¿½t believe itï¿½s possible to get a bad bottle of New Glarus. Very nice beer. Canï¿½t wait to get my hands on more.
New Glarus Zwickel;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Nice gold, slightly hazy body. Soapy white head. German grainy hop aroma... some orange and grass hints, on a grainy body with some slight honey sweetness. Very good and balanced taste... some sweet honey orange taste, on a oaty/wheaty base. Pretty good overall.

Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Haacht;Pale hazy yellow with a rather small white head. Rather light aroma. Pronounced lemon, some wheat, some yeast. Flavour is light and tart. Quite lemony, rather dry. Rather thin, not the best white, but refreshing. (From tap)
Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Haacht;Keg on tap, 330ml, pasteurised, sampled at Brasserie America, Valkenburg, NL Limburg. Cloudy pale yellow with little head. This was a sharp, citric Wit, quite dry in character and fairly light on the pallate. Nicely refreshing, lemony, with a brief metallic finish, enjoyed sitting and watching the world go by. Surprised to see it manufactured elsewhere than the local brewery.
Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Haacht;I like Belgian Whites. This one isnï¿½t bad either although itï¿½s the one I like the least. A decent, but bit of boring aroma and flavor. You wonï¿½t hear me complaining when a bar has only this witbier, but I prefer Hoegaarden or Witte Trappist.
Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Haacht;On tap at Zwart, Amsterdam. Milky Witbier. Lightly flavoured, witha hint of water to the lemon. Smooth, with nice carbonation.

Dusty and yeasty wheat malty flavour with lemon peel and shy spicy herbal notes. Malty and fruity taste, light bodied with moderate carbonation. Short and quite thin fruity finish, slightly herbal. Refreshing and clean Wit but unfortunately way too thin.
Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Haacht;(Bottle 30 cl) Greyish orange with a small, compact head. Rather dry without much bitterness. Light-bodied and quenching - a very classical witbier. 120501
Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Haacht;Draft at the LeKlas Grand Cafe Restaurant in the Amsterdam train station. Appearance wa a small milky smooth white head, fair lacing, cloudy, uncarbonated, and a straw yellow hue. Aroma was malty, spicy and mild banana notes. Sweet, malty, banana, and spicy flavor. Decent. Smooth palate. Worth a try.
Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Haacht;The DM & Hotstuffï¿½s European Honeymoon trip beer number 101. This draft brew poured a medium head of finely sized mostly lasting white colored bubbles that left behind a good lacing. The body contained soft carbonation, was cloudy and yellow white in color. Its aroma contained mild wit notes with a slight malty banana scent . Its mouth feel is initially tingly and bubbly with biting hops and a smooth hoppy aftertaste. Its flavor contained nice wit malty hoppy notes and was very tasty.
Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Haacht;Typical, average belgian white. Spicy, yeasty and citrus in the nose. Hazy/cloudy, yellow coloured with a lasting white head. Taste is spicy, citrus, yeasty and wheaty. Decent. But like I said quite average. Refreshing.
Hinterland Honey Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Hinterland Brewery;I wasnï¿½t impressed with this beer. It tasted good and you can put down a few, but it lacked flavor for me. If I am going to have a honey wheat, I want more of a summer feel, it seemed confused. I think they tried to give it some hops and a little bit of a dark feel, but then donï¿½t give it enough flavor.
Hinterland Honey Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Hinterland tapper was mid-gold color with a sweet, clove-like fruity aroma. Taste was of malts and fruity wheat with a hint of honey in background - mildly hopped. Palate was nice. Overall, all nice light wheat brew.

Hinterland Honey Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Taste was a clear golden colour with virtually no head. Definately very smooth, and it had a nice touch of honey character. But as far as wheat goes, was very weak and on the palate came across very grainy.
Hinterland Honey Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Pours a golden yellow color with a nice creamy head.Slight aromas of honey and wheat malts.Flavor is the same as the aroma,honey and wheat.Not bad,but nothing stands out on this brew.
Hinterland Honey Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Lightly hazed golden color with a moderate white head. Mild malt-o-meal aromas along with a touch of dry honey and herbal hops. Light, but the honey helps. Flavors on pale malt and light cream of wheat. Some dough and hints of flowers as well. Finish is light and slightly sweet. Certainly one of the better wheat ales out there. It is what it is.
Hinterland Honey Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Hinterland Brewery;Golden color with medium white head. Aroma is honey, malts, wheat. Taste is much of the same. Could use some more complexity but it goes down smooth.

Hinterland Honey Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Hinterland Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Pours a clear light golden pale brew with a thin creamy white head that leaves behind some good lacing and ring. Aroma of light multi-grain malt with scents of bubblegum, banana esters and a touch of honey. Taste is light to medium bodied, smooth, creamy with very little carbonation. Flavors picked up include a balance of malt and yeast character. Finish is semi-sweet with a lingering bubblegum aftertaste.
Hinterland Honey Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Hinterland Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Faint honeyish sweetness in the otherwise malty nose. Light wheat flavor with faint honey on the finish.
Denisons Miami Weisse;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Berliner Weisse;Denisons Brewing Co. (Victoria St.);It is supposed to be a berliner weisse, but is quite restrained. The full body, tan colour, and background phenols and malt make this a cross between Berlin and Bavaria. The finish is mildly acidic. They tried to put grenadine in my glass, which sounds more than just a little repulsive. It's a tasty pint, but needs more Berlin and less Bavaria for my money. They already have a great Bavarian wheat, they don't need another.

Hahn Special Vintage 2000 Millennium Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle shared by STLWill at Woodshop 5.0 (2/20/10): Pours a transparent dark copper amber with a spotty-lacing off-white head. Aroma of semi-sweet dark caramel malt with some light fruity oxidation. Starts with pretty good fullness and light doughy caramel biscuity malts before a sweettart fruity finish. Has some signs of age, but is still quite drinkable and fairly complex.
Hahn Special Vintage 2000 Millennium Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Woodshop 5.0 ruled for many reasons. One reason it ruled was when Yespr was excited to see the bottle you held because he hadnï¿½t tried it before. Tasting side by side with him was cool. This had a rich, sweet and spicy barleywine nose. Taste is creamy and caramel and brown sugar.

Hahn Special Vintage 2000 Millennium Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Vintage 1999. 400th rate! Last bottle in my collection that was originally half a dozen. Ten years in the bottle, best part of 4 spent in my cellar, and it certainly looks worse for are with most of the label missing and dirt all over the side of the bottle. But itï¿½s whatï¿½s inside that counts right? Served in a big wine glass at cellar temperature, iï¿½m presented with a deep burnished copper body, reminisant of a tawny port. Seems to have a real depth to the clarity, perseived hazyiness, suggesting age. Offwhite collar of foam eventually dies off with legs that cling to the glass. Vinous nose straightupl; sultana, raisin, bitter orange, plum, date, honey and golden syrup sweetness. Undertones of oak, spice and alcohol. Very clean considering age! Smooth body, good length, texture is lean and dry from youï¿½d be led to believe from the nose. Nice welcome alcohol warmth towards the finish. Once again comparisons to a tawny port come to mind with the flavour; buttery nutty oak, sultanas, dates, brandy-like undertones, brown sugar, earthy spices perceived as cinnamon and nutmeg. Mildly bitter roasted malt notes and dark grain bread combine with subtle citrus and peppery alcohol flavours that linger and dry out the finish. Bitterness is quite low otherwise. Lovely complex and remarkably clean aged ale. Somewhat dry sherry-like at times, without the body. Excellent flavours and certainly is a beer that has stood the test of time very well indeed, especially consider its humble beginnings!"
Black Oak Pale Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Oak Brewing;"pours almost clear light golden with a small off-white cap offering some retention and lacing. good amount of spicy citrus, touch of toffee mingling into this bready and spicy english maltiness, crackery as well, relatively clean and mildly fruity yeast action. moderate carbonation, light body; hoppy but balanced spicy-citrusy finish. pretty nice north american english pale ale, if it makes any sense."

Black Oak Pale Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Oak Brewing;The best thing that I can say about this beer right now is that it seems like a fairly solid party beer. But for the fuller body and lack of crispness, this would come off as more of a hoppy lager/hybrid style. There just isnï¿½t much to it, a conservative dose of floral/spicy/citrus hops, some lemony notes and some grainy, cereal and subtle honey malt character. Not bad, just not great and not my definition of a Pale.
Black Oak Pale Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Oak Brewing;Cask. Aroma of hops, quite pleasant. Hazy body, good white head. The taste is weak and really nice but the finish is weak.

Black Oak Oktoberfest;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Oak Brewing;A very confused beer. Not enough malt (these guys really have trouble with the whole mashing thing), an excess of crystal malt and just no sense of what it wants to be when it grows up.
Anderson Valley Brother David's Double Abbey-Style Ale;Boonville, California, United States;Dubbel;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;caramel and a touch of red fruit not too deep but made well. malt syrup spritey with herb and vine. Marscapone and Almond. Lighter for the style but not light.
Anderson Valley Brother David's Double Abbey-Style Ale;Boonville, California, United States;Dubbel;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;A good example of a Belgian dubbel. Nice flavor, but slightly lacking that full belgian yeasty/hoppy flavor that you get in a true import. Not super pricey, so was worth the try. Paired with dinner and split with a friend, so had no problem finishing. When going with this style, I prefer the Trappists, Urquels, St. Bern, Unibroue, etc....but nice to try some US microbrews attempts. Similar to North Coast Old Pranqster. A bit on the red side.
Anderson Valley Brother David's Double Abbey-Style Ale;Boonville, California, United States;Dubbel;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;From Aug 2007 Another brew that I got in trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! Pours from waxed 22oz bottle a clear deep amber with a good head of foam that shrinks to a fine layer and it has some good lacing. The smell has strong notes of caramel malt along with some dark fruit and alcohol. The taste has the caramel malt in big abundance ie it's up in your face. After another sip or 2, the fruit gets more assertive with plum and fig and I get some chocolate as well.(not what I would expect from an Abbey Dubbel) Swishing the brew in my mouth, there's also a touch of sourness and I'd have to say, it's a pretty good tasting interpretation of a Belgian Dubbel at this point, but it *could* use a bit of tweaking. A few more sips in and the alcohol becomes more noticeable but it's not intusive, just warms my tummy a bit. It finishes on the semi sweet side and the aftertaste is on the short lived side. Not a bad brew but when I think of other Dubbels that I've tried and enjoyed, this one misses the mark for the style by a fair bit. I think it's the lack of spiciness.
Anderson Valley Brother David's Double Abbey-Style Ale;Boonville, California, United States;Dubbel;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Aroma is malty and light spicey with darker fruits. Taste is somewhat malty, light burnt sugars and chocolate. Light yeast spicey and sweet finish.

Wells Eagle IPA (5%);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Draft at some bar in Uxbridge Now this is finally bitter bitter. Maybe too much of it. Bitterness all over the place. Okay.
Wells Eagle IPA (5%);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"Gold-amber body with a bubbly off-white head that settles to a wispy ring leaving lots of lace. Aroma of sweet malts, crystal malt, grassy hops; there is a pungent character to it. Sweet malts, crystal malt, and hops balance nicely in the taste, crystal malt dominates in the after taste followed by a round hoppy-malty finish. Not as hopped up as North American IPAs."
Wells Eagle IPA (5%);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);IPA? Traditional (just) but drinks more like a PL...or have my tastes been so twisted by modern IPA? Real quaffer but absolutely nothing memorable at all. MOR bitter at best with some tangy metallic notes around the edges.
Wells Eagle IPA (5%);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"Ar: Light, corny malt; a hint of pineapple. Ap: Copper and clear; medium-large off-white head with very good retention, slowly receding into lattice structure, leaving stretchy foam patterns on the glass sides. T: Dry, grainy malt; very slight butterscotch; zesty, vinous hop flavor with a moderately clean high bitterness; a bit of melanoidin richness, but very, very slight; chalk and bitters on the finish. P: Medium body with high carbonation; finish is dry. O: A very clean copper ale with a noticeable though understated English character; bitter, lightly malty, and quaffable."
Wells Eagle IPA (5%);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Pours dark copper with a small white head. Aroma is malts up front with some hops in the background. Taste is malt, carmel and biscuit, more like a red lager than an ipa. Very disappointing.
Wells Eagle IPA (5%);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Clear, slight veil, dark amber color with dense activity. Slightly creamy beige 2 finger head, lasting around 10 minutes, with moderate legs. Flavors of sweet grains, barley, caramel, lemon, apples, faint molasses and nutmeg, ginger, peppercorn, and herbal spices. Slick medium body with crispy carbonation. Cereal and biscuit feel, moderate sugars, slightly syrupy, quite bitter and almost sour end. Medium strength finish, long and coating, a dash of grassy, almost earthy and thick leafy, floral hops. Slowly dissipates into a grainy toffee malty feel. Bloody well done. Very sharp and citrusy at first, but slowly numbs the tongue in sweetness. English IPA are very coarse, so this one is well represented, but the intensity is great. Good flavors, pretty well balanced, and decent freshness. Overall very good quality craft.
Wells Eagle IPA (5%);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Pours red with a decent off white head. Aroma is malty. Taste is mild. Hints of malt, caramel and a light spicy English hop quality. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy. It is surprisingly light. Doesnï¿½t really seem like an IPA, I would say itï¿½s a bitter or special bitter at most and very much in the English style. All in all not bad if you go in expecting this.

Bear Republic XP Pale Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Based on the Racer 5, I thought this would be a little better. Semi-smooth beer and hoppy for a pale ale. I've had IPAs with this kind of bitterness. Clear, yet with enough malt in it to give a light orange appearance.

Schlitz Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Attractive black can. Do I shiver or shudder when I hear the word ï¿½iceï¿½ on an american beer? Scraping ice off partially frozen beer is about as caveman as drinkeing rotten fermented grain. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager appearance. Big off white head. Aroma is metallic and slightly sour. Taste is fairly palatable when compared to other ice beers. Not much bitterness. Behaves like a decent regular pale lager. Finish is non assuming. Much better than many pale lagers. Miles ahead of unrefined City Ice and Nasty Ice. Lacks the coarseness that is typically apparent with iced brews. Alky is well hidden and finish is rather short and easy to handle. I just had a Weyer Impy Pumpkin ale and this is just as good as far as enjoyability goes.
Schlitz Ice;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This is possibly the best Ice beer that I have ever got.

Sea Dog Raspberry Wheat Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);"Pre-pour thoughts. Watching post election coverage as I read this. Noticing the best by date is not notched on the bottle. Twist off cap. Pours a light amber color. About one finger white head that fizzles away after a few moments. Only a spot of head remains right in the middle. No lacing. Aroma is raspberry. Itï¿½s almost a natural raspberry, and it might be. Buttery, cracker. Thereï¿½s a touch of earthy hops. This smells, light, and fruity, but not too much so. Taste is light raspberry, medium cracker. Itï¿½s lightly sweet and raspberry, but a nicer gentle tartness right at the end. Again, very light and not overly fruity or artificial. Mouthfeel is light body. Has a little graininess from the wheat. The raspberry tartness is gentle, and really compliments the beer. You could easily slam this, but I donï¿½t think youï¿½ll want to. Overall this is an excellent beer. A fruit beer done right. So many times you get these and itï¿½s crammed full of artificial stuff, or so sweet that itï¿½s hard to drink. The phrase ""less is more"" applies. I like this a lot."
Sea Dog Raspberry Wheat Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 5/5/2016. Pours fairly clear golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lightly tart raspberry, wheat, cracker, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of raspberry, bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lightly tart raspberry, wheat, cracker, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal/grassy bitterness and fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of raspberry, wheat, cracker, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice robustness and balance of raspberry, bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitter/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from carbonation and bitter/tartness as well. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very good fruited wheat ale. All around good robustness and balance of raspberry, bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, and clean to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
Sea Dog Raspberry Wheat Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);The aroma is raspberry of course. Body is a bold golden color with only thin head. Has a dry raspberry taste. Only a hint of sweetness. Refreshing clean finish.
Sea Dog Raspberry Wheat Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Sea Dogï¿½s raspberry ale is a little better than their blueberry ale in trying to taste like a fruity beer that didnï¿½t lose its way. Itï¿½s sweet, a little tart, and overall refreshing, but it still lacks in a a memorable finish or in tasting like beer. Its sweetness is a little too fruity to really want to keep drinking.

Hinterland Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Hinterland Brewery;"12 ounce bottle from Woodmanï¿½s in Janesville, WI, consumed a few minutes out of the fridge in a pint glass. Dark, vaguely hazy amber-gold with a billowy lasting off-white head...resinous aroma, a touch of caramel, somewhat musty - not quite skunky but definitely a bit aged in a way that doesnï¿½t work for me though some might find it more tolerable in an ""English"" pale; no date on the bottle (of course) but this store has lots of turnover and it was refrigerated...hmm...body is moderately hoppy/bitter throughout, edging towards strongly so by the finish, only light sweetness with that woody, husky character appropriate to the English style; also a fair bit of dry yeast character throughout though I donï¿½t believe this is bottle conditioned, anyway it comes across...average fullness of body, average to perhaps slightly stronger carbonation. Ehh, big ""OK"" when all is said and done."

Hinterland Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;One of the more stand-out brews I had at this brewpub - thick and creamy, with a very smooth mouthfeel - a lot of caramel, maple, raisin, and date - reminds me of the fruity complexities of the better-made german bocks - a very light roasty/smoky character in the finish - great stuff.
Hinterland Bock;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hinterland Brewery;From Skyviewï¿½s growler. Sweet caramel aroma and flavor. Roasted grain, and a roasted meat quality. Very much like a German doppelbock like Salvator or Optimator. Sticky and sweet. Some smoke. Probably the best brewpub bock I have ever had.

Hinterland Packerland Pilsner;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hinterland Brewery;I can forgive a LOT of things in beer: shitty taste, moderate alcohol, slipshod packaging and any other number of infractions. What I canï¿½t & wonï¿½t forgive is being named after the Packers. For that I give this tripe ï¿½the fingerï¿½. The digitus infamous, the salute of shame. Actually it was OK. I just hate the Packers. Carry on my wayward sons.
Hinterland Packerland Pilsner;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hinterland Brewery;9/29/18. On tap at Brocach. Clear pale golden pour with a small frothy white head.

Hinterland Packerland Pilsner;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hinterland Brewery;Lemon and bread dough in the nose. Taste is bright sweet malt and lemon zest. Finish is clean but could use more hop bitterness.
Hinterland Packerland Pilsner;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hinterland Brewery;12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy yellow with a quickly dissipating white head. The aroma is is not clean, it smells like caramel malt. The taste is OK, but the hop bitterness is quite low and the residual sweetness from the overuse of caramel malts is quite apparent. Glad to see that it is not dry hopped, but the bittering hops need to be increased and the amount of caramel malt used decreased.
Hinterland Packerland Pilsner;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hinterland Brewery;Keg at World of Beer Wauwatosa, 9/13/16.

Hinterland Weizen Bier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hinterland Brewery;Courtesy of Skyview. Clear golden color with a large rocky head. Tart lemon and old banana aroma. As I started drinking it, I got the distinct impression I was chewing on a banana. Wheat and very fiant clove, but as Guerde said, this is a banana bomb. Definitely tastes like almost over-ripe bananas. Not spectacular, but certainly better than the 3.25 itï¿½s got here.
Hinterland Weizen Bier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hinterland Brewery;(bottle from Skyview) Pours a hazy gold with a large white head that sticks around, but settles to a fine film. A surprisingly good aroma of dried banana chips and cereal, along with a bit of vanilla. This aroma is very sweet and estery, with a touch of pear and kicks of clove showing up too. Gets a bit musty as it warms. The taste is really sweet too, and is quite a banana bomb with some bubblegum as well, but the beer finishes quite crisp with a tart spike of lemon peel right upon the finish. The mouthfeel is lively and appropriately substantial for a better than average hefe. This is a really good beer that would be a great drink for the summer months. and I donï¿½t know why but it is incredibly underrated. Thanks Bob!
Hinterland Weizen Bier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hinterland Brewery;Pours a hazy orange color. Aroma is medicinal, coriander, wheat, and orange peal. Taste is about the same with some hints of bubble gum.

Hinterland Weizen Bier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hinterland Brewery;On tap at the Green Bay location. Hazed yellow with a white creamy head. Bananas and clove are all over the aroma. Creamy mouthfeel with lots of banana, a little lemon and clove in the finish. A hefeweizen thatï¿½s heavy on the banana and clove but decent for what it is.
Hinterland Weizen Bier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hinterland Brewery;The least favorite beer I had here - it had the look, though - very hazy gold/orange, with a frothy, lasting head - lemony aroma, with strong yeasty qualities - bready, yeasty, earthy - understated banana flavor (which is good in my book) - a bit of grainy character - the flavors wheat usually imparts werenï¿½t that easy to notice - light and easy drinking, just lacking a bit of character.
Hinterland Weizen Bier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hinterland Brewery;When I opened this beer, the aroma of wheat and honey poured out immediately. After the initial taste I noticed the banana undertones which were very pleasent. This is a classic german style wheat beer, it wasnï¿½t as sweet however.
Hinterland Weizen Bier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hinterland Brewery;12oz bottle. Poured a cloudy yellow-orange color with a fluffy white head. Pretty standard hefe aroma with banana, light clove, and a bit of yeasty bread dough. Delicately sweet and light to medium bodied. Ample carbonation. Tasted of banana, clove, and a hint of caramel. There was also a pleasant fresh cereal grain note that extended into the finish. Nice.
Hinterland Winterland;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hinterland Brewery;"When I saw ""Juniper Berry"" on the label, I got a little worried. Maybe I had thought this would lean more towards a winter warmer vs a porter. The berry flavor is mild and doesnï¿½t overpower the chocolate and coffee notes. Has a little bitter/burnt sugar in there...slightly smokey. Solid brew for $1 on clearance....... Oh yeah, forgot about the foam! I thought it was because was an old bottle, but read some other comments about this issue. I never had a beer this foamy I donï¿½t think. Beware....and pour super slow."
Hinterland Winterland;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hinterland Brewery;Hinterland Winterland seems to have some serious issues with execution. Pour is dark but super foamy. We are talking like 95% foam. Real annoying. Light toffee like aromas. Taste is initially coffee and chocolate be the backend is harsh bitter I assume from the juniper berries. Winterland has some potential but need to do something about the foam and tone down the juniper berries.

Hinterland Winterland;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hinterland Brewery;Bottle - Pours very dark with big, creamy head. Chocolate, coffee, and burnt malt notes with some sweetness. Nice, rich mouth feel, velvety. Solid porter.
Hinterland Winterland;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hinterland Brewery;This beer is my nemesis. My local gas station, which has the best beer selection in town, carries this regularly, and somehow, I keep forgetting how much I hate it. This last time, it was marked down to $4.99 for a six pack. Awesome price, right? On taste alone, it is. But itï¿½s nearly undrinkable without investing a ton of time to wait for the head to go down. Extremely annoying. Drinking from the bottle, the beer explodes in your mouth, allowing you to only drink in small sips. Pouring into a glass? I just used 3 glasses, and waited until they all lost the head before I could drink. Nearly 10 minutes. I really doesnï¿½t matter that the beer tastes good. Itï¿½s annoying, even at that price. Please lord, let me remember next time...
Hinterland Winterland;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hinterland Brewery;Bottle at the beach. Pretty decent porter overall with an interesting subtle juniper finish.

Fox River Light;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fox River Brewing Company;"In the bottle. Thanks to Darrel M. for the beer! Unfiltered cloudy medium gold in appearance with a small white head. Has a toasted almond aroma. Bread dough scents upon warming. Lemony tart flavor- maybe even lime. Lacing OK. Somewhat salty in taste. Medium body- this does not appear to be a light beer in the usual sense. Medium carbonation. If this is indeed a ""light"" beer, it is truly excellent for an otherwise bad style."
Fox River Light;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fox River Brewing Company;On tap at F.R. Appleton. Poured a very light golden with a small white head. Some light malt presence (honey and pils), but not anything more in the aroma. Flavor was a little stronger than the aroma, heavier on the honey and adding a faint floral bitterness. Very light on the palate, yet smooth. No real flaws in this one... just weak in the aroma and flavor departments.
Durham Triple X;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;IPA;County Durham Brewing;Tap at Bar Volo. 5.0%. Hazy orangey-coppery amber with smallish creamy white head. The aroma is malty sweet with loads of toffee and apples, soft and English kind of earthy, leafy. The flavour is that of ripe autumn fruits, leaves and earth, moderately bitter. Soft mouthfeel with very thin carbonation. Dryish malty finish. A bit too watery. Otherwise an alright low-ABV English-style IPA. Not sure Iï¿½d enjoy a full pint though...

Durham Triple X;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;IPA;County Durham Brewing;Cask sample from Cï¿½est What?. Pale orange in colour with soft carbonation.

The head fades to a thin remnant and leaves a trace amount of lace. On the nose, there are notes of citrus, caramel, bread, tropical fruit and herbs. The flavour is well balanced, moderately bitter with herbs and pine, along with a moderate toasty malty sweetness. The finish is moderate in length and balanced. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a smooth, watery texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a decent English style IPA. Though it is subtle and sessionable, I prefer the hop addict. This one could be more complex and assertive. 2011-12-15

Durham Blak Katt;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Tap at Bar Hop 2. Brown/black with excellent light tan head. Such thick lace, such good retention. On the nose itï¿½s sweetish, roasty, with dark chocolate and molasses perhaps. Tastes roasty and sweet with a bit of pleasant fruity hoppiness(?). IDK... anyway itï¿½s really nice. Soft yet slightly grainy on the palate, the finish is quite dry. Worked very well for me. Edit: Year and a half later, tap sample at Crafty Coyote. Looks good. Malts, not too toasty. Modest sweetness. Dry. Didn't enjoy it that tremendously as before but I'll not lower the score.
Durham Blak Katt;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Draft. Completely black body, perfect light brown head. He head is thick, with small bubbles and it builds up after pouring. The aroma is pure dark chocolate. It lets down a bit with the light body and the taste could have more chocolate and less smoke, but itï¿½s still a very good stout.

Summit Great Northern Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Summit Brewing Company;Sampled in a blind taste-test on 11/11/2019. Pours very dark, with a creamy off-white head. Aroma of wet leather. Definite coffee palate.
Summit Great Northern Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Summit Brewing Company;About average for a porter. On the thin side, slightly lacking malt...but balance is fine. One of the better ones in the variety pack that I got. First introduction from Summit. Nothing really special here, but worth the try.
Summit Great Northern Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Summit Brewing Company;Part of a flight at Stone Arch MSP. Similar cola black to the Waconia Peanut Butter Porter but with a more stable tan head. Mild dark malt aroma of licorice and chocolate. Roasty and dry. It's ok.
Summit Great Northern Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Summit Brewing Company;Swear to god these ratings are getting deleted. I know I rated this before. Roasty robust flavor, great price but kinda thin. Makes it very drinkable tho
Summit Great Northern Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Summit Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. Pour was black, foamy tan head. Aroma of roasted coffee, roasted malts, cocoa. Taste was moderate bitter, coffee, dark chocolate.

Light/medium body with moderate carbonation. Solid stuff.
Summit Great Northern Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Summit Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle in Columbus Ohio. Very dark brown; opaque in the glass. Slightly sweet up front but mildly bitter by the aftertaste. A bit more flavorful than average for style, with plenty of dark roasted malts but only very faint smoke. O: tastes like a big beer, including a hint of higher ABV than actually present."
Summit Great Northern Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Summit Brewing Company;Pours a dark brown. Not a lot of head. Nothing worth noting. Aroma is chocolate syrup and coffee. I smell dark malts. Maybe some floral hops. Taste is again much of the same. Aroma is more of chocolate, taste is more of coffee. Nice balance between bitter and sweet, but leaning bitter. Mouthfeel is quite smooth. Itï¿½s quite heavy. It is bold. I donï¿½t know how drinkable it is from only drinking this one. Overall it is tasty. A good porter. I just wish it had a bit more in the ABV. Worth a try.
Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;Seems more like an Extra Pale Ale vs. IPA...or hoppy Pale Ale. I liked this one better than their EPA. Little more citrusy, with minimal hops for this style. Nothing stood out with any of the Summit beers that I tried in the variety pack, but at the same time they were not bad....just ehh and thin.
Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. Pours a deep golden color with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is mildly of dry hopping. The flavor, however, screams aroma hops. Pretty good beer, but in no way British. It totally lacks the characteristic esters found in British beers. This is a mild version of a typical American IPA. I guess that they figured that they would just tone down their IPA a bit and rebrand it as being authentic British. Quite a disappointment actually because I thought that they could do much better.
Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;"Draft to taster at The Pint Room. Looks solid; a transparent gold with foamy eggshell head. Smells and tastes of aged hops with a mildly to moderately bitterswert backbone thatï¿½s more sweet than bitter. Some caramel as well. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a bit filmy. Underwhelming."
Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;I didnt like this one a as much as their extra pale ale. For an American IPA there really wasnt much in hop aroma or flavor except for a brief hop bite. The aroma and flavor had more of a malt profile, which wasnï¿½ bad but not what I expected. Overall it was o.k but not great. Originally rated on 11/21/08
Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;Sampled at GABF 2015. In the tasting glass light amber. White head. Nose of grassy hops and malts. Medium body. Flavor is light citrus and grassy hops. Finishes bitter but not a nice one. Not wild about this one.
Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;Not really a good beer. Aroma has a number of things going on, many not so good - a bit of funk, hint of hop and toffee, whiff of skunk. Flavorï¿½s dominated by bitter, some malt and a tad of hop. Palate is dominated by bitter: too much.
Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;12oz bottle to tulip. Pours clear amber, white froth sticky head. Aroma of pale malts, bubblegum, fig, some pepper and orange gummy candy. Taste of same with extra candi sweetness in finish.

Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;Pours a clear amber color with white head. Not too bitter, could use some more hop aromas & flavor
Summit True Brit IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Summit Brewing Company;Light, crisp aroma. Yellow pale pour. Flavor is citrus with a hopped finish. Alcohol is heavy in the finish.
Summit Hefe Weizen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Summit Brewing Company;Hazy gold pour with a two finger, creamy white head. Aroma is wheat, toast, cereal, banana, clove spice and a hint of hoppy spice. Flavor is toast, wheat, cereal and a hint of banana bread. Light to medium body, slightly slick, slightly chalky feel, light, but blanketing and somewhat sharp carbonation. Not bad overall, the aroma does a much better job of hitting the right notes for the style, than the flavor, but it's still pretty tasty.
Summit Hefe Weizen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Summit Brewing Company;Look: pours a light gold. Bright white head. Marry clear. Smell: Apple. Vinegar. Grass. Pine. Taste: Apple. Slight bready flavor. Slight bitterness. Earthy hops. Pine. Feel: more dry than sweet. Feel the dry on the back end. Overall: nice crisp beer. Doesn't linger too much. First drank: home 1/15/15 Vintage: enjoy by Jan
Summit Hefe Weizen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Summit Brewing Company;Sort of bland and uninspired. Weak body, golden color, aroma of bananas, wheat, and hay. Watery mouthfeel and a little bit of a citrusy flavor.
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;On tap at Gluek. Pours a clear amber brown with a grayish brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of bread with a touch of honey and sweet grains. Flavor combines honey, toffee and sweet grains backed by a light earthiness.
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;You know, I have to say, like some other Gluek stuff, this really isnï¿½t too bad for the price!
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;I am a big fan of tubing down the river in DL MN. Got to have a beer in the can. Glueks provides a very cheap, mostly drinkable beer, but MUST drink as fresh as possible, skunks easily and quickly.
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;This beer was good from the perspective that it exceeded my expectations from a cost-to-value perspective. I picked it up on a lark because it was soooo cheap at Discount Liquor. I expected a pale economy lager all other budget beers I can think of. What I got was something that actually seemed a bit bock-like. The bad news? It was not a bock I liked! Truer to style than other budget beers might be, but still not really worth buying or drinking, no matter the price. It was dark brown but brilliant and sparkling, with a fine white head. I started to think that maybe this cheap beer wouldnï¿½t be so bad...price isnï¿½t everything after all. Aroma was diacetyl, metal, and some caramel. Flavor was not good...malted milk ball graininess with some sourness that I really donï¿½t think was supposed to be there. Pretty awful. Mouthfeel was thin. Most of this went down the drain. I would not recommend this beer. I have several more in the fridge awaiting their eventual disposal, which will not be via mine (nor anyone elseï¿½s) stomach. I bought this at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee.
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;Not good. Had a strange off flavor that was almost sour, with sweetness and alcohol. I guess from the honey? Blech. The good news is that because of the higher alcohol content it takes fewer beers to make you not notice the fact that it tastes bad. I gave it a bump for being cheap.
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;Served via 12-oz can during the Winterfest 2008 in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota. Pours a clear light amber brew with a thin white head that quickly dissipates to a thin white ring. Aroma of light caramel malt, some grassy hops, a touch of honey and some light pear. Taste is light to medium bodied, well-carbonated with flavors of light caramel malt, some grassy hops, green vegetables and honey. Finish is slightly watery, some caramel malt aftertaste that quickly becomes clean cut and crisp. A summer session brew.
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;"I was slightly to moderately impressed by this beer. Donï¿½t get me wrong, I didnï¿½t actually like it a lot, but it was made by Gluek and it tasted ok; thatï¿½s what impressed me. It basically tasted like a lager with a little bit of honey added that somewhat hid the alcohol and went down fairly smooth. Under no circumstance would I buy the beer but..........I suppose I wouldnï¿½t turn one down if there was nothing else to drink."
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;One of the best Glueks I have ever tasted, That isnï¿½t saying much but is very drinkable
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;Canned. Light brown body with a white head. The aroma has some The aroma is weirdly sweet with canned peaches and dandelions. Very sweet flavored cheap strawberry candy with some hint of nasty cheap candy bar nuget. There is also a little bit of band aid. It gets worse as you drink more.
Gluek Honey Bock;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cold Spring Brewery;Horrible, just awfull. Most Glue beers are low end, but the redeming part is usually the fact that they are rarely offensive- just cheap and flavorless. Well the honey bock is surely not tasteless. The overall flavour is one of malted garbage. Bought a case and ended up trashing 23 beers. That is rare.

Calumet Rye;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Keg at the brewery, 8/20/16. Clear pale golden, thin fizzy off-white head, good retention. Aroma of rye, toasted malt, caramel. The taste is strong rye, citrus, cherries, toasted malt. Medium bodied, strong lingering bitterness.
Calumet Rye;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Draft. This one is infected, sorry to say. In this day an age I canï¿½t really accept brewers still releasing infected beers, jsut dump it already.

Calumet Rye;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear golden orange with a near white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of light fruit, rye and a backing sweet bread note. Flavor has notes of sweet grains and light fruit that are cut by a bit of a rye finish.
Calumet Rye;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Draft at Calumet. Hazy orange-tan, thin white head. Another horrible, way below par offering from Calumet. While the rye sort of works with the disgusting off flavors, this beer is still terrible.
Calumet Rye;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap at Rowlands Calumet Brewery. Hazy amber with a thin white topper. Aroma of malt and rye with mild breadiness and a faint hop characteristic. Taste of rye, malt and lemon with a dry finish. One of the better options here.
Calumet Rye;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, pours a clear pale orange-red with no head. Sweet malty honey nose and taste, with a lightly bitter finish. A fine beer to have with bar food.
Calumet Rye;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Pours a dark clear amber with a soft floral aroma. Hint of honey, aroma of lightly roasted nuts and ginger. Taste is initally dry but tapers off to a sweet rich malted finish

Calumet Rye;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Copper color with a smaller off white head. Aromas of dark caramel and lightly yeasty dough. Light darker malt flavors with light caramel and a hint of wild honey. Not strong in the rye department as the feel and light spicy rye bite were not in the forefront. Again a very easy drinking brew.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Not that dark at all, amber hued with small white head and no lace. The aroma hinted of roasted malts, caramel, grassy and floral hops, cheery and apple, dusty yeast esters, and an industrial hint of plastic. The taste has a layer of sweet malt and a accompanied bitterness, but also displayed a sour fruity. Undertone of smoke and spice faintly appearing. Funky aftertaste, not really that nice. The mouthfeel is buttery and a tad sticky for the style. Something about this beer doesn't work, maybe it's the sourness or the pronounced funk.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;I poured this out of the bottle and got so much foam that it took me forever to get it into the glass. Just too carbonated. Amber color with a thin, sweet nose. Dark sweet caramel with a subtle roast grain taste. A little thin in body. Tastey but simplistic.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Poured a ruddy orange/red, with a thick, lively tan head. Wet, grassy and somewhat spicy hops aroma, as well as a touch of detergent. Flavor is very tangy, bordering on sour, with a touch of caramel and notes of earthy hops, especially at the end of the sip. Highly carbonated mouthfeel. Decidedly average, and pretty boring.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Draught at Kraftbrau Sept. 27th 2003... Dark cloudy brown. Slightly fruity aroma very mild. Slight light brown beige head. Malty with more pronounced hop flavour. Creamy body. Had an odd pie crust aftertaste of Crisco. Cheers to Vale for being a great hostess that night, made my trip to Kalamazoo quite enjoyable.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Light dark brown color with a small head of very fine bubbles. It has a heavy fore taste with no after bite and leaves a good lacing on the glass and a malty aroma.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Muddy enough to wallow in and oozing sweet into the slime. There were some flavors I liked in here but the overal affect was rather unpleasant. I couldn''t finish the bottle.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;This one is fun - it has the deeper malt depth and of the Munich Red and a similar sourish note alleviated by the spiciness characteristic of the Vienna. And then there is the molasses or other dark sugary goodness all it''s own. I can honestly say I''ve not had anything like it before, stylistically.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;This is a style that no American brewer seems to want to replicate--the Czech dark beer. This is a very hoppy version, quite brilliant. Reminds me of Lobkowicz Baron, but with serious, fresher hops. This is a great brewer. Psych Prof provided me with this. Many thanks to this generous Rate Beerian.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Rerate: After several bottled samplings, I have to say I am most partial to this one over all other Kraftbrau's but the Helles. It's got a real snap to it! Original: On tap at the brewery. Very fresh, exceptionally fine carbonation, a bit smoky and caramelly, really quite a delicious surprise. I think some dedicated ale drinkers would like this. Had several since in bottles and it's good. Not an earth-shaker, but good.
Kraftbrau Dark Bohemian;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavï¿½;Kraftbrau Brewery;Slightly cloudy amber appearance. Light malty aroma. I didn't even take any notes on teh taste, I don't think that there was any.
Kapuziner Weissbier Schwarz;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);[5.1% ABV] Mostly grain in the aroma with signs of caramel, dark malt and bread. Taste is semi dryish with dark malty notes which scratch the tongue with bit lingering rough hint. Average, but still pleasant.
Kapuziner Weissbier Schwarz;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);It's beer annd if I drink enough, I probably get drunk but I am not going to try. With dunkel weizen I expect a weizen with some karamel and usually some smoke, tied together with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Not in this beer. a tangy watery taste dominates the beer. Initially it is not that bad but as soon as you have swallowed, all what remains is the feeling that you did drink somethin nasty. I am not going to finish the bottle
Kapuziner Weissbier Schwarz;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Coole Bï¿½gelflasche. Extrem dunkle Farbe - fast schwarz. Groï¿½e Menge Hefe. Sieht schon mal toll aus. Riecht auch lecker. Geschmacklich tut sich da aber nicht sehr viel. Kaffeenoten, etwas Kakao - gar nicht so viel Malz. Die bitteren Noten der hellen Weizen aus gleichem Haus sind deutlich reduziert. Fï¿½r ein Bier mit so einer intensiven Fï¿½rbung kommt recht wenig. Etwas mehr Sï¿½ï¿½e und Substanz wï¿½r nicht schlecht. Immerhin aber schï¿½n weich.
Kapuziner Weissbier Schwarz;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);0,5 l swing top bottle as Kapuziner Hefe Dunkel Naturtrï¿½b. An unclear darkest red brown with an huge pale beige head in the glass. Low sweet fruity smell. Taste has some orange fruity sweetness at the start getting more dry later. Little bit roasty, little bit sulfur, low yeasty. Not that typical Hefeweizen taste at all.
Kapuziner Weissbier Schwarz;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bottle from Edeka, Rothenburg. (18/5/19, BB: 26/4/19.) Pours hazy brown-reddish with a quickly thinning, frothy, tan head. Aroma of toast, peanut, dried fig, tobacco, caramel, pear, clove, 'Pomme d'Amour', cake. Taste is light to medium malty sweet, restrained caramel & cake supporting dark fruits (fig, raisin) & some banana, a bit smoky-toasty with sourish wheat, metallic accent, bitter tones of clove & pepper, leading to a dry, herbal hoppy finish, lingering maltiness of dark fruits & cake, tad metallic again. Light to medium body, slick texture, fizzy carbonation. Hugely drinkable Dunkelweizen but feels too thin in the end.

Kapuziner Weissbier Schwarz;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Medium, one-finger foam, brown-black color.

Black and orange can with a couple of Gold medals from back in ancient times. Coat of arms with the Polish flag with a couple of crosses. Pours clear, pale yellow with a lot of bubbles. Small white head. Bubbly. Settles as thin, flimsy layer of foam unable to cover the surface of the beer. No Lacing. Aroma is not very distinct or intense. Lightly sweet and with a light sourish streak. Hints of something salty. Medium carbonation. Thin, watery, lightly tingling texture. Flavor is lightly sweet followed by a moderate bitterness with a little saltiness. Aftertaste is thin, a little salty and so short that I hardly noticed it. A bit strange that the Brewery calls a beer with nothing to distinguish it for ï¿½Specjalï¿½. By all means - it is refreshing and inoffensive. But so is water.

Samuel Smiths Extra Stout;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Stout - Dry;Samuel Smith;Cask at Sinclairs Oyster Bar. Apparently all of the Samuel Smith pubs have no mobile policy from now on, so I got warned from the bar staff to put away my mobile, which is good reason not to go there ever again. Thanks guys! Back to beer, mild chocolate aroma, pitch black color with big sized creamy tan head and nice lacing. Chocolate and cocoa taste, mild. Thin body, soft carbonation, creamy. Goodbye Samuel!

Lots of carbonation bubbles, and a fair amount of sediment. Aroma is of wheat, spice, citrus, and malt. Taste starts off with lots of lemon zest, and almost immediately ends there.

Garde Kï¿½lsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Privatbrauerei Gaffel Becker & Co.;Generous effervescence feeds the lasting white foam that covers the pale yellow beer.. A rather grassy nose makes this kï¿½lsch feel less clean and successful at malt extracting than the majority. Its malts come across sweeter than most with vanilla ice cream suggestions on top of the classic graininess. The intense carbonation does not quite cut this impression. Under average.

My mistake. Recently I visited Susanï¿½s in Santa Fe, NM and spotted Sunnerï¿½s Kolsch. Belatedly I will be giving it a rating. The brew is in a 500 ml bottle and going into a shaker glass. It arrives a pale, straw yellow topped by a vigorous white on white head, a zillion tiny bubbles. Almost no scent, perhaps a light citrus. And it is the same with with a taste, there is a hint of lemon, grain, water and for all the carbonation, it is a little flat. Not as I remember. A bit let down on this.

Sickly gradient golden body with strong carb and a loud, hissing sudsy pearly head. Dry and prickly, lightly grainy taste but thankfully not slimy and keeps the phenolics well under control. Medium-full body. Tart aftertaste also brings a bit of the nasty. Above average Kristallweizen, but then again, itï¿½s been a long time since Iï¿½ve had one.

Refsvindinge Brygmesterens Egen Pils;Refsvindinge, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Refsvindinge Bryggeri;Copenhagen 11/4 2017. 33 cl bottle bought at Refsvindinge Brewery. Label looks like something coming straight out of the seventies. A sun setting over a blue sea and some corn growing on the top of it (!). Peculiar. Pours very dark golden yellow - almost amber. Looks more like a Vienna. White head. Settles as patchy thin layer of foam. Aroma is sweetish and of caramel, lightly roasted malts, apple juice and a hint of butter. Soft carbonation and slightly thick palate. Flavor is very sweet. Followed by medium slightly spicy bitterness. Aftertaste of caramel. Not much Pilsener about this. More like a Wiener or a too sweet Brown Ale. Will not become my favorite from Refsvindinge.

Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Bottle from somewhere. This is an old rate, lost due to low word count on Ratebeer during the redesign. Was a decent IPA, shame I'll never get the full review back now!
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;From Feb 2006 Poured from bottle(room temp) a medium copper with a large head of foam that dissipated slowly leaving a good layer with lacing. The smell is rather faint with some citrusy hops coming through. The taste is also hoppy with bitter tones that aren't of citrus...maybe spruce or pine but there's some malty sweetness there as well giving it a rather balanced taste. This, for me, is a nice interpretation of an IPA and if I found it locally, I would put it on my regular rotation. Bottom line: A very tasty IPA that may not please the die hard hop heads but worked very well for me indeed. I recommend it.
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Liked this pale ale as the taste was up my alley and the colour was the brown shade that i liked. Would buy this again if I could find it in Canada.
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Brewed using a blend of English malts. Magnum hops are used for the early hop addition, with Goldings for finishing and dry hopping. A very flavorful and hoppy ale.
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Old rating. Bottle from Old Town. This was never as good the pale ale in my opinion. The hops just never reached IPA levels at the time. A pretty modest IPA for IPA standards.
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;I didnï¿½t care for this as much as the regular Sierra Nevada pale ale. It was a bit on the bitter side, as IPAs should be, but something about the balance between malts and hops didnï¿½t work that well for me. Not very smooth going down. The flavor is there for sure....a bit fruity and very hoppy. Basically a decent average IPA, nothing special.
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"""this one falls into the ""standard"" catergory of Sierra Nevada Beers, the aroma and flavor one expects from a good ipa are lacking, and you canï¿½t help but notice a similar hop profile as several other SN beers."""
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Very nice IPA, doesnï¿½t wallop you over the head with hops, but you definitely know theyï¿½re there. Good character, bitter finish
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Coper beer, exaggerated amount of carbonic gas, big and unstable head. Citric aromas are felt, not too much from the malt is perceived. Flavor with some caramel and citric notes, not really bitter at the end.
Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Very pretty, dark orange color. It wasnt that it was too hoppy, but the hops just came out wrong somehow, not crisp enough maybe. Decent, but I would take the pale ale over this any day.
Rocky River Zeus Juice;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap @ the brewpub: Hazy golden colored pour with a soft white head. Aroma, light fruits, banana, some spicing, and some sugary notes. Flavor, spice, some yeast, lightly sweet malts. The finish had a nice spicy bitter bite to it. Very enjoyable beer. But for the record I hate being the next rater after someone like Steward.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Multiple samples, GABF 2006. Head is mostly lasting. Body is dark yellow. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted bread/grain, cookie), with notes of clove and grains of paradise. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. Spiced rendition for sure, but not overly done (like the Powerhouse version, e.g.). Decent mouthfeel and appearance help the total experience.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Tiny white head mounts the clear golden body. Spice oriented nose that works really well for this rendition. Complete floral and herbal hops gain from their coriander and ginger encounter, especially that the candied malts don`t feel too heavy, more like a toasted pils malt foundation. Light-medium bodied, rather light carbonation. The nasal aromatics seem diluted in mouth, where a sweet white wine like feature takes the reins, boosting the spice dominance beyond reason.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);GABF 2005: Golden hued with a small head and some lace. The aroma had notes of banana, clove, cardamom, pepper, bready malt and dusty esters, nice. The taste starts with a fruity twang and a mild flowery background. Some spicy and yeast character as well. The feel was just average, fit within the style. A nice beer but lacks that something special.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Dirty dark copper w/ creamy off-white foam. Aroma is candy-ish & yeasty w/ notes of coriander, cinnamon, & ginger. Light, gently carbonated feel (perhaps a little thin). Flavour is sweet & yeasty w/ a mild tartness. Finish is spicy & dry.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Dense, dirty orange color with a bright foamy white head. Almost looked unfiltered. Sweet and spicy nose (Liberty? Hallertau?) with a light yeasty presence. Gentile, soft carbonation. Full mouthfeel that has a candi sugar meets classic Belgian orange peel/ corriander flavor. Slightly tart. Big orangey finish with bready, banana flavored yeast. I really like the yeast flavors on this. Took Silver at GABF in ï¿½03, along with many other awards. Really nice interpretation of the style.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Hazy orange from the tap at the pub with a thin white head. Clear, crisp finish with nice spicey flavors. Not as subtle as other saisons I like, but a very easy drinking beer.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Bright orange and murky. Wonderful nose full of ginger, rye, and curry, oddly enough. Spicy. A little thin, but refreshing and bold with the rye bread and ginger flavors. Very punchy.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Murky orange-gold body with a white head. Some lacing. Fruity, yeasty aroma. Slightly dirty. Spice, yeast and hop dominate. Alcohol becomes apparent. Some lemon/banana. Full-bodied. Slight carbonation.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);8/22/03: on tap at the Rocky River Brewing Co. pleasing aromas, which include floral, hops and yeast. creamy lacing with a cloudy, orange-tan body. creamy taste with belgian flavors- yeast, coriander, some fruit and citrus.
Rocky River Artisian Saison;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Bottled (RAF). Nice spiciness in this dry beer. Coriander, orange, clove, soft yeastiness and nice, dry hay. This is a pretty good saison, not my favorite, but worth drinking. A pretty good balance.
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap at brewery in Cleveland. Just OK.

Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Tap. Pours crystal clear pale amber, medium off white head, great lacing. Aroma is faint honey, grass. Flavor id biscuit, honey, grass, a bit of metal, light sweet, light bitter. Light body. Meh
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Aroma: Faint hints of malt aromas--caramel and bread--but I almost had to snort the beer to get them. Appearance: Clear gold color with rich white head. Taste: Light sweetness balanced by a light sourness. Palate: Light body, slick texture, average carbonation, long finish. Overall: Itï¿½s a well developed beer, but nothing spectacular. Standard issue quaffing beer for a microbrew.
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Tap at the brewpub. Clear light golden pour with a pillowy white head. Slightly fruity, grainy, just not digging this at all.
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);on tap at RRBC, nice golden color, all kinds of malty taste some bread even? not a bad drink just too much malt for me to enjoy definitely easy finish though 3 gulps and done.
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a medium golden color with a small foamy white head that lingered and left great lacing. The aroma was tangy and semisweet with light golden fruits and a touch of citrus. The flavor was dryish and somewhat nutty with a yeasty and tangy undertone and hint of vague fruits. Medium length dryish and bready finish. Medium body and nicely smooth.
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Sample at the brewpub. The beer is a clear yellow-gold color with a thin and foamy white head that dissipates steadily to a film. Spotty lacing on the glass. Mild hops and malt aroma. Light, crisp body with lightly bitter hops and sweet malt flavors. The finish is lightly bitter with a short fruity and malty aftertaste. Just average overall.
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);hazy gold with white head. mild malt flavor before a crisp finish. not much going on here, but not bad
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Light clear yellow color... Not much aroma... Light malt flavor, crisp finish, not much bitterness on palate, not much on the finish at all... Decent
Rocky River Coopers Gold Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Sample at Rocky River. Clear yellow with a medium white head. Sweet malt aroma with some faint dry hops. Flavor is mostly sweet malt, but there is a bit of dryness on the back end.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;This particular Christian Moerlein brew was available in the sampler 12-pack back during the Hudepohl days. The last time I had this beer was probably in 2001. I recently contacted Christian Moerlein and sadly they have no current plans to make this beer again. This was probably one of the best Kolsch beers made by and American brewer at the time... Christian Moerlein Kolsch was a hazy gold color with a nice white crown. The aroma had a light maltiness and some grassy hops and lemon. The flavor and some citrus (lemon) and was well balanced between the light toffee malt and the moderate hop bitterness. This was a light beer and had a decent amount of carbonation. This was my second favorite of the sampler just behind the Christian Moerlein Bock and was one of the first Kolsch beers that I was exposed to and was a pretty good one at that (in my opinion!)...
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Pours canary, with decent sized head and good lacing. Aroma of hopcit, some honey. Tastes of pale malt, with some hopcit and honey at the finish. Ever-so-slight grains of paradise at the culmination. Nice.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;A nice beer - sweet hoppy flavor - Iï¿½ll give it to Hudepohl - they did a pretty good job in making a Koelsch - not quite as sweet as most German Koelschs but a pretty good effort.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Slightly hazed golden yellow liquid. Wispy diminished off white head with a small amount of lace. Pale dry malt, whiff of toffee and licorice. Some light citrus qualities with some off sweet powdery perfume flavors. Finishes with some light fruit and light anise. Interesting, but a mid tier kolsch. Thanks to slikwily.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Thanks to gerdy555 for the trade. This beer pours a lightly hazy orange/gold color with a very thin eggshell white head. Thin lacing as well. The aroma is citrusy, with some malt and vanilla in the background. Light-bodied and rather crisp, with a tasty combination of citrus (lemon), hops, malt and vanilla again. The finish is tart fruit. Overall this is a nicely drinkable Kolsch from Moerlein.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Light orange with a bright, big airy head that went away quickly. Crisp and light, not so Kolschy but lightly fruity and malty, a decent light ale.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Cloudy amber color (looks absolutely nothing like the beer in the picture). Smeels and tastes artificially sweet. Drinkable, but I'd not go out of my way to buy it again.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;pours golden and a little hazy, with a medium white head. aroma is slightly hoppy and slightly grassy. flavor is a little bit bready, and kinda tart. great for a hot summer day.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Not a bad brew at all... but a tad too light for my personal taste. Yes, it's refreshing, but there's really nothing remarkable about it.
Christian Moerlein Kolsch;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;"Aroma is slight malt with some citrus, lemon perhaps. Color is a medium golden with some haze. Poured with a huge head. Flavor is a mild malt with mild hoppines, some citrus flavor. It is waht the label claims ""a mild light bodied golden ale"" and a fine example of one. i prefer my ales a bit more full bodied, but this one would be great on a lazy hot summer day."
J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear pale gold color with a thin white head. The aroma was one dimensional, consisting of distinct, but subdued apple. Not really what youï¿½d expect when smelling a kolsch. Light bodied and slightly sweet. Distinct apple came out again in the flavor and was accompanied by hay and some white paper (at the end). Strange fruity beer without even the slightest hint of hops. This one didnï¿½t have much going for it.
J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Pours a clear straw yellow colour with no head. Light, crisp and clean but watered down. Faint lemon aroma, grass and corn. Flavors that reminded me of rice and crackers. Bleh.
J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Clear gold with a nice white head. A nice honey taste with a nice malt / hop balance. A brewpub staple kind of beer. Not all that interesting but drinkable.
J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a light golden blonde brew with a thin and fast dissolving white head that has some spotty lacing and white ring. Aroma of golden grain malt, some grassy hops, green vegetable character and a touch of honey. Taste is light bodied, plenty of carbonation with flavors of golden grain malt, grassy and light citrus hops, some farm hay and a touch of honey. Finish has a sharp bitterness then a clean cut aftertaste. Not quite the Colonge Kï¿½lsch I am used to but still a simple light session beer.
J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Golden yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of corn, grassy hops and light sweet malt. Taste of corn, grassy hops with a mild hop finish. Taste is too vegetal. My least favorite beer on the sampler.
J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Poured a golden color with a slight hint of haze to it. Aroma was that of fresh cut grass and the pungent aroma of tart hops. Pallate was much of the same - a little sweet malt taste up front followed by a pallate ripping hop blast. Aftertaste was slightly bitter. Not overly impressed by this one.
J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at the Thirsty Troll Brewfest Jt Whitneyï¿½s did not bring much that was of interest but this did catch my eye. I have had samples in the past but never properly rated it. Since I am unlikely to order a full pint at the brewpub this was my best chance to get a sample. It wasnï¿½t bad but I found myself wondering if it couldnï¿½t be better. Aroma / Appearance - The body was very clear with a starch white head. Straw and wheat were all I could pick up from the simple nose. Flavor / Palate - Honey, melon and straw fill the mouth briefly before things evaporate on the tongue. It is clean and simple which as much as one could expect from a kolsch. If it were any other style I would have called it a bad example. This one is so-so.

J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Sample @ Brewery. Not much of a aroma some metalic keg of sorts. Gold body to it. Bitterness was pretty much all I got for flavor.
J.T. Whitneys Koln Kolsch;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Kï¿½lsch / Kï¿½lsch-Style;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;"The 10th rating for this brew; I get to put it on the map! Unfortunately, Iï¿½m lowering itï¿½s average score. Lemon and glue aroma. Clear, light gold body that actually has visible carbonation! The first brew in the 8 beer sampler that had bubbles! Ring of off-white head. Decent lace. Somewhat sweet with some diacetyl. Mouthfeel is spritzy; thereï¿½s too much carbonation. This brew just doesnï¿½t work for me."
J.T. Whitneys Richs Rauch Bier;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub accompanied by my brother, mid-October 2006. Unfiltered, chunky, very dark caramel-maple color with a smallish creamy lasting tan head....nice smoky-cheesey aroma with a bit of wheat-like sourness takes a bit of time to express itself (served too cold, of course)....the flavor and mouthfeel arenï¿½t as interesting, though at first the acrid smokiness and juicy, charred-meat character are pretty potent...at midpalate a nice fruitiness takes over (cherry-tart apple) but the beer is too burnt, dry and bitter at the finish, contributing to a cottony though watery, dull mouthfeel. A mixed impression for sure.
J.T. Whitneys Richs Rauch Bier;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a clear toffee/amber with a short cap of off-white head. Aroma was strongly of smoky cured ham with a dash of peat and some bacon. Flavor was of strong smoky peat with caramel and some dark malt thrown in.. and some ham. Light-medium bodied. This either struck me as too smoky or it couldï¿½ve been that the smoke was abrasive and not well-integrated. Either way, I canï¿½t say that I found it too enjoyable.
J.T. Whitneys Richs Rauch Bier;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap March 3, 2006 Smells like a smokehouse where meats are aged. Caramel brown body with no head or lacing to speak of. Very oaky without being overwhelming upon the first pass. Tasted almost like someone had liquified a smoked ham. To date, the best beer that I have had from JT Whitneys even though the overall style is not among my favorites.
J.T. Whitneys Richs Rauch Bier;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Amber-red in color with a creamy off white head. Sweet, nutty aroma with some caramel notes. Smoke comes out when you taste it. Smoke, tosted sesame, sweet with just a hint of sesame in the finish. Watery palate, lighter body, but not bad.
J.T. Whitneys Richs Rauch Bier;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Nicely blended rew, but a little weak on the Rauch, especially when compared to the German versions, actually had more of a weiss taste.
J.T. Whitneys Richs Rauch Bier;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Dark red color with a thin head. It has a vague smokey aroma, but not overpowering.

Medium carb, oily. Nicely balanced smoky flavor. Smooth and refreshing. Definitely good with smoky foods. Not like the darker rauch beers I had in Germany, but pretty good.

Deep amber color, small head, little lacing. This IPA leaned too far into sweetness for me, very malty; hops were thinner, but assertive enough for an IPA. Palate was not real thick, but very smooth, almost oily."
John Harvards Implosion IPA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;A good IPA but I prefer their Insomiac IPA to this one.

Manayunk Golden Goose;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Manayunk Brewing Company;An excellent re-interperatation of a German-style unfiltered kellerbier. Not quite a pilsner, but more than a helles. The use of American hops - cascade, crystal - is highly unusual and gives a real interesting character.
Manayunk Golden Goose;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Manayunk Brewing Company;It is a dry hopped beer so you can smell and taste the hops in this beer but it is a light beer so it doesn't have tone of taste.

Weihenstephaner Korbinian;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;Na een zeer lange zoektocht kwam ik deze mooie Doppelbock tegen. Geur: Zoet! het nodigt uit om een slok te nemen. Smaak: Karamel, Toffee, chocolade ook ietsjes. Afdronk: Zacht, ik proef geen bitterheid.

Weihenstephaner Korbinian;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;Keg at the Weihenstephaner Brewery in 2016. Dark ruby with an offwhite head.

Weihenstephaner Korbinian;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;In een BeerBattle geproefd tegen de Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock met Guido. Het verhaal achter 'Korbinian' is de moeite waard om je in te verdiepen. Mooie mengeling van legende en de geschiedenis van Bavaria. Het bier zelf wint het van de Celebrator op de verschijning van fles en etiket. De appearance van het bier is min of meer gelijk. Doordat de geur en de smaak van de Korbinian net wat minder uitgesproken zijn, gaat mijn voorkeur naar de Celebrator. Dat doet echter niets af aan het feit dat de Korbinian een mooie Doppelbock is. Ik kan me geen bier herinneren waarbij de smaak van noten zo mooi aanwezig was.
Weihenstephaner Korbinian;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;Superb. Light carbo. Strong, deep nose. Mahogany in the sun. Mouth feel good but could be richer. The malty roundness in the mouth is great. Eager to try next to anoptimator. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bullfrog Sailfrog American Pale Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bullfrog Brewery;This beer pours into the glass a dark copper/amber color. It has a off white head that was thick and somewhat lasting. The aroma shows hints of hops, fruit (lemons) and some malt. It is light in flavor that shows hints of hops and lemons in the front, then a sweet malt slides in while a earth like flavor calms you for a second. Just as you start to finish the hops kick in, but not too overpowering. A crisp clean beer. Good

Belgian yeast and maltiness, smooth alcohol and musky ripe melon esters. Light citrus, too. Medium amber clear liquid with foamy lacing white head. Heavy watery body with medium silky carbonation. Not quite syrupy, but close. Starts sweet and stays sweet throughout. Sugar and musky melon, orange and alcohol (cointreau). Strong alcohol taste, estery and full of body. Bitter finish is almost balanced with the sweetness, though it can be almost cloying in the finish and after. Also has a mild salty aftertaste or bitter orange.
Red Star Belgian Tripple;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Red Star Agave Grille;One of the Red Starï¿½s better seasonals. +++ Draft only - served in a 10 oz snifter.

Red Star Canvasback Pale Ale;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Red Star Agave Grille;Nitro at the brewery. Amber body, heavy grass and light caramel malt with thick carbonation, creamy with some light vanilla and faint biscuit. The APA here is muddled by the nitro, both in body, flavor, and particularly the nose. Thereï¿½s a good beer under there, but its not easy to find.
Red Star Canvasback Pale Ale;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Red Star Agave Grille;One of their better regular offerings, with a decent amount of hops over a moderately malty body. Still not something spectacular, but a pretty decent beer overall
Red Star Canvasback Pale Ale;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Red Star Agave Grille;Sample at the brewpub. Clear amber pour with a thick frothy off-white head.

Red Star Canvasback Pale Ale;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Red Star Agave Grille;I sometimes like to have one of these before a meal. This beer is on nitrogen which gives it a strange mouthfeel for an APA. Decently hopped, and always smooth.
Red Star Canvasback Pale Ale;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Red Star Agave Grille;I have certainly tried hoppier brews, but this is a reasonably well balanced and quite enjoyable example of the style. +++Draft only. Nice golden color with a medium white head that lingered and left great lacing. . Nice grapefruity hop aroma. The texture is reasonably thick and the hops definitely shine through on the flavor. There is some malt to help balance out the hops.
Red Star Canvasback Pale Ale;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Red Star Agave Grille;Great floral aroma. Nice amber appearance, but could be a little more red. Flavor is lacking a little bit of finnishing hopps.
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);It has a light golden color with a thin white head. There is lively carbonation visible in the beer which has very good clarity. The head is fluffy and fades fast leaving just a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Little to no lacing is left behind on the glass. The aroma is rather light but there is a hint of light grainy malt, mild grassy hops and a pleasant citrus scent. Its flavor is very similar to its aroma. There is light grainy malt with mild hop flavor and bitterness, along with a nice touch of citrusy lemon and lime. The palate has a light, easy to drink, body with a watery texture and lively carbonation.
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Clear yellow with a thick white head. This had a very distinct lime aroma. Light and refreshing.
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);11.5 oz bottle 3/23/10 (Binnyï¿½s Plainfield)-42ï¿½ in English Pint-Pours a clear yellow witha small white head. Aroma of corn, malt, and lime. Taste of the same with the lime becoming more prominent. This light bodied brew is better than other lime brew but that is not saying much.
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);There are some pilsners and lagers that can pull off a twist of lime in them, but I donï¿½t believe this is one of them. Much rather have the Labatt without it, but it is still better than most macros.
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Clear straw yellow color. Totally see-through. Bubbles like ginger ale. No head, decent carbonation. No body. The light lager aroma completely is overshadowed by a sweet Sprite-like lime aroma. Has a surprising vodka aroma. Actually surprisingly refreshing because the beer is overshadowed. The taste is sweet 7Up and a little sourness. Butterscotch aftertaste. Actually, the malt emerges a bit, but this is a beer for non-beer drinkers. Too sweet and sour. Might as well go gin-n-tonic. The feel is lacking: almost no body. Some carbonation adds a little. This is not a ""beer."" Nonetheless, itï¿½s drinkable. Weak, but pleasant enough."
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Why did they have to put lime in this. A decent canadian lager with a little character, and put a shot of lime in it? Doesnt mix well, not saying this is terrible, but an unnecesary combination. Put lime in bad american pale lagers or mexican beers, but not a canadian beer. Iï¿½ll stick with Bud Lights version if I feel the need to drink an artificially masked beer.
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"What a super crappy beer. Part of a 12 pack i bought, it tasted like shit. Light lager with stale lemon lime flavors and soft carbonation. what a wasteon my palate."""
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);12 oz. bottle from Tmoney99. Pours a clear light golden with a medium sized white head. The aroma is weak pale malt infused with a very artificial lime scent that just doesnï¿½t excite me. The flavor is actually a bit better than I would have expected from the nose. The pale malt had just enough lime citrus flavor to make it somewhat drinkable. I did have this after working outside on a warm day so maybe my judgement was a bit off. Regardless, this will be a one time thing.
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Presentation: It was poured from a brown 11.5oz. or 340ml bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: It has a light golden color with a thin white head. There is lively carbonation visible in the beer which has very good clarity. The head is fluffy and fades fast leaving just a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Little to no lacing is left behind on the glass. Smell: The aroma is rather light but there is a hint of light grainy malt, mild grassy hops and a pleasant citrus scent. Taste/Mouth feel: Its flavor is very similar to its aroma. There is light grainy malt with mild hop flavor and bitterness, along with a nice touch of citrusy lemon and lime. The palate has a light, easy to drink, body with a watery texture and lively carbonation. Notes: It makes a good warm weather or ï¿½lawnmower beerï¿½ and I would say that it is better than some of the more popular citrus flavored light or pale American style lagers.
Labatt Lager & Lime;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Bottled. Poured very bright, almost watery golden with a dusting of white head. The aroma picked up artificial lime extract on a bed of pale malts.. non-offensive, but not good. The flavor had even more of the lime with corn syrup and pale malts at the core.. drier and fizzy on the scratchy finish. Light-bodied bordering on watery on the palate.. very artificial.. some Sprite stuck on the short finish. Donï¿½t need to drink this one again.

This is either a seasonal or a new beer... I thought it was ""ok."" Initially, the hop aroma was enticing, and the flavor was enjoyable. Although, after a few sips, it seemed to fade. Turned out to be similar to other light lagers (maybe pushing toward a dunkel) - with an extra dose of hops. But it wasn't enough for me. I fancy myself as a ""hophead,"" and this beer didn't satiate my hoppy appetite. Needless to say, it was nice to see... and try. My hat goes off to them for a worthy attempt."
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;Plenty of booze and a little floral vibe like acid rock album covers. A little oakiness puts this one off. Bottle.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours clear golden with very small frothy white head, faint earthy aroma, low carbonation, mildly bitter earthy taste with floral hops background, thin body, long finish. Very flavorful, enjoyable.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;After a long deliberation, we decided on this one and it was better than expected. It has a nice aroma of sugar sweet alcohol and apricot wheat funk. The appearance is a golden cloudy piss. The taste is alcohol on the nose (but not in a bad way) with a solid wheat / belgo yeast aftertaste. It grows on you the more sips ya take. Good for a Hump day of catching up on reviews and doing pre-holiday gift exchanges.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;Sample at SBWF 2017. Golden with a small white head. Aroma and taste of fruit esters, light spices and some malt. Some warming alcohol in the finish. An ok one.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;NIce ale! You get a bit of yeast, floral, and fruit. Itï¿½s a pretty nice mix, one at first sip I wasnï¿½t sure I liked but in the end a very above average brew.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;Tap at the source. Pours light yellow, white head. Aroma is lemon, orange, banana, clove, esters, wheat. Flavor is lots of bubblegum, esters, banana, clove, some lemon. Wow thatï¿½s estery. Not for me.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;At 9% alcohol I have no reason to complain. However, the flavors are not really the best.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;Smell of yeast and sour fruit, vinegar. Come clear golden color with thin white crown. Taste of yeast and sour fruit, somewhat bland. Slightly slimy texture. Just ok. Donï¿½t feel the tripel.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;12oz bottle. A crystalline gold pour with some minimal head. The aroma is sweet and alcoholic - the way I feel about most tripels. The flavors carry a bit of hop cleanliness and the traditional Belgian yeast. I liked the name and the label, but this struck me as standard tripel. I am unfortunately not the best audience for this particular style.
New Holland Black Tulip Trippel Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Tripel;New Holland Brewing Company;pours a clear straw gold with a medium to small white head. Aroma of banana, and a hint of floral. sweetish fruity taste. Banana and some light spice. Kind of a light perfume nasal linger. Sweetish finish. Pretty good.

Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;out of the bottle pours a playful amber gold hue with a medium bodied white head which lingers along with the lacing. smells crisp and clean of light hops and florals. at first the taste is mild and welcoming with a medley of citrus fruits, peaches, cherries and grapefruit coupled with floral hops. but the flavor finishes abruptly harshly bitter. a little watered down. well under-carbonated. a good attempt weï¿½ll say.
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;"Bottle... Hazy, light amber ale with a small, fizzy, white head. Good retention. Funky nose with notes of lye soap, chicken stock, and light grapefruit. Not offensive; just strange. Lemony, black tea flavor with medium bitterness. Medium-bodied with an astringent mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, bitter, grassy finish."
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;"Dark-tasting crispness; almost suggesting a roasted aftertaste characteristic of a strongly hopped porter--but no roast in the aroma. Flavour is balanced. Texture, a bit thin but not terribly thin. Good; very pleasant and easy to drink. Bitter but not as bitter as many pale ales."
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Not exceptional, but simply a good pale ale. Nice flavour, good hoppiness, fairly dry, not much malt, but good beer. Aroma is very malty with some subtle hops, good colour.
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Surprisingly pine hoppy aroma. Golden with an uneven head and some lacing. Taste was thinner, lightly malty, and plenty of juicy hops.
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;(Bottle) Courtesy of my good friend Argo0. Pours a large, white head with an orange body. Nose of tin, iodine, pine hops and milky malt. The flavour is somewhat unbalanced in its bitterness.
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;A decent enough pale ale, not exciting. Sort of a cross between an american and an english style pale ale - mainly because the malts remind me of Maris Otter but are probably just crystal malt. Nicely hoppy, but integrated. Somewhat hoppy. Creamy bottle-conditioned palate well done. Seems most of the beers from this brewery tend to emphasize balance and appealing mouthfeel.
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Pours hazy gold with a good looking roacky lacing well retained head. Aroma is mildly citric with apples. Flavour is sweet with clementines and apples. Pithy with a bit of earthy leaf and invert sugar. Apperance is the strong point. Quite a muted offering.
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;beautiful appearance, slightly hazy golden with a dense, rocky head, well retained but leaving nice lace. aroma of green apples, walnuts and grren leafy hops. some malty flavour of biscuits and caramel with mild pithy hops in the finish. not bad, but the beer looks way better than it is.
Williamsburg Pale Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Williamsburg Brewing Company;a hoppy, citrusy flavor...nice and refreshing. a golden color with white head. not too heavy on the hops. a decent pale ale.
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Aroma typical of a wheat beer. The flavour? Confused. Very wheaty. Somewhat sour. I can taste and like the hops, but itï¿½s not at all bitter. The carbonation has a zing to it that doesnï¿½t match the flavour and Iï¿½d rather the carbonation be less. Iï¿½ve had worse wheat beers though--the sourness is kept in check and itï¿½s thoroughly drinkable, although I would not remotely describe it as smooth. I find this beer is very very hard to describe with words.
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Bottle... Hazy, straw-colored ale with a small, frothy, white head. Earthy nose with notes of straw and Amaretto sugar cookies. The flavor is mostly bland, but unoffensive, refreshing and crisp. Fizzy. Decent Summer brew!
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;out of the bottle. pours a light hazy golden-yellow. Large, frothy white head, very carbonated. citrus aroma. tastes of corn and lemon. slightly hoppy and bitter finish and aftertaste. for a light beer its pretty tasty!
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Not my favorite from this company. Had an interesting taste, and at least is better than beers such as bud lite.
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;This had the flavor intensity of lemony water and not much carbonation. This was just lacking in pretty much every aspect.
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Aroma is a mixture of yeastiness and grass, with some hop aroma. The beer pours a golden yellow, remarkable for the intensity of the haze, even with a gentle pour. Large yeast pellet in the bottom of the bottle. Flavor is marked by predominant banana esters, some phenolic overtones and a marked yeast component. Hop bitterness seems out of balance with a pine resin predominance. Beer is way overcarbonated, with a large persistent white head. Mouthfeel consists of marked carbonation, light body. Overall, a somewhat flawed wheat. Would like to try on tap or a different bottle/batch.
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Fair as wheats go. Clean for sure, with that touch of butterscotch corn and metallic finish I get in alot of american wheats. Fair lemony citrus quality. Zesty.
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Very odd chemical aroma, somewhat plastic-like with raw fermented grains. Mild citrus. Pale dull hazy gold with thin white frothy lacing head. Light watery body with medium carbonation. Starts a bit lemony with raw wheat and plasticized taste. No hop bitterness. Dull lemony malt water that ran through a mile of stinky plastic pipe. Drain pour.
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;I tasted a hint of orange peel which of course wasnï¿½t added in this somewhat citrusy medium dry beer. It seems like a refreshing summer ale to me and I would definately like to taste this one on tap. Ifyou like wheat beers that have decent amounts of hops, this one isnï¿½t bad.
Williamsburg Wheat Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;(12oz bottle) Lightly hazed apple juice body topped by small white head. Aroma is medium sweet, orange, floral, light lemon. Taste is medium sweet, lemon/orange, herbal, floral, some tartness. Light-medium body, no real crispness. Unusually hoppy for a wheat beer, but nice nonetheless.
Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Bottle... Very dark, crimson beer with a small, creamy, tan head. Good retention. Vanilla, roasted nuts, cocoa and caramel in the nose. The flavor is generously bittered and moderately burnt. Medium-bodied and fizzy. Lengthy, burnt, bitter finish.
Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;"Deep red, not quite brown; hold it up to the light and see. Short head, some lacing. Aroma is a nice mix of hoppy and sweet. Taste is surprisingly bitter - I was expecting a lame over-sweetened brew. Palate is ok, but overly carbonated. Nice dry roasted finish."
Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;A very nice beer, and even better than the other Williamsburg beer that I have had before. A nice bitter hop taste and goes down pretty smooth.
Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;This is my first beer from Williamsburg Brewery. It was an excllent beginning. The Porter poured a dark brown with white frothy head. The flavors of burnt malt and roasted chocolate were evident thoughout. More chocolate than other flavors. This is a local product than can be enjoyed more in the future.
Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Yup, this one produces a massive, frothy, off-white head, and a dark brown and vibrant red blended body. The aroma has something suggesting grape and raisin amid a caramel cooking sauce, but the flavor is of another piece, initially being significantly smokey with a burnt bitter edge but then just more mildly port-like with a robust smoke finish. The palate remains reasonably frothy and not bad among porters. Quite nice, overall, and it went intriguingly well with ziti with Newmanï¿½s Italian sausage spaghetti sauce.
Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;(Bottle) Pours a huge, beige, frothy head with a deep reddish-brown body. Nose of molasses and burnt malt. This is perhaps the best exibit of molasses Iï¿½ve ever sampled. Flavour is very oily, molasses and coffee - bitter hops and smoked malt. Very good - I love this... Thanks Argo0.

Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Nice aroma with notes of coffee and chocolate, like Tootsie Roll fudge, with a bit of molasses. Has a bit of metallic tinny quality, too. Root beer brown clear with thin light tan lacing head. Medium bodied with light-medium carbonation. Decent malt sweetness, a bit weak, and is tempered by some mild acidity. Finish is quite dry, with roasted, almost burnt malts. Hop bitterness stays into the after. Mild coffee and chocolate, light tang.
Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;(12oz bottle) Big tan head atop a dark brown body possessing red highlights. Aroma is medium sweet, chocolate, some lactic sourness, nutty, light roasty. Taste is medium sweet, chocolate, earthy, some roasty, grapefruit, light coffee, lactic sour. Light-medium body. Other than the Willamette hop presence, seems a traditional version of the style, and does a nice job of balancing the malts with hops.
Williamsburg Porter;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Large light brown head, good retention and a fair amount of lace.

Lagunitas Imperial Stout;Petaluma, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Chocolatey, with coffee undertones. Honestly, this drinks like a porter, but in an imperial stout...amazing. This is pretty smooth, IMO and the alcohol is very well concealed. Maybe too well hidden, haha. For the price of five bucks at the local specialty store, I couldn't resist, and I am glad I didn't. Some imperial stouts are quite bitter, but this hits the perfect balance for my taste. If you are in a the market for a good imperial representation of a stout, give this a try. I bet you won't be disappointed.

At 10% ABV (I rounded) it packs the necessary punch an imperial stout needs. This is my preferred beer style and Lagunitas does a great job with it here, especially for an unlimited release. A perfect dessert beer. Pair with smoked meats if you can.
Lagunitas Imperial Stout;Petaluma, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Pours dark with no little to no head. No depth or complexity. Way too light of a mouthfeel. Lacks a certain smoothness. I am not a fan of IS's this hoppy.

Chocolate, nuts, cocoa, dark malt, coffee, and a hint of smoke. The body seemed a tad thin to me...but a minor flaw. This is a really fine sessionable brew.

Pours a clear dark brown colored brew with a beige head. Aroma of roasted nuts, light chocolate and caramel. Taste is medium bodied, smooth, with a little metallic aftertaste.

Port Washington Old Port Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;On tap at Hops Haven. Poured deep mahogany with a short cap of beige head. Nose was very sweet.. rockinï¿½ the lightly-roasted coffee and milk chocolate.. dark fruits emerged as this aired out.. farily complex. Flavor was of lightly-roasted cocoa and milk chocolate with the secondary dark fruit again.. coffee bitterness provides a nice accent. Powdery cocoa feel on the palate with light-medium roast and a medium body. Not a great porter, but a solid one.
Port Washington Old Port Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Opaque and deep brown in color with a short creamy tan head. Trademark reserved aroma ï¿½ this time itï¿½s like the kegging room with a spilt box of Swiss Miss scattered haphazardly. Fuller body than expected. Some flavors of cocoa powder, dark chocolate and black currant. A conservative interpretation of a sweet stout in my opinion. Decent balance with a finish thatï¿½s acidic at the corners but not too distracting.
Port Washington Old Port Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;This is how Porters should be done. Gobs of flavor, especially the draft version as opposed to the bottled version (which is actually contract-brewed elsewhere.) Coffee, chocolate, malt, and shwing!!
Port Washington Old Port Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Draft. I had this at the new Hops Haven Brew Haus in Sheboygan, where Port Washington is new being brewed, This has a wonderful black malt and coffee taste enhanced by its flavorful nose. The head is typically thin but clings to the sides of the glass. Excellent smoothness punctuated by a slight hop finish.
Port Washington Old Port Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Nice brownish head, but quickly dissapated. excellent dark color. Aroma was very roasty with some chocolate in there. Was a bit thin in my mouth but the taste more than compensated. Strong with out being over powering, with a nice finish. Very good beer, one of the best I have had.

Siam;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Siam billed an ""Asian Style Lager"" is actually a German style larger called Helles. Asian countries turned to the Germans when they decided to brew beer, and that infulence can be seen to this day. Siam is actually a very well done Helles. This beer pours to a beautiful, bright, deep golden color, with a nice white head, and a nice bit of carbonation. The nose is very malty with some nice balancing hop aromatics. The palate is crip, and clean with great pale malt flavors. This beer finishes with more malt flavor up front, and then dries with a nice balance of hop bitterness. A great beer from the Old Dominion Brewing Company, one of the best microbreweries in the US. Seek this one out if you can find it in the DC Metro Area. Goes great with Asian and German fare."

Port Washington Pier 96 Lager;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Attractive beading/bright golden pour/fluffy white head all contribute to the good looks of this brew. Flavor though was thin, weak, timid and disappointing...even for a pale lager. There was a very light herbal hop not in the finish...and the finish was the best part of this drink.

Grainy and kinda corny on the nose with some pale malt and cereal notes.. bit of citrus too.. rather weak but pleasant. This was tasty and refreshing... cereal malts at the core with lemongrass and mild floral bitterness surrounding. Lighter-bodied. Higher carbonation made it rather spritzy.. still refreshing, though.
Port Washington Pier 96 Lager;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Clear gold in color with a thin sheet of a white splotch for the head. Reserved aroma, with some flour off the grocery shelves and a little underlying lemon signals. Watery and carbonated with a hops injection as an afterthought. Served too cold, probably trying to mask how terrible this one really is. Musky, skunked finish.

Port Washington Pier 96 Lager;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;This brewery offers three bottled beers: Old Port Porter, Amber ale, and this lager, Pier 96. These are all contract brewed and bottled by another brewery, but the draft versions brewed in Sheboygan by Mr. Kolar (with a little help from Mr. Fillion) are far and away vastly superior. This lager is excellent on tap. So much more to offer than American Macro brewers. If you consume nothing but Bud and Miller, give your tastebuds an a workout!

Pours a hazy deep amber with a rough off-white head. Classic American aroma of caramel and overripe fruit. Medium body with caramel and overripe fruit, somewhat oxidized and then killed by a very distinct underlying acidity and a bad chemical tang. Sour rather than bitter finish.

Pours hazy to murky brown/orange with a lacing off-white head. Mild butterish and light fruity to toasted malty aroma. Flavour is mild breadish and light caramel malty.

Port Washington Amber Ale;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;A nice medium bodied brew, pours a dark but clear amber colour with a full head. Sporatic bursts of hops in each sip. Aroma is pleasent with lightly roasted biscuit malts.
Port Washington Amber Ale;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Somewhat tame rendition of a rather bland style to begin with. The lightly roasted caramel malt is there along with a relatively timid hop bite (which is to say, to style) but there are so many other (better) choices available.

Heavy Cascade-y presence in the flavor (citrus and pine bitterness).. lemon meat and caramel sweetness at the base with a rather high level of bitterness. This wanted to be creamy on the palate, but fizzled out to a tacky finish.
Port Washington Hefe Weiss;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Sample at Hops Haven. Orange-tan with a slight, thin haze. A decent Hefe, with some orange-banana tones. Mild clove as well. A little sugary.

Port Washington Hefe Weiss;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Very attractive hazy golden pour, releasing a pretty potent typical banana and cut grass aroma. The flavors were spot on to style, bananas/cloves/grassiness/yeasty fruitiness, etc. Quite nicely brewed and refreshing.
Port Washington Hefe Weiss;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;"On tap at the brewpub in Sheboygan, WI as the ""Triple H Hefeweizen."" Pours a hazy golden brew with a thick fizzy off white head that dissolves slowly to a good lacing. Aroma of bananas, a touch of wheat and some vanilla. Taste is smooth, creamy with a solid banana aftertaste. This beverage is lacking any yeast aroma or aftertaste in which I consider very refreshing. One of the best hefeweizens I have tried. I hope to find this beverage packaged in bottles sometime soon."
Port Washington Hefe Weiss;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;"On tap at Hops Haven as Triple ""H"" Hefeweizen. Poured damn near clear dull golden with a short white head. Nose had a whole lot of sweet bubblegum and banana.. accented by lemon zest and peppery spices. This is the most concrete example of bubblegum in a beer that Iï¿½ve come across. Flavor was rockinï¿½ the sweet bubblegum too with bunches of bananas.. clove and white pepper accents.. sweet overall and very well done. Creamy middle of the palate with ideal carbonation.. tart wheat and citrus going outward. This was an excellent hefe."

Port Washington Hefe Weiss;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Barely cloudy and solid orange in color. No head, but numerous bubbles breaking at the surface. Aroma is 99% bananas and 1% cloves. Honest to God, nothing else exists in aroma. High carbonation and a little watery and slick at first. Some flavor elements of orange rind, lemon juice and dried banana chips. Effervescent and tingly on the palate. Some pepper and cloves on the backend for the aftertaste. A decent interpretation and one of the few tolerable beers from this brewery.
Port Washington Hefe Weiss;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;"Festival tap: labeled ""TRIPLE H"" for Hops Haven Hefe. Cloudy hefe with candilike nose. Only hints of banana. Thin and dominated by the candy flavor."

Port Washington Raspberry Wheat;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Sampled on our Great Lakes beer tour. Pale light gold. Smells likes raspberries. Reminds me of raspberry zotz from the late 70s, which is probably not a good thing. Thereï¿½s a honey sweetness, but the raspberry flavor isnï¿½t quite right.

Port Washington Raspberry Wheat;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Light wheat beer overly infused with a slighly artificial raspberry juice flavor that seemed to overwhelm everything else here. Some hop bite (floral in nature) seemed to redeem things slightly.
Port Washington Raspberry Wheat;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Cloudy straw color with a light hue of pink. Fresh raspberries in the aroma along with a touch of sweet wheat. Flavors of bananas and raspberries. I have to wonder if they have tweaked the recipe from some of the earlier ratings. While there is a slight sugar raspberry flavor, it is balanced by some banana and pale malts. I found this quite drinkable from a fruit beer standpoint.

Port Washington Raspberry Wheat;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;"Festival tap: Not sure why they bothered hauling this to a festival. It was brewpub cookiecutter all the way, just another ""plain jane"" ras-wheat with nothing to write home about. Sweet fresh berry nose, thin body, lightly pink tint to the color. Grainy in the middle."

Portsmouth Octoberfest;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Portsmouth Brewery;Considering that they make this every year, Iï¿½m a little surprised to be the first reviewer of this beer in 5 years.

Poured a clear, light-medium golden with a short white head. The nose was distinct, expressive, and enticing... fresh pumpkin pie filling, nutmeg, and cardamom with sweet caramel and candy as it warmed up. Flavor was pumpkin pie goodness!

Port Washington Pumpkin Smashing Ale;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Just had a Pumpkin beer from somewhere out West, and I'm still trying to choke down that six-pack. This offering from Hops Haven Brewhaus (Port Washington Brewery)is a world beyond that. The color is, well, orange like pumpkins! Nice pumpkin pie aroma, with cinnamon and the nutmeg showing nicely, not the plastic/waxy flavor of so many other pumpkin offerings. A bit more malt would be welcomed,but this is amazingly good considering it hasn't been brewed for a few years. Could quaff this all night!

Port Washington Black Cherry Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;On tap at Hops Haven Brew Haus. Dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma of chocolate covered cherry, perhaps a chocolate covered black cherry. Funny the description says a hint of cherry but thatï¿½s pretty much all the aroma is.

Port Washington Black Cherry Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;"Roasty chocolate/coffee/toffee porter-like flavors mixed with sweet b;lack cherries. First few sips were fine, but I began to obsess with the notion that I was tasting a Smith Bros. cough drop in my beer. Not really a bad beer, yet not one Iï¿½d reorder."
Port Washington Black Cherry Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Very dark brown with a touch of rudy when held to the light. Medium dark beige head. Aromas quite similar to the Old Port with dark malt and chocolate, but with a hint of cherry. Dark cherry flavors, akin to kool-aid, mixed with a porter do sum up the start.

Pours a dark cola caramel colored brew with a light tan head. Some spotty lacing. Aroma of black cherry, a slight chocolate and nutty character.

An interesting fruit porter and could see this marketed as a terrific Christmas porter.
Port Washington Black Cherry Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;On tap at Hops Haven. This was the star of the evening... Poured a clear, deep brown with garnet highlights and a medium beige head. Nose was primarily of black cherry skins with dark roasted chocolate malts in the background. Cherries were dominant in the flavor, too.. which turned out brilliantly... deeply-roasted dark chocolate and coffee bitterness were very supportive.. tangy black cherry finish lasted for a while. At least medium-bodied on the palate.. grainy at times, but still felt good. I would love to see more brewers use these cherries.
Port Washington Black Cherry Porter;Sheboygan, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Hops Haven Brew Haus/Port Washington Brewing Co.;Enjoyed at Great Taste of the Midwest. Black body with tan head. Nose bursting with sweet cherry/chocolate aroma. Very impressive aroma. The taste was a slight step back from the nose, but still pretty damn decent. Roasted malts and toffee to the forefront, subdued raspberries as well. There was a slight aftertaste of stickly sweet cherry flavoring, but itï¿½s a small price to pay for an otherwise nice porter.

Craft Black Lager;Paiania, Greece;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Craft Brewery;[Thanks to fugitive]. Bottled. Dark brown colour with a light beige head with an average duration. Aroma is toasty with light hints of chocolate. Flavor is cocoa, with a toasty maltiness, and slightly sweet. Dry final.
Craft Black Lager;Paiania, Greece;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Craft Brewery;"(33 cl bottle from On the Rocks, Plakias, Crete; Produced on May 25th 2012) Pours a clear dark brown with tan head. Decent retention and good lace. Aroma is definitely toffee and what to me resembles brown ale although it might be schwarzbier as I donï¿½t have much knowledge of the style other than that it is dark and bottom fermented. I donï¿½t detect many fruity esters in this beer. No hops detectable either. Oily texture, soft carbonation, medium body and a sweet finish. Taste follows the nose with sweet toffee being the predominant impression.. Once again pleasant to find well balanced non-pale alesmin the Cretan summer climate. Decently drinkable."
Craft Black Lager;Paiania, Greece;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Craft Brewery;September 2008: This brewery doesnï¿½t mess around with fancy names. The four fonts on offer at the only bar Iï¿½ve seen this beer at were: Lager, Black Lager, Red Ale and Weiss Bier. Poured into the breweries own glassware, this beer was jet black with a good tan head on top. It looked impressive sat next to the nuts and warming in the early evening sun by the harbour in Chania, Crete. The aroma was all about roasted and burnt malts, as was the taste. Sadly it was just like drinking a watered down, fizzy Porter or Stout. There was no creaminess or rich body to it at all. It was a lager, but black and with a smell (unlike most lagers). The beer just didnï¿½t feel right, it looked so wholesome and inviting, but failed to live up to its looks. It was too fizzy and lacked body.
Craft Black Lager;Paiania, Greece;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Craft Brewery;Pours dark, thin looking with a small head that recedes almost immediately. Looks like a glass of coca cola with no ice. Nose is roasted marshmallows, small hint of smoke and a little bit of fruit. Flavor is sweet mostly. Toward the end it bitters a bit only to take on a metallic flavor. Also a bit watered down. Light bodied, mouthfeel is oily and slippery with a medium to long aftertaste. Drinkable, but I wouldnï¿½t order on purpose .
Craft Black Lager;Paiania, Greece;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Craft Brewery;Dark brown color with a small head. Coffee, dark chocolate and roasted taste and aroma. Some hops on the finish. Not a fan of black beers. But it wasnï¿½t bad.

Moylans Moylander Double IPA;Novato, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;Big dissapointment. Beer has some bready, honey notes which are very unwanted in IIPA in my opinion. Beside that itï¿½s rather dry, doesnï¿½t have much of sweetness.

Mini-haze to my otherwise standard looking pilsner/lager, yellow more than golden with the usual fading white head most in this style seem to have. The beer was spritzy, lemony, crisp and finished with a dry bitterness, not bad at all, pity the brewery has now closed.

Craft Pilsner Beer;Paiania, Greece;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Craft Brewery;50cl bottle, 1 month old. Crete. Aroma of honey and grapefruit. Beautiful thin foam, and golden color. Most bitter pilsner I have had in years. Slightly salty. Perfect medium body for pilsener, thin texture and lively carbonation. Better to be enjoyed on its own. Taste is amazingly multicolored for pilsener. Perfect example of this beer type for me. Grab it as fresh as you can.

Faint malty aroma. Mostly malty taste, light bitter, with a medium bitter finish. Pretty watery, though. Thin body, medium carbonation, watery texture. Didnï¿½t really expected to say that, but I think I prefer their lager that the pilsner. Below average pilsener.

Craft Athens Lager;Paiania, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Craft Brewery;500ml out of date bottle: bought and drank while on holiday (Mykonos), 11 May 2013. Sorry to see these guys have stopped brewing: I have had a few of their beers and each has been fine, a sad loss to the Greek beer scene. This beer was pale gold and had all the usual lager/pilsner atributes: clear, bright and clean looking with a swiftly fading white head. Almost odourless apart from hints of grain in the nose. Refreshing and fairly sweet in the taste but not a huge flavouring of anything worthy of note. Pleasant to drink after laying around in the sun all day, but not a serious beer hunters target.

Decent pale lager, expected worse than that.
Craft Athens Lager;Paiania, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Craft Brewery;50cl Bottle on Syros, Greece. Clear golden colour, white head. Just a very bland lager, light sweet, with a hint of lemon. There are better macro(!) options in Greece. Light-bodied.

Ilzer Hefeweissbier;Monor, Hungary;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ilzer Sï¿½rgyar;From bottle at Mï¿½zeum Cukrï¿½szda, Budapest. Clear pale golden colour with rich head. Vague aroma from citric and banana. The aroma reveals very little from Bavarian Yeast. Slight phenolic in flavour, and very light in body. Lemony backbone. Tasty beer with bit too much of lemon, maybe from hop extract. Not infected from brett or the likes but clearly too much of citrus.

Ziggy Socky;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Obviously a novelty beer. Bought this a few years ago in CT, and still had one kicking around. Slight floral aroma, and a decent color - inbetween your avg american brew and a microbrew like Sam Adams. Better flavor than expected, easy to drink.
Ziggy Socky;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Deep amber color, cream colored head, nice aroma, hillarious label. But thatï¿½s where it ends. This beer tastes terrible. The sixer I tried was fresh, too.
Ziggy Socky;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;By all recollections, the age of the beer I rated was likely on the high side (2+ years?). So, lack of freshness may have hurt the rating. That aside, I could not find anything redeeming about this beer. Dark yellow color, kind of like the old St. Pauli girl I had about 6 months ago. Frothy white head that fully eroded. Bland, flat.
Ziggy Socky;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;2 bucks a six pack of bottles at the Grocery Outlet! It had somewhat of an apricot flavor. Not bad at all, and the bottle caps own. Grab a beer and drop your pants!
Ziggy Socky;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Ok, what can you really expect from this beer? I bought one simply to say Ziggy Socky, Ziggy Socky hoy-hoy-hoy! But, surprisingly this was one of the smoothest most drinkable lagers I've ever had. Their market as a novelty brew will probably be pretty good, but with poor exposure. If it were, and if they could mass produce this beer to compete with Bud, Miller, etc they would probably do pretty well.

Ilzer Dunkel Weissbier;Monor, Hungary;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Ilzer Sï¿½rgyar;Bottled, pasteurised. Brown amber colour with thin head. I was lucky enough to find the two Ilzer beers in the same bar so could compare, and this is the ugly sister Iï¿½m afraid. Looks reasonable, but the flavour impact is almost totally missing. Thin malty and sweet, a rather unfortunate beer. I also noted that no-one else in the bar ordered it.

Adelsburg Pils;Monor, Hungary;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlï¿½;Ilzer Sï¿½rgyar;Bottle courtesy of and shared with ogivlado (thanks!) Poured a golden body with a persistent thick creamy white head. Quite lively carbonation. Faint nose, bit grainy with some light hopiness. The taste starts with some bready grainy maltiness carrying notes of honey. Lightly acidic lemony hopiness. Definitely a solid lager and one of the best Hungarian beers, but that unfortunately doesnï¿½t mean much and itï¿½s still nothing special. Itï¿½s a refreshing lager that I wouldnï¿½t mind having again.
Adelsburg Pils;Monor, Hungary;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlï¿½;Ilzer Sï¿½rgyar;Normal pilsner with moderated malty and yestly flavour.This is the only hungarian factory wich keep the german purity-law.

Odell Isolation Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;"Not a lot of aroma to this one; some dark malts and that's about it. Flavor is caramel and more chocolate than I expected. Slight bit of bitterness in the finish. Lacks the complexity of the best English Strongs; not much fruit, toast, or other nuances. Admit I'm a little disappointed and underwhelmed here."
Odell Isolation Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;330ml can at home. Pours a deep reddish amber. Thin fizzy off white head, aroma of biscuit and sweet bready malts, some oak and mahogany woody notes. Flavour is smooth and sweet malts, slight bit of resin bitterness. Easy drinker
Odell Isolation Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Draft. Deep amber body. Fizzy, off-white head. Malty aroma of caramel, toasted grain, cookie, earthiness, light grapefruit rind. The flavor moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Thin for a winter warmer. Taste of grain. Was tired of this half-way through the pint.
Odell Isolation Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;The name of this beer matches very well with the style. Itï¿½s malty flavor is very sweet and perfect for winter. Itï¿½s caramelly and thick but itï¿½s also pretty clean. I like it a lot.

Aroma is of bread and bananas. Taste is very weak, not much going on here. Tastes like weak tea with a bit of caramel stirred in.
Odell Isolation Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Bottle. Deep copper color, almost reddish. Creamy off-white head. Malty caramel aroma, low hops.

Odell Isolation Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Can pours a hazy reddish-brown color with a creamy tan head that lingers leaving massive amounts of lace on glass. Aromas of dark bread, a bit of spice and a hint of alcohol but really not much else. Tastes of toffee, bread and a smidge of chocolate and minerals. Medium body, nice lively carbonation, silky, creamy mouthfeel and a mildly sweet crisp finish. I love this beer because itï¿½s not heavy, itï¿½s easy to drink and itï¿½s smooth!
Odell Isolation Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Sample at Veteran's. Pours a clear, dark brown color, with a small, tan head.

Odell Isolation Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;12floz bottle, BBD: 05.14.2018, $1.75 unit cost, pint glass. Appears a darker hue of amber and head is the color of beige. A well malted ale in the nose and palate. Notes of toffee, raisin, and tobacco present. Full bodied as it heavily coats my mouth. This isn't a spiced winter warmer, and I like it as a main go to option for that sensibility without being superfluous.
Dominion Millennium;Dover, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Oaky and pretty foul. Super oaky. Hazy maroon without much head or lacing. Bitter and boozy like a lost your job drunk. Tap at Big hunt.
Dominion Millennium;Dover, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Backlog rating. Cloudy orange, no head. Wooden nose. Amber/resin spice taste. Marzipan, orangepeel, wood - which lingers on in the aftertaste.
Dominion Millennium;Dover, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);355ml bottle. Amber pour. Aroma is boozy and minty. Flavor is sweet and spicy, herbal,whatever.
Dominion Millennium;Dover, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Lucked out at a bottle share and got the 1998 version. Pours clear mahogany, no head to speak of. Aroma is very sweet and boozy. Flavor features roasted malt, caramel, woody and fruity tones. Mouthfeel has decent body of not much fizz - but it has been 19 years, maybe 20. Toast the Dominion!

Dominion Millennium;Dover, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Bottling date Feb 1995 - 20 year old bottle. Pours chestnut brown with minimal head. The aroma has toasted malt, dough, toffee, richness and English yeast. It has a rich body with very little soft carbonation. The flavor starts with toasty malt, wood, oxidation and weird household cleaner. The finish is dry, but has a broken sugar aspect as well. Interesting. Not perfect, but for twenty years old itï¿½s held up pretty respectable.
Dominion Millennium;Dover, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Great reddish dark garnet red color, clear. Earthy hop aroma and sweetness. Strong malty flavor with some old ale sherry going on. Overall pretty good beer.
Dominion Millennium;Dover, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);12 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet. A: Pours a dark amber color with good clarity. While the head is quite creamy, it only pours about half a finger high (eggshell shade) and doesnï¿½t even have good retention to make up for it. Small hints of lacing are left on the glass. S: Immediately, I notice a boozy character, albeit a defined and non-harsh one. Caramel is (expectedly) strong here, along with toffee, earth, leather, and even something suggesting candy-coated hops. Honey is a lesser characteristic semi-hidden underneath the primary notes. Aromatically, there isnï¿½t much to get excited about, but by no means is it unsatisfactory. T: It starts with a healthy nutty flavor. Itï¿½s past the midpoint where this one gets interesting. Thereï¿½s just enough hoppiness here - existing as a slight herbal (and, at points, even citrusy) tone on the back end - to ballast the sweetness without coming off like some big DIPA. Did I mention itï¿½s boozy? Thereï¿½s no monstrous sugar note here (it is a bit sweet and candy-like at times, but hey itï¿½s 10.5%) to cover the alcohol, so the latter is rather prevalent. However, it does its job well: it gives the beer some complex nuance without being ruinously burning or unbalanced. Itï¿½s both complex AND well-integrated, so in that regard, itï¿½s a big success. M: While itï¿½s boozy, it isnï¿½t a harsh booziness. Plus, itï¿½s rather dry. While it could use a longer finish by all means, that means this one is easy to drink, even with its full body. Maybe I should call it an easy sipper...yeah, thatï¿½s perfect, easy sipper. O: This is a barleywine for barleywine lovers. Itï¿½s boozy, kind of challenging, but drinkable to those who can handle it. Itï¿½s a fantastic aging candidate - too bad the twist-off cap is going to oxidize it too quickly...
Dominion Millennium;Dover, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Bottle at home from notes 07. Pours reddish copper with a smaller disappearing white head. The aroma and flavor have caramel, dark fruit, fig, dates, brown sugar, a hint of vanilla, and some citrus elements. Decent mouthfeel. Decent enough, sweet, I definitely liked the oak aged version better.

Dominion Oak Barrel Stout (Brewpub Version);Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);A super dark brown pour, light tan head that rises about two fingers, gone quickly. Light lacing...Light aroma, combo of vanilla, coffee, and alcohol...The taste comes out of nowhere, no idea it would be this vanilla from the aroma. Dominated by vanilla on the front, but on the finish its dull bitter coffee and alcohol and wood. The finish is also very chalky, a residual powder feel which is not nice. Very alcoholic for a 5% beer. Overall, this is a big miss. The first sip is nice vanilla but after that its all downhill. The vanilla disappear and you get a powder feel.
Dominion Oak Barrel Stout (Brewpub Version);Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);12os btl thanks to FunkyBrewster. Pours dark with a frothy tan head. Slightly sweet aroma of vanilla and roasted malt. Most of the flavor is of vanilla that kicks in towards the finish. A little dark fruit, barrel, vanilla, and just a hint of bourbon. Not a bad stout.

Dominion Brown Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Brown Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On the money brown ale, English style. OK drinkability, but nothing special. Malty and brown colour, Not complex. Tallboy from the brewery.
Dominion Brown Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Brown Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);The Old Dominion Brewing Company of Ashburn, VA has an outstanding little brewpub attached to the brewery. This really is a small and cozy place, with great pub grub, and is the place to be if you want to taste Dominionï¿½s offerings. Beer lovers from around the country have made the trek to Virginia with the sole purpose of trying Old Dominion brewed beers. There is always about 22-26 taps of beer flowing from the taps, along with two beer engines, great beer and great variety is a hallmark of this brewery. What is great about the brewpub is, there are a few special beers that can only be found at the brewpub. One such beer is Dominion Brown Ale. This beer is an American brown ale by style, making it a bit more flavorful and much more hoppy than its British counter part. Dominion Brown ale is a fantastic example of this style. This beer is dry hopped with Cascades to get that signature citric, piney, hop aroma in the nose, and bittered with Galenas. Three malts are used in this beer, including caramel, carapils, and chocolate malt. This is a sweet malty and hoppy brown ale, one of the best examples of the style I have ever tasted. This beer is available on draught only, but growlers can be filled to go. One will often find this beer on one of the beer engines in cask conditioned form as well. Dominion Brown ale pours to a deep brown/mahogany color with nice white head, and good carbonation. The nose on this beer is very fragrant with piney, citric hop aromas, no mistaking it, it is Cascades. But there is also a nice back drop of chocolate and caramel malt aroma as well. The palate is a firm malt back bone of sweet caramel, and chocolate malt flavors. This beer finishes with more good malt character up front then dries out to a nice, bitter hop bite. Really a complex and flavorful brown ale, and as stated a perfect example of this style. This is a great drinking beer. I would match this with a big juicy burger and a heaping order of fries doused in Dominion All Malt Vinegar. This beer really goes great with a good cigar as well. Iï¿½ve been known to smoke a Te Amo or two in my day, and a growler of this goes quite well with that cigar.
Dominion Brown Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Brown Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at Hard Time Cafe - College Park, MD. Bring it out of retirement! It certainly was not the Belgian Brown (well...according to the tap handle anyway). Clear dark chestnut brown, lasting light tan creamy head. A very nice malty nose on this with toasted marshmallow, butterscotch, milk chocolate, with hints of toffee, and a very light nuttiness. Flavor was similar with soft sweet toasted malt getting a nice dose of hoppy bitterness at the end. Real nice balance overall. Medium bodied and silky, soft carbonation, toasted malty finish. A perfect brew to consume in quantity. Nice job as usual...

Dominion Real Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Amber. Hoppy aroma. Smells fresh. Creamy with a slight beer aftertaste as well as a hoppy bitterness. Solid beer. What a good beer should taste like. Capital Ale House in Richmond.
Dominion Real Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);This was my first Cask Real Ale. The color was like amber. The ale was not one of the best I have enjoyed from Capital Ale House. It was sweet with a malty flavor. The hops were not balanced with the malt. There was little carbonization.
Dominion Real Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Poured cask at Capital Ale House - Innsbrook. A reddish-amber body with a thin white head. Nice aroma, hops, caramel, nutty malts. Good taste, somewhat hoppy with a nice malt backbone. Very nice overall.

Dominion Real Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Dominion Real Ale is pulled from the beer engine, and has a beautiful, bright, amber color, with a thick, creamy white head from the use of a sparkler, and a very, very soft carbonation. This beer is served at cellar temperature which ranges from 40-54 degrees. This allows the flavors and aromas of this beer to really be showcased. The nose on this beer is outstanding. Very fragrant, flowery, hop aromatics flood the nose. This beer is dry hopped, a small mesh bag of hops is actually placed in the keg. The palate is a firm malt back bone of pale malts. Fruity esters and biscuit like malt flavors coat the tongue. The body on this beer is very soft, and this beer is very drinkable. Dominion real ale finishes with more fruitiness up front, then dries out with a long, bitter, hop finish. This is an outstanding example of real ale, and reminds me much of my beloved, departed Bank Street ale. This is a great beer to match with steak and kidney pie, or a hot order of fish and chips. Dominion has taken to cask conditioning a number of their beers, and you will often find beers like Tuppers Hop Pocket or Dominion Porter on the beer engine as well. It is always a treat for me to see what is being pulled from the beer engine, and I often find myself enjoying a pint of real ale at the brewery.
Dominion Real Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at the brewpub. Pours amber with a smallish white head. Subtle aroma of bready malts and floral hops. Very creamy. Flavor matches the aroma, with some wood notes. Very nice session beer.
Dominion Real Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Had this on tap at the Old Dominion Brewpub is Ashburn Virginia. This appeared a cloudy golden yellow with a good sized rocky off white head. Great head retention as a half-inch of head was still left in the glass after all the beer was consumed. The aroma was of a pleasant floral and citric hop scent that was not too strong or too weak but just right. The taste was crisp clean hoppy goodness with the citric standing at the forefront and slight earthy notes in it as well. Malt didnï¿½t play a big a part in the flavor as it did in balancing this out. Mouthfeel was creamy with a medium body and this went down very smooth. Definitely on of my favorite non-seasonal beers that the brew pub offers.
Dominion Real Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);GOldeb body, little to no carbonation. The aroma is very mild, with some slight floral hops. The flavor is mostly hops, with citrus dominating. The malts are very thin which detracts a bit for me. Ok but not great.
J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draught. Pours clear amber with small white head.

J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft at Old Glory in Georgetown. Pours a decent amber with a thin off white head. The head leaves quickly and produces minamal lacing. The aroma was of caramel malts. Not real strong though. Has a decent carbination. The flavors is light but get toasted malts. Has a light body. The finish is light but okay and not much of an aftertaste. This wasnï¿½t either bad or good but better than drinking macro swill.

J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at Old Glory in Georgetown. Not too impressed with this one, it had some nice caramel notes in the thinly malty body and a light aroma of hops with slight bitterness at the finish. Palate was watery - my main complaint. Drink this with food, it wonï¿½t get in the way.
J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);This beer was horribly off when I had it at the brewpub on 01-20-07.

J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);At Old Dominion Brewpub, 10/17/2006. Faint aroma. Thin head. Very weak flavor. Disappointing.
J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);This one poured with the usual amber color of its style, but with absolutely NO head (they had just swapped the keg too) and no lacing. The smell was a little musty and malty, maybe some nuts in there. Hops were noticeably absent in the aroma and even flavor (was this really intended to be an amber?). Flavor was of strong malts. Very drinkable and smooth mouthfeel (low carbonation), a decent session beer, but a complete miss within style.
J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draught at Old Dominion Brewpub 3/1/2006: Coppery amber body with a small eggshell-colored head that sticks. Body is clear showing medium-sized bubbles. The aroma is mild overall, but does show some mild hops, a bit of caramel & toasty malt, along with a touch of grains. The taste is mild toasted caramel malt that almost feels dry in the mouth, a hint of floral hops, and a touch of butterscotch that is barely noticable. Light-medium body, medium carbonation, finishes clean and crisp and also nicely dry.
J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at Old Glory, M st., D.C. Had upstairs and outside on the deck. Cool setting. Crisp, clean, a fresh finish, fair to perhaps slightly above average in most categories. With the great description, great hops & malts should come off a bit better.
J. Pauls 1889 Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours a medium copper body with a frothy tan head. Some light citrus and hop bitterness on the nose. Flavor starts with a nice hop bite mellowed out by a smooth malty finish. Good beer.
Old (Auld) Dubliner Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft at the pub. Pours a clear amber with an off white head which is deminishing but laces okay. Has a caramel aroma with slight hints of hops. The carbination was good. The flavor is malty and refreshing. Has a watery texture. Light to medium body. Has an alright finish and aftertaste. Not awful, and was refreshing but not a real deep beer. It is what it is.

Old (Auld) Dubliner Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);(02.03.06) On tap at Old Dominion brewpub, Ashburn, VA. Clear brown ale having a tiny head. No discernable carbonation. Light sweet malt aroma. Medium bodied ale that starts dry with slight hop and malt flavors. Finishes dry with lingering hop bitterness. A good dry drinkable amber ale.
Old (Auld) Dubliner Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Auld Dubliner Amber Ale which is brewed by Old Dominion exclusively for the legendary Dubliner Pub, located downtown Washington, DC. You will find this draught only, Irish Red Ale in just two places, on tap at the Dub, and on tap at the brewery in Ashburn. This beer is an authentic, very, very well done domestic example of the classic red ales of Ireland. It is brewed with pale, caramel, and black malts, and hopped with imported Irish Northdown hops. Auld Dubliner comes in at 4.6% abv, making this a great choice for a session beer, and a great beer to bring home in your growler. Auld Dubliner Amber Ale pours to a beautiful, bright, amber color with a soapy white head that fades, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very fresh and inviting, with aromas of sweet and caramel malts, paired with some nice spicy/herbal hop aromas, and undertones of estery fruit. The palate is firm with lots of good caramel malt and estery fruity flavors, with some buttery notes that glide over the tongue. Auld Dubliner finishes with more caramel and fruit flavors up front, then ends with a nice, spicy hop bite that lingers.
Old (Auld) Dubliner Amber Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Tap in DC. A very sweet flavored ale. Nice rich amber color with very little head. A little sweet for my taste but excellent for the style. Very mild hop bitterness rounds out the flavor.
Dominion Sweetwater Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Deep copper. Nose has a bit of caramel, some bitterness. Flavor is quite hoppy, but itï¿½s hoppy in a ""tasteless bitter"" way, instead of some noticeably floral, citric, or interesting way. Some sweetness at the end. Decent."
Dominion Sweetwater Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Not as hoppy as I had hoped. On tap at the Brew Pub in Ashburn, VA. Hoppy aroma. Not much head. Nice malt/hop balance. A pretty decent brew!
Dominion Sweetwater Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);A decent APA. More malty than most, not that that is a bad thing. Overall aroma and flavors are pretty subdued. Quite a bit different than the beer that they brew at the Sweetwater Tavern restaurants. As of early June 2003 no longer available in bottles due to a lawsuit.
Dominion Sweetwater Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);I believe this is the beer I should be rating. I had this beer a few years ago in a case purchased from Costco for very cheap, and I found it again in single bottles at Norm's in Vienna, Virginia. The colour was darkish orange with a nice pale head. A mild hoppy smell mixed with acidic fruits such as grapefruit. The taste was fairly mild, but definately reasonable for a pale ale. My only complaint for this beer was that it was a tad watery. Nothing like any of the Saranac beers, but still noticable. A very worthy pale ale, just like most of the beers that come from Dominion! Give this a try, then try some of the other Dominion beers: Tupper's Hop Pocket, New River Pale Ale, the list goes on and on!
Dominion Sweetwater Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Sampled at the brewery. Plenty of hop aromatics, but I think the malt is the more intriguing part of this beer--lots of slightly English style malt and a little bit of estery character make this extremely drinkable.

Dominion Golden Lager;Dover, Delaware, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at Dominion. Deep clear golden with a medium white head, a little darker than their highly superior Dominion Lager. Aroma is of light grass and hay. Flavor has notes of grain, some caramel and a little grassy hoppiness. Moderately sweet, medium hop bitterness at the end. Full, round and creamy with lively carbonation. As stated, not nearly as good as the Dominion Lager but not awful either.
Dominion Golden Lager;Dover, Delaware, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Worthless. Rusy and smoky taste to it. Why does it even exist. A time and money and liver healthiness waster.
Dominion Golden Lager;Dover, Delaware, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);In the bottle. Rich deep gold color with a rapidly disappearing head. Aroma not quite what I need in comparison to its German cousins- I just donï¿½t get that bready malty smell. The bite of the tongue is not just hops, this is sort of astringent, but not in a bad way. An OK beer.

The palate is firm with crisp pale, toasty, and caramel malt flavors on the tongue. The body is very smooth and round, making this a very drinkable beer. Hard Times Select finishes with more crisp malt flavors up front, and it balanced to perfection with just enough grassy hop bitterness. This is a very stylistically accurate domestic version of Dortmunder/Export, and a very crisp and clean lager. This beer would match with a number of dishes on the Hard Times menu, but when I go to Hard Times, it is always for two reason, beer of course, and chili. I matched this beer with Cincinnati chili 3 ways (Cincinnati style chili with cheese served over spaghetti) and it worked exceptionally well. If you ever find yourself in the DC Metro Area, and have a craving for some great chili and some great micro brews and imports, check out any one of the Hard Times Cafe locations.

Victory Amber Lager;Dover, Delaware, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours on draught an orange-amber, with a thin ring head and trace lace. Maybe some light (and very much so) bubblegum and sweet malt aromas... a bit underdone. Some caramel malts, aerated sugars, and light pale malts throughout, well-integrated, but not very complex. The finish introduces a touch of hops. The body is medium-light. Ok for an amber, and could make for a session brew in some settings, I suppose.

It has a strong chocolate flavor, but it lacked the complexity and smoothness of the Left Hand. Iï¿½m going to have to try it again from the bottle, because I get the feeling Iï¿½m not giving the brew its fair shake.
Dominion Winter Brew (Imperial Stout);Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Courtesy of Jasonp 2004 12 oz Intense chocolate, roasted and burnt malt notes, coffee and chocolate liquor aroma. Fantastic aroma. Pours a slightly brown tinged black with a creamy tan head that last. Fore is very chocolatey (both dark and milk varities) with bready pumpernickel notes, creamed espresso, dark fruit notes, firm, but not strong alcohol and the finish is burnt and roasty with smooth dark chocolate and vanilla lingering into the far aftertaste. The middle of the flavor profile is like iced chocolate liquor cake..delicious. I guess I just like lower abv Imperial Stouts because I thinkt his is fantastic. It is pretty thin for the style, but the flavor is amazing. Wish i had more of this.
Dominion Winter Brew (Imperial Stout);Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);pours dark with a tan head, aromas of roasted and chocolate malts, coffee notes, alcohol and hops. flavor is smooth upfront, chocolately, sweet with a hoppy bitter finish.
Dominion Winter Brew (Imperial Stout);Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Old Dominion Winter Brew is changing seasonal, and some yearr it is an Imperial Stout by style, and is a very good one. Dominion uses five different types of malts, and four different hop varieties in this beer. This brew is a rich, roasty, warming, hoppy, flavorful beer, everything an Imperial Stout should be. Bellï¿½s Expedition Stout is my all time favorite in this style, Winter Brew isnï¿½t nearly as big as Bellï¿½s, but it doesnï¿½t have to be. You can have range within a beer style, with beers like Bellï¿½s, and Old Rasputin being on the high end of the scale, and beers like Winter Brew or say Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout on the lower end. All four beers fall into the stylistic parameters of Imperial Stout, and its great that a beer lover can taste different breweries take on this style. Winter Brew pours to a deep black color with a nice tan head, and soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is wonderful. Big chocolate malt aromas mingle with notes of roasted barley, peppery alcoholic strength, and citric, piney hop aroma. This beer has a very ""stout"" malt back bone. Pale, caramel, black, wheat malts, and roasted black barley make this beer very complex and flavorful. There is a lot going on in this beer, flavors of bitter sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, and a touch of vanilla, coat the tongue. The body isnï¿½t as hefty as some of the bigger examples, and that makes this beer dangerously drinkable! This beer finishes with more chocolate malt character up front, then leads into a warming, dry, bitter, roasty, high octane burn. Imperial stouts are know for being rich, powerful, roasty, strong brews. Winter Brew has all those qualities. This beer has quite a kick at 8%abv. Another fantastic seasonal from one of the finest breweries in the US. This beer is one to be sipped and savored. I would pair this with red meats, it would work well with a hearty beef stew. This is a great desert beer, match this with milk chocolates, or German chocolate cake."
Dominion Winter Brew (Imperial Stout);Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Imperial;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Tap-Tiber River Tavern-Ellicott City Md 12/22. Saw this beer on tap & gave it a try, was glad I did. Sweet aroma, not heavy at all even though it poured pitch black. Sweet, malty, chocolatey, nutty flavor. Many levels, very complex. Long, pleasent finish, also sweet. Wasnï¿½t even sure what it was as they were simply calling it a Winter Brew, but after checking w/the brewery found it was definitely the 2004 Winter Brew-Imperial Stout (2005ï¿½s is ""a big west coast style ale...quite hoppy & rather pale in color""). This place had some left over or found a keg in the back of the cooler. Unfortunately, found they had tapped it out by Christmas!!"

Probably because of the name that means ""Grumple"" in Danish. Pours clear yellow with white head which disappears fairly fast. Aroma is not very distinct. Mostly malt and corn. Medium carbonation, watery palate. Sweetish malty taste with strange dry finish and a good bitterness. No reason to grumple over this one."

Barley Days Wind & Sail Dark Ale;Picton, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Barley Days Brewery;Pours a clear light brown with a small offwhite head. Aroma is roasted malt and molasses. Taste is moderately sweet with notes of roasted malt, coffee, and a little fruit. Light-medium bodied with low-moderate carbonation. It's fairly hard to find beer from Barley Days here in Ontario, where it's brewed, (lousy liquor monopolies!) so I have been waiting to try this for a while. Sadly it did not live up to my expectations. There was little depth and it reminded me more of a dunkel then a porter. To me that's an excess of roasted malt that tends to cling to the palate.

I wouldnï¿½t have normally given this a go with the rakeï¿½s selection freshly updated, but Richard insisted I try it as a freebie - who am I to argue? I was totally surprised by this one. Richard was giving me a full-on drunken lecture on the quality of American pale ales and as my nose steadily crinkled up more and more, I could see that Iï¿½d hit a nerve. Heï¿½s never been much of a ""beer-bully"", but Iï¿½m glad he pushed me into having this one. Clear red-amber with almost no head. From the aroma alone, Iï¿½d have guessed this was a framboise - very strong smell of raspberries with hints of sweet cherry and other dark fruits. Taste of malts, dark fruits and cane sugar. Finish is sugary with a taste of boiled berries. Syrupy body. Overall, the beer is far too sweet."

Casta Triguera;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Wheat Ale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);12 oz. bottle. Seeing that this beer is retired and the last rating is a year ago, and the one before that is over two years, age is a contributing factor to this beerï¿½s suckiness. Pours a hazy golden brown with virtually no head. The aroma is malt that has a spoiled sweetness. The flavor is almost exactly like cheap sherry. Watery body. This is an unconditional drain pour.

To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. 06/11/02: This looks nice with a big billowy head of foam that goes away after a while. I like the smell of this. It reminds me of fresh hay. The beer tastes sweet with some spice there.
Hammer & Nail American Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Boottle. I wish I could remember where I picked up a bottle of this stuff. It appears to be about 2 years old. A Clear amber color with a very small head but still carbonaton. Not oxidized at all. Nice malty, old ale taste but just a tad sweet. Iï¿½m sure this was a very good beer back in the day.
Hammer & Nail American Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Clear amber in color, the head is moderate, the lace in sheets, both off white.

Hammer & Nail American Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Pretty good, but pretty average. Everything you'd expect from an american pale ale.

This has some nice aromas of raisins and yogurt with a nice presence of nuts and brown sugar.
Hammer & Nail Brown Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;Hammer & Nail Brewers;I'm not really a fan of american brown ales, but this one's a champ. Really smooth, and semi-sweet. My only complaints are that I wouldn't mind a little darker color and I wouldn't mind a little less hops (for a brown), but most US browns tend to be that way. Probably the best one I've had so far. Personally, I think if you're going to drink a brown ale, may as well go with Sam Smith's. Hammer and Nail hasn't disappointed me yet. I'd buy this again.
Hammer & Nail Brown Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;Hammer & Nail Brewers;The appearance and aroma were decent, but the palate was harsh..............
Hammer & Nail Brown Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Excellent representation of the Brown ale style. Slightly nutty aroma, malty flavor.
Hammer & Nail Brown Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;Hammer & Nail Brewers;I have to agree with the Commercial Description: Very balanced. It should have more hops. More like the Sam Smiths (very good) rather than the Newcastle (Not that good).
Hammer & Nail Brown Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;Hammer & Nail Brewers;A nutty, kinda bread dough nose, the malts U know. Quite tastey, nice head and generous lace, some hop bite at the finish, a real decent brown ale in my books, thanks to VENOM!
Hammer & Nail Brown Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;Hammer & Nail Brewers;"Dark amber; complex malty aroma & flavours of toasted caramel and stewed peaches. Body is a little light, though."
Hammer & Nail Brown Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Incredible brown ale. Balanced to perfection with a nice malt flavor and equally flavorful hop bite.
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. 09/01/02: This beer looks great in the glass. The bubbles cascade up and down the side revealing a nice clear body. The flavor on this is on the bitter side but has some nice sweetness underneath it all. This smells like a fresh stream that has some wildflowers growing near by. I definitely need to buy more of this.
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Mildly fruity caramel aroma is somewhat stale. Clear copper coloured body is topped by a low white head that recedes to partial cover and ring. Fruity caramel flavour has mild finishing bitterness with some floral and lavender hops still apparent in the aftertaste. Medium light body with somewhat low carbonation. Seems like we got here too late. Bottle sampled at the Country Inn with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, Rastacouere and Yowie.
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;The Lure: Some shy fruitiness amidst the caramel. Hops have left the aroma, but itï¿½s overall unpleasant. The Festivities: Flowery hop bitterness rises behind the fatigued maltiness. Big bubbles do not affect the flavor display, but the subdued nature of it all recalls amber ales more than ESBs. Transcendence: Time is a quirky concept.
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Diminishing white head covers the caramel coloured ale. Faint bready and caramel scents emanate from the mostly malty nose. Irregular flavors peak up here and there, disturbing the global balance, the peak of which being those awful plastic notes that kick in just before the soapy hops confirm your lack of desire for another sip. Not very hoppy at all and for that matter, not very tasty either. Light bodied, fair carbonation, rather astringent. Too old obviously.
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;"RERATE-- Found probably the last sixer of this great beer I""ll ever find, and I""d have to say it""s probably one of the best bitters brewed in the US, if not the world. Perfection for me. OLD--Not bad at all. The beer poured nicely, with a thick head that generated an awesome smell. The actual taste didn""t quite live up to my expectations, but it was very tasty and drinkable. This one is a little harder to find than the rest of the H&N styles, but I think it""s their second best, after their oatmeal stout. Pretty classic ESB, in all respects. A little rough around the edges, but quite enjoyable."
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;"Sunset orange; Medium dense head; The aroma is whacked- spearmint!. Mint and chocolate on the first sip- f-ed up man, but not offensive, just very, very strange. Became cloying at 1/2 mark. Nice bit of malt across the tongue."
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Wow, never would have guessed the alcohol content at all. Malty, slightly perfumey aroma. Smooth palate. Pleasant slightly bitter finish (very slightly) to a pleasantly fruity beer.
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;orange hazy color, sweet aroma very well balanced malt and hop flavors. It's quite good, I would call this an English Pale, rather than an Englsih bitter. I don't find it very bitter frankly. It's tasty though.
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;A decent ESB. The malt was great while the hops were only OK. I wouldn't have guessed this was 6.7% that was a surprise. Thanks VENOM!
Hammer & Nail Extra Special Bitter;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hammer & Nail Brewers;"Why don't we see more ""ESB'S""? It's a great style, not to mild, not to strong (OK for Weenies}. This style is well balanced (malts vs. hops), not a high ABV, clean and refreshing. H&N's ESB, is a nice dark copper color, with a generous beige head and fine lace, and many ""Tiny Bubbles"" to denote a well brewed beer. Malt sweet at the start, friendly carbonation, and a decent hop dry spicy finish that leaves you saying AAAAHHHHHH! I found it a great thirst quencher after a day of shopping with my daughters in this 108F dry Arizona heat and the bazillion idiots that populate the wide straight streets, that are most always baracaded due to water main breaks and or just general idosy of the City Street Department, all graduates of the Mickey Mouse School of Highway Engineering! Not the least of my complaints as I think my VISA Gold Card sustained some serious dents!"

To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. 09/12/02: I was excited when this came out because it reminded me of my trip to Germany. It has a nice sweet malty taste and is prickly and like liquid bread in the mouth. A great beer to drink in the waning weeks of summer.

Hammer & Nail Vienna Style Lager;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Orange color noe head. Butterscotch nose and also taste. Weak hoppy finish - crisp - ok - but not very special.
Hammer & Nail Vienna Style Lager;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Sadly, word is that Hammer & Nail has gone the way of Brakspear and Celis Brewing. A nice, slightly spicy Vienna-style lager that's perhaps not up to Sam Adams Vienna standards, but yet makes for enjoyable drinking nonetheless. Light bitterness that most anyone should be able to handle. Adios, Hammer & Nail. I hardly knew 'ya.
Hammer & Nail Vienna Style Lager;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Bottled. Bright, bright luminous lovely amber, would get a 5 app if the head lasted more than 10 seconds. Rather cloudy. Strong toasted grain aroma with hints of pine. Flavor sweet and malty for the most part, with some hop hints towards the end. Rather weird cola flavors and texture at the finish also that I wasn't too thrilled about, but this is a fairly solid effort from this now sadly defunct brewer. My first Connecticut beer!
Hammer & Nail Vienna Style Lager;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Another good one from Hammer and Nail. Dark amber, with a decent sized creamy head. Sweet and malty, with a touch of hops popping through the middle and in the finish. I''m not real familiar with the vienna style, but i prefer the Sam Adams version a little more. This one doesn''t seem to have quite as much body, but is balanced a little nicer. I don''t think this brewery makes a bad beer.
Hammer & Nail Vienna Style Lager;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Awesome lager. Huge toasty malt flavor with a nice crispness and spicy hop bite.
Hammer & Nail Vienna Style Lager;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hammer & Nail Brewers;"Copper colour; Aroma of plain CornNuts and dark rye bread; smooth palate - soft malt notes, touch of iron, finishing sweet with a hint of brown sugar and caramel popcorn."
Hammer & Nail Scotch Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hammer & Nail Brewers;You might be wondering why Iï¿½d choose to rate a 4+ year old bottle of scotch ale from a long gone brewer. While I had some reservations about rating this one at first, I thought itï¿½d be a good learning tool for anyone just getting into cellaring and also to shed some light on what happens to weaker scotch ales as they age. Once I opened this and the initial diacetyl note faded, any reservations I had were quickly dashed as this one shaped up to be a very drinkable enjoyable beer that took on some older barleywine qualities and some of its own character courtesy of some underlying smokiness. Bottle a good friend of mine had cellared since 2002 and was kind enough to share with me at my tasting. Pours dark brown with a thin tannish head. The carbonation on this one was still present, but, as expected, was on the scarce side. Smells doughy and malty with some very mild diacetyl creeping in. The smoke which was pronounced when this one was fresh has blended into the background, playing a more subtle role. Tastes of juniper, roses, caramel, and slightly toffeish with nice spicy elements. Finish is of slight sherry but with a lot of nice malty character backing it up. While on the decline, still very drinkable and enjoyable. This gives me faith that scotch ales, even lower ABV ones are good as cellaring candidates.
Hammer & Nail Scotch Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Damn that's a lot of malt. Roasty and rich. This stuff would make any Scot proud. I'm not huge on malty beers, but the balance was there on this one.
Hammer & Nail Scotch Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hammer & Nail Brewers;"Dark brown; seriously malt nose; big smokeiness, fat malts, long finish....."
Hammer & Nail Scotch Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hammer & Nail Brewers;I'm a sucker for smoked beers, this had a smoked malty aroma, some faint fruit. Sweet malty smoked flavors, but overall much too sweet for my tastes.
Hammer & Nail Scotch Ale;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hammer & Nail Brewers;"Very deep ruby red, garnet if you like, beige head that fades quite quickly, decent lace. Large malt nose, hints of caramel, and that slight touch of smoke. Front is sweet, the middle light, the finish nicely hopped, moderate carbonation, dry, and quite good, not over powering, just good and pleasant to the palate.""Thanks Venom"", the King of beer Trades!"
Hammer & Nail Oktoberfest;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. 11/10/02: I had this and a few other oktoberfests at the same time. This one was a little bitter for an oktoberfest. I like mine more malty and full bodied. Still fun to try.
Hammer & Nail Oktoberfest;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hammer & Nail Brewers;A good maltiness to this beer. I agree that this has a little more punch and bite than your typical Octoberfest. Very nice, may I have another!
Hammer & Nail Oktoberfest;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hammer & Nail Brewers;One of my favorite domestic octoberfests. Sharp, clean, and slightly hoppy. Very pleasant mouthfeel. A bit tougher than the average octoberfest.
Hammer & Nail Oktoberfest;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hammer & Nail Brewers;On the dark side for a Marzen. Malty nose. The body is very smooth. A little bit drier than most Marzens. A good but not great oktoberfest beer. Balanced hops.
Hammer & Nail Oktoberfest;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hammer & Nail Brewers;"Dark rich amber colour; moderately malty; nutty, toffeeish. Maybe my palate was shot, but to me this was not as well developed as the others I've had from this brewery."
Hammer & Nail Oktoberfest;Watertown, Connecticut, United States;Mï¿½rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hammer & Nail Brewers;Dark ruby brown with a generous beige head, large malt nose. Moderate carbonation, mild sweetness, and a touch of hops to finish off. Nice beer, as with all the beer from this really decent brewery, the beers are not over powering, but are quality brewed and quite a treat. Thanks once again Venom.
Sagres;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);(25cl bottle, Lisbon) AROMA: straightforward, hint of skunk APPEARANCE: light golden yellow, average TASTE: green grain, some metal, basic pils hops, leans toward dry instead sweet PALATE: light to medium light, frizzy but not harsh OVERALL: a summertime lager with some euro characteristics. More flavor than a Bud or a light beer. Kind of a high end (but cheap) mass lager. Doesn't suck. I like the dryness of it.
Sagres;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);Golden with a fizzy head. Light. Toasted grain, light earthy notes. Effervescent. Industrial lager done industrial.
Sagres;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);De color dorado, ligera y de carbonataciï¿½n media. Aromas dï¿½biles a granos y malta. En boca es dulce, simple pero bebible. Superior a Bock.
Sagres;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);Bottle. Pours clear straw with airy white head. Clear aroma of yeast and malt, with faint hoppy notes. Sweetish, estery flavour with bitter notes og hops and tpuches of malt. Estery and malty aftertaste. Well, a regular Pale Lager but not bad for the style.
Sagres;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);Bottle at Village Underground in Lisbon. Cool art exhibit. Standard pale lager appearance...straw golden, looks like a hot summer day type of offering. Nose isn't inviting but wasn't really expecting much. Grainy like domestic US conglomerates. Taste follows suit but honestly hits the spot this afternoon. One of the two primary Portuguese beers. Finishes clean. Just enough bitterness with light grainy sweetness. Met expectations.
Sagres;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);0,33 l. Bottle. Golden color with white head. Malt aroma. Malt, sweet, grain and herbal taste
Berkshire Traditional Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a murky dark orange color with a fingerï¿½s worth of white foamy head that slid off at a decent pace. Mild stringy lace. The aroma had some herbal to earthy hop qualities blending with some smooth semi-sweet cereal to biscuit-like malts. Light butterscotch and some caramel to toffee malts even come out to balance fairly nice. The flavor had the semi-dry and semi-sweet clean malt quality about it with a low hop bitter character about it. Sly aftertaste of this malt rides into the finish with the same low hop quality about it. The palate was about medium bodied with a fair sessionable smooth aspect to it. Hop bitterness was quite contained. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt as projected. Overall, pretty good pale ale, seemed close to an English styled one, but still worthy of coming back to.
Berkshire Traditional Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Hazy Amber brown color. Thick creamy beige head. Tart celery malt nose. Bittersweet toasted malt flavor has spicy bitter hop aftertaste.

Berkshire Traditional Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;Heavy toffee malt aroma. Body is an amber with a touch of gold caramel with a medium haziness. Heavy off-white foam head that laces nicely. Light fruit taste with only a touch of bitterness. Has a pleasant clean finish. Reminds me of an English Pale Ale. I could drink many pints of this.
Berkshire Traditional Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;Aromas of herbaceous hops, caramel, faint strawberry, faint muscato. Hazy red-amber with a mostly lasting off-white head. Pretty dry, fruity, malt-forward, finishes quite clean. Light-medium bodied.
Berkshire Traditional Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;On tap at Uno. Pours dark red with fluffy white head. Aroma is of bready malt and red fruit. Body is medium and smooth. Herbal hops, pepper, caramel malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and peppery. Overall it is good brew.
Berkshire Traditional Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;APPEARANCE - very nice copper color. Light head is white but tucks itself back into the beer right away. NOSE - this is not a hoppy pale ale. Perhaps some grassiness from hops, but I canï¿½t be certain. If I didnï¿½t know this was an ale, Iï¿½d swear it smelled like a lager. FLAVOR - really pales in that department. NOTES - Iï¿½d like to say I can drink this on a hot day and be refreshed... But the flavor is somewhere between refreshing and a solid american pale ale. But itï¿½s really not.
Berkshire Traditional Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;Transfer from BA review on 8-7-12- Poured from bomber into pint glass Appearance ï¿½ Pours a wonderful deep amber color with a big off white colored head. The head has fantastic retention and retains its strength for quite some time but it eventually fades over time to give a decent amount of lacing. Smell ï¿½ The aroma is on the lighter side with hints of roasted malt some caramel smells as well as some floral and citrus hop aroma. Taste ï¿½ A sweeter bready malt flavor with hints dark fruit are the first to meet the tongue. As the taste moves on light hop flavor of a floral and very light citrus flavor come to the tongue. The beer seems to bitter more toward the middle with the advent of the hop, but then again seems to sweeten toward the end where flavors of a caramel nature meet the tongue Where a slightly bitter caramel and malty flavor is left on the tongue. Mouthfeel ï¿½ The body of the beer is on the average side with the carbonation level being the same. Overall - A pretty good ï¿½not soï¿½ pale ale with nicer roasted grainy flavors. While it has god flavors it is nothing to really go out of the way for.
Berkshire Traditional Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;Growler. Pours amber with an off white head. Toffee malts, faint earthy and floral hops, light fruity notes, and a touch of bitterness in the finish. Not bad.

Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;Bottle. Rich amber beer with a cream head. Malt and light grapefruit aroma. Grapefruit and light malt flavor. Medium bodied. Decent-good bitterness. Light grapefruit and light caramel linger.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;Pours hazy dark amber with a thick white head. Aroma of bread and yeast hinted with hop elements. Taste has sweet malt elements, a subtle element of molasses with citrusy hops. Palate has bread and nutty nose hints that are hard to miss. Pretty interesting.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;Poured from a 12 oz can a hazy orange with a slight head that did not linger. Bready malt and a grassy citrus hop Aroma. The Taste is similar to its aroma with a moderate hop flavor and crisp mouth feel. It ends with a slight bitterness that lets the sweet English malt flavor linger. This is my kind of IPA, you know, one you can drink.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;12 oz can. Pours hazy orange with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, bready malt and tropical fruit. Body is medium and crisp. Herbal hops dominate the palate with bready malt and tropical fruit provide support. Finish is long and dry. Good brew.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;22 ounce bottle A very affordable bomber brought with it the chance to reacquaint myself with Berkshire Brewing. My initial impressions remain positive though I think there might be better (or at least more interesting) local breweries. Even so the price point makes it almost as cheap as the national brands it shared shelf space with. Aroma / Appearance - A bronze body settles into place beneath the ivory head. Nutty English malts drive the experience though the floral hops are not completely muted. The resiny aspects underscore this balance. Flavor / Palate - Red licorice, walnuts, and semisweet candy chews refresh the palate. The overall profile matches the typical expectations of a solid East Coast IPA though it fails to exceed them. It's still a worthwhile beer to track down given that it should set you back less than half the cost of most bombers these days.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;Golden brown pour, nice foamy off white tannish head. Woody aroma, with floral, yeasty, and apple notes. Flavor is floral and lemony, quite bitter and tart. A bit thin.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;Maltier and earthy, as an English IPA should be...just not my bag, really. They always come off a touch stale unless brewery fresh, and this is no exception.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;Bomber poured a clear tarnished gold with a small lasting creamy ivory head. Aromas of caramel, bread, earthiness and light graininess. Palate was light to medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of caramel, bread and earthiness with a smooth dry moderately bitter finish.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;22oz bottle 11/10/16 (Kappyï¿½s-Medford)-38ï¿½ in Shaker-Pours a cloudy amber with a small white head. Aroma of malt and hops. Taste of malt, hops, citrus, and grains. This light bodied brew is a bit lacking.
Berkshire Lost Sailor India Pale Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Berkshire Brewing Company;Can pour into nonic pint glass from Epsom Circle Market (updated 3/30/19 from Julios Liquors). Aroma is vague citrus dominated by malty bread backbone. Appearance is cloudy gold with a fair amount of sediment in suspension, even without pouring out the last sixth of the can. Finger-width off-white head with poor retention and minimal lacing, occasional large bubble. Taste is moderately sweet caramel malt base with mild citrus. Palate is light bodied with thin, smooth texture and lively carbonation (a little sting). Overall, the appearance really detracts from the overall experience. Better to just drink it out of the can so you never have to look at it. Even so, the aroma and taste aren't really true to an IPA so you're probably better off avoiding unless you're looking for something more APA-like. Skip.

Poured a medium and cloudy copperish color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of floral hops, citrus, caramel, and toasted malts. Tastes of caramel, floral hops, some citrus, and lightly fruity. Nice bitter finish. Some lacing left on the glass. A very nice Amber Ale.
Beermanns Rip Roarin Red Ale;Lincoln, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;First off, I am not 100% sure this really is an amber ale, but thatï¿½s cool. Nice aroma of toffee, chocolate, dark fruits, tea leaves, floral and citrus like hops. It almost reminded me of say 1/2 a barley wine. Pours a dark red with a nice lasting creamy head and great lacing. Flavors of some darker malts, dark fruits, a leafy hoppy tea kind of thing, floral notes, some light citrus, toffee, chocolate. All things considered pretty damn complex. A good amount of hops in the finish leaves a nice lingering bitterness. I could session this stuff. Just wish I had more.
Beermanns Rip Roarin Red Ale;Lincoln, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;From a 12 oz bottle purchased at Corti Bros in Sacramento, this poured a rich copper color with a very thick and foamy head the stuck like glue to the inside of the pint glass. Nose was citrus hops and flowers, with hint of fruit. Mouthfeel was very oily and flavors are complex and powerful. Bitter finish. A remarkable beer from this small brewery. I am not sure this really and amber but who cares.

Enjoyed this one.

Bloomington Strong Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bloomington Brewing Co.;A golden ale with a minor head. Banana and yeast qualities make this a full-bodied, tasty beer. Some minor complexity but all the while a well-rounded, refreshing beer.

Sagres Bruna;Vialonga, Portugal;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);Bottle. Pitch black beer with a light dark head. The aroma is roasted coffee and the flavour is oaty, slightly smoked, bitter and roasted. Overall a nice beer.
Sagres Bruna;Vialonga, Portugal;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);Bottle poured black with a dirty off white head. Roast aroma with a roasty chocolate , coffee flavor like a watery porter. not bad.
Sagres Bruna;Vialonga, Portugal;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);Bottle. very dark with some ruby. Slim tan head soon gone. Aroma is chocolate. Thin bodied. Chocolate and roast malt taste. Reasonable, I suppose.
Sagres Bruna;Vialonga, Portugal;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);A lot darker than expected. Poor head retention. Tasted like a schwarzbier to me - flavour and aroma are dominated by chocolate malt. Nothing else is really apparent. No off flavours, but it has a thin body and lack of malt, but the dark malt character compensates in a way.
Sagres Bruna;Vialonga, Portugal;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);A good dark beer with a nice clean head. The nose is a subtle chocolate with a slight burnt note. The body is quite thin but the flavour, like a schwarzbier, is more of the malt bitterness rather than hop presence.
Sagres Bruna;Vialonga, Portugal;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);"Woody, toasted malt nose; dark brown color, fizzy tan head. Hints of chocolate in the body with a tobacco finish. Thin, like a Schwarzbier. Commericial for sure, but passable and better than the regular Sagres."

Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;Pours golden tan with a thin sticky head. Mild hop taste upfront that fades quickly. This is mild for an IPA and 65 IBU.
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;16 oz. can. Hazy gold, white head. Melon, citrus, caramel, bit of pine. Pretty well balanced and not a hop bomb.
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;"from 16oz can (BB 10/2019) into Spiegelau IPA glass Appearance: pours deep golden with a thick 1"" off white head that has good retention. it has almost perfect clarity and above average lacing is observed throughout. Aroma: bready malt derived aromas dominate. resiny dank hoppy character, some fruit (but not citrus) and a faint aroma of oxidation is just detectable. Taste: perfectly balanced, malt sweetness to bitterness! such that the 65 IBUs are just a statistic. Palate: medium bodied, resiny, oily texture, lively carbonation and pronounced astringency. aftertaste is long and smooth in every way Overall: this IPA really drinks like an old school Sierra Nevada pale ale variant. the balance is just great without any particular flavors or notes sticking out. to newbies of craft this beer might seem uninteresting... my only wish is that I'd tried it fresher!"
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;12 oz single bottle from Meijer (Indianapolis). Clear golden appearance with a white head. Aroma of resinous hops, mild pine and lightly toasted malt. Similar flavor, adding sharp hop bitterness and a light grainy sweetness. Medium body with a slight dry finish. Solid.
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;Medium gold, thin but persistent white head. Nose is super mild pine. Middle is caramel up front, medium bodied malt, touch of orange, pine bitterness. Finish is more of the same. Not bad, just seems to be missing something.
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;Pours a mostly clear golden orange from the can with fluffy off-white head that dissipates slowly to leave good lacing. Aroma of nice piney and pithy citrus hop notes over a clean malt base of biscuit and caramel. Taste follows, straight up old school West Coast IPA, with moderate bitterness and clean hop profile. Good balance, well done, but unexciting.
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;Very forgettable. Mild sweetness, mild bitterness, not peppery, somewhat piney/floral. Just nothing special.
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;10/10/18 - Tallahassee, Fl -Beer Stop -16 oz tall boy can. Sparkling medium orange pour, bubbly off-white head. Fresh, fragrant spruce and spearmint aroma. Bittersweet hoppiness makes an opening splash, nice grapefruit citrus notes, some caramel sweetness, a bit of raw cookie dough. Sticky, thick mouthfeel. Enjoyed in the dark after riding out Hurricane Michael.
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;Too much malt profile for my taste, and seems to be lacking hops. A fairly run-of-the-mill IPA. Nothing special by any means, but it's not off-putting in any way.
Upland Dragonfly India Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;IPA;Upland Brewing Company;Appearance: Honey amber. Nearly clear. Thin layer of white bubbles. Nose: Light pine notes with a decent amount of malt. Taste: medium piney, a bit of resin with some caramel. Bittersweet. Body: Medium to lighter and lively. Parting thoughts: A fairly nondescript IPA. Restrained. Not overpowering. Not terribly memorable.

ZIP Porter;Zrenjanin, Serbia;Porter - Baltic;ZIP Industrija Piva;Bottled in home of my friend Boban (Sremski Karlovci, Vojvodina). Very dark brown, quite sweet and easy to drink. This was my first contact with any Porter and I liked it.
ZIP Porter;Zrenjanin, Serbia;Porter - Baltic;ZIP Industrija Piva;Brown to black. very sweet, slightly malty, not much bitterness. Tastes very light in alcohol, and more like a malta.

Kappeli Lager;Helsinki, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kappeli;Spritzy, some flavours reminiscent of bitter lemon, touch of malt. Completely overwhelmed by my chocolate chip cookie. Availability is rather sporadic, too, as it was one only once of the three times I've visited Kappeli (which is one of Europe's most famous cafes and worth the visit regardless of the beer).

The aroma contains bitter hops, grain, wheat, maize, some honey, yeast. It tastes light malty sweet and light to medium grainy bitter, bit wheaty. Dry, grainy, somewhat bready finish. Light to medium body, slick texture, soft carbonation. Has quite a German or Czech character, in that sense a very well-made Pilsener for Belgian standards."

Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;12 oz bottle. Pale hazy yellow, small white head, no retention. Aroma is cooked banana and light honey Flavor is light wheat some honey sweetness that fades to a sour graininess. Body is very thin. I paid $4.50 for a sixer of this swill, I should have put a gallon of gas in my tank instead.
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Actually looks pretty good. But it smells bad, like dried wheat grains and paint. Taste is thin and a little heavy. ick.
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Bought in amixed 6 pack from Vons: I thought this was the best out of the 3 that this company had to offer. Real sweet aroma of fruit like banana and light yeast in there too. Flavor was quite good with sweetness from the honey and malt. Very quaffable and i enjoyed the slightly gloomy appearance with thick head in my glass.
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"Bottled From Vons. Now called ""Honey Weiss"". Pours a medium golden color. Sweet grainy, slightly tart aroma. Bland malty flavor. Not much of anything going on. Not really offensive though."
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;A buddy and I tested this beer and we likened it to this... Must taste the same as sucking the urine straight from a bee! Color is a light gold with medium carbonation and the smell. Yuck. The sweetness stabs at your tongue and leaves a sour aftertaste. The only thing I find subtle about this beer is why they're still brewing it.
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;my buddy who i always give homebrew to gave me a bottle of this a while back to try. did I mention he was a cheapskate? There is NOTHING about this beer I found desireable, from the packaging to the product itself. In fairness I'm not a big fan of honey-beer to begin with but this was sicky-sweet swill.
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;perhaps an unfair situation as i was drinking dogfish right before, but you get what you pay for with this beer.
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Smells slightly fruity (rotten) after more than a few inhalations. Tastes like nothing: watery, bland, boring. Color is a tint between yellow and gold. Not worth $4.99 for a six-pack even. Not recommended at all.
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Sme*ls l*ke Mi*ler Hi*h L*fe. Lo*ks L*ke *t t*o. Swe*t, cream*d c*rn t*ste. Al*o h*s wat*r l*ke qual*ties. V*ry b*d.
Eureka Honey Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"Looks like urin in the glass. Nose was decribed as ""funky"" by a non-beer drinking friend of mine and when investigated by myself he was right, there is definate funk going on and we aint talking George Clinton. Gloopy wheat and odd honey sweetness. Mouthfeel is kinda like soft water with a slight bakeing soda taste. Thank god this was out of someone elses fridge."
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottled from Vons. Pours a medium golden brownish color. Sweet slightly acidic aroma. A couple of hops under a sweet grainy somethinerother. Very, very light trace of bitterness.
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Bought in a mixed 6 pack from Vons: Average aroma of light malting and added hop with some stench of rice or corn lingering in the back. Pure golden picture with a fast dissapating head. Flavor wadnt to bad and was easily drinkable but still felt empty.
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Well, this really isnï¿½t too good. Doesnï¿½t smell anything like it should, has a lot of bad butter characters. Not a pale ale - I advise staying away.
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;This had an average head.aroma typical mass-produced smell.Color medium amber.Taste was kind of bland.Better than the average commercial beer,but not much.This is a good beer to serve to the masses,but pretty dull for the Rate beer people.
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;"Single 12 oz. bottle from Vons in San Diego. Pours a clear medium amber with a small white head that diminishes to a film in a minute or two. Smells mainly sweet - grainy and corn syrupy with little else detectable. Flavor is watery, lightly sweet, with a bit of toasty malt, corn, clover and some mutant floral hops. Light body and assertive carbonation. Definitely a drain pour as well as a classic example of a ""Craft Brew"" (though we know itï¿½s from those contract kings Gluek) aimed at the masses. Please, give us a break, this beer is an absolute stinker!"
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Pretty good pale ale. Has a nice slight bold taste, which arent really in pale ales. Went down smooth and had a nice bitter aftertaste. A really good light beer.
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;"12 oz bottle. Poured a golden color with a thin white head. Aroma was very yeasty with fruit accents. The taste was pretty good for a pale ale but I admit itï¿½s a bit watered down with mild-no activity. Very toasty and a little bit bitter but left a clean finish. I would pick this one out if I didnï¿½t want to feel ""full"" and wanted to go on a drinking binge but not really one I would expect to sip on."
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;"This was really quite ugly; grassy and grainy. metallic and weak; not good; I ï¿½d rather have a Gatorade"
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Thanks argo0. Medium golden body with mild carbonation and a small, sudsy white head. Aroma of butterscotch, light sweet caramel, and some green apple. Watery and buttery slick flavor and palate. Fairly sweet with little hop character and low, toasty bitterness. Thereï¿½s absolutely no craft here. Just a feckless marketing ploy and obvious recasting of Gluekï¿½s substandard pale ale.
Eureka Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottle at Aaron and Kathyï¿½s Holiday/YeHa Party on 12-3-05. Courtesy of argo0, I believe. Pours yellow with a fizzy and unsturdy white head. Nose is musty malts and sweet corn with light cereal notes. Taste is corny as well with grains, light lemon and dry bread. Body is thin and watery with lots of seltzer-like fizziness. Finishes with more light lemon notes, corn syrup, cereal and semi-sweet malts. Pretty bad!
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;bottle from friar tucks , dark brown pour w big foamy light brown head. aroma of malt and cocoa, some taste of chocolate and caramel. decent
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Mild grain astringency and roasted malt nose. Astringent bordering on tannic palate. Mild cocoa and anise notes fit well without overpowering.
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;overall a very good beer. i find the name to be quite creative and that is what drew me in at first. itï¿½s a very good beer with a very deep color and a tannish head. i would recommend this to anyone.
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Pours a nice dark color with a tan head. Aromas of chocolate/roasted malts and kind of fruity? Taste was of roasted malt and some coffee and kind of floral taste.
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;"Alas, an answer to the age old theological question. ""What were they eating at the last supper""? With this piece of the puzzle, we can safely assume it was buffalo wings and pretzels. The Son of God angle is unique, but very risky. You see, if you go with your dark underlord Satan theme you canï¿½t go wrong. Drinking a bottle of something like Satanï¿½s Nut Sack Brown Ale, you think ""ah, tough name."" You drink it and itï¿½s nasty, and you figure, "" what did I really expect, after all itï¿½s Satan. With the Holy Jesus beer it just seems you canï¿½t be let down because God is good. This beer was pretty good, but certainly not perfect. Iï¿½m a little let down. So now I question. Am I as Job was? Is God testing my faith? Are the people at Mendocino Brewing false prophets? What would Jesus drink?"
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle. Pours opaque black with a small dark tan head. Sweet mocha aroma. Dark, sweet chocolately flavor. Well-balanced, nice mellow aftertaste. Pretty much a standard stout.
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Pours with a good brown head that doesnï¿½t leave much lace. Midnight black, light does not pass through it. Medium bodied, nose is burnt chocolate. Good mix of hops and malt, smooth, starts sweet and finishes with a slightly bitter finish. $4.20 for a 22oz. bottle
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Dark black color, nice creamy tan head. The aroma has some sweet notes of chocolate and lots of roast. Some toffee and caramel show through as well although a bit metallic. The flavor is more sweet & fruity than roasted but not very balanced and dirty metallic tasting. Finishes very metallic like sucking on a penny, seems too dry maybe. Just looking at the picture on the front makes me think about how dirty this beer could be.
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;This poured a dark amber color, with a pretty big, tannish head and substantial lacing ringing my glass. Nice aroma of roasted malt, and just a succinct of bittersweet chocolate and roasted pine nuts. Medium mouthfeel, roasty in flavor with good malt up front, and not a lot of sweetness. Hop balance follows, nice and crisp. Creamy and smooth. I don't know why this beer is listed as a stout. This is not a stout or a porter, but a very good brown ale. L'chaim.
He'Brew Messiah Stout;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Stout;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Simplicity in it's style. Dark stout of roasted malts, with a thin coffee/chocolate finish.

Flying Fish BlackFish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Cask at the Grey Lodge in Philly. This as a very slight roast flavor. After that it tasted like a beer. Nothing special here.
Flying Fish BlackFish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Casked conditioned ale. I drank the same cask as egajdzis at the Grey lodge Pub. I found Blackfish to be quite drinkable and a hoppy aftertaste. The dark particles were typical for these casks. Excellent cask and not easy to find, best checking with the brewery for availability.
Flying Fish BlackFish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Served on cask... Poured a dark garnet color with no head or lacing. It had a strong fruity aroma (blackberrys, I thought the blackfish was because it was blackberries). I am confused by the commercial description here. I would have classified this as a fruit ale, but I guess mild ale is OK. The taste was dominated by blackberries and grape juice, and it was very smooth and juicy. As I finished the glass I noticed some dark particles at the bottom. I am not quite sure if I had the same beer that is listed here in the database, because I did not notice any characteristics of an extra pale or a porter. But it was certainly called Blackfish, that much I know. But I enjoyed this none-the-less.
Flying Fish BlackFish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Fish Brewing Company;A blend of their XPA and Porter - served on the beer engine. Muddy brown in color with a loose, foamy head that dissipates quickly. Fruity hop character aroma. Initial flavor is a slightly fruity, hoppy and juicy, transitions next to a roasted wood sharp flavor with moderate bitterness. As it finishes, the flavor slides on into a mellow malty sweetness with undertones of nuts and roasted malt. Delicious.
Flying Fish BlackFish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Fish Brewing Company;A wonderful hybrid full of flavor. Not easily obtained......................

Old Milwaukee Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 9/23/2019. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.8%. Overall this is a very nice light adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Nice clean pils malt/grain showcase, with great earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the best macro light lagers I've had as expected of Pabst."
Old Milwaukee Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;(Our Old Milwaukee beer in Canada is brewed by Sleeman Brewing. They may or may not be associated with Pabst Brewing in the US.) I really enjoy a thin, crisp light beer and this one was, very surprisingly all that and more. Very easy to drink, a moderate amount of carbonation. Itï¿½s not heavy at all which is great if heavier beers give you that bloated feeling in your stomach. With it being a ï¿½valueï¿½ beer itï¿½s a nice treat on a dime, especially if you enjoy a thin tasting beer with no after taste.
Old Milwaukee Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;pretty nice for a light. i thought this was crisp and clean and i very much enjoyed it.
Old Milwaukee Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Old Milwaukee light: good shit indeed.

Old Milwaukee Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz can pours a clear pale golden straw with a large white head.

Old Milwaukee Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Pale yellow gold. Big bubbles lead to a brief disappearing white head. Faint briny malt aroma. Excessively carbonated. Little flavor or body. Thin, watery finish.
Old Milwaukee Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Aroma and flavor is not much of anything, watery with rather mild malts but surpringly drinkable.

John Shippeys Pipers Pale Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Draft @ Split Crow. Sold as Split Cream. Golden yellow, moderate creamy white head. Muted grainy malt in the aroma. Fairly mild flavour struggles in a too cold serving. Mild bitterness, and touch of grainy malt. Flavour grows as it warms and you work your way through the pint. Flavours grow in intensity but mostly just more of the same. Creamy medium palate is about as full as it could be for the style. Quaffable. 6/5/3+/4/13-14 Draft @ Peddlers Pub. Dark golden body, small white head and decent lacing. Aroma is dominated by a fruitiness, touch of malt and cidery notes. Sweetish body, just a touch of bitterness under more fruity under currents. Average palate. Quaffable but very unexciting. If this is the same beer as at the crow, this must not have been in great shape. 5/3/5/3/10
John Shippeys Pipers Pale Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Sampled with the pigeons on the patio. Light yellow color with a small ring of white foam. Grassy, acidic aroma with minimal malt profile & some over-ripe apple. Taste is the same, with bad tinny aftertaste... i will not have another one of these.
John Shippeys Pipers Pale Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden color with a ring of white lace. Weak aroma of hops. Mild flavor of malt and hops. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and soft carbonation.
John Shippeys Pipers Pale Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;"Pale yellow. Lightly fruity aroma (cherry, grape); very light body. Rather macroish, unfortunately."
John Shippeys Pipers Pale Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Very pale gold, much like the local blond ales (Keith's, Oland's). Thick and creamy white head. Light bitter and floral hop aroma. Taste is similar to those local blond macros, but bigger. Also a lot less carbonation, not as prickly and soda like. Medium bitter taste which builds on the finish. A touch thin on the palate, but a big step up from said macro blond ales.
John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Not sure why this is listed as out Of business-- I just had it on tap @ the Split Crow on our recent Halifax pub crawl. Dark brown, mahogany highlights. Sweet dark caramel, fruity and toasty undertones.
John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;On Tap. Nice clear red amber ale. A little sour and sweet. Foamy and good carbonation.
John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Red copper ale with a thin white off-white head. Stron buttery diacetyl in aroma. In mouth, maple cream spread with little hops. Lighter bodied. Enjoyed with OKBeer . On tap March 2005.
John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Draft @ Peddlers Pub. Dark mahogany brown bdoy, with a small creamy white head. Very muted sweet malty aroma. Bit bland really, some sweet malt and very small amount of earthy caramel notes in the back but you have to search real hard. Touch thin. Disappointing.
John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;On tap at Splitcrow. Clear deep amber with offwhite head & lace. Sweet malty aroma with a strong soaplike fragrance that dominated the taste as well. Hint of hop bitterness, drinkable but I was overall disappointed with this brew.
John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Slightly cloudy amber color with a thin offwhite head. Aroma and flavor of malt and caramel with a mild bitter finish. The body is medium with a creamy texture and prickly carbonation.

John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;solid red ale - light tasting without lacking in flavour - great beer for washing down some greasy food as you take a break from the sites of the Halifax waterfront
John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;"Orangey dark amber colour. The aroma shows some crystal malt; hint of chocolate. Crackerlike toastiness on the palate. Dime a dozen amber ale. I know in some circles it is a badge of honour to write great flowing verses about every single beer, as though it were a competition to see who can write the most words, where the winner is the one who can infer the greatest minutiae about the flavours and aromas. But some beers just arenï¿½t worth it. People who have a little experience in beer tasting will have had Rafterï¿½s Red about four or five dozen times, all from different breweries with different names. That statement alone says more about the beer than which kind of chocolate it was in the aroma, and whether or not the cashews you found were roasted or fresh."
John Shippeys Rafter Red Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Medium amber colour with a creamy diminishing beige head. Very faint aroma, balanced caramel and floral bitterness. Nice balance of sweet (caramel, butter) and bitter (floral, touch of perfume). Medium bodied, slightly warming mouthfeel.
John Shippeys Bootlegger Nut Brown Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Not sure why this is listed as out Of business-- I just had it on tap @ the Split Crow on our recent Halifax pub crawl. Medium brown with a distinctly roasty aroma and character, dry peanutskin bitterness in the finish. A nice brown ale, bordering on porter style.
John Shippeys Bootlegger Nut Brown Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Deep red brown ale with a thin white head. A good malty aroma with notes of butterscotch. Sweet malts with faint nuttyness, a bit earthy, and some buttery notes. Medium bodied. Enjoyed with OKBeer . On tap March 2005.
John Shippeys Bootlegger Nut Brown Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Dark brown, almost black body with a small beige head that trys to be bigger but fails. The beer leaves a full coating of lacing on the glass to compensate. Muted roast over malty dark fruit and diluted coffee in the aroma. Rich nutty roasty flavour with a malty underbelly. Roast is moderate but all encompassing, leaving a dry bitterness lingering in the finish. Ephemeral touch of licorice in the background is probably imaginary. Average palate. This could possibly be the last Shippeyï¿½s rating ever since the rumblings are that they have closed.
John Shippeys Bootlegger Nut Brown Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;On tap at the Splitcrow. Cloudy dark brown with tan head.

John Shippeys Bootlegger Nut Brown Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Deep brown colour with a thin, white, frothy head. Nutty and caramel aroma. Mostly nutty flavour, accompanied by caramel and slight bitterness, with roasted character throughout. Finishes lightly bitter. Medium to full-bodied, very warming and smooth.

John Shippeys Left Coast Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Dry;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Respectably dark brown. Deep roast aroma. Nice hop/ester background (blackcurrant) to the big coffeeish, chocolatey malts. Full, rounded malt flavours, with depth and style. Good straightforward stout.
John Shippeys Left Coast Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Dry;John Shippeys Brewing Company;5.2% ABV. Gorgeous black/ruby colour with a thick brown head. Smoky, roasted, and chocolate aroma. Coffee and chocolate flavours, finishing with bitter expresso. Can be a bit inconsistent body-wise - ranges from slightly disappointing watery and thin to smooth and chewy.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Gift from SJ. Nice orange medium pour. A pleasant floral and citrus aroma. The taste was slightly orange peel and pine. A little thin for my taste, but I liked it.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Not sure why this is listed as out Of business-- I just had it on tap @ the Split Crow on our recent Halifax pub crawl. Hazy orange with a chalky clingy head. Beautiful citrus and pine aroma, assertively IPA-ish. Sweet toffee malt and citrus peel and pine hop character and a long bitter finish. Very tasty.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;On tap in the Split Crow, Halifax. Extreme amount of hops. Bitter ale. Too over powered with hops couldnï¿½t get much else.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Growler, RBSG 2005. Body is light amber. Aroma is moderately malty (bread, cookie), lightly hoppy (grapefruit), with a note of butter/diacetyl. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Seemed rather boring to me.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Amber copper ale with a thin white head. Fresh resinous hops with sweet grapefruits in aroma. In mouth, good malts base and grapefruit notes expected of an IPA. Very classic. Medium bodied. Enjoyed with OKBeer . On tap March 2005.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;[At RBSG 2005] A hazy orange beer with a small off-white head. The aroma is sweet caramelic, but also with a hint of butter. The flavor is sweet and very slightly hoppy and buttery, leading to a dry bitter end.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Out of a growler at the 2005 RBSG. golden orange color with a creamy off white head. Honey coated hop nose. Lots of grainy sweetness topped with grapefruit and pine notes. Smooth on the tongue like I would expect from a growler transported beer. It just screamed to be drunk with a sandwich.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;RBSG 05. Growler. Holy crap this has more diacetyl than any other commercial beer ever. The diacetyl pretty much covers up the hops in the aroma, although the hops come out a bit more in the flavor and finish. Somewhat of a dry finish. Need to watch fermentation on this one and increase the hops. Despite the diacetyl it was a drinkable IPA.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Growler. Citrusy and lightly piney nose, balanced out by some caramelly malt. Medium bodied, slightly bitter finish. Not bad.
John Shippeys Left Coast IPA;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;RBSG From a growler. Smallish head of white on a medium amber body. The aroma is yeasty light malt. The flavor is balanced between light malt and a bit of hop bitterness. The finish is dry with a watery light body. Needs more hops and body to round it out some.
John Shippeys Chiquita Weizen;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Draft at Shippeys. Slighly hazy golden orange body with a creamy white head that fades (3+). Yeasty, estery aroma is a touch muted. Flavour starts with lots of banana esters per the name. Followed up by some yeast and a touch of bitterness. Quite nice. Medium palate is less chewy than I like for the style but is quite smooth nonetheless. (3+) The banana makes it ok that this beer was essentially my breakfast right?
John Shippeys Chiquita Weizen;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Cloudy yellow. Aroma shows lemon, banana and for some reason brettanomyces (yikes!). Sweet palate, with marshmallow, cinnamon and vanilla. Too sweet, with some unusual flavour and aroma combinations.
John Shippeys Chiquita Weizen;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;John Shippeys Brewing Company;2005 edition. More a straight up weizen than previous years. Very cloudy pale golden colour with a lasting creamy and frothy white head. Lemon and light banana aroma. Flavours show lemon, light citrus, and some faint banana, with a nice background tartness. Light to medium bodied, refreshing. Rating is for current version. (Original rating 4.0) Cloudy yellow gold colour with a mostly diminishing frothy off-white head and lots of lacing. Big fruity and estery aroma. Tons of banana up front, then finishing with a dry but refreshing and quenching bitterness, and possibly a bit of alcohol. Served a bit too cold, but every bit as good, and IMO better than the wheats Iï¿½ve had from Germany (Schneider Weisse, Paulaner Hefeweizen, and Koner Ludwig).
Eureka Wild Berry Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cold Spring Brewery;Medium gold color, medium head. Berry aroma pronounced. Berry flavor strong, nice smooth wheat beer in background. Covered up by fruit. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is neutral.
Eureka Wild Berry Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cold Spring Brewery;Poor color, off-fruity smell, metallic thin taste. .........................
Peroni Gran Riserva Doppio Malto;Roma, Italy;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);Bottle - clear golden with decent white head. Fairly standard lager aroma. High carbonation. Slight ting on tongue. Sweet malt tasting - not too bad - but standard fare.

Cascade Premium Light;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Drank straight out of the bottle on 8/82018 (the only beer left at office drinks). Has a cardboard and grain nose.The flavour is barely detectable - just a mild and slightly unpleasant chemical character. Light body, average carbonation. Horrendous as expected.

Cascade Premium Light;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Had this as a sundowner near King's Canyon, but that's about it. Objectively, this one has nothing to get excited about.
Cascade Premium Light;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Ummm, well it is what it is. A light beer. On tap at Cacade in Hobart. Donï¿½t nesd to try this one again
Cascade Premium Light;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);A Light beer gone wrong. Skunky flavor in a watery body is hard to describe. Great heritage from Cascade Brewery but this brew doesnï¿½t belong with the rest of great beers churned in this Hobart landmark.
Cascade Premium Light;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Decent light alcohol beer. Good when icy cold on a hot day. Slight bitterness and sweetness. Thin and fizzy but good for what it is.

Cascade Premium Light;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Itï¿½s a cold liquid, it has fizz, and is refreshing on a hot day. Thatï¿½s about the best thing I can say about it. Doesnï¿½t taste horrible.

Wadadli;St. Johns, Antigua & Barbuda;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antigua Brewery (Royal Unibrew);On tap at The Pineapple Beach Club in Antigua on vacation. Pours a clear gold with a thin, fizzy, short lived white head that fully dissipates. Aroma of grainy malt and skunk. Sweet flavour of grainy malt, corn and skunky hops with a mildly bitter finish. Light body with a thin, watery texture and average carbonation. Not good, not even in the Caribbean heat.
Wadadli;St. Johns, Antigua & Barbuda;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antigua Brewery (Royal Unibrew);Historic rating. Sampled a few of these whilst on a days tour of Antigua many years ago. Light gold, bit fizzy, fairly bland, but drunk cold on a hot day its refreshing and serves its purpose.
Hart Cross-Cut Stout;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Stout;Robinson Brewing (Canada);This is a very solid stout. Plenty of roasty complexity, with good hops to balance. There is also a smokiness to this beer that is reminicent of how your flannel shirt smells the morning after sitting around a north woods campfire all night. Very apt for a canadian beer.
Hart Cross-Cut Stout;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Stout;Robinson Brewing (Canada);"The ""Commercial Description"" is pretty much spot on. This is an enjoyable stout that I would rate even higher except that it is a tad thin and lacking in body. But the ""roasty"" flavor is just fine."

Hart Red Leaf Canadian Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Looked like a cutesy-labeled macro by the label, but surprised myself by rather enjoying it. Would call this a winter ale, plenty of hearty caramel malts. Nice bready character, certainly more heft than expected. Malts are forefront, but a definite hop presence.
Hart Red Leaf Canadian Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Nice amber color with a good head. Great malt aroma with a hint of sweetness, maple? Has the nice roasted malt flavor of an English pub ale. Very good/ smooth.

New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;From Oct 2007 I got this in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! This pours from 12oz bottle a hazy deep amber with a thick head of foam with lots of lacing. The foam subsides after a few minutes but there's still a fine layer left as I get closer to the bottom of my glass. The smell is a nice mix of caramel malt and citrus hops. The taste has a very good caramel malt flavour up front..very nice. That's followed by some hops..some grass and some citrus and a touch of dark fruit. The hops aren't overpowering at all and that's fine by me as there are plenty of American IPAs that give you that real hop punch. This is nice and tasty and smooth. It has a fairly thick mouthfeel and the carbonation is fairly light as well. It finishes with a nice balance of malt and hops. I like this son of a gun! Thanks a bunch John for sending this one my way!
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;Tasted on 2/18/12 from a capped 12oz bottle. Pours hazy golden copper with a thick beige head that leaves average lace. The nose is soapy resin and lemon pith hops with some cereal malt. The flavor is nicely bitter with tons of citrus peel and the same light cereal malt from the nose. The body is medium with average carbonation and a long bitter citrus hops finish.
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;"""surprisingly the weakest offering of the 9 NG beers Iï¿½ve had to date, with IPA being one of my favorite styles. The beer was nicely balanced, and still tasty, but the hop presence is way too understated and the caramel malt too prominent, in both the flavor and aroma. Citrusy hops are barely there - for balance, but not up front. More like a pale."""
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;Rated from notes: Aroma is floral, with a bit of pine. Citrus follows on the palate, with some grassy notes. Slight toffee finish.
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;April 20th, 2012 - Thereï¿½s nothing finer than a brew that packs a walloping hop flavor in a flurry of other heady tastes and notes. New Glarusï¿½ Hop Hearty hits this very mark, bundling huge hops with boisterous fruity flavors to make a powerful one-sip-at-a-time style drink. The aroma is a bold combination of strawberries, passion fruit and pepper, surfing on a leafy bed of hop cones and resin, while the flavor is milder, and stuffed with the light sugary notes of cotton candy, bubble gum, and a mild ruby red grapefruit. This is marketed as an IPA, but itï¿½s nothing like the scathing, high number IBU brews that are making their way around hop head circles. This is heavy in a different way, sporting tons of sugars and sweets, all of it well balanced and naturally sweet. And thatï¿½s another piece of evidence that New Glarus does great work across the style board.
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;January 2012. Bottle. Amber color with a white head. Hoppy aromas, with pine, citrus and malt. Caramel flavors with lots of pine and hops. Great beer!
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;Another great beer from New Glarus, and another great IPA! A classic IPA through and through. This beer needs to be a year round beer!
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle served in a FFF pint glass. A: Pours a solid amber color with a frothy and thick two finger off white head forming on the pour. It slowly recedes to a thin film and juicy collar. S: Resiny and sticky hops are present upfront and there is a nice caramel and bready malt backing that is slightly sweet in nature. T: The taste is not as fulfilling as the nose is. Mostly malt forward with some pale malts and slight bread roll sweetness. The is followed by a slightly grassy and light resin hop profile with a finish that is the same with a twinge of flower. Unfortunately the finish fades rather fast. M: The body is surprising light and refreshing with a nice carbonation. The finish isnï¿½t really all there though in terms of lingering taste. O: This is a light and refreshing IPA, but I wish the flavor profile was a little more hop forward and a bit more vibrant. Still a very solid beer overall. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 03-30-2012
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle from Keyport. Poured a reddish-brown with a nice, hoppy aroma. Flavor is good, fresh hops and is a very solid beer. New Glarus does it again.
New Glarus Hop Hearty Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;New Glarus Brewing Company;"Nice rich copper coloured body with a glow of orange and even some peach colours with a thinnish, one centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of bright piney and resinous hops with a bit of malt noticeable and a hint of sweetness from fruits. Medium-bodied; Mildish hop notes with grassy and herbal flavours and a smooth maltiness that makes the beer go down very easily. No alcohol or assertive flavours at all, and almost no bitterness, including none from the hops at all. Overall, a pretty disappointing beer - drank almost as fresh as I could have had it, but without any hop notes and nothing tasting much like an IPA at all. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Ridgeview Liqour in Green Bay, Wisconsin on 29-July-2012 for US$1.99 sampled at home in Washington on 03-September-2012."

Wild Onion Golden Lager;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wild Onion Brewery;On tap at the brewpub: Poured into a Pilsener glass, this had a deep gold body and a decent white head that hung around for a while. It had a sweet grainy maltiness in the aroma with more of a suggestion of grassy hops than a real hop presence. Thatï¿½s pretty much how the flavor worked, too. This seemed to be a more substantial lager than what folk had reported in the past, but I think it needs more hops to balance it out.
Wild Onion Golden Lager;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wild Onion Brewery;"It is not saying much when I base my ratings on the """"""""least offensive"""""""" of the group. Of the 3 I tried this was the least offensive. Does that mean it is good, no. But of the beers I tried at the brewpub this would be the one I would drink again, under pressure. Nothing to detract or enhance this beer, very average. A pale lager in all respects."

Wild Onion Golden Lager;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wild Onion Brewery;12oz bottle(9/99)-A golden body with a nice white head and an aroma of light hops and sweetness. Taste of the same and finishes dry. Not the best golden.
Wild Onion Golden Lager;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wild Onion Brewery;Had this beer on 6/22/2000. Aroma is like cotton candy. Color is a hazy gold, with good carbonation and a light head. Taste is just bad. Starting with light/medium body and no flavor. Finish is like sweet plastic. Overall I rate its just bad, donï¿½t buy this beer.
Wild Onion Golden Lager;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wild Onion Brewery;This one had the expected clear golden color with just some lacing (sampler glass at the brewpub).

New Glarus Snowshoe Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;12floz bottle, no date, $1.75 single, pint glass. Pours with little head development atop a dark amber body. Smell is similar to a caramel pastry. The palate is medium in body, and malty with a sweet toasted taste. Fair for beers in this style range.
New Glarus Snowshoe Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Good for what it is but not a beer Iï¿½d pick up and drink though great on a cold day and a need for a marley-forward beer.

New Glarus Snowshoe Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle with many thanks to Drake! Pours deep amber to brown with a small beige head.

New Glarus Snowshoe Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Lovely reddish brown pour. Faint head, some lacing on the glass. Malt and tea aroma.

New Glarus Snowshoe Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Draft. Pours red-amber with off-white head and substantial lacing. Bread malt aroma. Light bread malt with some stone fruit notes. Light body.
New Glarus Snowshoe Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Candy sweet, mild, decent consistency and minimal hop. i was expecting more malt but really this is fine. almost too mild tbh
New Glarus Snowshoe Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;A clear dark amber with a generous collar of fine ivory foam. It's a vibrant old-worldish malt backbone with assertive hops as well. Too fresh and resolute to feel European. A bit of nut spice and holiday tasting. The feel is crisp with a lingering mild piquancy, after a medium light body feel, slightly round, barely creamy. There's either not much here or a whole world to dive into depending on your willingness to travel. This beer has carved out a unique and wonderful place among today's converging options. Joy.
New Glarus Snowshoe Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Pours a clear copper red on tap with bubbly off-white head that dissipates to leave moderate lace. Aroma of clean toasted malt and nuttiness with a light fruity ester and earthy spicy hop not. Taste is less intense than the nose, but still some solid fruity esters over toasted malts and earthy hop. Solid for what it is, seems to be the theme of the brewery.
General Brown Derby Lager;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Very crisp. Had it a while back soï¿½s this review is from notes. Head: Decent Flavor: Average Palate: palatable

General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Nothing says"" I grabbed this from a going-out-of business Kroger store on the way to the party"" like a case of ""BEER."" Now Pabst, once Schlitz, Mller or Falstaff (the Falstaff version, several years ago, was the best), this stuff is pretty good for the price, when you can find it. Iï¿½ve won many bad beer contests with it, yet thereï¿½s never any left at the end of the evening."
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz can (Old Notes)-Pours golden with a white head. Aroma of corn and grains. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew tastes as generic as the can.
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"back in ï¿½Nam we used to call this stuff ""facepalm"". then weï¿½d use the empties to make mosquito bombs. good times."
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Love the label. Almost as cool as those No Frills beers I came across in the late 80s. Pours yellow and fizzy. Smells and tastes like adjunct heaven with some corn and water as the beer warms. Not bad for an econo-beer.
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;If I could rate below a ï¿½1ï¿½ on any part of this beer I would. Absolutely horrible.
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"I remeber this !! It was the worst thing ever !! An I thought my days Black Labelk and Grandpas old style was bad. Thanks god the country came away from the whole ""Generic"" thing."
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;In a nutshell: Carbonated bilge water. Itï¿½s about as close as I ever want to come to drinking cat urine. The most redeeming quality of this swill is the swell can.
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Someone told me they found a case of this in his grandfatherï¿½s basement. He described it to me and I thought he was lying. This stuff was REAL?! Does this exist anymore? I found a picture and submitted it, I donï¿½t know if it will be posted or not.
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;A friend found a sixer of this stuff and bought it as a joke. It is exactly what it says it is, generic beer. Appearance score is for the awesome can!
General Generic Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Why even drink this? The only good thing about it is the can, white with black lettering saying BEER.
Edsten Double Plus;Woodland, California, United States;Dubbel;Edsten Brewing Company;Medium brown color, medium head. A full-bodied Belgian Abby Double. Very malty, some hoppyness. Nice malt sweetness, nearly fruity. Mouthfeel is full and expansive. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is malty, with a very slight alcohol bite, not very noticeable despite being a 9.5%. VERY nice beer. Very comparable to the best Belgian ales.
Edsten Double Plus;Woodland, California, United States;Dubbel;Edsten Brewing Company;Excellent presentation, gorgeous deep caramel color with even bubbling. aroma is sweet, grassy, carmel, citrus. fantastic citrus sweet with high tart end and bitter follow through sent to the sinuses on a very vinous tongue. An amazing beer behind this cryptic tattoo-like wordless label.
Edsten Double Plus;Woodland, California, United States;Dubbel;Edsten Brewing Company;Aroma of candish malt, lemon and fresh-mown grass. This beer is sweet, very sweet. Somehow, it still dries out on the tongue for balance, but that doesn't quite mitigate the overly-cloying sweetness. Unfolds a bit as it continues to warm. I'd like to give this another try, but I don't think I'll ever come to like this more than the Edsten Triple Wit. Thanks to user_experience for this goodie.
Wild Onion Summer Wit;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wild Onion Brewery;The beer pours an opaque gold color with a small white head that fades quickly. The aroma blends orange juice, lemon zest, coriander, and wheat sweetness, and the taste is slightly sweet and a bit one-dimensional. The aftertaste doesnï¿½t have the typical American wheat yeast flavor, which is a plus, and the aftertaste just has some light fruit and wheat flavor. The palate fuses a thick texture, medium body, and a soft carbonation.
Wild Onion Summer Wit;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wild Onion Brewery;Can at the brewpub. Clear light orange pour with a white head. Aroma is orange and mild coriander. Light bodied and clean. Pretty refreshing.
Al Ahram Birell;Giza, Egypt;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Al Ahram (Heineken);Can shared at GBBF 2015 - big thanks to Ollie Jobbins. Pours clear pale yellow with a creamy, white head. The nose is tangy cereal and faint lemon. Sugary, lots of damp cereal, light grass, bitter hay. Light bodied with fine to average carbonation. Sugary finish, more pale grains. Not good.

Al Ahram Birell;Giza, Egypt;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Al Ahram (Heineken);330ml can. Pours dark gold with a medium head. Aroma is cornflakes, off milk and boiled vegetables. Taste has boiled vegetables and cardboard. Weird rank, tangy malt on the finish. Pretty fucken bad.
Al Ahram Birell;Giza, Egypt;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Al Ahram (Heineken);Can.Clear golden colour with off-white head.Aroma is sweet and grainy with flavor of syrup and sweet apples really odd flavor and taste with sweet mouthfeels and short harsh finish.
Lï¿½wenbrau Zurich Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlï¿½sschen (Carlsberg);Used to be one of the Top 5 Beers in the World (back in the 1970's) If kept at 40 degrees from factory to retailer it's a terrific beer worthy of being a World Class contender as was Munich Lowenbrau. Has disappeared (at least in the Northeast) since the early 1990's.........
Lï¿½wenbrau Zurich Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlï¿½sschen (Carlsberg);Clear straw pour under a fizzy white head that was gone in a flash. Mostly skunky aroma with a hint of bread. Typical light malty and slightly bitter (bad bitter) skunky flavor. Crisp finish. Despite that, if the beer is cold enough and you drink it quickly, itï¿½s palatable. Itï¿½s better than Lowenbrau Original but thatï¿½s saying practically nothing.
Lï¿½wenbrau Zurich Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlï¿½sschen (Carlsberg);Yellowish, a quickly disappearing head. A touch of citurs in the aroma. A little watery and bitter in both flavor and finish. (My beer waqs bought on a can in Sweden, I wonder if this really was the one I really had. This was a lightblue can with a golden stripe on top and one at the bottom...The name was Lï¿½wenbrï¿½u Original)
Lï¿½wenbrau Zurich Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlï¿½sschen (Carlsberg);Drank it because it was an import. Nothing fancy, got the label though. Not much to say really
Lï¿½wenbrau Zurich Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlï¿½sschen (Carlsberg);"It wasn't the ""real"" Lowenbrau from Germany, but it wasn't too bad either. Still, nothing really stood out about it either. A bit pricey."
Lï¿½wenbrau Zurich Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlï¿½sschen (Carlsberg);I could not find one thing wrong with this beer. Oh well, I did pay over 9 bucks just for a six pack. It''s sad that you can''t get this in the states anymore.
Lï¿½wenbrau Zurich Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlï¿½sschen (Carlsberg);"Waaaay back in the day, when Lowenbrau was contract brewed in the US by Miller, we would buy this thinking it was the ""real"" Lowenbrau. We never questioned why it was made in Switzerland, and not Germany. The funny thing was, even then, I thought it wasn't very good. Skunky green bottles, etc. etc."

Lï¿½wenbrau Zurich Alkoholfrei;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Lï¿½wenbrï¿½u Zurich (Feldschlï¿½sschen);Plastic bottle Clean blond color. No aroma (or plastic, maybeï¿½). No malt interest, just a quite strong bitterness. Not my favorite low-alcohol.
