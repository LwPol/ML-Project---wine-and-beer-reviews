Spanish Peaks Black Dog Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Tried this over at a buddy’s house. After the first sip, I wasn’t THAT impressd but it slightly grew on me towards the end. Still seemed a little off-balanced, slightly bitter or metallic? Not sure if that’s part of the style, but I have been hesitant to try Spanish Peaks after that. It wasn’t bad at all, just not what I expected. Would most likely rather go with a Belgian Ale instead.....or some other micro with similar style.
Spanish Peaks Black Dog Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;"""pretty standard english pale. lots of malt with a hint of spice and a little orange peel on the side. nothing to make me mad, or to change my mind about a fairly boring style."""
Spanish Peaks Black Dog Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;A decent amber. Pour a nice bright red with very little head. Smells and tastes pretty malty. Had in the bottle at Warehouse Cafe.

Decent beer. I don’t know if anything about it really stands out to me, but it is one that would be a good session beer for most folks.

Spanish Peaks Black Dog Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Clear, deep red-amber with a short tan cap. Scent is sharp caramel. Taste is caramel over a slight, vague bitter... Tea-like with a bit of maltiness. Average, at best.
Spanish Peaks Black Dog Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;From bottle. Too much carbonation. Very hard to drink. Had to dump it. Disappointed as I wanted to try this dark beer. Beer actually had foam coming out of the bottle while it sat on a table. Weird. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Spanish Peaks Black Dog Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Nice dark amber color pour wih a samll head. Decent brew but nothing spectacular in any phase. I might give this one another chance as I only had one bottle. Not the best...not the worst.
Spanish Peaks Black Dog Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;"A standard cheap six-pack in the midwest with slightly more character than, say, Michelob Amber. A bit of an unfair comparison since this beer is more flavorful and ""crafty"" than your usual gas station and supermarket brew, but that’s more or less the level at which to set expectations for a generic, malty but decently lively brew."
Ommegang Abbey Ale;Cooperstown, New York, United States;Dubbel;Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat);Caramel, dark fruit aroma. Reddish dark maroon in color. Taste is dark fruit, spices, sweet, caramel, cranberry, and malt, with some bitterness to finish.

Appearance is hazy, deep cherry red with orange highlights, lots of effervescent sparkle, 2-finger quickly fading fizzy beige head with no lacing. Aroma is strong caramel, dark and stone fruits (primarily plum, raisin, peach). Taste is apple, caramel, brown sugar, honey, dark fruit. Palate is light bodied with smooth, thin texture, lively-to-fizzy carbonation, numbing the bottom lip, and finish as taste. Overall, nice color and strong aroma and taste. Palate's not altogether pleasant--thin and the carbonation almost hurts the tongue.

The aroma is dark fruit, alcohol, and spice. The taste is raisin, plum, spice, and Belgian yeast. It's smooth. It's a good sipper and packs a punch. Like most beers from these guys, it's a great example of the style.
Milwaukee Brewing Downtown Lites;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Sampler at the brewpub. It poured a hazy golden color with a white head.

Milwaukee Brewing Downtown Lites;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Slightly hazy orange-tan. Foamy head. Not bad for a house light beer I suppose. Honey maly tones, very nice and easy going. Well done for what it was going for, despite being a touch grainy.
Milwaukee Brewing Downtown Lites;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;On tap. It is a mild, subtle, slightly sweet crowd-pleaser type ale, it doesn’t have a lot of character but goes down easily.
Milwaukee Brewing Downtown Lites;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Tasted 8/15/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Filtered with a golden hue. Brainy white head. Aromas of cereal grains and a mild hop bitterness. Light bodied but with nice discernable flavors. Crisp body with a bright, fresh palate. Good effervescence and a subtle citrus and orange in an otherwise mild finish. Subtle kiss of honey. Super session that actually has flavor!
Milwaukee Brewing Downtown Lites;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;aroma is wet newsprint, half rotten cereal left out in the rain. appearance is translucent urine, ring of head and zero lacing leaving a spotless glass where ’beer’ once was. flavor is factory malt, grainy cardboard and hint of honey to close. mouthfeel is ultra wet, quick.

Hop bitter at end. Actually has a nice aftertaste. Better than I expected, a well balanced and drinkable light beer.
Milwaukee Brewing Downtown Lites;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;It is a light lager. yellow color. Very light malt and hops with a thin palate, and it isn’t terrible for a light yellow beer, but I wouldn’t have tried it if it did not come with the sampler.
Milwaukee Brewing Downtown Lites;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Pours a light golden colour and a medium white head. Has a pretty malty taste. grainy and slightly watery it lacks a solid body and reminds me of something very similar to an MGD.
Milwaukee Brewing Downtown Lites;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Clear amber body. Dry grass, some honey in the aroma. The flavor has an interesting mix of dry grass, green pepper, pollen, and a dry toasty pale malt base. Finishes fruity dry with a lasting grass note. This could have been more interesting w/ some orange blossom honey. This rating is from early 2007. Earlier Rating: 7/24/2004 Total Score: 2.4 yellow body, thin white head. Light cornflake aroma with honey notes. The flavor has an amped-up version of the aroma, just featuring more prominent grassy and dandelion hops. Light, boring but unoffensive.

Milwaukee Brewing Solomon Juneau;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Pint on tap at the brewpub (Milwaukee, WI). Pours a rich darker golden amber pour, some healthy amber orange glow, though darker slanted, a healthy haze and big frothy whitish head atop sticks around well and laces well. Aromas are gentle bubblegum and grapefruit, some lemon, oranges and grass. A touch of that telltale sweetness, with more grapefruit coming in as it warms. Initial is lighter bodied, perhaps a touch of body with gentle citrusy sweetness, touch of tropical fruit, pale malts, bread, and some gentle floral/grass bitterness. Middle is mellow sweetness, quickly moving into a dry fruity finish, mellow dry bitter hops grow as it warms. Flavorful, but lacking the bitterness I was expecting, moreso showcasing a fruity hop essence. A bit odd, mellow, forgettable without a dominant hop profile bittering this baby up. Prefer the Pull Chain. Ok.
Milwaukee Brewing Solomon Juneau;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Draft at Milwaukee Brewing. Pours a pale straw with a fluffy white head. The nose is light and spicy with an odd ’wit’ like note. Faint malt. On tasting, appropriate medium-low bitterness with a soft malty profile as well. crisp and refreshing overall. But the Wit note is quite strange...

Milwaukee Brewing Solomon Juneau;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Draft at Old Fashioned. Hazy golden tan, nice steady thick off-white head. Pretty nice and refreshing APA. Balanced, but the minimal hops still leave something to be desired. The noble hops give it a crisper feel than having gone with NW varietals. Medium bodied, slightly soapy. Slightly dirty, doesn’t really hit the spot. Drinkable, but sub par.
Milwaukee Brewing Solomon Juneau;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;On tap. It has a nice hop bite, but the malts just aren’t working for me, almost buttery.
Milwaukee Brewing Solomon Juneau;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a straw golden with a thick frothy white head. Aroma of somewhat stale noble hops but the saaz still has a nice bite to it, bit wine like, bit of vanilla, smooth rice like creaminess. Flavor follows, light sweetness, creamy, maybe slight infection starting or it’s just the odd combination and old hops, could probably pretty nice fresh, not bad now, vanilla/rice softness. Carbonation is corse and plenty of it, again maybe slight infection starting.

Spanish Peaks Monterey Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;I had consumed a fair amount of this Pale Ale a few years ago, and happened to see a new shipment at my local BevMo. Suprised that I haven’t rated this one yet, so I cracked it open and watched Dirty Jobs. The beer pours out a light brown/medium amber color with a nice creamy 2-finger thick head with some nice staying power. Tons of carbonation rising up from the bottom of my Maudite glass. Aroma was decidedly sweet, with no real hop aroma detectable. A bit of old malts, a touch vegetative but mostly sweet. A smooth mouthfeel with just a bit of prickly carbonation. Flavors were overwhelmingly sweet for a Pale Ale. No real bitterness detected, but a slight herbal background fumbles along with the caramel sweetness though. For some reason, I was enjoying the beer, even in all it’s underattenuated glory. Probably just my raging sweet tooth. The beer is not a true pale ale, but I found it tasty.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Apparently this one doesn’t age well. Some caramel and spice aromas. Caramel colored body with dirty dishwater colored head. Flavor was watery with hints of caramel and mild spicey bitter. Spicey aftertaste left on palate. Also some sediment found on bottom of pint glass that just didn’t peak my couriosity to finish last gulp.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Nothing special. Bottled. A straw yellow pour with little head rentention. Crisp malt and a light bitterness. Not much to appreciate here in my opinion.
Spanish Peaks Monterey Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Had this beer on 9/12/2003. Aroma is a light fresh scent that reminds me of Coors. Color is a pale gold with good carbonation and very thin head. Taste is crisp and bitter. Starting with a light body that goes down with a smooth fizzy feel. Finish starts off with a crisp malt flavor that is almost exactly like Coors. This is backed by a firm bitterness. Overall as a Pale Ale I rate it poor, there is no hop flavor, the body is to thin and the bitterness is not balanced.

Spanish Peaks Monterey Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;"This brewery must be back in business. I just sampled a bottle from ’07. This was amber/golden in color. Evident cascade hops in the aroma and an off-smell. Medium bodied, slightly malty, and very hoppy. A nice bitter finish.

Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Amber red color. Thick creamy beige head. Sweet raspberry malt aroma. Zesty fruity malt flavor. Pronounced bitter hop finish is somewhat medicinal.
Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;01-31-2008 Appearance: Amber, brown body with a very weak head, barely a finger. Smell: faint sweetness (as it warmed mild raspberry aroma) Taste: sweet, mild taste, very mild actually with aftertaste of raspberries. No honey. Mouthfeel: A bit watery actually, raspberries in background, a bit creamy. As it warms honey finally comes, raspberries are more pronounced. Drinkability: Very ordinary, bordering on bland.
Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Back in the 90’s, I loved this beer. I used to order special cases of it from Montana. It’s fruity but still tastes like a beer. Haven’t had it in 10 or 15 years though, so I could’ve been wrong.
Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Pours brownish red. Thick head with a chemically fruity aroma. Don’t know about the honey, but the raspberry is pretty apparent.
Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;It has a deep amber colored body with good clarity, visible carbonation and a light tan head. The head is very light and soapy. It very quickly fades down to just a very thin wispy layer. Lacing is minimal and slick. The aroma hit me with a light waft of raspberry candy as I opened the bottle. In the glass and with a proper inspection I get the same raspberry candy but with notes of honey and biscuit like malt. The flavor is very much the same as the aroma. It has a light body with a sweet malty character. There are notes of sweet honey and sweet/tart raspberry with hop flavor way off in the distance. The hop flavor just kind of picks up on the tartness of the berry and adds a very mellow subdued bitterness to the finish. Its palate feels light and silky with light somewhat fizzy carbonation.
Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Bottle. Light orange, average off white head. Aroma of perfumey raspberry, light caramel. Flavour is raspberry, more candyish than perfumey, with sweet underlying malts. Not bad, but I prefer a raspberry character that is more tart and stemmy, which I think is hard to achieve with honey.

Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Plenty of natural-tasting raspberry but I didn’t notice any honey. Almost cloyingly sweet and a bit syrupy.
Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Bottle pours dark amber with tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of raspberries. Flavor is tart raspberry with light honey and breaded malts. A very light and rather refreshing lambic style ale. I rated this by comparing it to other beers in its style. Some of the low ratings of this ale may be due to comparing it with all ales rather than comparing it with other fruit beers.
Spanish Peaks Honey Raspberry Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Ruby-copper, hayzy, thin off-white head. Aroma is fruity, with candi-sweet raspberry. Flavor is initially grainy and relatively dry, followed by a hint of fruity sweetness and a raspberry character that is more earthy and natural than it is in the aroma. Finishes dry and slightly tannic.

Spanish Peaks Porter;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Porter;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;I figured a buck and a half for one bottle isnt that bad if its all going down the tubes, so here goes. Appearance is standard black but with a thinner and whiter head. Aroma is not that amazing, but has some notes of roasted goodness behind its vinegar tingle. The flavor is actually better than expected. It has a pretty thin taste to it, making it easy going. It does give off a slight bit of roasted coffee, but very little. Double the ingrediants of this and we might have something worth revisiting.
Spanish Peaks Porter;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Porter;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;12.20.02 bottle (old notes). Pours a medium brown with thin head. Watery and light, not strong flavors, not much roast. Hints of cocoa. Could be more bitter at end.
Spanish Peaks Porter;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Porter;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Good dark color beer with a nice head. Somewhat weak and light for a porter. Decent flavor. watery texture. Somewhat lacking in finish. An okay beer. A sad porter.
Spanish Peaks Porter;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Porter;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Nice dark color but for a porter it is light. The flavor isn't bad. It has a slight coffee and chocolate flavor, but nothing big. But it has an almost watery finish. Lacks many qualities of a good porter. This would probably be a good dark beer for beginners. It doesn't leave a very big impression, though.
Spanish Peaks Porter;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Porter;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;This brew is horrible. Well maybe not that bad... but stay away if you can. The color is that of a good brown ale, and the taste is light and watery.
Spanish Peaks Porter;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Porter;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Rather remiscent of Blackhook Porter, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Rather light in body and average alcohol content. Good flavor, though, typical roasty porter malt with some lightly bitter hops. Body needs some work, though, lacking complexity and depth in a big way, and lending a light mouthfeel, which is great in some beers but not a porter.
Spanish Peaks Porter;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Porter;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;I was disappointed in this beverage after tasting their pale ale and black dog ale. This was to light (almost watery) and had little chocolate flavor..... To me this tasted like a bud light with a little black malt.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;I think I got a bad bottle. The body was very flat and the taste was lacking on the nutty side. It seemed a little skunky as well. I think that it had been sitting in the cooler for too long.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Pours a nice dark brown color. Aromas of nuts/chocolate/caramel. Flavor is nutty with a nice sweet honey chocolate taste and a little coffee bitterness.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company, Ltd.--Nut Brown Ale--1998 12 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV (3.5 / 5.0) Brown Ale--Clear light bright copper color. Flavorful light hop front with light nutty aroma. Body is light textured with smooth toasted caramel malt character and mild fruit sweetness. Spicy floral hop end. Sampled 6/9/1999.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Ok, I don’t know if I should really be rating this beer, because I bought it at a close-out sail at a liquor store, when this beer was probably two years old or so... no date on the six-pack... just dust on the bottles. Anyway beige head, brownish red colour. Nutty aroma. Little malty. Fairly watery. Caramel notes. Pretty crappy, but that might just be the old age of the beer, rather than anything inherent to the beer as it once was.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Had this beer on 12/19/1997. There is nothing special about it, but it is a good smooth drinking beer and I would buy it again.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;The aroma has coffee, toasted malt, and chocolate. The appearance is dark brown with a two finger head. The flavor is very toasty with lots of coffee and sugar. There is a bitter astringent taste to it as well but very little nuttiness. The palate is thin. This is more of a second rate porter than a brown ale.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Pours a three finger, light tan head that fades to a shallow layer leaving some lace. Mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Bitter chocolate nose. Flavor is sweet bitter chocolate, with a roasted coffee finish. Unusual brown but good. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from John’s Grocery Iowa City, IA.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Dark brown color,small tan head that had a decent hang time then faded to leave nothing behind but a slight lace.The aroma was malty and roasty with a decent chocolate side.The flavor was fairly decent,malty and chocolatey with a mild sweetness coming on and a bit of a mild bitter sweet ending.Very nice brew that is easy to drink almost anytime.well worth trying again,and again.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;12oz bottle from Party Source - Pours dark brown with a short creamy tan head that stays pretty well and laces the glass. Aromas of chocolate, nuts, caramel. Flavor is malty with chocolate, caramel, nuts, and a touch of roasted malt. Slight bitterness on the finish. Full bodied for a brown and dare I say more porter-like than any brown I’ve tasted before. I liked it pretty well.
Spanish Peaks Nut Brown Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Perhaps the most chocolatey brown ale that I’ve had to date. It pours a deep, opaque brown with red highlights and sports a slender tan head. The aroma is quite malty, full of chocolate, a bit of caramel, and a light nutty bitterness. Very thick and smooth to drink, the chocolate becomes more pronounced in the flavor, accompanied by lightly roasted malts, caramel, and an even lighter nuttiness. Good stuff.

Spanish Peaks Apple Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Apple Cider;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;I had this one at an Old Chicago Restuarant.My wife's favorite.The color was nice,kind of a golden red color.The aroma was definately sweet/sour apple and the taste followed the same suit with a slightlysour apple after taste that was not unpleasant but very good.The wife wants it rated higher but until shwe has an account it's my call and i think the hardcore was better ,but this is decent.
Spanish Peaks Apple Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Apple Cider;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;The folks at Spanish Peaks did a little bit better job here than they did with their pear cider. This one is not too bad, perhaps a bit much by itself but with food, its pretty descent. Similar aftertaste to Hardcore Crisp.
Spanish Peaks Apple Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Apple Cider;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Not impressed, I love cider and this stuff is probably the worst. It has a good initial taste but then the aftertaste hits you and it is one of the most horrid tastes ever, totally ruining your cider experience.
Spanish Peaks Pear Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Perry;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Pours a bright golden yellow color. Aroma of sweet pear. The flavor was a nice change from the apple.The flavor was mostly pear but there is the slight hint of apple as well.
Spanish Peaks Pear Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Perry;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;"A chartreuse yellow color with trickles of carbonation and a wisp of a white head. Head has wicked poor retention and settles to a bubbly sticky lace. The aroma is almost offensive; a tartness and acidity that does not stimulate the glands (and a hint of esters in the background). The flavor is sweet on the start with a skunky tart finish. Palate is comparable to a flat Orange Crush ? no carbonation and a syrupy texture. IMHO: A flaccid concoction if there ever was one. I am usually quite forgiving, but this cider should not be on the market."
Spanish Peaks Pear Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Perry;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;The first cider I have had in ages, so maybe that skews my ratings. Blonde, with a possibly green tint. This aroma and flavor was of pear/candy cider--quite jolly rancherish--a bit too much so--though still tasty and enjoyable.
Spanish Peaks Pear Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Perry;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Hold your nose, here it comes! This stuff is pretty rough. I bought a six pack and I think have only finished three of them in a year''s time. Serious aftertaste which approachers being bitter.
Spanish Peaks Pear Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Perry;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Can you say sweet? The sweetness overwhelms everything, in fact, I can't even taste the pear that's supposed to be in there. Carbonated sugar water.
Spanish Peaks Pear Cider;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Perry;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Not very good. No apparant flavor, just extremely sweet. I give it a thumbs down.
Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. Pours clear yellow-gold with a faint white cream head. Simple biscuity nose, some straw. Light sweet flavor with subtle citric tang, more biscuits, low bitterness. Light bodied with fine carbonation. Sweet, simple biscuity finish, bit more lemon. Very simple.

Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;(Draught) Pours a lightly hazy golden body with a small white head. Aroma of florals, grain, and minerals. Flavor of grain, grass, corn, and subtle melon rind.
Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;On draft at the brewpub. Pours a clear, light yellow with virtually no head. The aroma is bready and grainy. The flavor is strong with crackers and some toasted bread. There is very little hop or yeast character. The finish is refreshing. The mouthfeel is light, not quite watery (close), with some carbonation to keep it a little spritzy. Overall, a drinkable session beer with some pleasant, bready characters - but nothing to write home about.
Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a white head with yellow color. Aroma is grain. Taste is sweet grain, crisp. Refreshing.
Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Clear straw body with white head, nice lacing. Aroma is minimal, bread, light fruit. Taste is medium sweet, melon, some berry, bread. Soft light-medium body.
Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Mild grainy malts with light cabbagey DMS and fair fruitiness to the nose. Clear golden coloured body with decent white head that covers and coats the glass. Grainy malt flavour with a light fruitiness and very mild bitterness. Nice and flavourful example of the style especially considering the low ABV. Light, crisp body with fair carbonation. Sampled at the brewpub with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;New England Road Trip Easter ’05 with MartinT, tiggmtl and Rastacouere, beer #51. Sample at the brewpub. Clear bubbly blonde with a smelly vegetal nose...bland sweet corn flavor with a bit of hay texture...full, somewhat sticky body.
Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Lactic cereal and pungent hay aroma predict a crisp malting and lingering husks...Dry grass and citrusy dew keep things interesting...Well-done for the house blond...
Watch City Tick Tock Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Light clear gold, honest white film, mellow carbonation. Soft grainy and corny nose reminds me of popcorn, but somehow pleasant as it comes from vegetal hops rather than straight DMS. It’s just soo light. The softest pils malt just pushes and pushes to hold any trace of flavours over that watery background. Short-flavored, clean and thin..
Watch City Totem Pale Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours an offwhite head with amber/copper color. Aroma is malt, sweet, dark fruit. Taste is malt, sweet, secondary hops that balance nicely. OK carbonation.

Watch City Totem Pale Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watch City Brewing Co.;New England Road Trip Easter ’05 with MartinT, tiggmtl and Rastacouere, beer #50. Sample at the brewpub. Dark clear brass top by a big head and thick lacing...pungent honeysuckle/lilac and piney hops lick the nose...watery texture, good level of carbonation, nice bitterness throughout, sour orange detectable.
Watch City Totem Pale Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Grapefruity, citrusy hops profit from the decent malting which provides a full-bodied yet quenching body...Simple toffee and earth evolve with the lingering hoppiness into a well-balanced finish...Shiny and flavorful...
Watch City Totem Pale Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Superb off-white lacing. Big bubbles, a beautiful dark amber. Nice looks. Nicely fresh cut C-hops nose, sweaty and citrusy, dry and leathery. Feels stronger than it is. This is pretty tasty. Lots of well dried fruitiness, citrus and nut oil flavours. The balance is fine. A negative point might be the wateriness of the texture, yet it’s medium bodied and rather crisp.
Watch City Totem Pale Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewery: poured amber with a medium beige head. Earthy hop aroma. Slight sweetness in the flavor, almost maple-y. Moderate hops. Decent.
Watch City Totem Pale Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Handpump February 2005. Wonderful pour, beige, light orange and golden hues all swirl about as the beer settles. Large, creamy bright white head. Aroma of fruity, leafy, fuzzy hops, juicy and not overly bitter or dry. Flavor begins with light caramel and citrus, with plenty of hops flavor. Light honey on the finish, but little to no yeast character in the beer. Gets a bit too thin on the finish, and it just becomes hops and creamy nothingness. Not bad, but could use more malt depth, less hops. Medium-light bodied, low carbonation.
Watch City Totem Pale Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Amber in color with a small white head.Touch of sweetness,followed by malt character,finishing into a refeshing hoppiness.
Watch City Totem Pale Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Clear golden with a puffy white lacing head. Very mild lightly hoppy aroma. Body is semi-sweet and bitter, but lacks balance. Overall pretty bland for a pale ale, but drinkable and doesn't have any bad off-flavors.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;From tap at the brewpub. Pours hazy dark deep amber to brown with a small tan head. Aroma is roasted malty, slight breadish. Breadish flavoured with a nice little hop profile coming through. Ends lingering malty and slight roasted.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;No aroma. Clear garnet. Whole cherry flavor, including the pit, wiith a light mustiness. Not really my thing and drinks like an amber.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;On tap at Watch City, Waltham MA, 5 November 2009 as Titan Ale @ 5.9% but I guess this is the same stuff. Nice dark brown colour. Little bit of dark malt, a lick of tangy hops. Little bit of powdery chocolate. Slightly herbal. Medium mouthfeel. Solid stuff. Like the other Watch City beers, respectable but didn’t really grab my attention.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;A deep clear brown ale with a thin moka head. In aroma, a nice nutty brown ale with caramel, and meat broth notes, lightly vinous. In mouth, dry chocolate and nuts, sustained, meaty, quite nice. On tap at brewpub, Oct. 12 2008.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Pours a very dark brown that only lets a tiny bit of light in through the edges. One finger head that fades into a thin ring along the edge of the pint glass. Faint smells of burnt chocolate brownie or maybe even fudge. With a subtle blast of warm french toast. Tastes of bitter chocolate malt that fades quickly. Hint of honey and a pinch of brown sugar. The tiny amounts of carbonation and the overall smoothness make this brown betty a fairly ok to drink. Overall I like this beer on a slightly chillier or foggy/rainy day (which is not how I had it for this review, but have before). This beer would be decent as long as it wasn’t warm out.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;On tap at Watch City. Not much of an aroma to it. Nice dark brown color with an off white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. It tastes of mocha, the mouthfeel is chaulky and pretty light, not watery, but not sticky either. The aftertaste is much like the flavor as it hits your mouth, somewhat bitter. Not bad.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Draught pint at Watch City on 9/9/06. Dull stained-oak brown with a very slight hint of auburn and beige. Clarity is high and a creamy-beige head sits atop the beer, small, with moderate to low retention and moderate lacing. Sweet, sticky crystal malts in the nose are glimpsed at, but quick to the table are bitter, floral PNW hops that dry things out heavily and make way for a bready, sourdough-like finish. As it warms, nuts and light toffee increase the complexity, but it’s very dry and lean in the malt structure, without any soft or briefly sweet notes to give much needed balance. Hops in the flavor are minimal, providing light citric and floral touches that work with the crackery-dry malts to keep things heavily dry overall. Even a light dollop of tootsie-roll-like sweetness on the end does not seem to balance. Hops are mostly bitter, without any juiciness in the flavor. Slight breadiness and an arid, almost carbonic-like dryness (high carbonation). Dry, dry dry. I like dry, but with the very low flavor profile, high carbonation and relatively high bitterness, it just comes off as hard and fatiguing on the palate. Brown ales need a little comforting sweetness. No alcohol noted in aroma or flavor.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a foamy tan head that laces with copper color. Aroma is dark malt, roasty, hops, sweet. Taste is lots of hops balanced with lots of medium malt, very sweet. Like a 2IPA. Good for sipping.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Clear mahogany head with minimal beige head. Aroma is moderately sweet, coffee, nutty, some chocolate. Taste is medium sweet, chocolate, nutty, roasty/coffee, some grapefruit/pine. Medium body with some stickiness. Could pass as a porter.
Watch City Titan Brown Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Tap@Watch City, Waltham, Ma. Quite nutty and chocolatey, but with a fair hit of grapefruity hops. Piney, some lychee. really hoppy for a brown ale. Quite nice. Bitter finish.
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. Pours deep brown with a lasting, tight beige cream head. The nose has lots of ashy roast, some milk cocoa. Light sweet flavor with toasty bread, light baking cocoa, fine earth, balanced roast. Medium bodied with fine carbonation and silky mouthfeel. Light sweet acid with more ash, lingering strong roast, light coffee, more baking cocoa. Pretty decent.
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;Man. This was one nice stout. So creamy, but with a bite! Black pour, brown head. Roasty milk chocolate aroma. Flavor is chocolate with vanilla notes.
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;On draft at brewpub. The pour is jet black with a thin, tan head. The aroma is bittersweet with coffee and molasses. The flavor has a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. It has a decent level of fruitiness and esters, but also a good punch of coffee/chocolate notes from the roasted grains. There is also a decent bit of residual sweetness from caramel malts. At mid-palate, fruity hops and molasses battle it out. At the finish - full flavor, roasty with some sweetness and some earthy and fruity hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is quite soft and smooth. The beer was pushed with nitrogen, but it fits as it brings a creaminess to the tongue that carbon dioxide likely would not have brought in the same way. Overall, this was a very decent American Stout (not quite Foreign Stout, though).
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;Flavor has a tangyness a bit like weak coffee. Not great. I seem to remember this being better the last time I had it. May merit a re-rate.
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a tan head with black color. Aroma is dark malt, sweet, coffee. Taste is dark malt, coffee, chocolate. Thin mouthfeel. OK carbonation. Not my taste.
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;Thanks ClarkVV! The aroma of this beer was a disappointment. All that could be detected was a mild hint of dates. It was black in color with only a glaze of a head. This thin smooth beer offers the infused flavor of dates and anise. The flavor did have enough character to leave a decent taste lingering for a few moments after swallowing. (This was from a growler and I drank it on a night with many of the top 25 stouts.)
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;(on nitro) Opaque black body topped by a creamy tan head. Aroma is medium sweet, coffee, light chocolate. Taste is medium sweet, coffee, some bittersweet chocolate. Creamy medium body.
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;Nitro pint at the brewpub, 12/18/05. Typical nitro pour, inky dark body with a beige head that is well retained and laces perfectly. Aroma is rather muted. Some oily and lactic notes from the roast, with a bit of nuttiness, soy, chocolate and grapes. Rather bitter and having some licorice-like notes to it. Flavor does not seem to follow from the nose, as I was preparing myself for a dry, bitter, lactic and vinous beer. Not the case. It’s fluid texture delivers a seemless sweet malt that consists of a well-homogenized vanilla cream, chocolate, coffee (light) and toffee. Only a light dose of lactic and vinous notes on the finish, which actually add a fair amount of complexity and help to balance the heavy chocolate and creamy sweetness. Walnut/peanut skins linger on the end. The body is medium to medium-full with no thinning or wateriness, no alcohol and just a hint of earthy tanginess throughout. Smooth, even, near-velvety texture with low carbonation.
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;Pint @ Pub. Good nose, Cocoa, chocolate, little of a salty thing. Nice dark orangy black color, no light get through, Good head that faded slowly. Bittersweet flavors, Baking chocolate, coffee grounds, kinda piney. Medium body, Lite creamy mouthfeel, bitter dry finish. I like it. Warmed up nicely.
Watch City Moody Street Stout;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Watch City Brewing Co.;Roasty, chocolate and soy sauce in the sweet yet salty aroma. Opaque black with decent cover of large-bubbled brown/tan head that coats the glass. Chocolate malt flavours up front are followed by a pleasant roasty bitterness and light salty notes in the dry finish. Medium-full body with smooth texture and fair carbonation. Sampled at the brewpub with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
Maritime Atlantic Storm India Pale Ale;Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maritime Beer Company, Inc. (Sapporo);I really liked this brew when I visited Newfoundland. But there is nothing bad about Newfoundland. It goes good with moose meat. I disagree with Oakes because in my opinion I thought it was much better than Keith's. PS, Oakes, I'm always confused. I do think this is better than Keith's ,though.
Maritime Atlantic Storm India Pale Ale;Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maritime Beer Company, Inc. (Sapporo);I love ales but I wouldn't call this on I think this was more like a lager then an ale in my books anyway. Keith's is the way to go when I look for a IPA!
Maritime Atlantic Storm India Pale Ale;Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maritime Beer Company, Inc. (Sapporo);............................................................................
Maritime Atlantic Storm India Pale Ale;Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maritime Beer Company, Inc. (Sapporo);Oakes is right again. IPA is by definition hoppy - otherwise the beer wouldn't have made it to India. So why label beer with such low hoppiness an IPA? Typical Canadian golden ale.
Maritime Atlantic Storm India Pale Ale;Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maritime Beer Company, Inc. (Sapporo);One of the anomalies of the beer world is the use of the term IPA in Atlantic Canada for bland golden ales. This stems from Keith's IPA, which probably was an India Pale seventy-five or one hundred years ago, but has not been in a long time. So this beer is mislabelled in an attempt to compete with Keith's. Confusing, I know.
Maritime Atlantic Storm India Pale Ale;Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maritime Beer Company, Inc. (Sapporo);"Very malty; has a distinct ""Canadian Lager"" taste to it. Somewhat bland in flavor. Labelled an India Pale Ale, but I was searching desperately for even the slightest hop flavor. Come to think of it, it didn't even really taste like an ale. Anyone would think this was a lager in a blind taste test."

Long Trail Ale;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Long Trail Brewery;This beer is always a great choice if you don't know what you feel like drinking. Very session-able however it has complex malt notes as well as a hoppy bitterness at the end. I highly recommend if you haven't tried this beer before. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Long Trail Ale;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Long Trail Brewery;I really like this Amber ale, the signature beer from Long Trail in Vermont.

Long Trail IPA;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;IPA;Long Trail Brewery;Amber, haze, thin head. On the palate it's got a fair bit of sweetness, but also that sort of old school piney C hop with a hit of brighter fruits towards the end. Well-made if unexciting.

Long Trail Pollenator;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Long Trail Brewery;"THOUGHTS: Not really my cup of tea. Generic but easy to drink Spring ale. Actually quite spring-like, whatever that means. Very flavorful for the low ABV. TECHNICAL: Drank 4/28/2013. Bottle. Poured a crystal, clear, light to medium gold with not much visible carbonation and a small, pretty much white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma had moderate cookie, grain, toasted malt and cake; moderate floral and perfumy hops; slight honey; and a little citrus. The initial flavor was lightly sweet, bitter and acidic; while the finish was slightly sweet and moderately bitter and acidic with an average duration. There was caramel, honey, citrus fruit, toast, grassy hops, citrus hops, cookies, floral and perfume hops. the light to medium body was slightly syrupy with lightly fizzy carbonation and an ever so slightly astringent finish."

Long Trail Pollenator;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Long Trail Brewery;Disjointed flavors of hops, honey and malt. All this makes a Golden bodied Ale that I do not have much desire to drink again.
Long Trail Pollenator;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Long Trail Brewery;"Bottle. Oh, come on guys, a name like this has to be used on a Doppelbock! Clean, lightly yeasty nose, golden ale straightaway. Deep transparent golden with a short white head. Fullish body, clean and basically flavorless; there’s a pleasantly bit of golden pale malt, hint of yeast, and light bitterness. Dry, and they’re getting a nice English subtlety out of the hops here. Crisp and easy-going, essentially flawless as these things go."
Long Trail Pollenator;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Long Trail Brewery;Very drinkable on a warm summer day. A bit sweet and slightly syrupy for my taste. The honey flavor is okay. It is not heavily carbonated and the appearance is very average.

Dark copper pour, off-white head, light lace. Slight boozy aroma, some sweet tea accents, a bit of nuttiness. Flavor has some caramel sweetness, a bit of bubble gum, some cola a touch of nuttiness. Thick enough mouthfeel.
Long Trail Double Bag;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Long Trail Brewery;Mild pineyness, munich malt, cooked sugar. Appearance golden with white foam. Taste is harsh, rough and indistinct, overworked malts. Flabby and lacking any kind of subtlety. Typical low intelligence wannabe brewer micro crap. Make one silly style, pump it out and forget about improving it.
Long Trail Double Bag;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Long Trail Brewery;I have rated this before and gave it a 3.6 rating, which I include below, likely because it wasn't fresh enough. I am now drinking a recently brewed and bottled 12-ouncer and am finding it to be quite tasty. The flavor profile I had noted previously is pretty much the same, although I'd amend the mouthfeel to be more oily than slick. The new overall rating here reflects my tasting of this bottle......and now here's the old review.....22-ounce bottle pours clear copper with the tiniest spritz of white head and lacing. Aroma: brown sugar, nuts, toffee. Flavor: caramel, nuts, plums, peaches. Mouthfeel: medium-bodied, slick.

Long Trail Double Bag;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Long Trail Brewery;From Aug 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a clear reddish-gold with a small head of foam that dissipated quickly leaving just a fine layer. The smell is pretty fruity to me with some citrus and there's some malt sweetness there as well. The taste is of biscuit malt up front, not sweet but certainly yummy , and as I enjoy *that*, it is quickly complimented by a nice hoppy bitterness...wow, and it finishes on the very dry side. There be Big flavours to be found here yet they work so well together that my bottom line for this Alt is that it's a real smooth drinker and one that I'd recommend without reservations. Thanks to Nutbrown for including this Alt in our trade!
Long Trail Double Bag;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Long Trail Brewery;12 oz bottle from VA in a Laughing Skull glass. Lovely copper body with great clarity but only a short head despite a aggressive pour. The head, nonetheless, has excellent retention. Mild aroma with obvious alcohol. Surprisingly full and complex flavor has hints of toffee, vanilla, honey, and brown sugar. Somme roasted nuts appear in the moderately bitter aftertaste. Smooth and full bodied feel where the high ABV is partly hidden.

Long Trail Tom OBriens Stout;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Stout;Long Trail Brewery;"Bottled, 2002. Pour/appearance: not as invigorating or unique as Guinness, certainly, but not bad; head is thick but diminishes fairly quickly. Aroma: very chocolaty-sweet, but rather weak and lacking in complexity. Flavor pretty dry and lacking in maltiness; hop bitterness at the end is pleasant & reasonable but not enough to give this a great rating. Average for this brewery I suppose, which has to mean: not recommmended."
Long Trail Tom OBriens Stout;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Stout;Long Trail Brewery;This beer is very light for a stout(the color is almost dark red when held up to the light), it has a nice aroma and very distinct flavor.

Long Trail Hibernator;Bridgewater Corners, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Long Trail Brewery;6-pack for my 2019 Easter Vermont weekend. Pours a clean amber colour with a big frothy light-beige head with good retention and full of creamy lacing waving around. Aromas are a nice blend of spicy rye grains, caramel malts and hints molasses, alcohol. The taste shows the caramel and again, light molasses to balance out the sweetness. The other thing that helps out is the dryness that builds in the finish. Like it says - a rich, robust winter beer for 6% ABV.

Das Bier ist ein klassisches Strandbier, das man am besten stark gekühlt trinkt. Es erinnert an das Heineken, zu dessen Konzern es auch gehört. Es dominiert der leichte hopfige Geschmack, der es weniger vollmundig, aber dafür sehr erfrischend macht. Ein Bier, das Lust auf Urlaub und sonniges Wetter macht.

Stella Lager;Giza, Egypt;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al Ahram (Heineken);Can, best before June 2019, shared by Stacey on 11/17/18. Clear, bright, fizzy golden with a white head that recedes quickly to nothing. Mineral water with maybe a touch of grass or herb from some hops? Not quite sure. Light honey-like malt character and pretty clean with a peppery finish. In the mouth it's fizzy, light, watery and filled with mostly mineral water and cracker notes. But it doesn't show the wax or DMS of the Sakara Gold. Actually not too bad, but for a bit too much sugar on the finish. Otherwise, not much to see here.
Stella Lager;Giza, Egypt;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al Ahram (Heineken);16 oz. can. Crystal clear gold. Malty aroma, grainy, honey. Light grain and yeast. Light body, oily texture with lively carbonation level. Not bad at all but not much flavor

Carib Lager;Champs-Fleurs, Trinidad & Tobago;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carib Brewery;Very refreshing. Easy drinking. Nothing harsh or off putting. Very smooth and enjoyable Caribbean style lager. Would definitely get it again. Cheers.
Carib Lager;Champs-Fleurs, Trinidad & Tobago;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carib Brewery;I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say this is one of the two or three best beers you find in the Caribbean. Essentially it’s similar to Corona in terms of it being a skunk macro lager in a clear bottle which is a real shame because it looks very much like piss. If you can get past that this is a very good beer to bring to the beach in the West Indies where they have it in the regular 330mm bottles. The best part is you can get yourself a 6pack of these for around 4 euros and crush them all while on the beach. Have encountered these in Anguilla and SXM but also in Belize where it comes in those comically small bottles about the size of my finger. Not better than Belikin however.
Carib Lager;Champs-Fleurs, Trinidad & Tobago;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carib Brewery;Can in a trade with tfontana. Thanks Tom. Crystal clear gold. Aroma is light toasted grain, corn husks. Flavor has a touch more malt sweetness then the standard pale lager. Not overly sweet yet... as I drink all I taste is corn. Not good.
Carib Lager;Champs-Fleurs, Trinidad & Tobago;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carib Brewery;"Bottle pour into nonic pint glass from Total Wine & More, Burlington. Appearance is lightly hazy, pale golden yellow with trace sparkle, finger-width white foamy head with poor retention and trace lacing. Aroma is mildly roasted malts, bordering on chocolate but not quite. Taste is biscuity malts with mild fruity bent and hint of cardboard. Mouthfeel is light side of light-to-medium bodied with thin, smooth texture, soft carbonation and exclusively malty finish. Overall, many ""third world"" pale lagers are all the same but this rises slightly above with a malty character that is a bit more rich. When in Trinidad and Tobago, do as the Trinidad and Tobagans do!"
Lion Lager (Sri Lanka);Biyagama, Sri Lanka;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery (Sri Lanka);I have tried many beers from Europe and Asia but this particular beer stands out for me.

Allagash Dubbel Reserve;Portland, Maine, United States;Dubbel;Allagash Brewing Company;One of the nice parts of traveling out of town is getting to locate brews not available at home. A trip this summer to Chicago to watch the Cubs put up the W flag included a visit to a seedy liquor store that, inexplicably, had a couple of bottles of Allagash Dubbel on the shelf. I purchased one (bottled on 7/1/15), brought it home and am now opening for a taste on a cool, autumn, Friday evening. I pull the cork out of the 750 ml bottle and pour aggressively into my Buffalo Bayou snifter. I find a tall, sepia colored, finely bubbled head on top of a mahogany brown-amber body. I give it a smell, yeast, yellow raisin and biscuit. But it is a tasting after all. I take a drink and taste and find, oh my, caramel, toast, berry, malt, yellow fruit and something earthy. All of it quite subtle, easy drinking. There is some nice lacing as I take it down. I understand Dubbel is no longer available. Shame.
Allagash Dubbel Reserve;Portland, Maine, United States;Dubbel;Allagash Brewing Company;Bottle purchased from Whole Foods in San Carlos in May 2017. Bottling date of 04/19/16.

Allagash Dubbel Reserve;Portland, Maine, United States;Dubbel;Allagash Brewing Company;Allagash did a great job with this Dubbel. A wonderful malty flavor.

Allagash Dubbel Reserve;Portland, Maine, United States;Dubbel;Allagash Brewing Company;2016/11/30 - Pours a hazy amber brown colour with a thin off white head that quickly reduces and leaves moderate lacing.

Stella Export;Giza, Egypt;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al Ahram (Heineken);Frisse pils, een van de weinige alcoholische versnaperingen in Egypte. Mooie fles, maar eigenlijk stelt het niet zo veel voor. Toch best fijn voor als je met je natte ballen in het hotelzwembad ligt te dobberen.
Stella Export;Giza, Egypt;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al Ahram (Heineken);Works fine as a thirst quencher in the hot desert climate. A little sour and weak hop flavor.
Stella Export;Giza, Egypt;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al Ahram (Heineken);Im Mittelteil ist dieses Bier leicht hopfig herb, der Nachgeschmack ist weniger herb und wässrig. Geht runter wie Wasser. Ganz in Ordnung, kann mich über dieses Bier nicht beklagen, vielleicht ein wenig zu durchschnittlich. Beim Export meine ich ein wenig mehr Aroma und einen etwas intensiveren Nachgeschmack festmachen zu können. Test vom 8.1.2005, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 7,9,12,8,9,9 - 9,10
Stella Export;Giza, Egypt;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al Ahram (Heineken);"50 cl bottle from a Cruise in the Nile. It pours a clear yellowy-light golden liquid with medium bubbly white head. The aroma is very light; basically hoppy, with a far hint of malt. It smells artificial. About the flavour, very similar: some citron hint, maltier than the aroma, but still artificial. Fizzy carbonation and smooth watery feeling. Refreshing beer, ending slightly bitter. It is unusual to have the chance to choose between different beers in Egypt, but if you pick this one you’ll have a somewhat decent beer. But do not expect much. Regular european commercial lagers are much better, and we tend to underrate them. I suppose this one is a little overrated owing to the fact that you can only choose between Stella or specially awful non-alcoholics. Decent presentation (bottle and crown cap)."
Stella Export;Giza, Egypt;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al Ahram (Heineken);Lemony gold brew with a largy white rocky head, some spotty lacing and ok retention for the first half of the glass. It has some skunk to it but nothing offending while remaining fresh overall. Lemons and yeast are prominent with some malts in the background. Tastes pretty good! I was totally suprised. Decent tasty malts that are somewhat subdued, decent fruity undertones and a solid bitterness. Well balanced. Light bodied with a nice creamy enjoyable swish and right at the end , there isn’t much, but a sharp hard bitterness rises up. Leaves the mouth slightly dry.
Stella Export;Giza, Egypt;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al Ahram (Heineken);Not much better than the domestic Stella. Slightly more body, slightly better hops finish. Emphasis on the slightly.
Great Basin Nevada Gold;Sparks, Nevada, United States;Cream Ale;Great Basin Brewing Company;Draft at Great Basin, Reno. Pours a golden color with a small white head. Actually looks about the same as the Icky IPA. Mild aroma of grass and grains. Light flavors of grassy and floral hops with some cereal grains.

Great Basin Nevada Gold;Sparks, Nevada, United States;Cream Ale;Great Basin Brewing Company;"Always nice to try a style that’s fairly difficult to find either on tap on in bottles. By the time I was getting into this beer, I was getting into my grilled mushroom quesadilla and this beer went really well with the earthy mushrooms and the creamy cheese. The body of the beer was a pale gold, crystal clear with a creamy 1"" off-white head. A pretty simple, straight-forward aroma of yeast, light pit fruits....a touch of maltiness.

Great Basin Ichthyosaur IPA;Sparks, Nevada, United States;IPA;Great Basin Brewing Company;"The Icky pours a crystal clear caramel in hue, the aroma giving off notes of clover honey and hints of over ripe tangerines, musky and deep. A soft, off-white foam drapes the inside of glass as I sip down; and slowly tipping the glass allows me to enjoy a sweet-ish forward that smoothly drops into a shallow valley of light bitterness. Sticky Icky...certainly another nice, solid brew from Great Basin."

Aroma hints at something better but the chile overpowers the cerveza; the mix is visual and sensory mud, very bitter and too sharp with chile gusto. And at that, the mix leaves no distinct palate-pleasing note. Avoid. (In fact we’d like our money back on our first bottle from Costo, please.) ""1"" ratings for taste, palate, or overall were forced by the form scripts; zero not an option unfortunately."

Still inconsistent on tap, though."
Great Basin Cerveza Chilebeso;Sparks, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Basin Brewing Company;Apparantly this has quite the reputation around these parts, but like all chile beers, I just don’t know why.

Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;"Der Typ ""Indian Brown Ale"" ist schon einmal etwas neues. Es soll auf die Vielseitigkeit des Bieres hingewisen werden und dass von einem Brown Ale und IPA Aromen vorhanden sind. Es dominieren aber natürlich die malzigen Aromen und schaffen eine röstmalzige, karamelliges Basis, welche mit einzielnen Hopfenspitzen gewürzt ist. Ein interessantes, untypisches Bier, das mich aber nicht vollends überzeugen konnte."

Big flavor of coffee, bitter dark chocolate malt, oats, and bread. Rich mouthfeel, lingering aftertaste, very delicious! Amazing palate.

Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Sorry FrostyCoban , I totally disagree with you , I think IT taste like piss. Greetings from Rotterdam
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);This lovely trampjuice, in a atomic bottle is one of the greatest drinks i ever had in my life.To create this kind of joy they probably get the apples from the best apple trees in the world. When you open this artistic bottle and smell it, it gives you that feeling that you are standing somewhere with a beautiful landscape. Drinking of this gives you also such a relaxed feeling in your head, you forget all your problems. I wouldn’t recommend this drink with a steak but more with a takeaway or ready meals. Unfortunately in my country they don’t sell this atomic bottle of pure gold, at least my uncle Riol is a frosty jacks smuggler and brings me a bottle from now and then.
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Smells like cows shit, taste like rotten apple, dont recomend to drink this cider. This is for poorpos and homeless people on benefits :D
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Sweet flavours from the orchard whence the apple was picked, light head with minimal aromas. I heard the golden apples picked for this fine cider came from the garden of Eden and are more succulent than the milk from eves bosom. 10/10 would recommend with a dabble of unsweetened vimto squash.
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Sykes what an utterly boring and horrible cider. Kitchen sink! Unable to end this one. Skunky aroma. Waterish and a very low acidity. Very mild apple. More chemical. Not at all recommendable. [Can from Spar at Manchester Airport Terminal 3, England]
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Add a little neat squash and you've basically got a cheap alcopop with more units than a bottle of vodka. Not one for beer snobs, needs some guts.
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);I tend to drink this for breakfast particularly on weekdays when i have no company. However gets me through the day (low rating cos blackouts)
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);500 ml can @home,bb 05/2018. Pale green,clear. Aroma... alcohol,aspects of vomited white wine,drain cleaner. Taste... first just plain liquid,then something akin to sour apple and chemical astringency. Yuck.
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Plastic bottle from Today’s Local, Reading. Light gold colour with no head. Big spoiled cheap white wine, massive sulphites - strongest sulphite smell I've ever experienced in a cider - honestly smells like someone farted in the bottle, big artificial sweeteners, big synthetic syrupy green apple with sulphites, light rotten apple, vomit, vomited white wine, light toilet cleaner, light washing up liquid, light plastic, light glue, light rubber, light rotten eggs, chemical, light chlorine, light urine, light metallic, watery cough syrup. Really bad.
Frosty Jacks;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Scary looking silvery gold with a fizz of head gone in seconds. Harsh rubbery high alcohol aroma with vomited white wine aspects. Sherbet and vomit with chalk, sweetener bitterness and icing sugar. Plum palinka splashes. Nasty but I saw it through.
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Can at home, 21/06/16. Clear golden with a decent white cap. Nose is apple pulp, light wood, straw. Taste comprises apple skin, sweet lucks but not overly so, hint of tarte orchard fruit. Medium bodied, prickly carbonation, dry close. Not too bad for a cheap supermarket number I guess.
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Info at McTapps. Quite cheap cider with some apples but mainly lemons in aroma and taste. Sourish, to much carbo, tough to finish. The next two cans from the four bought will be a tough matchup.
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Four pack cans bought at local Tesco in Eastbourne. Pours out in a clear light yellow-golden colour with medium to thin body. Aroma of dry apples and acid. Taste of unripe green apples, leaves and fields. Sour-acid and thin finish. Lacks some body and taste - not my kind of cider to enjoy.
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Can, from Tesco (as Tesco Original Dry Cider). Pale yellow, quick shortlived fizzle of head and good condition. Muted apple skin and a faint ester note in the nose, quite dry and apple tart in the mouth with a low suggestion of saccharin. Finish is brief and slightly tart with a vague woodiness.
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Can. Tesco. Yellow. No head. Aroma: synthetic apple. Flavour: dry, synthetic apple. Jaysus. Should be called ’Apple flavoured alcoholic drink’
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Can from Tesco. Yellow cider with an aroma of apple juice. Taste is dry and slightly sour apple sauce and apple juice. Lots of carbonation. Just about drinkable.
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);A truly awful thing to do to an apple. Too little acid to use as a cleaning solution. Too much phenylalanine to use as fruit fly bait. I can think of no gastronomic or industrial use for this liquid.
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);500 ml can. Clear light yellow colour. Aroma of sweetish light apple with some weird citrus-like notes. Flavour of mild sour apples, acidity and artificial sweetness. Easy to drink.
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);"Can @ home Dear god in heaven. What an unpleasant drink, and a horrible blight upon the noble name of cider. Pours a typical, perhaps somewhat weak, cider pale gold with no head. The aroma is unfortunate, consisting of an artificial and sweet apple flavour. The flavour is even worse, unpleasant and with a lingering salty taste; completely artificial as well. To make matters even worse it contains sweeteners; what the devil? A despicable waste of money, avoid this rubbish - I implore you."
Hereford Orchard Farmhouse Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);500ml can. Pours fairly dark for a cider, but still a relatively light clear gold. The aroma is metallic and alcoholic, with nothing good going on. The flavour is totally uninspiring. It is mostly just tart, artificial apple. The finish is bizarely salty, and utterly unappealing. Just to illustrate how poor this is, it has added phenylalanine, for God’s sake! Awful stuff.
Aston Manor Amber Harvest Strong Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);"A quite exquisite drink. As soon as you get past the first few mouthfuls, you won’t want to stop; you’ll be able to imagine one’s self sat in an orchard of viridescence"
Aston Manor Amber Harvest Strong Dry Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Bottle from my local tramp shop. Clear very pale yellow, fizzy white head that faded to nowt. Aroma of stewed apples, sherbert. Flavour is sharp apples. It’s cheap, not so great but better than some of the other tramp juice.
Aston Manor Extra Strength White Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);Happy to be the first review on this white cider! I like it just fine but it does NOT come in the extra large cans!!! Just be aware you’re not getting the usual 13.5% free with THIS cider. Other than that this cider get me rather pissed. Not a loaded with chemicals not stinking meat scent...but Ill drink it!
Polaris Extra Strong Iced White Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);I am tempted to agree with CiderTramp on this one and get 8 other people to rate it 5 therefore making this the best thing on the site, however i recon id get kicked in the teeth for doing it haha! Pours completly transparent no colour whatsoever, looks like soda water. Taste and swell are horrible chemical over carbonated rubbish. Was a good idea at the start though.
Polaris Extra Strong Iced White Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);[bottle from haddows] This was hilariously awful. it barely even managed to smell of fake apples, tastes of sugar and very weak diluting apple juice. They didn’t even have the cheek to dye it green, its completely clear, haha! 99p per litre, yum yum.
Polaris Extra Strong Iced White Cider;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Apple Cider;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);"I love drinking any White Cider, and lots of it!! But this Polaris is GREAT!! It smells like spoiled meat...Some say it can give a nasty hangover but I just start drinking more the second I awaken. It’s good and cheap too, looting a few parked cars provides enough to get a few cans and I’m ready to go! ""Extra Stong White Cider"" is all I will drink and THIS has all the chemical goodness I look for!! Buy it by the bootload!"

Delicate hoppy aromas mingled with malt. Hop flavours along with caramel, toffee and malt and an oily finish that at the same time manages to be dry but slightly overcarbonated
Aston Manor Balti Beer;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);For tasting purposes I had this with a curry. Quite noble of me. Floral hops compete with a curry cutting sourness. Good with a balti, but I have doubts about whether it can stand on its own.
Aston Manor Balti Beer;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);A light ale with pleasantly bitter hoppiness. Really good accompaniment to spicy dishes (I had this with vindaloo).

Wyre Piddle Piddle in the Hole (Bottle);Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;500ml bottle at home. Dark amber ale with little head. Aroma is a bit rotten. Malt taste with quite a bitter aftertaste. Refreshing but not the best. May go well with crisps or nuts.
Wyre Piddle Piddle in the Hole (Bottle);Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;Bottle.Not fond of this, Has a weird aftertaste that really lingers in the nasal area.

Brewzzi Boca Blonde Ale;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft 2/9/11 (Brewzzi PBI)-Pours a clear golden. Aroma of malt and hops. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is another basic blonde.
Brewzzi Boca Blonde Ale;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Tap. Just another light blah beer to cater to the masses. Fortunately those masses have been acquiring a sense of taste and will be able to support better local brewpubs, and let this one remain exactly what it is. Tasteless beer production to go with so-so food.

Brewzzi Boca Blonde Ale;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft. Golden colored and served with a thick head that sheds some thick lacing. There’s not a lot too this but as far as basic Blonde Ale’s go I thought it was pretty solid. Certainly refreshing with no foul flavors. Light-bodied but not watery and somewhat creamy on the palate. Sweet bread, grain, straw, and light grassy hop finish for some balance. You know... Limited for sure but enjoyable enough to drink on a hot day.

Brewzzi Red Reef Red Ale;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewzzi Microbrewery;The best beer I tried while visiting, but that’s not saying much.

Bullfrog India Pale Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bullfrog Brewery;I should preface this by saying that I am quite a hophead. According to the bartender the hop profile of this one had been changed for this batch so the commercial description may no longer be accurate. This beer is a hop lovers dream. Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a hazy caramel color with a small white head. The aroma is a stron g assault of floral and fruity hops. The flavor is also massively strong with fruity and floral hops with a sweet rich malty undertone. I was really impressed with this one and look forward to having it again.

Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Draught. This was really disappointing. I found this to be one of the worst heffe’s I have tried.
Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);"Slightly hazy golden coloured body with a very thin white head. Aroma of yeast, wheat and citrus - not half bad at all. Medium-bodied; Effervescent feeling up front with some yeast and wheat most noticeable. Curacao and some light fresh flavours up front, fading to a mild malt. Aftertaste shows some sweetness, but mostly mild, run of the mill flavours. Overall, a decent wheat, nothing too special, but worth trying. I sampled this 12 ounce bottle purchased at Trader Joe’s in Tyson’s Corner (Falls Church), Virginia on 04-November-2007."
Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Rating this one as the Bavarian Hefe that is on the label. Pours golden yellow with medium white head. Cinnamon, yeast, musty wheat aroma. A little honey wheat taste, finishes dry and uninspiring.

Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Deep gold, mostly clear. Nose vaguely wheaty and honey-sweet, no real hefe character. Flavor is sweet and malty, mild yeastiness. Finish has some harshness, not that pleasant. Eh.
Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Like Mikeben’s rating, my bottle also just says Wheat Beer on it but it’s not a hefeweizen - more like a hybrid brew that’s part american wheat beer. Pours a clear golden, like a pilsner, not cloudy like I was expecting. Doesn’t have any of the hefe characteristics like banana or clove.Aroma is lightly malty - not much there. Taste is nice and malty with a good dose of hops, citrus and grain. Good sweetness, not much bitterness at all. Mouthfeel is full, round and very nice on the palate. Overall, nice taste and texture.
Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);"What’s with the high ratings on this one, did I miss something? Suspiciously clear for a hefeweizen; golden orange, medium white head. Aroma of mildew and wheat, honey. More of the same in the flavor, thin-med body, wheat comes out in the finish. Not offensive, just lacking in the wheat; more of an ale/ American wheat mix, not a hefeweizen."
Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Color is a deep golden-yellow with a few hues of brassy orange. Head is bone white and medium thick.Smells of banana, wheat malt, clove, German hops, and a somewhat rough skunkiness. Taste is bright and fresh with banana, clove, other sweet fruit and citrus flavors. Delicious wheat and banana flavor. I am very impressed with Sea Dog, given my past 3 tastings.
Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Medium gold, mostly clear, good head and lacing. This has a lot of lemon tang and yeastyness to it. I thought that this was just an average wheat, but it did have a nice pepper spice at the finish.
Sea Dog Hefeweizen;Topsham, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);My bottle says Wheat beer. It is a nice wheat, more American in style then german due to a slightly hoppy undertone. Coloring is done right, smells good. Maybe not the very best I ever had but I love this style and this one ranks up there. Taking out a few hops would improve it. Flavvor is good though and it has the thickness missing from lesser wheat brews.
Sea Dog Toasty Nut Porter;Topsham, Maine, United States;Porter;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Aroma of hazelnut, butterscotch, caramel and toffee. Like a schnap shot more than a beer. Near black in appearance, very still. Taste is almost overly sweet, and that strange caramel-dirt funk that gets all the Shipyard stuff is here too. Comes off as flavor-added rather than malt derived. Smooth but kind of cloying.

Sea Dog Toasty Nut Porter;Topsham, Maine, United States;Porter;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Pours burnt dark brown with a huge tan head that last a long while. Aroma is nutty, sweet, toasty, roasty, butterscotch, and hazelnut syrup flavored coffee. Roast malt, buttered toast, HAZELNUT (I love hazelnut, but WOW...way too strong, it tastes like someone took an average dry stout, a porter, and hazelnut syrup and mixed them equally, very artificial). Enough spicy, and bitter hops to balance a portion of the flavor but it remains oddly sweet and too nutty. Body is thin and over carbonated for a porter.

Tetleys Smoothflow / Extra Cold (Keg);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Keg at Lakeside, Crosby as ’Tetleys Extra Cold’. Shared kindly by someone else. Dark amber brown, hazy with a dense creamy head. Aroma is muted malt sugars, quite airy and plain. Body is smooth with tingly carbonation. Taste is pretty watery, sugars, insipid and washed out with a lightly drying finish. Impressively watery vibe, helped, no doubt, by the extra chilling. Not good at all.
Barrington Mohican Amber Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt amber color with a fair cap of a little white head. Dies off at a mild pace leaving some light speckled lace. The aroma had some nutty, caramel and toffee malts playing with some grassy sweet hops. Light earthiness, and a tad of herbal qualities to it. The flavor combines the malts with the the hops gently. Leaves a bready caramel malty aftertaste. Quick malty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. ABV seemed appropriate. Overall, amber ale with a British ale yeast? I’m left scratching my beard but I do know Barrington likes their British ale yeasts, I wouldn’t put it past them. Perhaps again.
Barrington Mohican Amber Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;All malt aroma - sweet, tangy. Medium, cloudy brown, fair head which fades rapidly. Tangy, woody, moderately astringent, not as sweet as it smells, seedy/slightly herbal, a little metallic, moderately hoppy. Finish has a tongue-curling astringency over a wild sloe fruitiness, medium bodied.
Barrington Mohican Amber Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;aroma is wet malt and a bit of sweet fruit. the beer is balanced with light hopping and a bit a nut and yeast sweetness. a little strange and not enough carbonation.

Barrington Hopland Pale Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Cask at the brewery, 6/27/15 A very wonderfully bright cask that must have been no more than 16-20 hours old with plentiful carbonation and head and a clear, copper color. Leafy, dry, earthy hops give way to a touch of light citrus and a hint of fresh herbs. Dry, well-attenuated pale malts add structure without any honey, dough or that like, while light yeast esters and mineral water character sits on the finish. Dry and watery, with plentiful leafy, fresh, spicy and floral hop character. I love the lack of any crystal malt or resinous hops here and the texture and carbonation are spot-on for a cask. Strange that a lot of their other beers were on the sweeter side yet this one was fully attenuated and nicely bitter without being overdone. Very drinkable, if perhaps a bit forgettable. Would order this again immediately if I were there again.
Barrington Hopland Pale Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;On tap at Barrington. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking pale to hazy burnt orange color with a slight transparency running about it. A film of light white head glazes over the top of the beer. The smell had some pale English malts. The taste copied and carried into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation comes across fairly smooth and assists in leaving a fairly simple creamy coating over my tongue. Overall, the more I think about it, I’d say this was more of an English Pale Ale than an American one. I’d probably still would have again.
Barrington Hopland Pale Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Cask at the brewpub - Great Barrington. Pours clear, bright good with a fine, creamy white head. A bit of orange citrus in the nose, light floral and piney notes. Light to medium sweet flavor with mild pine bitterness, lightly toasted bread, dried grains. Light bodied with fine carbonation. Decent bakance to finish, some dry bread, hints of caramel, pine, ripening orange. Alright.
Barrington Hopland Pale Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. It poured medium amber to olive in color with a thin white head and busy carbonation. Pretty straight forward aroma of biscuit malts And faint clean hops around the back. Light to medium body. The flavor had a sweet maltiness at the start with a low to moderate bitterness at the end. Pretty basic overall but it did get better as it warmed.
Barrington Hopland Pale Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Part of a sampler at the brewery.

Barrington Brown Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;"Notched on the side, this one reads ""June."" I was told that’s a best by date. This was poured into a mug. The appearance was a dark brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Light messy lacing roamed around the glass. The smell had a superb blend of rich nutty malts with a light roasty smooth chocolate and ample coffee roaming in and out. The taste copied the aroma nicely to work over a gentle sweet rolling and roasty smooth, slightly smokey and light amount of cocoa. A lingering roasty smooth coffee/cocoa aftertaste leads to a balanced dry to wet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a really nice sessionability to it. The carbonation rolled over nicely with a delicate sharpness. Overall, this was a really nice English Brown ale, definitely again."
Barrington Brown Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Tried on tap. I enjoyed the mahogany brown and dark colored amber richness. The aroma is somewhat well incorporated. I get dark malts when I am preparing to feed the gulls. I wonder if it will be enough. Earlier Rating: 7/28/2013 Total Score: 3.3 On tap at the brewpub. The pour is mahogany brown to darker amber. The nose has a variety of niceties going on. Dark malts, molasses, nutty, molasses, and basically sweet. The body is medium in texture but boy did I enjoy the smooth undertone. The taste is also sweet and nutty at first with a good lingering bitterness at the end. This is one of their standard brews that they bottle and sell locally in Western, Mass (USA).
Barrington Brown Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;22oz bottles from the brewery. Pours mahogony brown with an off white head.

Barrington Brown Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle shared with Sander at his place, NYC. Pours clear brown with a modest, tan foam head. Aroma has some ashy, lightly toasted malts just tinged with sourness. The flavor, though, is quite sour, and I can’t imagine it’s intentional. Some light toast and cocoa, but mostly sour malts. Light bodied with average carbonation. Sour finish, faint dry roast and leaves, some tart fruit hints. Hard to enjoy this. (January 2012, score 2.6) Bottle shared with Chris in NYC. This is more like it. Nicely rounded, bready, with toasted biscuits, impressions of cocoa. Good and drinkable. (February 2016, score: 3.6)

Berskhire Mountain Black Bear Stout;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;This was served in a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a black color with a slim bar pour’s kind of white to off white foamy head that quickly dissipated leaving some light clingy lacing. The smell had a graceful blend of roasted coffee notes with a rich sweet chocolate. The taste came across through the roasty notes. A slight roasty aftertaste leads to the same finish.

Overall, this was my favorite beer from this brewery. Definitely have again.
Berskhire Mountain Black Bear Stout;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;A nice sweet stout with good drinkability and roasted character. Aroma is slight, pours black, it’s what you would expect from a stout. Well done.

Berskhire Mountain Black Bear Stout;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;I poured a 22oz bottle into a tulip pint glass. Its best before date was notched at August 2013. It cost $4 ($0.18 per ounce). Appearance: Opaque dark black with no highlights. Forms a large, dark tan, frothy head which laces and retains well. Smell: Plenty of roasted barley, hints of vanilla and milk chocolate. Taste: I’m so used to drinking large, imperial stouts I sometimes forget what can be done with smaller versions like Berkshire Mountain Brewers Black Bear Stout. This is a by-the-book brew in the sweet stout style. It has everything you expect and nothing you don’t. So, yes, it’s good, but it’s been done. Light, sweet maltiness at the beginning of the palette. Slight milk chocolate flavors with perhaps a dairy flavor often found in stouts brewed with lactose sugar (not sure if this one is or not). Slight tanginess through the middle with hardly any bitterness, finishing with a short, but noticeable, burst of roasted malt or coffee-like bitterness. It fades away almost completely clean and rather quickly, making this a beer that’s satisfying, but a bit too fast for its own good. Not quite robust enough to be a dessert beer, it’s a stout for the sake of drinking stout. I can live with that. Drinkability: I had considered rating Berkshire Mountain Brewers Black Bear Stout a little lower because of the mild palette, but then I realized its drinkability is quite impressive. The mouthfeel is quite thin, but then again it’s a deliberately lighter bodied beer. It’s soft and smooth across the tongue and glides down the gullet with ease. At 4.9% ABV it’s perhaps a bit too big to be defined as a session beer, though drinking it in large quantities should not be a burden on anyone.

Berskhire Mountain Black Bear Stout;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle at Sander’s pace, NYC. Breakfast beer. Pours black with a small, rich beige head. Aroma is subtle roast and big milk chocolate. A good lacto presence here. Flavor REALLY doesn’t follow as I had expected. It is only faintly sweet, with a modest roastiness and mellow cocoa. Light to medium in body with average carbonation. The roasted malts in the finish are more pronounced, with notes of tobacco and ash, light burnt earth, and mild grassy bitterness. Easy to drink, just not very characterful. Aside from the aroma, this beer reminded me of a mild.
Carlsberg Elephant Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);From old tasting notes. Bright Amber red color. Rocky beige head. Faint fruity malt nose.

Tiger Beer;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Review: 500ml bottle of Tiger Beer: 4.8% vol. Can find it as 5% vol. in other regions of the world. Comes in a bottle, can or from the tap. Popular in Asia especially as it is the perfect beer to have as the sun goes down. Unlike a lot of other Asian beers, Tiger actually use quality ingredients from Australia and Europe. No shitty rice beers here! Love the famous iconic branding, the famous tiger logo and nice big colourful lettering, the blue, orange and gold. Stands out for sure. On the bottle we get ""World acclaimed Asian lager”, born in Singapore and this is an “award winning full bodied beer”.  On the pour I am getting a nice clear golden coloured beer with a white head that is a little on the small side. Some slight carbonation. Ok on the looks.  The aroma is not great, very light, an ok lagery smell, all malty and grainy on the nose but too light and a little too much corn and very sweet. The taste is easy enough to appreciate, was very soft on the tongue, nice and crisp. Nice frothy mouthfuls initially, and also getting some corn in the taste. Tasted like a regular lager, no real complaints there. Perhaps a little creamy off taste but generally it was ok. Getting the malts and grains, and the fruits, with the hops on the low level. To be frank I was a little disappointed as the overall taste was ok but nothing too exciting, a bit bland in fact, nothing to set it apart from the millions of lagers out there. Disappointed as I have had this beer many a time when I was in Asia. In fact it was my most favourite beer that side of the world, lovely from the taps. I just guess it doesn't travel well, and not so exciting in a bottle thousands of miles away from home. Perfect for the hot humid Asian cityscape, not so when its piddling down in bog town Ireland! Overall it was light, smooth and drinkable but with no kick or standout features. Boring."

Tiger Beer;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Not bad, but mainly because you need a refreshing drink during the hot and humid days in Southeast Asia. As soon as you start thinking about what you are drinking while having a Tiger, it is just nothing more than a watery, malty and corn-like lager. Well... It quenched my thirst in Singapore though.

Icehouse Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Cut and paste all these mass produced beers would have a hard time telling any of them apart

Icehouse Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12 oz can pours golden with a white head. Aroma and taste is grains and malts.
Icehouse Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Reviewed from notes. Most of the time this was drank out of the can, (after hockey games/locker room).Once, I stole one to take home for observation. Here’s the rest. The appearance was a clear yellow color with a fast rising carbonation that looked like it was trying to escape the glass. No head. The smell was just a scaled down version of ice house. The taste was the same as the nose. The palate was light and watery. Overall, dumbed down ice house. I’ll take ice house heavy before having this again.
Icehouse Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz can (old notes)-Pours a clear golden with a white head. Aroma of corn and grains. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew was not bad as I had other light lagers that were much worse.
Icehouse Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It looks good in the glass but such a light non existing taste with no after taste. I guess if there was no clean water to drink this would be a good subsitute.
Icehouse Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Reminds of the first time I stopped at a green light and threw up. Mildly disappointed in the overall vomit though. Would have appreciated not having to taste this awful creation again!
Icehouse Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Icehouse isn’t bad enough, they had to make this? watery but with a ton of alcohol, not a fan
Icehouse Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Yes! Nasty Icehouse in a light version! I can gain less weight while I get drunk! Oh wait, it’s ""light"" because it has less alcohol. OK, I can drink more of this to get the same level of drunk as Icehouse!"
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Probably the best offering by this thankfully out-of-business brewery, which is like saying having your arms amputated without anasthesia is better than gouging your eyes out with a pencil. Absolutely flat, very little hops, and the malt is nowhere to be found. The only redeeming quality this beer has is a weird sweet/tart aftertaste.
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Poured light amber with thin white head...smells like ballsweat...taste is sour and metallic with a hint of rotted pine cone...I feel bad saying it, but THANK GOD these guys went out of business!
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;At the GHBF: Hazed copper hue with small white head and little lace. The aroma has notes of pine, bready malts, grapes, and is soapy. The taste is fruity and tart with a bitter finish, becomes bland and one-diminsional. Less than your average brew, nothing to seek out. Needs a bit more malt backbone, really a bit more of anything good.
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Dry saazy hop nose...IPA??? Thin malts are grainy, fruity as it warms, strange flatness in flavor. Sourness once it reaches room temp is awful.
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Smells like new gym shoes. Kinda freaky actually. Overall, this sucked. Sucking on something that ran over the cracks in my driveway.
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;sour grapevine aroma. horrid, horrid bitter vinegar flavor. damn this is sour and unpleasant. i hope this is a bad bottle and not the intended result.
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. No, no ,no. Goddamnit, no. This is awful. This is nothing short of vinegar. No hops. No malt. Just vinegar. Great Grains may be the worst brewery in Texas, and that speaks in volumes because Texas is full of shit brewries. I would rather be assulted in prison than drink this piss again.
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;(Bottle) I had to raise the appearance up a point for the great bio of Texan legend Belle Starr. Pours a amber-orange color with a small white head. Light floral hops and citrus aroma. Kind of a bland IPA. Not very hoppy...
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;I feel really weird slamming all these as once they were okay. Never great. perhaps, but this one I thought was a generally okay beer. Not my idea of an IPA the way I've come to know American ones, but a maltier one with good body and a fair bitterness. Now ...?????
Yellow Rose Cactus Queen India Pale Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;IPA;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;This is not an IPA in my subtle opinion. Has a bit of funky aroma - reminds me of mixture of rotten vegetables and cheap bourbon. Flavor carries over in the same fashion but when smacking your lips turns to sweet ripened fruit. Cloudy, nectar like appearance with a slight head. Very odd concoction, but palatable and I am always open to new tastes.
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"This beer has all the flavor of a bag of excretement after a colostomy. And it’ll get you drunk if you drink enough of it. But why the hell would you subject yourself to such torture? This puts the ""putrid"" in putrid. Rotten caramel and half-assed hops that ride the short bus."
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;I’m doing a tour through the great extinct beers of Texas.... Here’s an example that is nut-brown with reddish hues and a short lasting beige head, an aroma that is slightly hollow other than a general light caramel and window unit air conditioner whiff, and a flavor that is moderately sweet with raspberry flavoring notes. It tingles on the tongue despite not having quite the same volume of carbonation as is often found in the Great Grains beers. Watery finish, lingering caramel and nut flavors. A beer to prove that natural selection occurs not only in animal extinctions but in commercial markets as well, as economic theory predicts.
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Pour is brown with not much head...smell is a little coffee and a little malty...taste is thin and sweet with caramel and a little coffee aftertaste...is this the same beer as their Vigilante Porter that they just poured some water in?
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;This beer is pretty good considering it came from the same brewery that bottles fermented ballsweat like Texas Tornado and Blackhorse. Medium sized head which dissipated quickly leaving a beer that looked like coca cola. Super sweet malt aroma with some coffee and notes os spearmint...aroma was pretty nice actually. Flavor came in a quick burst, slick and cold on the tongue. Coffee and caramel in the finish, didnt linger too long. In typical great grains fashion, it was too carbonated, though I must say that this is one of the better beers from these guys.
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Interesting brew -- it's got a little Verhaeghe Duchesse De Bourgogne -thing going on. Fresh Concord grapes, vinegar and stewed cherries in the aroma. Sour, like a kriek or lambic. Pucker up bay-bee, cause it's astringent. Schwarz brown, light fizzy head. The label's too busy. Gongoryphyllis growing down in the bottom means it's a beer to pay attention to. Long sourish finish and the mouth goes a little watery. Some coffee in the aftertaste.
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Thanks joet. There's a lot going on here - perhaps too much! Dirt brown color and wow, a strong alcohol nose - like whisky, with, I know this will sound crazy, a hint of plain beef taco! It's astringent as all get out, like a bitter lemon. This is a very unusual beer, and worth trying because of it. I just wish it was better integrated.
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"Gift from joet. Bottle conditioned brown, cloudy. Definitely a ""sour"" brown, reminiscent of Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby. Refreshing, but for sure not for everyone's taste. Perfectly trad. lighter body."
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Chesnut is a good word here. The description on the bottle says to drink this with good friends and your favorite dog. Earthy.
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottled. Cloudy chestnut brown. Green apple aroma. Mildly roasty and slightly sour. Low bitterness. Dominated by green apple flavour.
Yellow Rose Honcho Grande;Dallas, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Dedicated to Pancho Villa, as sour a brown ale as the Balcones Fault Red Granite, and I outta know cuz I''m tasting them both side-by-side. There should be a new Brown Ale subcategory - Sour Browns. Like all Yellow Rose beers - needs major work. Lose the citrus bite flavor and make it more of a malty ale. Is that so hard?
Yellow Rose Vigilante Porter;Dallas, Texas, United States;Porter;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Rated from old notes for posterity. An acceptable porter with a roasted caramel taste. A bit thin and watery at the end. Ok.
Yellow Rose Vigilante Porter;Dallas, Texas, United States;Porter;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle 16fl.oz. [ Vintage 2005 ]. Light unclear medium to dark brown colour with a large to huge, frothy - creamy, good lacing, fully lasting, off-white head.

Yellow Rose Vigilante Porter;Dallas, Texas, United States;Porter;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"Courtesy of Anand, 6+ years old Dark brown color with excessive head. Unoffensive aroma, some vinous trait, light oxidisation. Dry mouthfeel, too much carbonation; light vanilla and roasted malts; very low bitterness. Bad."
Yellow Rose Vigilante Porter;Dallas, Texas, United States;Porter;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Never one of my favorites. Getting past a thin body in a porter generally leaves me with the feeling that all else is on a downnhill slide. The various qualities of roastiness and licorice and all else just get washed away in wateriness. Sad affair.
Yellow Rose Vigilante Porter;Dallas, Texas, United States;Porter;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"These outlaws would’ve left their drivers license and a phone number at the scene of the crime. This porter is more like a Poro-Potty; rotten chocoloate and vinegar merge to form mountain lion diarrhea in a bottle."
Yellow Rose Vigilante Porter;Dallas, Texas, United States;Porter;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Light brown with thin tan head...smelled actually a little hoppy, with light chocolate coffee undertones...taste is also a little hoppy with light coffee undertones...this is thin, watery, and weak...
Yellow Rose Vigilante Porter;Dallas, Texas, United States;Porter;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;At the GHBF: Thin dirty brown hue with a small lasting head and minimal lace. The aroma is nutty with some caramel and toasted malts background, floral and dusty too. The taste is watery sweet, cola like, no depth of palate, some coffe tone on the finish. Yuck, what mouthfeel? Why just why, avoid. The worst porter I ever had and I have rated 112 so far. You can do better with a kit.

Cisco Whales Tale Pale Ale;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);This is a backlog rating from 2012 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are pale malts, mild florals, basic.
Cisco Whales Tale Pale Ale;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Pours bright clear copper , white head.

Cisco Whales Tale Pale Ale;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Found in a can in a variety pack. Mild dark amber color.

Pours clear golden with small white head. Caramel malt, hops. Soft mouthfeel, but there is some carbonation though. Decent.
Cisco Whales Tale Pale Ale;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Salty body with earthy yeast strains and resin hops a bit of raisin in the finish.
Cisco Whales Tale Pale Ale;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);On tap at Maryland Live Casino. Thought I was trying something new, but think I had it about a decade ago and forgot to review. Forgot it was an English pale ale, which could be my least favorite within this style. Lacking hops, with the balance leaning towards the sweet. Has a dark orange to light brown appearance. An ok beer and drinkable, but probably should have gone with the Goose IPA.
Cisco Whales Tale Pale Ale;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Aroma rather faint. Taste stronger: gentle hopy and bitter, some malts, well balanced, rather thin though. Soft, lingering bitter aftertaste. MF slightly oily. Decent.

Cisco Baileys Blonde Ale;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Bottle. Pours dirty blonde with white head. Nose and taste of dried grain, malted wheat, ripe banana peel, dried citrus and yeast. Medium body.
Cisco Baileys Blonde Ale;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);A - Pours a slight golden orange color. 2 fingers of creamy white head. S - Grassy hops, pears, biscuity yeast, lemons. T - Bitter grassy and floral hops off the start. Grainy phenolic band aid flavor. Lemony yeast. Very faint malt peeking out. The finish is dry with an aftertaste of grassy hops and slightly citrus. This is a hop intensive blonde. In fact it’s a little unbalanced. The bold hops are welcomed upfront. It carries through but steps on everything else. The slight malt is not enough to hold up to the amount of hops. Having said that I still like it. Mouthfeel is spot on.

Cisco Baggywrinkle Barleywine;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Supposedly have the 12% version.. unsure. Great color. Classic Barleywine aroma... malt, sugar, alcohol, slightly boozy. Taste is like a barley wine IPA hybrid... can dig it.

Pours muted unclear amber with a small beige head that goes quickly. Aroma brings sweet and crispy amber sweet malts with some raisin character.

Cisco Baggywrinkle Barleywine;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Had a three year old bomber out of my basement ""cellar"". It had a nice sediment that I barely disturbed upon pour into a globe glass. Color is a deeper caramel amber hue with a small off white head that fades quickly. Aroma is all sweet on the nose with just a hint of some delicate hop. Taste is sweet, malty, sugary with just a hint of hops trying to keep up; lingering on your palate. Overall a pretty solid example of the style for sure. Pick up two, drink one fresh and put the other away for a while."
Cisco Baggywrinkle Barleywine;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Sampled at the Rapids Liquor tasting. Up front it’s light-bodied with some cherry and dark fruit, then gains weight towards the end finishing more like I’m used to in a barley wine. There is zero alcohol evident here, so it goes down relatively easy.
Cisco Baggywrinkle Barleywine;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Rich deep dark brown coloured body with a single centimetre tall tan head and a nice bit of suspended particles/yeast noticeable. Aroma of pit fruits, strong toasted malt, nuts, earth, caramel and quite a bit of toffee - nice and not too pungent of alcohol notes. Medium to Full-bodied; Strong earthy flavour with a subdued sweetness, a good bit of alcohol and toasted malt and some light oak and spices. Aftertaste shows a pleasant mix of dry oak, vanilla, toffee, yeast and some light earthy notes. Overall, a good relatively mild barley wine that shows it’s age nicely and doesn’t come across to bitter - but has some good complexity and a smooth sweetness. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Ramsey Liqours in Ramsey, New Jersey on 22-February-2013 for US$10.49 sampled at home in Washington on 01-March-2014. 2012/2013 Bottle?

Pours a slightly hazy orange amber color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have a sw eet caramel malt base with herbal and citrus hops, some earthy notes too. Good bitterness to the finish. Some toffee and wood there too. I liked this even though I usually lean more toward English barley wines.
Cisco Baggywrinkle Barleywine;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Biscuits, raisins, caramel, and a fair amount of alcohol in the aroma. Malty and somewhat sweet flavor. Drying alcohol and a little smoke in a somewhat harsh finish. I’ve really liked most of Cisco’s big beers. This was decent but a little disappointing.

Aroma of roasted caramel, dried fruit, malt, and fruity. Taste of the same with a bit of alcohol along with more sweetness.

Full bodied with too much carbonation.

Etwas muffig, wenig spritzig. Nun ehe malzig werdend, dabei ist eine gewisse Getreidenote präsent. Das Bier schmeckt hier nach Kürbis, desweiteren nach Steinfrüchten, nach Ingwer.

Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Not too bad. Has a very nice dark hazy brown appearance. Aromas are of spices, cloves. pine, cinnamon, and very light hops. Taste is something different than what I’m used to. I get tastes of pine, cloves, and other various spices that I just can’t put my finger on. Has a smooth aftertaste with a little bit of a sour end. Not really my type of beer, but it does not lack quality.
Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Very hazy dark brown coloured body, very opaque with a super dense tan head that tops the beer so perfectly. Aroma of roasted malt, figs, stale hops, nuts and some toffee - not great but not horrible. Medium-bodied; Strong malty taste showing a good character with some hops and a good nuttiness that ends the beer. Alcohol is noticeable but not much overpowering. Aftertaste shows some lighter malt and a bit of the nuts. Overall, a decent beer - a bit odd for a holiday seasonal - but good to try. I sampled this one year old 75 cL bottle purchased from Chevy Chase Wine & Liquors in Washington, D.C. on 24-December-2005."
Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Bottle thanks to John. Bright amber pour with generous bright light yellow foamy head. This is a spicy one... particularly nutmeg and cinnamon. Other than that, it’s hard to distinguish much else about this beer. Some malt presence and a little bit of hops.
Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Bottle. Pours on the ruby side of amber with a thin yellowey head. A very toned down spice aroma. Tastes of spices but again toned down. Full on the palate.
Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Bottle; poured a copper/auburn color. Off white head. Aroma of spice, pine tips, toasted malt and yeast. Flavor was similar with spice, toffee, pine and vanilla. Flavor was a little strange, almost medicinal. Good amount of hop presence, for the style. Probably had it during the wrong season."
Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Bottle 750ml. Very balanced, piney taste. Nose is plums, ginger, spice. Unusual beer, very earthy and warming. Medium bodied. Color is amber. Carbonated well. Very good, exceptional for the style which is very hit or miss for me. A nice surprise, i believe this is underrated.
Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"22 oz. bottle. Poured a cola like light brown with a small white head and moderate lace. Flavor was lightly spicey as advertised with some cinnamom. Some really mild caramel in the background. Mouthfeel was full and moderately carbonated. I don’t know about ""freshly baked Christmas cookies in a bottle"", but it was good and I enjoyed it."
Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);From the on-set this beer looked like it had potential. A nice amber body a big frothy head, perhaps too frothy, with very little lacing. Aroma was malty, mostly earth notes with a few mild & indistinguishable spices. Flavor was basically the same, but had a moderate bitterness to it. No real warming sensation here.
Cisco Celebration Libation;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Bottle… O-Town Throwdown Part Tres… Hazy, burnt orange ale with a huge, rocky, white head. The aroma is all cocoa powder and dark chocolate with a pleasant undertone of holiday spice. Intensely bitter, medium sweet, lightly acidic and chocolaty. Medium-bodied, but thin with spritzy carbonation. Bitter, cocoa finish.
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;2/27/2009 4:55:09 PM Ryan/Casey. Medium brown body with healthy, rocky tan head. Malty and yeasty nose, with some caramel notes. Smooth texture. Caramel taste comes through strong. Some dark chocolate towards the finish. Warming. One of this brewer’s better ones.
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;Pours an orange color with a very thin head. Not much of an aroma. Taste is slightly sweet with a very slight bitterness. Okay.
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;12 oz. bottle. Pours a slightly hazed deep reddish amber that allows light to pass through with a thin-moderate off-white head that barely made it to the second sip and left very little lace. Weak aroma of dusty malt and caramel. The flavor is dominated completely by the malt, which has some brown sugar sweetness and at the same time noticeably stale oxidation. No hops presence to speak of and little if any bitterness at the finish. Although I enjoy malt driven beers, this is not something I would look to revisit.
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;"12 fl oz bottle from BOTW (Rochester), served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. BB 02.30.11 App.: Clear copper with a nice reddish-tan head. Aroma: Awful! A strange blend of wet carpet, wet paper, sour barf, ash, vegetal notes, peppery awfulness, really bad. Palate: Medium body, restrained effervescence with some prickly bubbles, smooth overall. Flav.: There seems to be a little earthy caramel malt trying to claw its way out of a mess of bitter herbs, vegetal notes, wet ash, barfy blech, earthy terrible, overall a disaster; dry with good bitterness and a metallic, burnt yuck finish. Holyoke! Dam! This is horrible. Drain pour."
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;"Bottle, stamped ""best by 2.30.11."" No, seriously, February now has 30 days. Pours bright red/orange, a little cloudy, with a foamy 2-finger yellowish head. Aromas of grassy and citrusy hops, lemon and orange zest, and slight berry. The flavor is tart cherry and lemon rind, raisin, and some bitter grass in the finish. Low to medium carbonation with a medium body. Meh. A bit strange. [617]"
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;Very nice cloudy appearance with a neon glow to the amber. Some lacing, head does not stick. Very sweet nose, toffee, tea, again very sweet. Palate is more of the same initially but with a perfect amount of hops to avoid cloying taste leaving the taster with that sugar daddy feel. A bit gritty towards the end as well. Very well done.
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;Bottle, pours an amber body with an off white head. Lightly sweet caramel a tough chewy with some toffee notes and a english hop tones. A hint of paper and some light residual sugar notes with a hint of paper like oxidation.

Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;I like the malts but it was a little too sweet for my taste. It’s looks cloudt and amber - very enticing.
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;"Aug. 26, 2009; 12 oz. bottle &#40Kraig’s Kegs&#41. Seems much more of an English Strong Ale &#40although the ABV isn’t indicated&#41 in flavor & brown color. Sweet, syrupy malts dominate aroma & flavor, although there is some astringent bitterness to be found on the back end. As with almost any malty brew, it needs to warm up. I would enjoy this more in the Autumn or Winter, but probably wouldn’t seek it out."
Paper City Holyoke Dam Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Paper City Brewery;A thick and murky dark cherry red. Bubbles can be seen in the thin spots. Puffy finger of white head. Rather sweet caramel aroma. Rich and slightly roasted. Slight brown sugar, oak. Some pungent raisin. Nice roasted English ale. The taste is a heavy initial brown sugar. Some roasted malt, but a very astringent alcoholic aftertaste. Aspires to a strong ale taste, but it comes off wrong. Had potential, but its nature comes off a tad musty. Ashy and gritty feel on the tongue, but that’s not a bad thing. Overall, the flavor improves as it warms, so let it warm up nice and good.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;Another reason why the Americans should not use wheat. Subdued nose, slight cloves. Very tart unbalanced palate. Cloudy yellow with thick head and lacing. Not bad but not that good.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;The aroma was cloves and bananas, other fruity esters. The flavor was likewise a mix of bananas and cloves, but definitely watery and a bit disappointing. The mouthfeel was too light, and combined with the watery flavor, made this very subpar for the style, although not bad, Being at a place that served German beer on tap, I got something else.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;Hazy lemon with a low head and good carbonation. Wheat and citrus in the aroma. Banana, lemon and corriander in the flavor and a thin but sweet finish. Decent for an American wheat.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;Pours like clear lemonade with a huge sudsy white head. The aroma is spicy banana and clove with lemon-orange citrus, and some grainy wheat. The flavor is much the same- tart lemon citrus, banana, and clove. The palate is very thin and crisp with some astringency, finishing very clean. Not too impressed.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;(bottle - 12 oz) Hazy straw color with a pillow of foamy white head. Citrus and wheat dominate the aroma with hints of banana and strawberry coming through at the end. Sour wheat flavor at the beginning with a little of the same fruity hint that I caught in the aroma. Some strawberries and pears it tastes like. Very grainy wheat middle with a dry and bitter finish. Sourness lingers for a bit.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;Pours gold with a white head. Smells of wheat, some earthy hints, perfumy. Tastes lightly tarte and citrussy with a sweet wheat finish.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;12oz. Bottle: Aroma of lemon, wheat, spices, butter, and coriander. Poured golden in color with a small, white head that diminished immediately. Cloudy. Full of medium-sized particles. Pretty gross flavor. Tastes of sugar-cookie, spices, banana, butter-cream icing, plastic, and coriander. Light to medium body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Banana finish. Mediocre wheat ale.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;Bottle: Bright yellow, albeit a bit hazy, with a relatively thick and pock-marked bright white head. Tingle of lemony zest in the aroma, with a creamy consistency and yeasty tug to the sweet top. Bit too sweet and candy-like for my tastes. (#3168, 11/1/2007)
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;KSBF07 Poured a golden/yellow with good head. ARoma was lots of bananas and cloves. Flavor was much the same was thin and watery though not as carbonated as it should have been.
Paper City Cabot Street Summer Wheat;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Paper City Brewery;"KSBF07 as a Paper City ""Hefeweizen."" Typical appearance for a hefe, although the head was a bit weak. The aroma was cloves and bananas, other fruity esters. The flavor was likewise a mix of bananas and cloves, but definitely watery and a bit disappointing. The mouthfeel was too light, and combined with the watery flavor, made this very subpar for the style, although not offensive (ie. drinkable)."
Paper City Ireland Parish Golden Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Paper City Brewery;Not bad. Average. Drinkable. Their most drinkable beer. Great name, it will get you drunk. A staple for the Holyoke st paddy day parade. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Paper City Ireland Parish Golden Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Paper City Brewery;"No head. Clear carrot orange. Slight haze in the glass. Not much going on, really. Toasted caramel malts in the nose. Slightly sweetened with molasses. A mild grassy hop. Slightly nutty, but more sweet; English-style sugars. The taste is an oxidized mess, wet cardboard hint at first, which overshadows the crystalline, spiky malt, as well as the ever-so-slight grassy hop. Like a stale pilsner, although it is actually neither. The feel is very watery and thin, which doesn’t help the flavor. It’s just not that great. The wet paper doesn’t do anyone any favors."
Paper City Ireland Parish Golden Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Paper City Brewery;A mildly hoppy ale like many APA that wants to be an IPA. Accepatble to the lager lover. Aroma is dull hops and this carries over to the finish. Looks like a pale lager with a decent white head. I’d say this is more than a simple golden ale as specified here.
Paper City Ireland Parish Golden Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Paper City Brewery;Ryan/Casey. Light brown bod with prickly tan head. Fully hoppy nose, with some pine notes. Creamy texture. Taste of hops, caramel. Pretty good actually. Plenty of grapefruit in the finish.

Paper City Ireland Parish Golden Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Paper City Brewery;(bottle - 12 oz) Clear golden color with a thin tan head. Rather fizzy. Aroma is very light, almost to the point of non-existent. All I could smell was some bitter hops. Flavor is rather spicy and zesty with some floral hops and grapefruit. A little tangy and watery but finishes with a clean citrus taste.
Paper City Ireland Parish Golden Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Paper City Brewery;This is a local beer for local people. Gold, honey color in the pour with little head. Aroma was suble with definate bitter hops that covered over a sweeter scent, almost cookie dough like. taste was very light and sort of thin but would suit the adverage beer drinker just fine. But also not bad for us snobs when the wallet is a little light. A ligher beer for those with lighter pockets.
Paper City Ireland Parish Golden Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Paper City Brewery;Very faint aroma. Rich opaque golden color with a small white head. Nice hoppy flavor makes a good impression on the tongue with some spiciness and citrus. Average body, not too heavy but not overly thin either. Nice beer.

Paper City Winter Palace Wee Heavy;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paper City Brewery;07-Nov-13 (12-oz bottles: Obtained in trades with jjpm74 and shadey, thanks John and Shane!) This beer is pretty old, but it’s tasting really good. Its flavors are deep, rich and savory, with sweet caramel, toffee, smoke, cacao, dark (but not burnt) toast, dried fruit, and dark earth. The beer is moderately sweet, not cloying at all, and balanced very nicely by gently bitter roastiness. The aromas are earthy, roasty, and somewhat sweet, with chocolate, toffee, caramel, and dried fruit. Carbonation is light to medium, but it’s an old bottle and the carbonation level is fine for this beer anyway. The color is medium brown with good clarity, and the head pours to a quarter-inch before settling quickly to a thin ring. Overall, while some Scotch Ales don’t age particularly well, this one has far exceeded my loftiest expectations. Really enjoyed this one.
Paper City Winter Palace Wee Heavy;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paper City Brewery;Murky pour, dark brown, faint orange highlights. Thick head, some retention. Smoky malty nose. Much more of the same in the palate, very sweet and good, peaty. Not too sweet as a few hops come into play at the end. I liked it , true to style.

Paper City Winter Palace Wee Heavy;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paper City Brewery;Very sweet and rich, with some different kinds of nutty flavors underneath.

Paper City Winter Palace Wee Heavy;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paper City Brewery;Shared by barley69 at DLD. Dark reddish-brown pour with a beige head.

Paper City Winter Palace Wee Heavy;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paper City Brewery;"It took me a while to warm up to this Wee Heavy. The nose was weak, but eventually I could discern some dark, burnt chocolate. The taste was very bitter to me; I could make out no fruitiness that others spoke of. The flavor was more complex and had more going for it than the aroma. As Wee Heavy’s go, it was working really hard to live up to the style...I’ll give it credit for that."
Paper City Winter Palace Wee Heavy;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paper City Brewery;Dark red/brown body topped by a medium thick head with some lace.

Paper City Winter Palace Wee Heavy;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paper City Brewery;(bottle - 12 oz) Muddy brown color with a very thin and quickly dissipating off-white head. Malty in the aroma with a very light hint of smoke, caramel, and toffee. Smoke and lots of caramel begin the flavor that moves to a lightly fruity but surprisingly bitter middle. Finishes very crisp with a lingering and bitter aftertaste. Almost like coffee mixing with apples and caramel. Very easy to drink.

Dark, chestnut brown and smells like a very subtle maltiness, hard to say because there isn;t much there. The flavor was a little too sweet, overly malty but not in a good way.

Paper City Indian Pale Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Paper City Brewery;Bottle at home in NH, shared with Charlie. Pours clear, medium-dark gold with a small, white head. Fairly tame nose, light grain, toast and earth. Plenty of EKG hops in the flavor, lightly sweet, a touch off-balanced, some mild burnt sugar. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Kind of bland in the finish, mild wood, pine, toasty malts, a few lingering bitter notes. Nothing too wrong but pretty underwhelming overall.
Paper City Indian Pale Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Paper City Brewery;The aroma is chlorine, surprising Belgo-funk. Apple skins and citric oils. A little disjointed in the nose. The appearance is a bad omen: completely overflows out of the bottle like lava. Pineapple yellow-orange out of a sweaty bottle. Lacing is not bad. The flavor is more apple skins, pale malts. Much sweeter hop character than expected. Actually decent but different. Palate is overcarbonated -- flows out of the bottleneck (minus one point right there). Pleasantly soft and a little fizzy. It’s a very apple-y IPA, more akin to a Belgian than an American pale.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with spicy carbonation. Overall: Not bad, but not something I would drink again, unless of course someone says I had a not-so-hot bottle. The person I got it from deemed it local and fresh, so I’m leaning towards it not being my bag.

Taste is flat smack of whatever. Not specifically bad, but just kinda... there. Lager sweet back. Iced tea-esque. Wutev va. A tick is a tick. Did I mention this is NOT my first beer of the evening?"
Paper City Indian Pale Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Paper City Brewery;"An interesting IPA which I enjoyed but a bit ""clove"" heavy in my opinion. Roasty, citrus, earthy, clove."

Arbor Bavarian Bliss Hefeweizen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon, orange, pear, apple, banana, bubblegum, clove, wheat, biscuit, light honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange, pear, apple, banana, bubblegum, clove, wheat, biscuit, light honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light-moderate spicy/herbal bitter finish with slight wheat tartness; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, banana, bubblegum, clove, wheat, biscuit, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice standard hefeweizen style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

Arbor Bavarian Bliss Hefeweizen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;"Bottle: Yellow-ish, amber-ish, and of course, ever-cloudy with that signature hefe yeast haze; the chalk-white head isn’t as billowy as it should be for the style. Aroma is like a fairly standard, muted hefeweizen; notes of clove and banana being the strongest, with some citrus zest and bread in the back. Kind of weak, not necessarily bad, though. Taste is similarly weak, a little watery and not a good mouth feel for the style. Some overripe banana hints, clove, light taffy. Very small touch of finishing citrus zest, and maybe even some toasted bready malt. The yeast isn’t as powerful/potent here as I like in my hefes. Painfully average, lacking for a hefeweizen."
Arbor Bavarian Bliss Hefeweizen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Bottle. Clean, golden color with a fizzy white head. Banana, bubblegum and sour yeast aroma. Big initial dose of wheat, with mellow tones of cloves and fruit in the finish. Very light bodied but the over carbonation takes away from some of the flavor.. Quite refreshing, but a little bland compared to some of the other options.

Arbor Big Ben House Mild Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;On tap at the brewpub. A pale brown beer, unclear, and with a dense, finger thick off-white head. The aroma is fruity and lightly bready, with some grass. It’s very smooth on the palate, medium bodied and low on carbonation. Fruity, bready flavour with some caramel and a faint bitterness. Short finish. Rather uninteresting this one, and it doesn’t help that it’s served too warm. 150615

Arbor Big Ben House Mild Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;I had this on tap as part of a sampler, this was one of most disappointing beers for sure...It actually looks really nice, nice gold color, good retention...The aroma is nice too, light but gives off some decent hops...The taste is terrible, all skunk from start to finish, nothing redeeming here at all. At 3.5% I’d almost rather drink an American macro.

Arbor Milestone Cask Porter;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Porter;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Reviewed from notes. Poured from cask, this brings a nice dark body with a fairly substantial head and a good dose of lacing on the way down. Nose brings roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and some anise. Taste is the same with the flavors blending quite smoothly. Feel is nice, but not quite what I would hope the cask would do to the flavors, especially within the brewpub itself. Drinks quite well and was one of my favorite beers of the afternoon. Serving type: cask Reviewed on: 10-11-2010

Arbor Sacred Cow IPA;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;IPA;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a fairly dark burnt orange color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipated immediately. Left some speckled lace. The aroma had some musty old grass, light citrus pulp, piney notes, and an earthy sort dried malt. The flavor had that dried earthy malt up front with some mineral notes and the musty old grass. Faint breadiness. All seemed to blend in the aftertaste and finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Decent carbonation and an ABV that felt right. Overall, a bit different for me in the IPA category, not sure if I would come back to. Maybe.

Arbor Sacred Cow IPA;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;IPA;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Undoubtedly one of the most bitter IPA I have ever tasted. From a bottle, this stuff wanders into the imperial IPA territory without apologies. Rude, crude rototilling beer that that is terribly on style. Nothing else can be said. If you like IPA, flip my numbers because you need to try this, whew. My computer didn’t even like it, when I spilled this on the keyboard it gave me a bright screen of death and died.

Big Buck Naked Light;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at the Gaylord location. Clear straw body, thin off-white head. Light clover nectar aroma, almost non-existent. Slightly corny body, sweet and grainy or husky. Not especially impressive, but nothing to pour down the drain, either, which is the point I suppose.
Big Buck Naked Light;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Big Buck Brewery;Poured from tap at Big Buck Brewery in Grapevine. This produced a pale, yellow, clear beer with little to no head which quickly diminished, leaving the beer looking flat. I was surprised by the complexity of this beer’s aroma, which was slightly malty with sweet, nutty notes. This is a watery, lightly carbonated beer which went down easily and had a slight toffee nut taste. This was a surprise to me in that it exceeded my expectations in a light, low alcohol beer.
Big Buck Naked Light;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Big Buck Brewery;Draught at the brewpub Pale blond color. Aroma of fudge. Dry mouthfeel, light malt flavor, high bitterness. They proposed it as a Coors alternative, of course it’s better.

Big Buck Wolverine Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Buck Brewery;Draught pint at Gaylord, MI location on 6/2/06. Head is gone nearly as soon as the glass is put down, with no ring, no lacing and almost no carbonation. Very light, straw yellow, with just a hint of deeper gold. Strong, heavily drying, sour wheat in the nose does not seem to have been dealt with properly, as it is much too sour, soapy and dominant, with a very high level of attenuation, and no barley malt to create a backbone. Some light bubble gum, vanilla and corn notes arise as well, showing a quick lagering time. The flavor is sour, astringent and puckering. Soapy, soggy wheat, vanilla and dry cream notes all bog down the palate, while a stinging, noxious carbonation is persistent and knocks back any malt (barley) that might be there. No hops. Some alcohol is noted in aroma and flavor (fusel in nature). Some mushy cereal and sour wheat notes linger on. Quite watery as well.
Big Buck Wolverine Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Buck Brewery;Sharp and clear, lighter then I personaly prefer, but a good accompaniment to a light meal.

Big Buck Raspberry Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;One of the better Buck beers in my opinion. Has a great scent and a smoother taste. Didn’t notice thte malty aftertaste I get with many of the buck beers. Good for a Raspberry Wheat.
Big Buck Raspberry Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at brewery. Aroma is raspberry. Light orange gold copper hue. Bitters on the finish. Very fruity but one dimensional.
Big Buck Raspberry Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;Draft at the brewery in Gaylord, MI. Light copper color. Small white head, just a little lacing. Smells and tastes of raspberries (suprise?). Flavor wasn’t overpowering, just enough to let you know this was a fruity beer. Like every other raspberry beer I’ve tried there was no wow factor. However, with that being said, overall it was a very pleasant and easy drinking beer.
Big Buck Raspberry Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;Sample at the Gaylord location: Pours an orange-gold color with a thin white head and spots of lacing. Aroma of raspberry and wheat, surprisingly enough. Light-bodied and crisp with an airy tart raspberry flavor, along with a touch of wheat and malt. The finish is bubbly and fruity. Not overly fruity which is a plus, but all in all pretty average.
Big Buck Raspberry Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;5 oz draught sample at the Gaylord, MI location, July 2006. Whoah, a raspberry wheat at a suburban-type faux-Northwoods brewpub in July? Who would have thought it? Well let’s see what this rarity has to offer....faint haze to the red-tinged thin body with a small ring of lasting head....fresh just-ripe berries in the nose, touch of pale malts with the faintest hint of caramelized and burnt qualities....the body is pretty dry and fairly sour/tart with a bit of underripe berry sweetness, touches of pepper and orange towards the finish, rather thin and watery. OK for what it is, anyway.
Big Buck Raspberry Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;This was one of the better samples I tried at the brewery in Gaylord and I usually am not a big fruit beer fan. The beer pours an orangeish pink color with a nice head. Sweet raspberries and honey fill the nose. Nice balance between fruit and malts. The body is slightly fizzy, with more fresh raspberries puree really coming through. The wheat creates a creamy mouthfeel and makes this a real refreshing brew. Good stuff.
Big Buck Raspberry Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at the brewery in Gaylord Michigan. <!-- p --> Clear and slight brown thin head.

Big Buck Raspberry Wheat;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at the Auburn Hills, MI location. The color was a cloudy pink with a big raspberry aroma. It had a fizzy mouthfeel with a somewhat dry palate. Yup, it tasted like raspberries, but it wasn’t as refreshing as other raspberry beers I’ve had.
Big Buck Antler Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Buck Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a slight light hazy amber color. There was a decent transparency to it allowing carbonation to be seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Lacing stuck but eventually slid into the body. The smell had some light caramel malts lightly backed up by a nice gently roasted nuttiness. The taste followed the nose in a sweet slightly roasty way. On the palate, this was sessionable in a nice light sweet roasty way. Overall, I almost always had this with their reuben when I would make the drive back to the U.P. where I used to live. Good beer.

Big Buck Antler Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Buck Brewery;Nice lacing and head retention on this one. Copper body and a nose of something sweet, fruity (grapes), and malt. Taste is sweet and slightly bitter. It is nice to see an amber ale that does not rely on hops as its backbone. Actually quite nice and drinkable.

Big Buck Antler Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Buck Brewery;Poured from tap into pint glass. Produced a clear amber body with a small off-white quickly diminishing head. From first pour, the ale had no discernible nose, yet nothing offensive. Slightly bitter, this was a balanced brew with average hops and malt, producing a clean flavor. Not too shabby.
Big Buck Antler Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Buck Brewery;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy amber color. Both the aroma and the flavor show some sugar, and of course some caramel taste; the mouthfeel is quite dry, because of the medium-high bitterness. Simple."

Big Buck Antler Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Buck Brewery;"Sample at the Gaylord location: Clear amber color with a thin ivory head that dissipates steadily. Minimal lacing is evident. Light-bodied and mildly bitter with a touch of sweetness. The finish is light citrusy hops. Not the best ""transition"" between their lighter and darker beers. While it is not a bad beer, I think I will just skip over this transitional step next time."

Dark amber with a touch of retained head and a bit of lacing....toasty malty-sweet nose offers a bit of baked apple as it warms....dry and rather dull body, a bit of cidery sweet-tartness as you go through it but really very little to glom onto. Words fail me as the beer did....

Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;From notes: On tap at the brewpub it is a dark golden color with a slight head. It has the flavor of malt and the taste is bitter with some sweet nuttiness
Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a decent looking reddish to brown color with a nice half fingered white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving some slight stringy lacing. The smell had a light nutty to caramel to apple notes. The taste took those flavors and combined them nicely. On the palate, this one sat fairly light and came across fairly sessionable as the carbonation was there but mainly subdued. Overall, decent ESB nothing wrong but nothing over the top, worthy of having again, sure will if I’m back in Gaylord, MI (who knows when that’ll be).
Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;On draft at the brewery in Gaylord, MI. Pours a clear amber with an off white head. Light malty nose. Flavors of nuts. Medium bodied. Crisp finish.
Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;Draft at brewery. Medium brown with small head. Souring at the beginning and really grain heavy at the head.
Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;tap at the Gaylord location - The brewpub claims the abv is 10.7%. I think not. That would be very odd for an ESB and quite obvious. Pours lightly hazy amber with an off-white head that laces well. It has a very mild aroma of rather indistinct malt. The flavor is sweet up front leading into some good bitterness. There’s a touch of citrus and a lingering bitter finish. Good.
Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;MBGSF 2011. Poured clear brown color with a moderate off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Medium complex hop and sweet malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium pleasing bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Very drinkable brew.
Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at brewery. Aroma is weak but some hops and malts there. Red brown hue. Nutty toasty malts and resin bitter hops are well balanced in the flavor. Very good but a little mellow in character. The best brew I’ve had at this brewery.
Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;From a growler. Pours a dark, mostly transparent ruddy oak color with a thick layer of creamy tan head. Lots of caramel in the nose, lightly toasted, with a hint of oak bark character. A hint of mineral character as well, along with a bold, spicy, earthy EKG hop bite. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. A little bit of a mineral tang starts out the palate, which is then washed over with dark caramel malt flavors. A generous hop serving helps the palate to a dry finish, leaving a final smack of earthy spice and mild citrus lingering on the tongue. Pretty clean overall, with a pleasing malt, hop, and mineral balance. A little bit on the heavy side, I get the impression that a bit more attenuation would improve the refreshing quaff ability of this one, but the flavors are quite satisfying.
Big Buck Docs ESB;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Buck Brewery;Draught at the brewpub Amber color. Light aroma. The flavor is basically caramel, with a medium-high bitterness. Correctly brewed.

This one finishes with a nice lactic sugary hint. Enjoyable.
Big Buck Black River Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big Buck Brewery;Vinegary like especially since they served it cold. It said it was a chocolate stout but it was not like any chocolate stout I have ever had. Slightly better as it warms then you can get some of the malt and caramel.

Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Can from Brewtopia. Golden clear with small head and a little lace. Grassy floral cereal aroma. Medium sweet honey cereal cheerios with light earthy grassy bitterness accentuated by nice fine internal carbo. Light body. Good.
Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Courtesy of Wohlfs. Very faint caramel aroma. Flavor is very chewy caramel, a little oxidized. My friends here are saying beigian, I thought it was more doppel like, but not pale lager, for sure.
Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle: Courtesy of wolhfs. Rather sweet with a pretty big yeasty aroma which is quite suprising from a pale lager. Pours a transparent orangish-gold with a big soapy large bubbled white head with some decent retention. Flavor is rather sweet with some light yeatiness. No hops at all and the flavor is pretty consistant from start to finish. Maybe it gets a tad yeastier in the finish. I agree with wolhfs on the Belgian similarities. As it warms a little caramel starts to come thru. Not at all what I was expecting from a pale lager. I wonder what this was like fresh.
Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle found from the bottom dusty shelf in a party store. Big release of pressure when opened. Large white head erupts when the liquid hits the glass. Opaque light amber color with chunks of floaties. Sweet aroma, caramelish with a touch of yeast. This is reminding me of a belgian more and more. Very carbonated. Lighter bodied. Sweet flavor with hints of sour poking through. Slightly drying. Interesting to see what a few years will do to a pale ale. Different bottle. The previous bottle seemed to be infected so here is an updated rant. Less head although still forms and leaves good lacing. Predominantly malty in aroma with a touch of sweetness. A little bit of stale aroma sneaks in. Still somewhat drying. This has lost all of it’s noble hop power but is still pleasant. Numbers reflect non-infected bottle.
Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);This old bottle was given to me by Wohlfs, brewed back when the brewery was called Canal Street, is it even drinkable anymore? Poured a large frothy head and golden hue with great lace. The aroma has some oxidation notes along with lmeon and apple, pale biscuity malts, and a hint of yeasty esters. The taste is not all that bad with a light fruity acidic nature and malty background. Some woody like dryness and old ale character. No hops are left to be found however. Shocking and refreshing. It is interesting to read the post below, Founders as home a long way since this was brewed. Thanks for the rare bottle, it made my night.
Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"Cleaning up some old ratings found this gem from August 2001. Its ignorant babbling interests me so here I clean up the typos and repost ""Either they're trying too hard or not hard enough - too hard would mean that the effort is to subtly grace budmilloorists with flavor and the mark is overshot ... not hard enough means that they just didn't care and needed to hold the budmilloorists at bay. Either way this is mediocre fare."""
Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Some dumb ass poured me THIS beer, when I asked for an IPA. Not all that impressive, then again, what Founders are?
Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);It has that high-class European flavor that really pisses you off. Not a horrible beer but I give them more points because I think the label is cool.
Founders Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);This once again proves how Founders is one step away from making good beer. They should keep experimenting and one day I see them blowing some people away.

Founders Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"From Sept 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with jwc215. Thanks Joe! It pours a hazy orange gold with a 1 finger head of foam. Great head retention and there's some lacing. The smell has notes of caramel and earthy malt and some citrus hoppiness but overall, it's lightly done. The taste has some weak malt presence, earthy and a touch of caramel, followed by a light citric hop bitterness that dominates mid palate on and through the finish. Hmm, this is a serviceable APA in taste but the overall flavours come across as very mild to me. If this was lower in abv, it would be a decent sessionable ale but at over 6%, I just expected more flavour and didn't get it. Good medium mouthfeel here and the carbonation is fairly light. Bottom line: A decent APA that looks good, smells good, tastes ok, has a pretty good mouthfeel, and is pretty drinkable. There you have it in a nutshell. ;^)"
Founders Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle. Golden, excellent white foam. Aroma: malt and citrus, fruits and little flowers. Taste: citrus, fruits, pure, drinakable, a little sweets.

Founders Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Deep black, impenetrable even with a backlight. 1 inch+ thick, creamy, bubbly khaki head, which develops a rocky, pitted surface as it slowly recedes, leaving strings of lacing circling the glass. Mild aroma: dark fruit with coffee, roasted malts, hints of chocolate. Feel is silky, but a bit thin. Taste is roasted malts and coffee front and center, some fruit flavor - plums, perhaps - underneath. Bitterness begins right away and continues and lingers into the aftertaste, but it is not overpowering. Finish is moderately dry. The overall is a well-done porter, with a stereotypical taste, which is in the end relatively simple.

Surely the same beer. Pours a murky, heavily clouded orange. Rim in white. Light clove phenol nose. A bit warm, as the lemon, banana and clove oil develop on the tongue. Chewy. Oily. A pretty classic hefe flavor. I want more carbonation, more hops and more brightness. This lays a little dead on the palate. A touch of phenolic astringency over a bit more alcohol. This is fine, but nothing that I’m going to get whipped up about. It’s classic, relatively clean, but missing the necessary carbonation or lightness."
Hereford & Hops Herefordweizen;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the Wausau location. Lots of banana and faint cloves on the nose. Yellow color very cloudy. Strong banana flavor with light wheat and clove finish.

Hereford & Hops Herefordweizen;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On-tap at the brewpub: Straw gold carpeting of color with a sparkly white cap of medium height. Moderate lacing in spots and broken sheeting. Keeps a good skim the whole time. Aroma is quite plain. Just a small smacking of wheat induced incense and a smearing of tartly set lemon. Flavors bring the same tame action of low leveled wheat and a short tone of lemon spritz. Nothing to it really. Very average if not all together forgetful on the buds. Feel is just as lack luster. Smooth but plain and lacking any real hefe verve or qualities that should be in a hefe. Where’s the action? One of only a couple from Hereford’s that are a bit hard to get down and don’t make the cut.

Not great. Not bad. Just OK. Does not fill you with the ""warm fuzzies"" like a case of Blatz will. Believe it."
Hereford & Hops Whitetail Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the Escanaba brewpub. Light lemon sour malt aroma. Pours a very pale lemon yellow. Rim in white. Flavor is a classic salty, grainy, lightly chewy malt backed with a bit of metallic/grassy hop flavor. Very low key, but clean, which I appreciate. This is actually a decent golden, with nice drinkability, crisp malt character and refreshing dry hop balance. Nothing really stands out but it’s a decent version. Finishes on a lightly sweet citrus hop bite and then closes out cleanly. Rather hoppy for the style actually and I think that’s what makes it work. Fresh, bright, clean. A good blonde.
Hereford & Hops Whitetail Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;I usually HATE this style, but this one came close to me ordering a second. Hardly any aroma. Could pick up a hint of light fruit. Pour was a nice light gold with a one finger white head. Taste was sweet in the beginning. Apple and pear with a dry and light aftertaste. Nice carbonation. One of the better blonds I’ve had (beer that is!)
Hereford & Hops Whitetail Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap. Very light golden pour with a small head. Sweet fruity nose with a light hint of hops. It has a really light and sweet taste, much like a lot of big commercial beers. Finishes quite dry like most of the other beers at this location. It is a much better alternative for fans of American light beers.

Hereford & Hops Cleary Red;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the Escanaba brewpub. Crystal clear deep red amber, with a rim of white above. No aroma. I can’t pull anything off. Flavor. This is boring. A meaty, chewy old malt flavor climbs out of this one. Too much crystal, too much meat. No real malt intricacy and no hops to balance this off. Some too-warm yeast esters kick off a bit of gross twinge to the finish of the beer. Not entirely clean.
Hereford & Hops Cleary Red;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Crap was this bad. If this was in a bottle it would have been a drainpour. Nothing stood out with this beer. I literally put my beak into the liquid and inhaled and couldn’t pick up an aroma. The pour was a flat bubbleless orange with no head. Taste was weak and unexciting. I could taste a hint of biscuit and light malt with an earthiness to it, but it was so diluted I had to dig deep to pull that out of it. Terrible.

Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Alrighty then. This is not BIg Buck Raspberry wheat or Crazy Shirl’s, but it ain’t half bad, if you primed the pump with a dozen or so Blatz beforehand. If you get to the Hereford & Hops restaurant in Escanaba, stop at the convenience store next door (Gust Asp) and hoist a few Blatz before going in. You won’t regret it and the chicks will think you’re hot. Don’t question it.
Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On draught at the brewpub in Wausau, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden pale brew with a fast dissipating white head that leaves behind a fine film and thin white ring. Aroma of Kool Ade raspberry, some sugar character with very little bread malt presence. Taste is light bodied, well carbonated with more raspberry than any malt flavor and then a light ivory soap taste. Finish is slightly tart, with some raspberry and soap aftertaste.
Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap in Wausau. Plenty of raspberry on the nose. Light yellow body with off-white head. Faint raspberry taste in the body.
Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Pours deep yellow with thin white head. Aroma of mild raspberry, malt and sugar.

Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Had this one on draught in Wausau, Wisconsin. Subdued raspberry in the nose and finish, dark yellow pour and thin head. Not too bad.
Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On-tap at the brewpub: A strangely vibrant pale straw yellow with hugely active carbonation action within. Small but compact whitish head thats a bit styrofoam-like. Lacing sits along the glass in some spots. Aroma is a sharply acute raspberry extract with a spiked wine cooler-kool-aid spritz. Whoa...this is down right awful. Major raspberry abstract just flys up the nostrils with carbonation that could put ginger ale to shame. Its beyond the notion of kool-aid like flavoring and 7-up grabbing. Its got obtuse vanilla soda backing and some crackling wheatishness. Many off flavors of old sour gum drops, battery acid, decaying aluminum, and puckering sour sugared carbonation. Three sips and I was finished with it. The Mrs. had just about the same a hard of time with it as I did but nursed it for about an hour before giving up with still 1/8th left in the glass. Thank goodness they have some other fine brews to move on to.
Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;The version I had included chocolate flavoring for Valentine’s Day. Pretty awful. The flavor was so strong I couldn’t taste anything else for several minutes.
Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;"Draft (sample), Wausau WI location, July 03. Few things are to be more dreaded than a raspberry beer at an unknown brewpub; fortunately, this was better than expected (though still nothing special). A slightly artificial kool-aid raspberry nose, somewhat pungent; fresh-fruit flavor, only sligth sourness, nice malt but quite thin -- color yellow, not expected pink or red. Not bad for what it is, if that's what you like (though the question begs, then why are you here?)"
Hereford & Hops Razzberri Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Raspberries are currently in season - in fact, I had a fine snack of wild ones on the trail in the Porcupine Mountains recently and a fine Razbry pie of my mother's tonight for dinner. So one could expect good things from an ale with this name this time of year. And this one seems at first like it might deliver - a decent nose, berries there but not overwhelming, and a soft mouthfeel that is a bit sireening. But the flavour is, again, that artificial berriness that so many fruit beers stoop too, though perhpas in a sad sweet little smile of a way, and the aftertaste is simply brutal.
Hereford & Hops Badger Bock;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Got this one at the restaurant in Wausau, Wisconsin. A dark amber pour with a lacy, white head that dissipated rapidly, nose of carmel apples and sweetbread, nice balance with plenty of maltiness. This was a good beer, and accompanied my steak well.
Hereford & Hops Badger Bock;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the Cranberry H&H near Pittsburgh, PA. Here it is called Butler Bock after the nearby town. Pours orangish red in my clear glass. Aroma has hints of sweetness. There is absolutely no head, not even a froth. It does have that bock flavor, strong but not too strong. Very bocky, can enjoy as a bock, no doubt. Not bad at all, perhaps a little weak, but not much. Very gentleman-like for a bock, enjoyable. Finish is good and not offensive, but it does have it’s own personality. Not a bitter finish but it does have enough taste to let you know you just drank a beer. Finish fades rapidly.
Hereford & Hops Oktoberfest/Marzen;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On draught at the brewpub in Wausau, Wisconsin. Pours a clear copper amber brew with a fast dissipating off-white head that dissolves to a white ring and no lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, a touch of orange zest and some candi sugar. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with flavors of caramel malt, some flowery hops, and a touch of toffee. Finish is semi-sweet, some detected alcohol and a slight burnt brown sugar aftertaste.
Hereford & Hops Oktoberfest/Marzen;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap in Cranberry. Pour is a big head with the beer being an orange brown, mostly orange, colored liquid. Can’t see any bubbles within. Has a little perfumed background in there, the one I detect with most all H&H beers. I wonder if it is the dishwasher. Otherwise it is wonted beery smells. Interesting flavor, fruity and slightly sweet. There is a little bitterness but barely. The data card says this is 22 IBU. Seems to be less than that. Very little, if any, carbonation. Has a medium level of hop bitterness to balance a malt sweetness. Finish is not offensive and this makes the beer likable and easy to drink. Less strong than many Marzens. Over all, a decent and repeatable session beer.
Hereford & Hops Oktoberfest/Marzen;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Sample at the Wausau, WI location.

Hereford & Hops Brown Trout Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a milky brown color with a thin cap of a little white frothy head that fell off at a decent pace. Lace was slightly there, but messy. The aroma had some chocolate, light coffee, some peach-like/apricot sweetness and then light nuts. The flavor definitely leaned towards the sweet side. Sly malty sweet sort of aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Subtle carbonation was felt with a decent ABV coming about just right. Overall, pretty good brown ale, perhaps leaning towards the English side. Would have again.
Hereford & Hops Brown Trout Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Pours hazy amber with off-white head that fades quickly. Aroma of grain, chocolate, sweet malt and hops. Flavor is well developed and well balanced. Good brown...

Hereford & Hops Brown Trout Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Some decent malts in here make this probably the best H+H brew at this session, and its rating will rise due to its proximity to so much banality. But out in the field it couldn't hold up to more interesting browns.
Hereford & Hops Brown Trout Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Hereford & Hops beers in Bay City MI. are all clean, quality made beers. However, they seem to be brewed more for commercial success & acceptance by Budweiser fans more so than true to style. The Brown Trout Ale is the lone exception. Brett Moody (H&H brewer) has the right combination of ingredients to make this a truely enjoyable beer. Could pick it up on the malty aroma a bit to take this beer to the next level.
Hereford & Hops Highlander Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub.

Hereford & Hops Highlander Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Scottish Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Sampled at the brewpub. This must have been brought back from retirement. Pretty much clear and copper brown. A small beige head. This offers rich malts typical of the style. Softer hops are dry and add more bitterness and character than flavor. Perhaps some noble hops have been added but not a lot. A bit of maple syrup or brown sugar is tasted late.

Hereford & Hops Dortmunder;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;This beer is very good for a helles, but rating to enjoyment..average. Aroma was very floral. Almost smelled like a dozen roses. Pour was a light to medium gold with no head. Taste was very caramelly. Almost Sugar Daddy taste in the front and the watery finish drowned out all the flavor. Little carbonation and just a hint of caramel in the aftertaste. This beer tasted like it was thrown together at the last minute.

Hereford & Hops Dortmunder;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Pours lighter orange yellow in my glass. This was on tap at the H&H in Cranberry, near PGH PA. Here they renamed it the ’black & gold helles’ after the steelers. Should not be too bitter, the bar card says it has an ibu of 20. I can barely sense any aroma, but it is noticable. Its a kind of slight fruity hint. Head fades to a small white rim that sticks to the sides of the glass. An odd initial flavor awaits you, Not real bitter but not real lager like either. Kind of interesting personality. A metallic or industrial flavor that you easiy appriciate. Has some good personality for a helles. Finish is OK but does have some lingering bitterness to it. The bitterness fades rapildy and does not hang around like many ales.

Hereford & Hops Koelsch Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On draught at the Wausau brewpub location as Hereford & Hops Kölschbier. Pours a clear straw colored beer with plenty of carbonation bubbles, a creamy white head and slowly dissipates and leaves behind some spotty lacing. Aroma of white bread and a combination of citrus and grassy hops. Taste is light bodied, some white bread malt, citrus zest, a touch of hay and vegetable character. Finish is semi-dry, a little bit on the thin aftertaste side of light bread malt and some grassy hops. As a Kölsch beer, this is missing some of the flowery character I prefer in the Cologne style Kölsch.

Hereford & Hops Dopple Bock;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Draught sample at the brewpub, late July 2006. Deep chestnut color with a lasting creamy head....earthy, caramel-tinged aroma with light baking spices and a hint of berry throughout.....the body is luscious, 3 Musketeers-type nougat, caramel and vanilla and thick milk chocolate, alcohol showing up around midpalate, sweetness growing towards the finish and just moderated enough by a bit of woody, twiggy dryness....low carbonation, truly fine and stylish.
Hereford & Hops Dopple Bock;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Sampled this beer at the Great Taste of the Midwest in Madison WI. Even though my scores on this are accurate and well researched, ?Da Man? wants me to say more about the beer, so I will. A small brewery located out of my hometown that makes average beers at best. Then again people in Wausau drink Bud on a regular basis, so this probably taste like mead to the gods.

Hereford & Hops Christmas Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;[Growler, thanks Skyview] Pours dark brown with a yellowish-tan head. Aroma has quite a bit of spice in it--clove, cinnamon and something else that I couldn’t place. Some caramel malt was also in there. Taste was also spicy, but there was some roasted malt in the finish. Definitely not bad, but not my favorite Christmas beer.
Hereford & Hops Christmas Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;"A growler from Skyview. Dark ruby red color with a medium head. Aroma of cherries. The taste is really a mix of stuff: cherries, cinnamon, caramel, sweet malt, coconut. Someone made the pina colada comment, and that’s pretty accurate. I really enjoyed this. I nice change of pace from the usual ""mulled"" beer for Christmas."
Hereford & Hops Christmas Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;"Poured from a growler. Mahogany in color and fairly transparent. Aroma is scattered with random spice and polished sweetness; black licorice, clove, coriander, cinnamon, and banana. Dries out with a watered out cardboard downer at the end. Flavors are similar; molasses, cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, gingerbread, and clove with lots of black licorice and wet pumpernickel bread. A bit of heat in vanilla bean and bourbon type of sweetness. Palate is tight and and soft with moderate carbonation; finishes with a slow drying out of spiced fruit and dark sugars. This one is really all over the map in terms of flavor and aroma components; while complicated and not especially rounded, the messiness remains sufficiently unannoying and on the outside. Thanks Bob!"

Penn Dark;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;DATE TASTED: August 27, 2015 ... GLASSWARE: 22 oz. Pilsner... OCCASION: having returned from the annual soccer coaches’ meetings... APPEARANCE: dark red, almost burgundy body that supports a one-finger brown head... The head settles swiftly to a resilient ring and little else in the middle... too dark to track its effervescence... AROMA: candied, almost cherry cola in its hints... Slightly doughy, with minimal hops... PALATE: slightly warming, slick, almost flat... Dry, medium-bodied.... TASTE: an odd, vegetable flavor begins the profile... Grape, cola, some earthy elements that redeem the initial effect... Cough drop and raisin also are suggested... Not the compliment to the pilsner... OVERALL: Drinkable and steady, but not a beer that can be called a standout or a strong representation of its style... A beer that could use some dimension to its flavor profile... Peaty like scotch, in a strange way...
Penn Dark;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Tap @ Hotel Monaco. Dark brown with thin head. Smells like dark bread. Balanced- not too bitter or sweet.
Penn Dark;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Deep chestnut brown beer with a thin light tan head that subsides quickly into a surface film. Rather non-descript nose of nuts, brown sugar, and pumpernickel, but you have to search for all of it. Flavor is more pronounced with an initial candied nut sweetness with layers of caramel and brown sugar that is quickly set off by a smoky bitterness. Rather light on the pallet, this is a decent beer.
Penn Dark;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Dark brownish color with aromas of dark malt, light cocoa, some bread and a touch of caramel. Flavors follow suit decent funkel, liked it not crazy but true to style.

Penn Oktoberfest;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;DATE: September 22, 2016... OCCASION: another thirsty Thursday... GLASSWARE: Orioles mug... pours a sparsely bubbled, clear, copper orange body that sports a fizzy, swiftly dissipating head that smears to irregularity... a light caramel, lightly roasted aroma with some tea and lemon grass as well... sips a smooth, sweet, slammable body... a bit flat, lacking the effervescence of a more lively fest... the flavor profile is on par with its aroma, with caramel malts and flowery hops leaving a sweet, diminishing aftertaste... in all, not much of an experience, but a beer that will still occupy the palate during the fall... many other fests register a maltier return...
Penn Oktoberfest;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;At the source: pours amber with a white head. Aroma is caramel malts. Taste is much the same. Caramel malts and light hops . Easy to drink. Basically what one wants in an Octoberfest.
Penn Oktoberfest;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;355ml bottle. AMber/orange pour. This is jsut a watery and mildly offensive oktoberfest.
Penn Oktoberfest;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;This is a tolerable decent take on this style if maybe not perfectly fresh by the time I got my hands on it. It’s cloudy orange w/ a scant white head. Nose has some nice lavender hop nots w/ a subtle malty undertone. This is quite bitter and a bit grassy which does at least cut the body a bit as it’s a little too sweet. This is a pretty solid American take on the style.
Penn Oktoberfest;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Can’t believe I’ve overlooked this until now. Powdery malt aroma. Standard longneck, Bavarian checkered label, festive couple on the label featuring a woman with large biceps. More on the blonde side than the bronze side. Tangy, a little honeyish, light straw, little notes of darkish syrup. Not bad, a little on the simple side. Medium to slightly light body, a few off metallic grainy notes here and there. ABC Liquors, Bull Run.
Penn Oktoberfest;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Transfer from BA review on 9-28-13- Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served an amber color with a little bit of an orange hue. Upon serving there is a one finger white head. The head persists for quite some time, eventually fading away to leave a decent level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is very malty and grainy smelling overall with just some lighter hints of sweetness. A lightly roasted malt aroma creates the base of the aroma with some smells of biscuit and a grainy bready smell mixed within. A light caramel and spice aroma are there as well, giving it a slightly drier Oktoberfest aroma overall. Taste –The taste, as one may expect from the nose, is a bit on the drier and maltier side. It begins with a little bit of caramel sweetness mixed with a nice roasted malt and crackery flavored base. As the flavor advances, the caramel fades while some spice flavors of some nutmeg coming to the tongue. The roasted flavors increase to some extent with a little bit of some other lightly sweetened fruit flavors of apple and pear mixing in. In the end, a grassy and herbal hop flavor develop giving it just the right hint of bitterness to create an overall roasty and still moderately drier malty flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is average in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average. Both are appropriate for the style and make for a rather easy drinking Oktoberfest. Overall – A rather decent Oktoberfest overall. A little more on the maltier side with a decent balance of spice and roast to create an enjoyable beer overall.

Refreshing, decent overall.
Penn Gold;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;355ml bottle thanks frank. Clear gold pour with a industrial-looking white head. This smells like a pale lager more than a Munich light lager. It has a sharp herbalness from noble hops, but otherwise it smells bleachy and watery. Maybe almost sarsaparilla. The flavor is undoubtedly all-malt but as if pabst changed thier recipe to be all malt. It is also a bit oxidized. It is not a Munich-style beer, and a mediocre to decent amero pale lager.
Penn Gold;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;This is not an ideal lager. It tastes okay but has a distinct hint of banana and clove phenols that should not be there at all and don’t really work with the earthy bitterness. It’s a bit sweet but not too heavy due to fairly vigorous carbonation. This is not even close to style but I suppose it is fairly drinkable.

The hop could use to be more present and defined, but there are some nice things going on with the malts.

Bell's Oberon Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;Canned April 24th 2019. Pours a lightly hazed orange yellow with a massive head of foam that shrinks but doesn't dissipate entirely. The nose has some wheat, sweetish to earthy malt, and some citrus hoppiness. I taste wheat, earthy malt, some bread, and a mild citrus hop bite. Very smooth but not lacking in flavour. Just the right mouthfeel for the style..not too spritzy, not too heavy. Finally got to try it and I am pleased as punch.

Bell's Special Double Cream Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout;Bell's Brewery;"Aroma is roasted malts. Picking up slight sweetness. The brewer says this beer is ""completely dairy-free"", but the aroma suggests otherwise. Very nice. Deep black appearance, topped with a tall, thick, dark tan head. The head has very good retention, taking its sweet time receding. As it does, it leaves tan rings of lacing and forms a thick domed top. Taste is coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, a subtle lactose-like sweetness, with a balancing touch of bittering in the finish. Mouth feel is creamy while also being on the thin side of moderate. Finish is dryer than the initial taste would lead you to expect, with the roastiness lingering on the tongue. This is a classic English stout at its heart, which has the creaminess and smoothness of a milk stout. Extremely well executed."
Third Coast Old Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bell's Brewery;A 12 fl. oz. bottle, batch 13615, packaged on 30th October 2014, so almost 5 years. Poured into a snifter glass. Using a careful pour leaving much of the sediment in the bottle, it was a deep copper amber colour with no head but some sparse spotty lacing. Aromas malty, sweet, dried berries, dark fruit, blackcurrant, plum, prunes, fig, caramel, syrupy and a touch floral. Tastes moderately sweet, dark fruit, plum, prunes, raisins, fig, caramel, brown sugar, candied orange liqueur and a hint of mixed berries. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, definitely pleasantly surprised by this as it has aged well. I’m pretty sure I meant to drink this earlier, but I simply forgot about it. In any case I’m not a huge fan of Barleywines, but this was a very nice sipper with great complexity.

P- Full body, average texture, average carbonation, lingering bitterness. O- Drank at 4 years vintage to the date. I purposely cellared this knowing it was a classic for the cellar yet I didn't know how long to wait. Wish I had several to play with. For some reason, I decided to open it today, I guess to celebrate my brother's first day as an airline pilot and my terrible week at work. The nose was beautiful. Taste was very good too but didn't meet the expectations the nose set. Didn't love the floaties in the appearance, but who am I kidding, this was a stellar beer. A lingering bitterness at the end that I didn't love as it warmed. Really curious to try this at different ages now. Deserves a higher rating than I gave it. I bet with a year of age I'd have given it closer to a 4.5

Deep reddish brown, rising bubbles, topped with a tall, thick, creamy light tan with streaks of darker tan head. The color glows garnet red with a backlight.

Taste is toasted bread, hints of sweetness without ever becoming sweet, with very mild bittering in the middle, which fades toward the finish. Some coffee-like flavor, but not quite there. Hops add a bit of spiciness to the mild bitterness. The finish is mid-way between sweet and dry, with the caramel and toasted bread malts taste lingering on the tongue. Body is medium, toward the substantial side, good mouth feel from the carbonation. Overall, an excellent brown ale. The hops and bittering are nicely balanced by the toasted bready malts.

All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, spices, maple/sugar/molasses, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV with the mildly bitter/spicy/drying finish. This drinks like a spiced up American barleywine. So much going on, but it is perfectly balanced with rich malts/sugars and earthy spices. Nothing feels overwhelming or out of place. A really enjoyable and unique offering. Glad I was finally able to try one of these. They change the spices every year."
Bell's Eccentric Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Bell's Brewery;Very old rating found on a loose page while cleaning, possibly from 2010 RB gathering in Grand Rapids - Dark amber-brown pour. Hugely malty brew. Very sweet. There's a little bitterness there that keeps it from being cloying. Nice dark fruit notes. Full bodied.
Bell's Eccentric Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Bell's Brewery;From Jan 2008 I got this as an extra in a great trade with hoppymeal. Thanks Derek! This pours from 12oz bottle a very dark brown with about a 1/2 head of tannish foam. Still enough foam to put some nice lacing on my glass. The smell..well, I got a good whiff as soon as I popped the cap. Caramel malt and dark fruit hit my nose buds in abundance. The nose reminds me of a good English BWSA. The taste has a huge caramel malt profile and is delish! That caramel is followed by some very nice dark fruit character in the way of raisin and plum and fig. Wow. This is one tasty brew. It has a medium to medium thick mouthfeel and it finishes with that caramel malt/dark fruit goodness. Hell of a sipper in my book and the alcohol just shows up as some warming after the swallow. It's most welcome for this rather cold snowy day here in Casper. Btw, there *is* some bitterness here that I notice mostly when I swish the beer in my mouth and it's a dark chocolate bitterness. Very nice and a good balancing factor to the caramel malt sweetness. I think Bell's did themselves proud with this brew and I wouldn't hesitate to drinking this one again! Thanks again, Derek! My taste buds are very happy right now.
Bell's Eccentric Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Bell's Brewery;12oz bottles (both 2003 and 2005 vintages side by side since I thought they were different ticks) in tekus. 2003 lighter brown, 2005 darker brown, little to no head on both since they’re like 12+ years old. Aroma of sweet malts with caramel (2005 a little fuller and more dark fruit/chocolate notes), some spices, floral/bitter hops, faint EtOH, and some dark fruits. Flavor the same. Smoother texture. Interesting beers for sure, but not really my style.

Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bell's Brewery;12 oz bottle. Aroma of malt and caramel with a hint of chocolate. Pours a darker brown into the glass. Even though it is dark, the beer is quite clear. A little thick, tastes quite sweet with a delicate touch of bitter. Tastes malty with notes of caramel and chocolate. The taste of booze is well hidden. A heavier beer, makes a decent sipper.
Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bell's Brewery;12 oz bottle poured sent over by JStax. Thanks, Jeremy! Bottled 1/23/2013. Haven't tried this fresh, but glad to try it at this point either way. A dark, reddish brown pour, rocky tan fizz head. Explosion of caramel and molasses, despite the description advertising a hint of said features. Smooth malty constant with this. This is definitely rich, but I wouldn't call it too sweet. Lingering caramel finish. Very nice, unique brew here.
Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bell's Brewery;Bottle in Seattle. Thanks for saving this Andrew. 2013 bottle. Foamy, eggshell head on copper brown. Nose of deeply oxidized raisins and bitter dark grains. Sweet molasses and nuts. Deep oxidization throughout. Dry finish, a touch chalky. A bit unusual, probably past it’s prime, but it’s solid. And tasty.
Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bell's Brewery;From 2d2dspuma. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 4. Bottled 19 Jan 2016. 28+ months after bb date. Typical notes of a doppelbock still here but drier than desiderable. A bit boring. No foam at all
Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bell's Brewery;"Aromas are very heavily malt oriented - caramel and bread with hints of raisin and perhaps clove. Very low hop presence. Color is an attractive reddish-brown with a small light tan head; very little lacing. Taste is slightly sweet, fruity (raisin, plum), malty. Low bitterness. Slightly lively carbonation which works well with the malty, slighty sweet taste. The fairly high alcohol level is not overly apparent. Overall it’s fairly good though a bit too malt dominated for my taste."
Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bell's Brewery;Nice aroma of toasted oats and caramel. Medium bodied, toast, raisin, slight bit of vegetable and chocolate. Nice finish. Very clean. Great for the style.

Aroma of malty caramel, stone fruit, slight apple. Medium to full bodied; round, soft and silky mouthfeel. Flavor is very malty and sweet; caramel, bread, raisin and other mixed fruit."
Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bell's Brewery;Bottle from K&L in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is caramel covered apples, some raisin bread, prunes. Taste is raisins, prunes, mild apple juice, toasted dark bread. Dark fruit and then dark fruited bread and then dark fruit dry skins...very dark fruited bread vibes.
Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bell's Brewery;A very solid doppelbock. Very malty sweet, plenty of caramel and a little apple. Medium bodied and deceptively powerful.
Bell's Lager of the Lakes;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bell's Brewery;From the 12 fl. oz. can dated 08/05/19. Yellow, carbonated pour leading up to a lingering foamy white head. I get grass at first on the aroma and then a white bread character but not toasted like I prefer in my Pilseners. Also a sort of olive oil sensation. Light body. The taste has a breaded sweetness and a moderate bitter and dry finish. But generally it is crisp and clean.
Bell's Lager of the Lakes;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bell's Brewery;Pours golden with a thick white head. Aroma of light and airy malt. Taste has bready malt notes, slightly floral. Palate has yeast and Pilsen malt notes. Pretty good.
Bell's Lager of the Lakes;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bell's Brewery;12 oz can. Smells of corn and lemon. Hazy, darker yellow in color. Tastes has an initial sweet burst, followed by an almost astringent bitterness. I taste the malts, not much hop character, just bitter. Woody bitter finish. Don't care much for this one.

Bell's Lager of the Lakes;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bell's Brewery;From a can to a glass. Pours a clear light gold color with a monster frothy creamy head. Aroma is sweet malty grains upfront with a corn note. Taste follows the aroma with a slight earthy hop note and a slight bread note aswel. Medium to light mouthfeel. Excellent Pilsner!
Bell's Lager of the Lakes;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bell's Brewery;nice pilsener. a good lofty mouthfeel. simple but tasty beer. glad we have bells in Vegas finally.
Bell's Lager of the Lakes;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bell's Brewery;12 oz can. Pours a pale gold with a dense long lasting thick white head. Big scents of fresh baked bread. Tastes of astringent hops balancing the malt and an incredibly dry astringent mouthfeel. Super drinkable and still complex enough to intrigue. Another winner from Bells.
Bell's Lager of the Lakes;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bell's Brewery;Can. A nice enjoyable Pilsner. The only faults I have is the one dimensional flavor profile. Lacks the complexity of great pilsners. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bell's Lager of the Lakes;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bell's Brewery;It pours golden with a full white head. Head retention is excellent. It have very good clarity. It has a light herbal and bready aroma. It has moderate bread flavors with a balance in the hops which is an herbal and spice combination. The flavor is clean. It has a medium body with moderately high carbonation. Overall, a clean refreshing pilsner with a good balance between the malt and the hops.

King Royal Amber;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;King Brewing Company;Disappointing. Thin and soft and, well, beery, in the sense that the aroma and flavour reminded me of the days of Schlitz and Blatz and beerz that end in z. Hey, a plug for this brewery though - this is the worst they've got and it's at least fair. the food is great and they have two REAL dartboards ...
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;Bottle from Belo Vino. Poured a clear dark brown color with a moderate frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Medium sweet toasted malty aroma. Medium body. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Drinkable brew.
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;12oz bottle, no date. Clear brownish ruby with a tiny bubbly beige ring. Upon cracking the bottle, I took a quick whiff and got the unmistakable aroma of beef jerky. Nosing the glass, it’s still there, but not as up front. Besides the salted meat, some light roasted and toasted malts and brown sugar round out the aroma. No smoked meat or jerky in the flavor, but there is still the salty characteristic. The roast comes off as a little ashy, unfortunately, and there isn’t any brown sugar to be found. The fact that there is almost no carbonation at all makes the body seem much heavier than it is. Not too bad despite a few shortcomings.
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;Medium brown with no head from tap at brew pub. Medium body. Can taste the roasted nutty flavor. Nothing extreme. Good Session beer.
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured almost no head with just a few medium sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent almost uncarbonated brown colored body and thin oily lacing. The aroma was malty with mild brown malt and sweet notes. The semi-flat mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and mediumly tingly at the finish. The flavor contained notes of sweet malt sweet and brown malt. Not one that I would likely buy again.
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;Bottle. Very small tan head that mostly diminished, no lacing, visible carbonation, transparent, and a reddish brown hue. Nose was malty, chocolate, nutty, and mildly roasty. Flavor was malty, chocolate, roasty, semi-sweet and thin. Tingly, thin mouthfeel. Light body. Very quaffable, almost too easy to drink. Decent, but most probably will not seek out again as there are better ones out there of this style.
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;Almost opaque, dark brown with ruby highlights and a thin, tan head. Toasty, nutty aroma with some milk and dark fruit as well. Lightly, toasty sweet, some caramel malt character that is balanced nicely by acidity and fruity esters. The only downer is a subtle rubbery flavor in the finish. This is actually the first beer from King that did not taste like it was made with unfiltered, highly chlorinated water.
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;I messed up and poured this out with an entire glass full of foam. Bottle is from Jim (walleye) Thanks! Pours dark brown, with a giant head (probably due to me not letting it settle out after shipping). Smells malty, rich, fruity. Taste is sweet and has a sort of metallic aftertaste that is not unpleasant, but not really desired either. Its sweet and pleasing to drink, as most brown ales are. This could easily be a session beer. Not bad at all.
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;"(12 oz bottle: Obtained 06-Mar-06 in trade with Sully, thanks Mike!) While I’m not wild about the way this beer smells, the flavor isn’t bad. Chocolaty, lightly roasty, and only mildly sweet and bitter, the beer has a pleasant flavor but isn’t especially generous with sharing it. These elements are also present in the nose, but there is a bit of ""stinky feet"" that’s distracting me. Pretty decent mouthfeel for a brown ale: medium bodied from start to finish, average carbonation, maybe even a slight creaminess in the finish. Dark ruddy-brown in color, a bit darker than mahogany, with only slight transparency. The light-tan head is slow to form on the pour, lazily building to a quarter inch, and then fully dissipating after awhile. Nothing spectacular here, even within the brown ale category, and it’s quite uneventful, but the chocolate flavor is pleasant enough."
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;Bottle: Dark brown, thin cream colored head, foamy, spotty lacing.   Somewhat musty nose, light malts, very light sweetness.   Pale roasted malts on the tongue, slightly nutty, milk sugar like sweetness is soft.   Moderate body and mouthfeel, somewhat creamy in texture.   Clean finish, very light sweet roasted malts, with accents of lactose and coffee.   Light example, goes down easy thats for sure.   Thanks SuIIy for the bottle!
King Crown Brown Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;King Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a small light tan head that dissiaptes to a very thin outer ring. Nose is roasty caramel malt, brown sugar, roasty grain, toasted oat, little bit of firepit. Medium body with a light fizziness and a film. Flavors of ashtray, light roast notes, stale nuts.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;@ Michigan Beerfest-on tap-pours a white head and hazy gold color. Aroma is some hops, some light/medium malt. Taste is some hops, some light/medium malt. Easy.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;Hazy light orange body, big puffy off-white head. Floral, citrusy hops aroma. Toasty body with piney, citrusy hops, and definitely on the bitter side. Biscuity. Not bad, but fairly nondescript.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;Bottel @ union street saloon Detroit, MI. Pours a nice golden orange color with a small, white, foamy head. Nose is hoppy and sweet with some light floral notes. Taste is lots of hopps with some caramel and malt mixed in creating a sweetness. Bitterness in the finish and a dry throat feeling.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;Tap: orangish amber color with decent white head that fades fast. Besides a little citrus, there is almost no aroma. Taste is all bitter hops. Just o.k.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;Tap. Medium amber in color. Nice off-white head. Nice lacing. Citrus and piney hop aromas. A bit hop dominant in flavor but not horribly so. Lingering grapefruit rind flavor in the finish. Decent.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;"Bottle: Very sweet and malty aroma. Lots of caramel and only very light hops. Pours a dark transparent amber with a decent off-white head with fair retention. Very nice lacing. Very malty. Lots of caramel in the flavor. Only a touch of hops in the finish. Light caramel aftertaste. Real soft mouthfeel. The one word that describes this beer the best would be ""caramel."" Not as hoppy as you'd expect in an American Pale Ale, but still very good. Probably not the best example of the style because there is so little hops in the flavor."
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;Hazy apricot. Fine layer of dusty-white foam. Graham, caramel, toasted plantain, and floral hop nose. Touch of pine and phenols. Dense-bubbled carbonation with some fluff. Hops and citrus acidity are kept at bay by melted caramel and toasted malt flavors. Slick fruitiness persists throughout. Tight piney hop emergence balances the rich malt and doughy yeast abundance. Improves toward the finish, with the malt becoming earthier, and hop leaves supplying a long bitter aftertaste. Lingers with a tailing of persimmon skin, tropical fruit, and chalky-edged malt textures. Middle of the road, but enjoyable.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;Very yeasty nose with hints of caramel and piney hops. Very gritty and rough around the edges. The piney nosed hops seem soapy. Balance is lost, grittiness wins.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;This Pale Ale pours out to a bright amber with a generous head. Aroma is that of bread dough and pine needles. Tast is that of pine, biscuits, and caramel. This is a very drinkable Pale Ale. The balance is wonderful. It isn't dominated by hops as many pales are. The malt stands out and makes mouthfeel and swallow as smooth as velvet. This could be a session Pale if there ever was one.
King Pale Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;King Brewing Company;Tap. A nice smooth pale ale with hints of wonder, but not a standout Pale Ale.
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;Poured to a dark brown almost a black. Smells almost of a smokey coffee and coco. Taste like a watered down roasted malt. Aftertaste fades quickly.
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;Black as night pour with tan head aroma of coffee and chocolate and molasses taste of a hint of liquor and chocolate hint of vanilla after taste really solid beer. Thanks fletchwadd
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;At the brew pub.....Black pour into a shaker with a nice tan head.subtle roasted malt notes. Same with the flavorwith a hint of chocolate, coffee and unfortunately water.but it did finish strong with a touch of vanilla amid all the other flavors. A solid pour. not exceptional or bad but good.
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;On tap at King...Dark brown/black color with a big billowy mocha head. Aroma is typical coffee and dark malts. Flavor is the same, coffee and roasted malt. Palate is a bit too watery, carbonation is adequate. Pretty tasty but unoriginal porter.
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Falls short of the depth and complexity that a stout needs...something potentially wrong with this explosively fizzy beer...deliberate care must be taken not to fill your glass with foam. Head is somewhat acidic, almost citrusy, while the beer itself is flat chocolate and smoke w/ not much else.
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;On tap at the BrewPub Pours a deep rich dark brown (almost black) with a light brown head. Roasted barley flavor with hints of molasses/caramel. Very smooth-drinking beer. The batch on tap right now seems to be among the best of this variety from this brewer.
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;Dark brown/black body with a small tan head. The aroma is lots of coffee, dark chocolates and molasses. The flavor is coffee, milk chocolate, molasses, caramel and raisins. Medium/light body is soft with soft carbonation. Pretty good. I’ve been impressed with King lately.
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;"12oz bottle, courtesy of artusory. Thanks, Ryan! Pours a murky, dark-brown color; light-tan head with patchy lacing. Dense, milk chocolate and floral aroma; generous and sweet, with a bit of roasted malt. Medium mouthfeel: roasted malts and milk chocolate, in a velvety, lightly carbonated backdrop; slightly watery, but very drinkable and well-roasted. Medium, milk chocolate and roasted finish, with a hint of spice."
King Pontiac Porter;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Porter;King Brewing Company;Bottle, courtesy of artusory. Pours brown with ruby edges and a beige head. Very very nice roasty, mocha nose.

King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;Pours a deep brown amber color with minimal head. Full bodied with tons and tons of carbonation, could barely pour it. Dark malts, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and some dark dried fruit flavors. Finishes a little drier, but not my style.
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;This one poured a very very dark amber with little head. It smelled very sweet, perhaps of apples or even citrus. It went down smooth and finished very citrusy and hoppy. I would definitely recommend this brew and definitely have it again.
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;Picked up a single 12-oz bottle from Three Cellars in St Francis, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear dark copper amber brew with a, good lord, the thickest and lumpy off-white head to come out of a 12-oz bottle - even after it being in the fridge for a few days. Reading all the previous reviews, I have been warned. Aroma of toasted dark caramel malt, raisins, vanilla, fruity character with a touch of roasted nuts. Taste is medium to full bodied, well-carbonated with a metallic texture with flavors of roasted caramel malt, raisins, mild brown sugar and a touch of herbal spice. Finish is slightly dry and metallic with a roasted caramel and raisin aftertaste that slowly disappears after the finish.
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;Stupid sized tan head - BE AWARE (my experience obviously wasn’t the only one) with a chunky brown coloured body. Aroma of metal, raisins, nuts, cardboard and a bit of musty vanilla. Super carbonated mouthful of roasted malt, nuts, honey, caramel and some good oak. Aftertaste still has some carbonation, with a bunch of alcohol and a vanilla flavour that lasts. Overall, a bit too one-sided and mild for the style. Way too much head and over-bottle conditioned! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Merchant’s in Dearborn, Michigan on 14-January-2008.
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;Wow, I poured this into a Tulip glass and got about 2 oz of beer and the rest was head. The aroma was metallic and of slight caramel. The flavor was slightly metallic and caramel, once you get by the extreamly high carbonation. The body is light to medium with a dry mouthfeel and extreamly, did I say extreamly, not to mention extreamly fizzy carbonation. I had to pour this one down the drain, it was so heavly carbed I could not stand to drink it.
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;Aggravating pour - even being careful, I was left with 7/8s of a glass of sudsy tan head that took too damned long to settle enough to drink some. As more body became visible, I could finally spot the deep brown body, nicely highlighted in red. The aroma is old caramel and some orchard fruit. Nice malty flavor, sweet but not overpowering, with a mild earthy bitterness. Dry finish. The alcohol is only present in the warmth the ale brings. I would probably have rated this higher had it not been such a pain to drink. Three Cellars, Franklin, WI
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;Deep, dark brown with a big foamy head. Slightly malty aroma with a dry bitterness. Flavor was very astringent. Some malt and fruit but really overpowered by the sour bitterness. Don’t know if this bottle was old or it was meant to taste that way but it wasn’t good.
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;Bottled. Poured deep, opaque brown with an explosive cap of beige head. The aroma picked up lots of dry dishwater detergent that almost overtook the warm caramel notes.. this was not good. The flavor had lots of problems.. oxidation, sour notes, and more nasties drive this to an undrinkable state.. sharp alcohol and sours at the finish.. some caramel and darker fruits in there, but they don’t stand up. Sharp and ugly on the palate with a lengthy, boozy finish. Bad stuff.
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Poured with a huge off white head which settled down to a medium mahogany color. Aromas of dark fruits, caramel, light chocolate and lightly nutty. Tastes of chocolate, caramel, roast, and nuts. Fizzy body and over carbonated as the pour would suggest.
King Two Fisted Old Ale;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;King Brewing Company;(12oz bottle) 20-minute pour to let all the head eventually diminish enough to fit everything into my pint glass. Rocky beige head atop hazy mahogany body. Aroma is moderately sweet, raisin/prune, caramel, some smoke. Taste is medium sweet, smoke, brown sugar. Fills out with some caramel and raisin as it approaches room temperature. Overly effervescent medium-full body.

I love brewers nights. Golden pour, hazy. Thick cream head and lacing. Soft wheat, banana like aroma. I find it to be difficult to find an American made hefe that is both good and unique. This one isn't completely unique, but it's certainly not boring. Refreshing flavor. Light beer overall. Gentle wheat, floral presence, some lingering soft banana. Couldn't find anything to really complain about here. This is a hefe I would happily drink in many occasions. I'm in the mood for a good hefe all the time, but never have access to one.

Anacortes Belgian Ale;Anacortes, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival (GCBF) in 2001.

Light fruity pale malt, appley yeast, a bit of bubble gum top notes and some nice leathery, barnyardy notes. Brewer said this had only been on Brett for about 5 months, which is hard to believe considering how much the character comes through. Flavour is still quite sweet and chewy, but it should dry out nicely over the next 6 months or so.

Leathery, bretty aroma with woody notes. This is still very sweet...I’m actually surprised they’ve released it already as the brett has only begun to do its thing. Hints of alcohol late. Mainly lots of pale malt and peachy, fruity esters alongside light brett notes. Quite frankly, I expect significant changes in this beer over the next few months as the brett does its thing.

Wonderfully creamy head, thicker than latte foam and almost as milky. Sweet aroma, soft chocolate and roasted malts - with all that cream it reminds a bit of chocolate milk. I usually like to play grown-up and cast off these sweet beers as lacking depth, but this beer is just wonderfully crafted. The insatiable creaminess lays a smooth foundation for the mild roasted malt and smooth chocolate to flow on, sliding around all parts of the tongue on down the throat with ease. A slight bitterness in the malt is a slight distraction in the flavor, but despite this the palate here is sheer perfection. A dessert beer for sure - ends the evening wonderfully.

Some spicy malts going on here. Plenty of hops throughout with a lingering obvious bitterness. Dry as a result. Some pine, and extra bitter, bold grapefruit notes. Not really of the juicy variety that floods the market these days. More classic feel. Pretty good.
Anacortes IPA;Anacortes, Washington, United States;IPA;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;On tap. Pours a cloudy tumbleweed color with a thin white head and light lacing. Smells very weak floral - minimal scent. Tastes bready and tangy with good bitterness. Aftertaste is nice but lingers in bitterness.

Anacortes IPA;Anacortes, Washington, United States;IPA;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Draught at Island Café, Oak Harbor Cloudy amber color with large head. Not much aroma, but the flavor is malty, and it’s well hoppy.
Anacortes IPA;Anacortes, Washington, United States;IPA;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;6% version at the brewery Hazy golden orange color, white head. Good strips of lacing while drinking Nose was full of hops. Pine, grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Very fresh and vibrant with touches of caramel backbone. Quite bitter. Lots of pine and citrus but easy to drink. Not sexy but very solid and easy to drink
Anacortes IPA;Anacortes, Washington, United States;IPA;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;On tap at Hopvine Pub in Seattle fall hop harvest IPA fest last month - this was by far my favorite of the 6-7 I tried. Pours golden with white head, nose has light fruit, citrus rind. Flavor is dominated by a punchy bitterness with lingering citrus rind bitterness into the finish. Fresh NW hops linger forever in a wonderful finish.
Anacortes IPA;Anacortes, Washington, United States;IPA;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Pours yellow, not clear but not hazy, finger off white head. Smell slight citrus hops, tangerine. Taste floral tangerine and citrus. Med bodied and smooth Simple but good.
Anacortes IPA;Anacortes, Washington, United States;IPA;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Sample at the Tap House Grill in Seattle. The beer is a slightly cloudy orange-amber color with a medium thin white head that dissipates quickly. Short strings of lacing on the glass. Hops, malt and citrus in the nose. Light-bodied with flavors of grassy hops, sweet malt and citrus. The finish is mildly bitter with a short hoppy aftertaste. Decent overall.
Anacortes IPA;Anacortes, Washington, United States;IPA;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Sampled at GABF 2012. A solid and simple IPA. Nothing fancy. No lemon verbena to make it better just a good mix of hops. The bitterness lingers favorably through the sips. Sessionable. Maybe a pale ale?
North Channel Harsens Hefeweizen;Chesterfield Township, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;North Channel Brewing Co.;Another Brew i recently tried while up in the U.P. I love the banana flavor with the creamy after taste
North Channel Harsens Hefeweizen;Chesterfield Township, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;North Channel Brewing Co.;This is certainly one of the best Hefeweizens out there. I didn't give it highest marks on flavor because I prefer that it be a little less bitter, allowing more banana and clove to come through. But this is certainly a beer to go out of your way for.
Quay Street Raspberry Wheat;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Quay Street Brewing Company;12 ounce glass at the brewpub. Cleargolden. A pronounced raspberry aroma. Flavor is that, too. Berries are like what would come on ice cream and are sweeter and less bitter than expected. For what it is this is pretty good.
Quay Street Raspberry Wheat;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Quay Street Brewing Company;tap. golden with minimal head. the raspberry adds to the aroma, but the taste is pretty generic. not my thing.
Quay Street Raspberry Wheat;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Quay Street Brewing Company;This is a wheat beer designed for easy drinking and to appeal to the masses. It serves it’s purpose, but doesn’t serve my stomach well. It is very generic and nothing I would want again.
Quay Street Blue Water Pale Ale;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Quay Street Brewing Company;I had this on-tap at the Quay Street Brewery... well, eh. I didn’t mind it. There’s really not much to say about this beer. To me, it almost tastes like there are adjuncts in it. The description said it’s for hopheads, but I felt it was more malt-heavy than hoppy. The breadiness almost comes off as cheap malts with some almost corny flavor. It isn’t bad by any means, but it’s very average. Pretty drinkable, but the description ought to be changed. A pretty sweet pale ale that’s pretty forgettable.
Quay Street Blue Water Pale Ale;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Quay Street Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewpub. Veryclear and coppery. This begins with some kind of bitterness that seems artificial and is akin to zest. Some hop bitterness grows. There is also a sweet side with rich malts. The bitterness wins here. Not a fan.
Quay Street Blue Water Pale Ale;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Quay Street Brewing Company;tap. amber with very small head. light hops. minimal flavor. not much to get excited about here.
Quay Street Nutting Better Brown Ale;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Quay Street Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewpub. Dark brown opaque with an inviting tan head. A nice nose of nuts and chocolate. It is thinner than it looks. Chocolate, nuts, grass, and light roasted notes.
Quay Street Nutting Better Brown Ale;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Quay Street Brewing Company;tap. brown with small head. nutty malts, but somewhat thin on the flavor. doesn’t seem like a true brown ale to me.
Quay Street Tug B Oat-Meal Stout;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Stout;Quay Street Brewing Company;Nearly black. Raisins, coffee bean and some fruit in the nose. Smooth with a good coffee presence, nice hops. A little too raw with the coffee bean flavor but a nice straightforward stout.
Quay Street Tug B Oat-Meal Stout;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Stout;Quay Street Brewing Company;In the commercial description I read, the writer noted that this brew is carbonated with a nitrogen/co2 mix. Not being a fan of nitrogen, I was wary. I would have to say, however, the mix leaned towards the co2 and the nitrogen provided a nice creaminess. Lots of toasted flavor. Another brew that did not really reach out and grab the tastebuds. But worth a try.
Quay Street Porter 442;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Porter;Quay Street Brewing Company;A decent porter... but nothing to write home about. Roasted malt and chocolate in the aroma and flavor....sweet, but not sugary sweet. Goes well with a heavier meal.
Quay Street Porter 442;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Porter;Quay Street Brewing Company;This might be my favorite out of all of them. Sweet, clean tasting, roasted malts and light chocolate. Easy to drink. Very nice to drink with dinner. Not a big fan of strong porters, and this was nice.
Quay Street Porter 442;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Porter;Quay Street Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub Dark brown, with a sienna glint and finge. Rim of silky ivory. Too clear. Light aroma of nondescript sweetness. Flavor is a horrible watereddown trash porter. Artificial sweetness, overly bitter roasted notes, and peculiar biting character. Bad penny hops back end. Some light sea salt. Overall, pretty bad.
Quay Street Porter 442;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Porter;Quay Street Brewing Company;Very dark brown but there is some red shine, little head. Light coffee and roast in the nose with some dark fruit at the end. Light coffee at the front of the body, then the hops kick in ligktly throughout. An okay porter, a bit one sided with the hops, but they aren't over-the-top either.

Hops flavour are herbal and spicy with some grapefruit, pineapple gummy bear, and faint pine. Medium body, medium carbonation, almost crisp feel."
Lake Superior Special Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;A very enjoyable ale. More of a bitter or an English Pale Ale than an APA, though, to my taste… which means I like it a lot. Aroma is a bit weak, but everything else is wonderfully done. Good balance, not over hopped. Good palate and good aftertaste.

Pours a very slightly hazed orangish/tan golden with smaller dense white head. Very subtle nose, more forward on the malt with the hops just adding a bit of orange sweetness. Touch of bitter astringency up front, light pine and citrus, definitely get the lightly toasted english malt character. Different take on an american pale and fairly enjoyable. Thanks Tim.

Lake Superior Kayak Kölsch;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Growler purchased at the brewery.

Lake Superior Sir Duluth Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lake Superior Brewing Company;30-Aug-14 (12-oz bottle) This beer pours a black body with over an inch of tan head that settles very slowly to a quarter inch and refuses to diminish further. The aromas smells quite sweet and malty, with brown sugar and wort coming to mind right away, but also dark bread and flaked oats. On the palate, the medium-high sweetness matches the aroma, and it's fully malty, with cocoa mix, cola, brown sugar, and chocolate candy. The sweetness seems to mask the complexities of the malt, and even the oatmeal isn't particularly noticeable. The beer is medium in weight, with the residual sugar making it seem fuller than it really is. Carbonation is medium but soft. Overall, I certainly find this to be enjoyable, but I'd prefer a little less sugary sweetness.
Lake Superior Sir Duluth Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Pours cola black with tan head. Scent is coffee with some nutty components. Taste is chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Finish is very crisp and abrupt. Body is medium and smooth. Easy drinking beer for a stout. Nothing incredible in the taste but good nonetheless.
Lake Superior Sir Duluth Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Tap at the source in Duluth. Pint glass pour in nitro. Cola brown with a healthy tan head. Nice lacing. Nose is assertive coffee with a chocolate undertone. Taste is mild but leans on its coffee tendencies. Some sweetness definitely comes through. Silky smooth mouthfeel like a glass of thick chocolate milk. Lasting bitterness at the end but not to its detriment. It?s pretty good but nothing all that special.
Lake Superior Sir Duluth Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #43. Draught pint at Sir Benedict’s in Duluth, MN, August 2008. Near-opaque black, moderate bit of head, slow-diminishing, little lace...roasty, lightly chocolaty nose, decent enough if unexciting...flavor profile however is flat, dull, cardboard with little of interest...sweet, a bit of roast, but little to describe...overcarbonated and thin on the finish.

Lake Superior Sir Duluth Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Pours clear dark brown with a frothy beige head. The nose surprises with the fact that this smells more like a nutty brown ale than a porter. Anyhow.. Hazelnut, malt, chocolate powder but all very restrained and thinish. The taste is also on the weaker side again with nuts and maybe a German bock quality.. I’m missing some body and roasted omph! An easy drinker..

Lake Superior Sir Duluth Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lake Superior Brewing Company;"From a bottle with no date code (black mark to you, Lake Superior). Very dark / black with a tan, small head. Smokey & sweet malt aroma with a hint of fruit. Very light carbonation, as befits the brewer’s description of this as an English style stout. Smokey roastiness and fruit dominates the initial taste, followed quickly by a sweet maltiness. Smooth and mild, with a slightly subtle bitter aftertaste. This beer is all about the malts. But, then, with no date code, how would I know? The brewer lists no ABV, but it has a bit of a boozy taste, so I would guess it at 6-7% (annoying to not have this information on the label.). Mouth feel is moderate, with a nice creaminess to it. Overall, I enjoyed this beer a lot. Lake Superior: please provide more information on the label (date, ABV, IBU, etc.). The six pack carton advises, ""For maximum freshness, keep refrigerated."" First, no, don’t drink this at typical American refrigerator temperature. This beer is definitely better at English pub temperatures, maybe 50-55 degrees F at the coolest. Second, the concern by the brewer for freshness is a bit ironic given they do not date code. Regardless of my pseudo-rant, I like this beer and will be buying more from time to time."
Lake Superior Mesabi Red;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Thanks Gary. This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a ruddy burnt amber color with a sly transparency about it. Slight carbonation could be seen rising to fill a one finger white head that dissipated immediately. Stringy sticky lacing. The nose takes on rustic crisp nutty malts. Low amount of toffee, caramel and toast aromas. Light grassiness and some earthy in the balance of the hops. The flavor takes the malts sweetly to run into the aftertaste and finish. It’s quite smooth in the entire flavor department. On the body, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice smooth sessionable feel rolling about. Moderate carbonation. Overall, did I have an old bottle? I don’t see any dates anywhere, but there’s nothing remotely robust about this. However, if I did, there’s nothing off or skunked about it, hard to say, but perhaps I may have round an amber ale that ages nicely.

Pours a dark red color, with a medium sized tan head which dissipates into a thin layer that sticks around with a bit of lacing left behind. Smell is very heavy on sweet malt, syrup, molasses, dark fruit, and hops. Taste is rich with sweet malts up front, more dry bready in the middle, and finishes with some hop bitterness. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and medium bodied. Overall, a nice red ale. Not my favorite style, but this is a good one.
Lake Superior Mesabi Red;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Pours a very nice dark amber. Aroma is malt heavy, caramel and just a hint of hops.

Lake Superior Mesabi Red;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;The bottle I had was labeled Fitger’s Red. Not a particularly memorable beer.

Lake Superior Split Rock Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Lake Superior Brewing Company;12oz bottle from mtjoseph, thanks Mark! Pours a deep brown colored body with a finger-width, dense, frothy and creamy, light tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is caramel with some toasted grains, cocoa, a light dark fruitiness, a hint of earth, and a touch of odd sourness. Flavor doesn’t have that odd sourness and is better, but is pretty thin. Caramel, cocoa, and toast up front before this gets a bit grainy with a few dark fruits. Cocoa comes on more towards the end as this finishes thin, but fairly sweet and slightly dry with a light earthy bitterness. Medium length aftertaste following a thinner feeling, light, smooth body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a thin, straightforward, somewhat forgettable beer. Eh...
Lake Superior Split Rock Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Bottle. Very deep mahogany pour with a nice light brown head.

Lake Superior Split Rock Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Thanks to Bob for the bottle. Poured deep cola brown with a lovely initial cap of beige head. The aroma picked up toasty molasses first and foremost with caramel and a hit of earth backing it up.. sweet overall. The flavor found the same maltage at the core, along with a little honey.. prickly alcohol and dark spices around.. sticky sweetness on the finish. Light-medium bodied and warmer than expected on the palate.. lots of residual sugars on the finish.. not quite enough heft on the feel.. still a solid drinker.
Lake Superior Split Rock Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Another solid brew by Lake Superior...pours a dark brown with a ruby glow to it. Minimal head and lacing. Aroma is nice at first with chocolate, roasted malts, caramel and coffee. After it warms, I got some dark fruits and sort of a rotten alcohol note. Flavor is only slightly sweet which was definitely nice since I’ve had bocks that were overly sweet. Palate is creamy, thick and really lovely except that its a bitter over-carbonated. Solid, drinkable and worth the few bucks.
Lake Superior Split Rock Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Lake Superior Brewing Company;This one had the coffee and caramel look and taste with just enough hops to balance. Sampled at the Chocolate Moose in Ely, Mn.

Lake Superior Split Rock Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Lake Superior Brewing Company;A season brew, picked up a single 12-oz bottle from Cellars LexLarp in St. Paul, MN. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thick and lumpy off white foam head. Awesome lacing. Aroma is a surprise. I picked up scents of sauteed crabmeat and shrimp. Alsohas scents of, cherry, dark chocolate, floral hops and roasted dark barley. Taste is smooth with a taste of orange and coffee. Palate is light carbonation and creamy. Finish is a little spicey with a coffee aftertaste. This seems to have character more like a dark Maibock than a dunkler bock.
Lake Superior Split Rock Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Lake Superior Brewing Company;"12 oz. bottle. Tart aroma of chocolate and noble hops. The smell is simplistic and not very strong. Pours a sparkling brown with an amber hue and a small amount of beige head. Sweet, roasted dark malt flavor with chocolate and soft lemon notes and a touch of hops bitterness. Not bad but not much to it; bland. Watery, smooth, and oily in the palate. Low in carbonation. Easy to drink. Lake Superior Split Rock Bock is drinkable but utterly forgettable. It stands as a big disappointment from a brewer that I otherwise have found to be strong and underrated. It seems to come from the Shiner school of bock blandness. This in fact could pass for a mere American dark lager."
Lake Superior Split Rock Bock;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Bitter tasting, dark redish-brown in color, not much lacing. Aroma not the best either.

Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Tap at Pig and Fiddle. Deep amber to brown pour with a small soapy head. Some citrus, plenty of caramel malt, and a bit of lingering bitterness at the end.
Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Sampled on draught at Lake Superior brewery’s annual Oktoberfest in Duluth, MN. Pours a hazy brownish amber with a creamy off-white head that quickly dissolves to a ring and film top. Aroma of sweet citrus peel with a light caramel malt character. Taste has a good balance of caramel malt, grapefruit some lime zest and a touch of toffee. Finish has a mild bitter aftertaste then a dry caramel flavor. This IPA has a character more like an American Pale Ale than an IPA but is still drinkable.
Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Bottle picked up my dad about a year ago. Worth noting because this one has all but lots its hops. Pours a dark, murky amber with a thin white head. Nose is incredibly bland- mild sweet malts, water, blah. Flavor follows suit. Blah.
Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;(12oz bottle) Hazy copper body with enormous beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, floral, cookie. Taste is moderately sweet, caramel, cookie, floral, light grapefruit. Medium body, some stickiness. Not an IPA in the American sense (APA? ESA?), but still a tasty treat.
Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;poured an off yellow/orange color w/ a fairly small head. SMelled lightly hoppy hints of grass and something a bit off.. maybe a bandaid is the right description. Palate was fairly weak w/ not much of a coating on it. Flavor was lightly bitter, some nasty grainy stuff... just not good at all, maybe spoiled, maybe shitty... who am I to guess.
Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;It has been almost a month since I have had any beer. This one looked good, a crisp refreshng IPA. Instead I get an overcarbonated infected burning band-aid of a beer. There are some that say we should not rate infected beers. I beg to differ. People need to know to avoid beers from brewers that have infection problems. Unfortuante.
Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Stunningly overcarbonated without the ick of infection. Annoying, but not disgusting. When it calms down, hazy copper. Smells of pine and grapefruit, bit woody. Flavor is quite malty, strong toffee notes, some caramel sweetness as well, balanced by pine and citric hops. Bit biscuity and toasty. Decent, but perhaps overly busy. And way the hell too overcarbonated, the second beer from Lake Superior I’ve had that’s been that way.
Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Very over-carbonated, borderline gusher but not infected. Head settles rocky and sticky over a cloudy amber body. Herbal (minty), woody hops in the nose. Lots of malty sweetness balanced by a tannic hop bitterness. Obviously British hops.
Lake Superior St. Louis Bay IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Sampled this at the Autumn Brew Review. Very tasty--really hit the ol’ IPA hop spot! One of Lake Superior’s better efforts. Wish I could get this at home.
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;Light amber color with a modest light beige head. Grains, caramel and syrup scents. Floral flavors and pink and purple jelly beans come to mind. Stale feel. Not quite catching this one. 2/11
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;Small (1 or 2 oz.) pour, from a 12 oz. bottle, at Beer Dabbler Winter Carnival. Consumed on 2-6-16. Listed as “St. Croix Maple Cream Ale,” but I suspect it’s the same as the “St. Croix Maple Ale” listed here. Pours a hazy, slightly murky bronze with beige head. Juicy sweetness, presumably from the maple syrup, in the aroma. Maple syrup sweetness with dry, bordering on chemical, finish in the flavor. Good maple syrup/sugar flavor presence. Light to medium body. Smooth in the palate.
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;Bottle (Old Notes-Brewed by August Schell)-Pours a darker amber with a decent sized head. Aroma of malt, hops, and faint maple. Taste of the same with the maple becoming more prominent. this light bodied brew is well balanced and goes down smooth.
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. Pours dark amber with a foamy off white head that slowly fades. Aroma has sweet malts and floral hops. Taste is bitter floral hops and malt. Palate is thin and dry. This drinks nice and is not maple forward like you would think with its label.
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;September 15, 2012 on tap at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis. Light brown pour with some head. Maple and hops in aroma and taste. Light bodied.
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;Thanks to Bob for the bottle! Poured clear honeyed orange with a short cap of off-white head. The aroma picked up maple initially, with dank, really weird yeast and vegetal notes following.. another touch of sweetness on the back of the nose.. I love maple, but I didn’t love this. The flavor found maple and honey at the core, supporting bright, spicier peppery hops, unpleasant vegetal notes, and other sticky sweetness.. very assertive and off-putting on the finish. Light bodied with moderate-plus carbonation on the palate.. sharp.. not good.
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;"Pours an amber gold with a nice sized off-white foamy head. Nose is faintly of straw. Average viscosity. Taste is a bland mix of hay/straw with a weak note of hops on the finish; not sweet. Only an average beer that could pair with cold cut sandwiches, pretzels or nuts."
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;Bottle. Brown-orange pour with a nose of brown sugar. A bit thin on body. Taste is brown sugar, caramel, and maple syrup.
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;On tap Winterfest 2009 St. Paul MN. Hazy yellow color, minimal head. Pale malts, notes of mild maple syrup and maple sugar. Light dry finish. Some floral notes to finish, this is delicately flavored, but not lacking flavor. Would make a good session beer.
St. Croix Maple Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;St. Croix Brewing Company;Picked up single 12-oz bottle at Cellar’s Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN. Pours a semi-hazy orange amber brew with a thin white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of light caramel malt, some flowery hops, some light brown sugar, and a touch of saltine crackers. Taste is medium bodied, well carbonated with flavor or light caramel malt, maybe a hint of maple syrup, and some herbal spice. Finish is slightly gritty, metalic with a semi-sweet caramel aftertaste. Hard to pick up any maple syrup in the finish.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;From the previous ratings there may have been a recipe change in the 7 years since the last entry. Dark dirty Amber. Almost no head. Light pepper scent. Flavour is sweet with a pepper tingle around the mouth and a nice light burning sensation and in the throat.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at Cellar’s Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN. Pours a clear copper penny amber brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves behind a thin film and some white ring. Aroma of light caramel malt, a touch of vinegar and some citrus hops. Taste is medium bodied, well carbonated with flavors of light caramel malt, some citrus and a touch of BBQ sauce. Finish is slightly metalic, some caramel malt and then a clean finish. Where’s the pepper? I don’t think Cave Creek Chili Beer has to worry about this one.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;Sedement filled dark amber body. Chunks are large and dark. Ample off-white head with a sweet aroma closer to maple than the maple ale’s scent. Sweet body with an interesting flavor characteristic. I’ll have to try a serrano chile pepper for reference. ...ah there it is. A bit of pepper bit in the very finish.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;Had another taste of this pepper beer at the Between the Bluffs Beer fest yesterday. Almost no difference between it and the maple. A slight hint of pepper in an dark amber beer. Average body, malty, no hop. Short finish. Forgettable.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;Pours a clear copper color with a thin ring of foam. The few bubbles left on the side of the glass while drinking the beer can hardly be called lace. It doesn’t smell bad at all, but a chile beer should have some chiles in the aroma, no? This one does not. I am tempted to say that it does not have any chile in the flavor either, but I found that if you take a large sip, hold it for a while, press it against the roof of your mouth, close your eyes, and think about jalepenos, you will sooner or later perceive a mild chile pepper sensation, and even a spicy tingling on the tongue (which may only be from the carbonation, however). And so, in short, a disappointingly mild pepper flavor, only mildly more spicy than a bell pepper. And no where near as fresh.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;"Tried on tap at Winterfest. The brewery was recently purchased and this was a new batch of Serrano Ale. Dark orange with a small off-white head. Aroma was of malt, hops, hints of serrano peper, and flowers. The taste was similar. This is not a spicy beer. It has hints of serrano pepper that lingered into the finish. Overall, the beer tasted ""light""; as if it was missing something."
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;I could taste almost NO hint of any pepper in this stuff. Could be that the Cellar liquor store I bought it at, had it on the shelf for a few YEARS! The date was 6/05 on the bottles! It tasted just like a regular ale to me with a verrrrry slight heat at the end, i would like to try again when its fresh though for god sakes.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;Darker than expected, orange-copper. Nose peppery, chemical, some actual sweet malt. Flavor is surprisingly not incredibly horrid. Vinegar and peppers, but, being serrano, it’s not like there’s much flavor beyond the heat. There are a few actual fat malts here, but the chemicalized pepper character is too much. That being said, it’s surprisingly not actively horrible.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;Subtle heat index is the key here...this is not CAVE CREEK...mild heat and solid pepper flavors make this one a pretty decent beer to wash down some chips and salsa. And, by the way, it’s the FIRST chili beer.
St. Croix Serrano Pepper Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;St. Croix Brewing Company;"A light lager body with simple pepper flavor. Tha that is black pepper, which dominates the aroma and the flavor. I think they achieved what they were going for; this isn’t so spicy that Minnesotan, who would typically describe barbecque sauce as ""hot,"" couldn’t drink it, but the result is a beer that has the flavor of black pepper with almost no heat at all. There is no fruity flavor at all, as the description promies. Worth a try; at least it is not offensive."
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;I sampled two wheat beers - this one, and a hefeweizen. This was clearly the inferior one. It was lacking in a strong yeast-forward note that I expect from a wheat beer. It reminded me somewhat of Blue Moon - unoffensive, but nothing terribly memorable.
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Cloudy yellow, white head. Nose is bland with some faint fruit notes. Taste is wheat, grains, fruit notes.
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;Tap at the pub. Cloudy light yellow color. White foamy head. Light grainy aroma. Light sweetness. Flavor is dry grains, grassy hops, moderate bitterness. Crisp finish. Lingering dryness. Refreshing. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;Pour is hazed bright yellow w/ thin sticky bright white head...smell is yeasty banana and some soapy notes...taste is wheaty and lightly sweet with the normal banana flavors...a stronger than usual bitterness finishes it ou
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;Average wheat. Faint to no aroma. Average light golden color. Wheat up front with a little bitterness but a slight buttery hint at the end. May have been pulled off the fermentation too soon.
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;"Sampled at Joplin Macadoodles Springfield Brewery tasting event, 1/9. Weakest of the six offerings of the brewery; watery and not a whole lot of flavor. Nothing overtly bad or dislikable about it, but just a rather generic and bland wheat."
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;Keg @ Springfield. Hazy light yellow with a tight eggshell white head. Pretty bready nose. Wonder Bread, slight herbal hop and white pear. Taste is pretty similar. Very bready, sort of heavy. Strong carbonation. Pretty flavorless, inoffensive. Meh.
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;"Solid wheat beer; would taste good on a hot day. I'm not really a wheat beer drinker but I can say I've had a few better, a few worse, and a lot like this in the middle. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;Light and sessionable, though the overall flavor experience was subpar. Has a light grassyness that turns to stale hay at the end. Tried at the brewery in 2014.
Springfield Walnut Street Wheat;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Springfield Brewing Company;12oz bottle 7/20/13 (Brown Derby-Springfield)-38° in Hurricane Glass-Pours a cloudy golden with a small white head. Aroma of wheat, grass, and grains. Taste of wheat, banana, and grass. This light bodied brew is not bad and would be good on a hot summer day.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;Tap at the brewery. Pale yellow pour no real head. Aroma was corn and malts. Some very mild hops. Thin and watery body. Flavor was corn, metallic flavors, and toast. Thin body. Very smooth. Below average.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;Draft @ Springfiled Brew Co - Pale, straw color, foamy head that fades. Not much aroma. Mild flavor. Pretty basic pale lager.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;It poured a golden color with very little head. The aroma was slightly grassy. The flavor was about the same. One of the least favorites, especially with the other taps they have.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;on tap-pours a white head and pale yellow color. Aroma is sweet grain, some earthy hops. Taste is sweet grain, some earthy/spice hops.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;Draft… Clear, straw-colored lager with a small, fizzy, white head. The aroma is of green apple (acetaldehyde) and pale grain. Medium-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Although well-balanced with very decent toasted grain flavor, there’s a bit too much green apple (acetaldehyde) for my palate and system. Short, crisp finish.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. The body was medium gold with a bright white head. The aroma was malty bread with some sweet potatoes. The taste was lightly bitter with some potato skins. There was also hay and lots of malt in the finish. Clean.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;This was an interesting beer. It offered a much smoother body than most of its genre as well as some peppery spice. No adjuncts detected. A nice beer.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;A lovely lady with more character than looks. Draft at the brewpub, pours gold going on pale with thin white head. Grainy nose, faint hops. Favor is surprisingly juicy and caramel-malty, almost fruity, with a serious and moderate bitterness for refreshment and balance. High on flavor and drinkability, even if she ain’t so exciting to look at.
Springfield Mueller Munich Lager;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Springfield Brewing Company;Another brew courtesy of Brett. Decent brew overall. Pours a nice bright golden colour, with a big fluffy head and plenty of biscuit malts. Aroam is slightly hopped, taste is of malts and fruit.

Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;8/27/19 - Springdale, AR - Macadoodles Beer, Wine & Spirits - 12 oz bottle. Hazy medium copper pour, bubbly snow white head. Aroma is fruity and tropical, pick up some passion fruit. Flavor is akin to the aroma, tropical fruit abounds, some tangerine and grapefruit come to mind, Pick up some caramel sweetness. Decently thick mouthfeel.
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;Seems like a well-made pale ale offering is essential for this kind of brewery (much like many of their other offerings at SBC) and this one was clearly well-made. I was pleasantly surprised by the hop punch both in the nose as well as the finish. Often the hops are far more subtle in these flagship beers, but this one was pretty solid!
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Clear dark gold, white head. Aroma of citrus and caramel. Taste is citrus, pine, and caramel. Meh.
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;Tap at the pub. Clear copper orange color. White foamy head. Moderate hoppy aroma. Light citrus hops and pine. Soft bready malt. Flavor is light bready malt with a definite hop presence. Citrus notes, some grass. Restrained bitterness. Soft finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;Pour is a clear amber with a small white head. Aroma is a big sweet malt with a very minor hop. Flavor is again more sweet malt and even less hops in the flavor. Finish is bitter but also watery. This was not a top quality beer. Almost no hop presence and way too sweet.
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;Pours deep translucent golden with an off white head. Mild citrusy hop aroma. Flavor of citrus zest and pale malts with some mild grassy notes. Mild hoppy finish, mixed with flavors of biscuit and european malts. Not all that bad. A clean APA pale with a slight european twist.
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;I had this at Springfield Brewing Co. Pours orangish with a white head. Taste biscuits, nutty, caramel. I thought this was ok. I could drink this again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;Pours a amber orange color. About one finger head. Some retention. Nice lacing. Aroma is grassy hops. A little citrusy. A little roasted malt. A little nutty, and a little fruity. Overall, it’s not that great. It’s mostly hoppy and citrusy, that other stuff is subtle and you have to dig around to find it. Taste is a little hop forward. Yeah, the malts are making a strong show, but hops win out. It’s close to the hop profile of it’s far east brother. So as for taste-hops, citrus, and maybe some pine. Mouthfeel is quite dry. Medium bodied. It’s sweet to start, but the bitterness kicks in late, and lingers. It is an interesting mouthfeel. Overall, I find this a little boring. I would drink it again, but it’s not one that I would say, ’Hey, I haven’t had that in a while!’ and then buy it. If I were offered this or a Sam Adams whatever, I would probably take the Sam Adams. If I were offered this or a Bud Light, I’d probably take this.
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;Average. No real aroma to speak of. Orange color with a white head. Medium to light body. Some citrus bitterness and a light malt background. Pretty safe beer.
Springfield Paul's Pale Ale;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Springfield Brewing Company;"Bottle; an orange to amber color pour with wan off white head. Aroma of orange/citrus, cream and caramel; fairly mild aroma, but it had sit there a bit. Flavor was mild, but pleasant. Biscuit and caramel backbone with a subtle sweetness and citrus presence. Just need a more pronounced flavor"
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;Pours an average brown with a nose of deep, fresh coffee grounds. Flavor is typical session coffee grounds and roasted nuts. Average mouthfeel. Meh.
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;good shit brown color. Very mild chocolate aroma to it. It was kind of creamy/milky in the body. It was aight, but it didnt pack the punch that i was looking for. Fucking figure it out springfield, try some gonzo and get inspired to make a kick ass porter instead of a session one.
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;This poured a deep brown color with white creamy head that lasted throughout. It had a cascading effect that was reminiscent of a Guinness pour, but I found this to be a much better beer. Flavor and aroma was of chocolate, toffee, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel was great. I really enjoyed this beer.
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;Draft at Springfield Brewing Co. Beautiful dark brown beer with a tremendous creamy, foamy head that lasted until the end with a huge lacing on the glass. Great aroma of malts with a hint of hop presence. Great taste of dark malt, coffee and bitter chocolate with a bit of hop bitterness.. Nice thick, creamy mouthfeel that lets you know this is a substantial beer. I really enjoyed this one.
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;"Pours a absolute pitch with a medium-tan head that lasts the whole glass. Beutiful lacing. Aroma is very roasty, dark chocolate, dark-roasted coffee, and caramel dominate, slight hop ""pepper"" Flavor is again coffee, chocolate, tobacco, and a sharp hop contrast about 3/4 of the way through. Mouthfeel is very smooth, though a bit thin. Almost a great beer, but as is, a good beer."
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewery. Poured from a nitro draft. It was on their black sheep tap which is a rotating tap of their different stouts and porters. Poured a deep dark brown. Toasted notes. Taste of toasted and roasted malts; coffelike. Not at all a bad brew."
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;I believe this brew also goes by the name Mueller’s Black Sheep. It as decent. Nothing really note worthy. I tasted more like a black lager to me. A thin, crisp taste, with a medium to high amount of carbonation.
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;This one stood out at the session largely, I'm afraid because it had the most taste and character of the on tap brews. It has a fair amount of roastiness and some other interesting bitters to accompany enough malt to keep my attention. Very pretty too - I'm not sure how they got the Guinness cascade affect - must be the tap.
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;Draft. Found my notes from our visit during our 2001 Rt. 66 trip, so this is a little out of date. Yet it's a fine establishment that can use a shout out here. This porter is almost stoutlike in its smoothness and color. Low bitterness when sipping, but it starts to come through in the aftertaste.
Springfield Mueller Porter;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Porter;Springfield Brewing Company;Very faint chocolate milk aroma. Nitro cream head, looks nice but obviously fake. Insert lame breast augmentation analogy here. Opaque black-brown color. Cocoa and coffee flavor, quite a bit of roastiness. Starts off chocolatey and sweet but drying out and becoming far more roasty. Low bitterness throughout. I have to think this would be a little better without the dulling effect of nitrogen on flavor, palate and aroma.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;On tap at Bones. Clear copper with an off white head. Scent caramel. Taste is sweet and sweet.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Pours a darker amber with a large head. It tastes of sour fuits with hints of spice and citrus, it also has a tarte taste. Not so good.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Bottle from Brennan’s bought by Grandpa Bill because he liked the name. Pours a foamy orange brown, somewhat hazy, with some bubbles and some floaties. Aroma has some caramel, some clove, some wood. Taste brings some sweet fruit, caramel, some cloves. Finishes somewhat sweet and quite short. A bit amber-ish, but not very.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Sampled at the 5th Montana Brewfest in Bozeman. Hazy amber. Aroma of caramel and medicinal notes. Taste is also medicinal.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;I can deal with it. Strange that it is called Yellowstone, oh, Yellowstone valley! Then it’s not false advertisement.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle. Pours an unclear amber-brown with a thin beige head. Taste is of hops, floral, malt and some caramel. Is a little sweet. Similar, but lighter aroma. Reminds me of tea. The body is full and a bit chewy. Finish is rather clean with a bit of dryness. Pretty good and easy to drink, but falls a little flat.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Bottled. Poured medium orange with lots of sediment suspended in there.. short, somewhat sticky cap of off-white head. The aroma picked up sour redder fruits and berries joined by some honey and bright grainy sweetness.. no real goodness to note. The flavor wasn’t any better.. sour, sticky, and unpleasant with fruity and honey character again.. ugly, far too long finish. Lighter-bodied, but again tacky and ugly on the palate.. the sourness shouldn’t have been there.. I just bought this, so it really shouldn’t be infected. Gross.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Soap bubbly white head on top of a slightly hazy amber brown colored base. Candied orange vanilla among the classic Amber malt aroma. Some vanilla and light citrus helps to even this medium bodied, malt centered beer out. Sticky sweet, with some delicate vanilla pungency. Creamy and smooth enough to session out, I still found this one a little uninspired. Better as it warms up a little though.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Wow, first review in over 4 years. It’s time for an update: pours from the bottle a straight up translucent amber colour. Small creamy beige head with a nice whip cream like top. Stays creamy till the end. Aroma is very pleasent. Fresh floral notes with a hint of sweet undertones. Taste is very smooth with butterscotch and vanilla notes all the way through. A good buy for sure.
Yellowstone Valley Wild Fly Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Had this beer on 9/29/1999. Aroma is a nice crystal malt scent. Color is a mild brown with fair carbonation and light head. Taste mild, nutty and smooth. Starting with a medium malty body that goes down smooth. Finish is a light malt flavor back by an easy bitterness and has the slightest hop flavor. Overall it’s a very well balanced and refreshing brew.

Yellowstone Valley Renegade Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;"Renegade pours wonderfully leaving a medium head that adheres well to a pint glass.

Yellowstone Valley Renegade Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Murky copper with medium beige frothy slowly fading head. Aroma of pale malt, sweet malt, fruit and plastic. Taste is somewhat sour and off kilter and has mild fruit, floral and sweet malt characteristics. It’s a bit tough to choke down and I’m not having fun watching the Packers get clobbered by the Saints but the leader in the ESPN beat the streak contest lost at 24 so my hopes are still alive at 20.

Yellowstone Valley Renegade Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Aroma a bit floral, earthy and malty. Appears deep red with light foam. Flavor is good bitterness, citrus tang, slight bite and creamy caramel. Aftertaste complex mix of lemon sour, caramel malt and tartar. Beer has an interesting complexity but not a memorable consistency.
Yellowstone Valley Renegade Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Sampled from 12-oz bottle via last summer ABA 07 trip. Pours a clear orange amber brew with a fizzy and fast dissolving white head that leaves behind some lacing and a white ring. Aroma of caramel bready malt, sour apples and plenty of yeast funk. Taste is medium bodied, caramel malt and over the top sour apples. Has to be another infected beer. Memo to self... road trip to Billings in ’08 and try the beers locally and fresh.
Yellowstone Valley Renegade Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a pretty deep red with brown highlights. Malty on the nose. Slightly malty, sour/sweet on the palate. ESB? Really? Where’s the hops? Finishes dry and malty. Inoffensive.
Yellowstone Valley Renegade Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Bottle, mild aroma a bit of caramel, and very light hops. The amount of head was rediculous, very foamy and long lasting, took at least five minutes to pour this brew. That was the highlight, there was nothing wrong with it by anymeans, but it was definately lacking hops to be an ESB.
Yellowstone Valley Renegade Red Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Rusty reddish brown color, lightly hazed, no head to speak of. I see a few bubbles rising, otherwise I might think it was flat. Moderate caramel-honey malt aroma is pretty nice. Caramel malt flavor up front, also somewhat fruity. When it first starts to get just a tad too sweet, the hops kick in for a nice balance. But the aftertaste is sweetish, something like a subdued caramel apple. This sweet flavor really lingers in the aftertaste. Medium body? Lighter body? It depends. I found both. The first couple sips were heavier, then when I got used to it they were lighter. I will settle with this: it starts medium bodied, and finishes a bit lighter. But overall - medium. Carbonation a bit too mild. Hops in the aftertaste missing completely.
Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;On tap at Bones :(. Amber pour with a white head. Scent is very mild sweet. Taste is sweet.
Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Had this at the brewery. Pours a very light yellow color. Aroma is citrusy and slightly yeasty. Taste is lemony and sour, slight wheat flavor in there. Mouthfeel is thin and lightly carbonated. This beer is not very good.
Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Bottle. Pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Sediment adds some haze.Aroma is tart with crabapple notes. Tart dry palate, apple and unripened pineapple flavours. This doesn’t fit my notion of a crystal weizen.
Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Bottle: Golden orange pour with a modest white head. Nose is wheat and light citrus, somewhat more of a deeper fruitier backbone. Tastes crisp enough with the wheat and malty tones, more citrus and that same deep fruity element. Not like any (of the few) German Kristallweizens I’ve tried, but better than a lot of the wheat ale counterparts.
Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;"Alright! Kristallweizen! Haven’t had one of these in bloody AGES! Of course there’s a good reason for that, but let’s try not to go into this with any preconceived notions. Pours into my Maudite glass a transparent orange, with just a small amount of murk/haze. A small, thin, white head forms, and doesn’t stick around long, leaving a thin persistent white ring. Nose is actually quite pretty; fresh wheat, clean malt notes, some nice citrus, and a hint of perfume here as well. Flavours are... Oh God!!!! This tastes AWFUL!!! FUCK!!!! I’m not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn’t THIS!?!?!?! Flavours are tart, not quite infected-tart, but quite tart, no creamy wheat notes whatsoever, no nice citrus spice; just this awful, damp-cardboardy, tart mess. Really an unpleasant overripe fruit note is about all that separates this from the very worst malt liquors. Drain pour after a quarter glass. I just could not go any further with this one."

Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Orange-yellow, quite hazy, not exactly Krystal clear. Thin, patchy white head. Some sweet apricot in the aroma. Fruity, a little odd, but still enjoyable. Creamy and yeasty, medium bodied. Perhaps infected underneath the banana yeast tones? Sure as hell not a Kristal Weizen, but enjoyable enough.
Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle. Pours a cloudy golden-orange color with a thin white head that lasts. Taste is of wheat, grain and fruit. Similar aroma. A little bitter, tart and a tad sour, but makes the beer more enjoyable. The body is a little slick and a bit on the watery side. It is easy to drink, clean, refreshing and a good thirst quencher.
Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;I was about to say that I had a bad bottle, but judging from everyone else’s experiences, I would say mine was a typical bottle. Tastes like a bad sour ale. Tart wheat flavor that was thin and lightly acidic. Drank about half. Got used to it after a few sips but this is not good at all.
Yellowstone Valley Grizzly Wulff Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Dirty yellow with a soapy thin white head. Aroma of wheat, grain and soap. Taste is sour and tart, almost like a Berlinner Weisse and not consistent with other wheat ales I have had in the past. Went in expecting the worst and actually thought it was halfway decent.
Yellowstone Valley Black Widow Oatmeal Stout;Billings, Montana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;"From Dec 2007 Purchased locally. It pours from 12oz bottle a very dark brown with reddish hues and has a 1 finger head of tannish foam with some lacing. The smell is of roasted malt, some chocolate, and some caramel. The taste has roasted malt up front followed by notes of chocolate and some citrus. Hmm...I don't think the citrus is a welcome addition for me in this OS. Things were tasting pretty good until that ""sourness"" from the citrus hit my taste buds. Still, it's not bad. It finishes with a roasted malt bitterness, it has a medium mouthfeel, and the carbonation is medium. I'm still shaking my head over that weird sourness that *does"" mellow down a bit further into the session."
Yellowstone Valley Black Widow Oatmeal Stout;Billings, Montana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company;Draft at the taproom... thin black brew with no real head retention..

Route 66 Streamline Oatmeal Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Route 66 Brewery & Restaurant;Transcribed from my 2002 tasting notes, brewery has since gone out of business. Tasted on tap at brew-pub. Dark brown, nearly black color with medium beige head, poor retention, no lace. Fairly typical stout: bready malts balanced by roasted barley and slight hops bitterness. Faintly fruity yeast finish. Fresh, pretty good, not great.
Route 66 Streamline Oatmeal Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Route 66 Brewery & Restaurant;Draft - looked more like a porter. Was a translucent brown with almost no head. Way to thin and none of the creaminess that you normally get from an Oatmeal Stout. A little roastiness. Not very good.
Route 66 Streamline Oatmeal Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Route 66 Brewery & Restaurant;Pretty thin overall, but some good chocolate malt flavors and very dark in color. It was sweet, but I didn’t think it was overkill. I should have had a second to compare.

Route 66 Great Plains Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Route 66 Brewery & Restaurant;Draft at the brewery. This brew poured a large head of fine to medium sized bubbles that left behind an excellent lacing and an opaque black colored body with no noticeable carbonation in it. It had a strong coffee aroma to it and a smooth coffee mouthfeel. This brew tasted more like a stout than a Porter with its coffee flavor.
Route 66 Great Plains Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Route 66 Brewery & Restaurant;Faint cocoa aroma, along with a bit of coffee and hop. Deep brown-black in color with a light tan head. Malty, mocha-toffee flavor profile, definite semi-sweet chocolatey malt as well, and a nice, spicy hop bite.

Carolina Brown Ale;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Brewing Company;My bottle does not say nut on it, but the description above is the same description that’s on CBC’s website for Carolina Brown Ale @ 4.9%. Fresh malty bready aroma. Looks somewhat like iced tea. Peaty, English in nature. Leather, some cutting sizzle. Does not hide alky well. Finish is mishy creamy old country. Left wanting. No way is this in the same style as East End Fat Gary, Beaver Brown Note or Zuckfoltzfus Squirrel Bait. Shame.

Carolina Brown Ale;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Brewing Company;APPEARANCE: Pours brown in color, but it’s really more of a reddish-brown when held to the light. It also has really good clarity for a Brown. The head is cream colored, and stood about a finger tall initially, but settled pretty fast. There’s some decent lacing on the glass. AROMA: Chocolate, Coffee, Toasted Nuts, Tree Bark, and some Earthy aromas. TASTE: This is where this beer really shines in my opinion. It’s got really nice flavor for a thin low ABV Brown Ale. There’s a nice nutty flavor right up front, but it doesn’t take long before some really impressive chocolate/cocoa flavors start to sweep over the palate. There’s a bit of malty sweetness near the back-end as well. The finish is pretty clean with a touch of coffee. MOUTHFEEL: At first, the body seems to be a bit on the thin side for the style, but then all of the sudden there’s a powdery chocolate flavor that coats the mouth. Pretty low carbonation. MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: This beer was given to me as a gift from a friend who went down to NC. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I would definitely sip on this beer in the fall if I lived near the brewery. Cheers!

With a frothy off-white head that settles to a fair coating for awhile and then a ring. Not much lacing. Aroma is a bit of skunky bread. Taste is more astringent than expected out of a 'fest. Some sweet caramel malt that is buried by earthy noble hop bitterness, but very little flavor on the front of the palate. There is some nice nuttiness towards the finish. Mild carbonation and quite dry. I think Carolina Pale Ale is a very nice local (Raleigh) session brew, but even for a fan of Oktoberfest beers, this is just mediocre. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Carolina Spring Bock;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Carolina Brewing Company;Deep gold, almost amber hue. Caramel sweetness followed by a lighter herbal hop aroma. The taste is right in line with the nose while also allowing an almost grassy finish. The mouth feel is slightly sticky but not for long because the end is clean. Overall it’s a good bock but like most in this style I wish they were more flavorful and or a little stronger.
Carolina Spring Bock;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Carolina Brewing Company;This is a completely forgettable beer. There is no aroma to speak of, and the taste is of a beer, but cant be described much better than that. It’s fine, but I wouldn’t order it again.
Carolina Spring Bock;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Carolina Brewing Company;On draft. Light orange golden color, thin head. Sweet malty aroma, bread, honey. Taste is sweet, some bitter in the finish and higher than average carbonation. Pretty good overall.
Carolina Spring Bock;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Carolina Brewing Company;Copper pour with little to no head. Malty aroma, with some bread yeasts. Flavor was malty and hint of alcohol. Finish was slightly metallic. Drinkable but nothing special.
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;This was an almost perfect pils for the beach - cool and crisp, lightly sweet, a dusting of peppery hops. Plenty of flavor yet still light and refreshing. (OBX-2005)
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;pours a yeloow straw color with a nice amount of head. has a decent malt flavor and the finish is decent as well. a well rounded pilsner.
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;has a different taste than i am used to. not as crisp and clean as i was expecting, but hey, every beer is different. drank it from the bottle, because i dont really enjoy pouring pilsners- they all look the same, there is no point. has a fruity taste that i cant really pinpoint. still good, one of these guys better brews.
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Bottle pours a slightly hazy light straw, small creamy white head, attractive lacing, with soft carbonation.   Very light straw aroma with some pear mixed in.   Grassy up front, with a slight graininess.   Minor tinges of pear and flora blend in.   Not as clean and crisp on the finish as I would prefer, but still this one isn’t too bad.   Thanks goes out to ross8425 for the trade!
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;On tap at location. Good but not exceptional. Easy drinking, but I’d like a little more hop kick.
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Crystal clear straw body topped by small white head. Aroma is mild sweet, sharp herbal, some grassy. Taste is medium intensity bitter, herbal and moderate grassy, mild sweet. Medium body, not particularly crisp.
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Bottled. I'm not a pilsener fan. This was pretty good for a pils. Had a nice malty flavor with a hint of tan in the color.
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Very pale straw color along the lines of a light apple juice. Scant bright white head -- poor retention. Fairly effervescent. mild apple/pear/berry aroma - not all aggressive. expected a little more. On the palate it's attack of the killer bubbles. Water thin. flavor is mild cereal flavor with a very good hop finish. A little unbalanced in my book. Overall, a good American pilsner but does not measure up against better European examples.
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is grainy, malty and sweet. A light bodied pilsner. Malts are mild and kind of grainy and sweet. Hops are very slightly spicy. Typical pilsner, not a lot of flavor but lively carbonation. OK for a pilsner. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and dry. Aftertaste is grainy and slightly bitter.
Greenshields Pilsner;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;A very average beer which is not bad. Taste is ok, as is everything else. Of course, even an average beer is still a beer.
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Pours a three-fingered bubbly head, fades slowly and leaves a good lace. High carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy amber color. Nose is cidery. Starts and finishes with a sour cider flavor, not my idea of a brown, it may be off. No expiration date. $1.69 for a 12oz bottle from Super 7-Even Raleigh, NC.
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;uh? this could have been a bad bottle- i dont know. regardless, it was horrible. tasted like a sour apple jolly rancher with no body or any characteristics of a brown ale. ill give it points on looking good.
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;On tap at location. Nice nutty roasted malts without too much depth. This was very nice and easy-drinking but the mouthfeel was a little thin.
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;(draft) Clear, light copper. Aroma is sweet, nutty, caramel, light anise, nutmeg. Taste is sweet nutty, some caramel, finishes anise. Light watery body.
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Dark hazlenut/amber in color. hin, tight white head. Earthy and a bit nutty in the nose. malts certainly prevail. Very lively palate and a rich creamy, nutty, full finish. Since the brewmaster uses strictly German style brewing with imported malts and hops from Germany and the Chech Rep. It's not a beer intended to be remarkable in flavor, but consistent and very drinkable. Cleans up well too.
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;No head to speak of, thin flavor with no apparent aftertaste. Nice chesnut color. Easy to drink, but no real discernible taste. Not the best this place has to offer.
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;"One of the poorest excuses of a nut brown I have ever had. Weak flavor, no maltiness, no hops. As my girlfriend said ""A beer that is only good for getting drunk."" ReRate: After one more at a party, I say it still sucks, but not quite as much. the flavor didn't nearly taste as bad and disconnected this time. I guess the consistency is a problem for this one....."
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;This is an ale that i will speak highly of. It has a great taste and flavor, and I liked it very much!
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;............................................................................
Greenshields Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Upon its release from the 12-ounce brown bottle the beer sets in the glass deep amber to brown color with a modest frothy light tan head that erodes quickly leaving a thin veil of lace upon the glass. Nose has a nice nutty sweetness, fresh and clean to the senses, with the start sweet and the grain profile adequate, the top light in feel. Finish is modestly acidic and the hops a little light for my taste, aftertaste dry and a decent brown ale.
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;found this in my dads wine cooler. must be at least 5 years old and it did not hold up very well. similar to a farmhouse in aroma and flavor. finish’s sweet with a twist of skunk
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Wow, I just found out that Greenshields has been closed, and are reopening soon in the Triangle, NC. I found this in bottles at Peace St. Market, Raleigh. This one is dark straw with some hopcit and floral esters. The taste is less hoppy than many IPAs, but the malt is solid, and it is fairly well balanced.
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;I’m assuming I got a bad one - this was a serious drain pour. Usually Greenshields stuff is good - I’ll have to go back and re-rate once I’ve tried it again.
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;A decent IPA that isn't over the top. Has a kind of grassy finish, but still very drinkable.
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;im confused. this is a good IPA, but it has too much malt and too much of a malty smell. replace the malts with a strong hop presence and you could get a better than average ipa. all that aside, golden pour, standard ipa looking beer. this is better than highland IPA for NC brewed beers.. not bad.
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;A cloudy caramel color, with a fairly good bite. It leaves an odd aftertaste to me that I don't prefer, perhaps it's malt, but it's difficult to discern. It's not a beer I'd pick out of a crowd of IPAs. Quite drinkable, but I would order another IPA if it were at the bar and I had the choice. A uninspiring beer, but not bad. The head isn't spectacular, but it has a nice hops smell. An average IPA.
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Brownish amber, small coarse head, light hop aroma. Balanced on the hops side, with a good bite. Malt character comes through better after it warms a bit. Not a bad IPA, drinkable enough but not outstanding.
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;"Light pine, orange, pear nose. Good sized head with fair lacing. Amber, copper hazy appearance. Nice hop flavor - nothing overpowering. Light citrus flavors; mildly acidic with a dry fizzy texture. Solid IPA. Thanks to Trappist for the hook-up."
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Slight hop aroma. Nice malty flavor. Good hop aftertaste. Easily their best of the non-seasonal beers.
Greenshields India Pale Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;When I ate dinner at Greenshields pub I ordered the beer sample tray to. This was one of the beers featured on the tray. It is a light golden color and has a very rich and smooth flavor. It is an ale that could be served with any dish and would compliment it well.
Greenshields Amber;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;I suppose others may have had a bad bottle, but I’m lucky - I can get it straight from the source in downtown Raleigh. I have, in fact, never had it bottled. Greenshields is a gratifying beer on-site, with a smooth, strong flavor and a fair color. I recommend it to visitors - we locals already know...
Greenshields Amber;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;"uh oh, i have a feeling what ive been thinking was ""bad bottles"" of beer, is actually the beer. all of these beers smell the same, fruity and sour smelling like a jolly rancher. its amber in color, but for gods sake, is this a beer? there is no presence of hops, malt, whatever you think is in beer, doesnt appear to be in this. its not very good, i dont think i would recommend anyone to drink anything from this brewery. this beer is horrid. i think i liked their ipa actually, but all the others ive had, are sir- not worth a fuck."
Greenshields Amber;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Yuck! sour!!! is that how it supposed to taste? almost like drinking vinegar? thought I had a bad bottle from my monthly BeverageBistro.com initially, but when the next bottle tasted just as awful...I guess it’s not the place, but the beer!!
Greenshields Amber;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Medium brown color, Large head. Aroma is malty, nutty and sweet. A medium bodied amber. Malts are nutty and sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. This beer is a touch lactic, possibly infected. This is also the 2nd beer from this brewery that has this ‘quality’. Otherwise it’s pretty much a run of the mill amber. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and a touch sour
Greenshields Amber;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;(draft) Clear amber with off-white head. Aroma is mild sweet, some herbal, some pepper.

Greenshields Amber;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Not much aroma. Chemical taste - unbalanced malt flavor. No hops to mention, either. Somewhat ok, but not worth repeating unless its free.

Greenshields Amber;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;The beer after departing the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a reddish-brown with a fair to middling frothy light tan head that evaporates quickly leaving a sufficient sheet of lace to cover the glass. Nose is all malt, a bit astringent and the start slightly sweet with a light grain profile and the top light in its feel to the palate. Finish is crisply acidic and the hops adequate in their spiciness, very dry, drinkable.
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;wowo this ages great found this in my dadswine cooler must be 5 years old. thin airy head with light spotty lacing. coffee, smokey malts. finish’s clean
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;I hope I got a bad keg because, this is one of the worst stouts I've had. Has a hint of smoke in the flavor, but the body is as thin and fizzy as club soda.
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;"(draft) Clear mahogany body topped by beige head. Aroma is sweet coffee. Taste is bittersweet coffee, some herbal bitter. Medium body. Pleasant, ""accessible"" stout, with that unusual herbal twist."
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Pours out to the usual, dark color of the style with next to no head. Aroma is that of roasted malt and not much else. Taste is good, albeit it someone average. It is a bit on the thin side without a ton of oomph that many stouts give. This would be a good stout to give to someone jumping up from Guinness.
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Bottled. Average stout. Nothing really stood out. Tasted what it should be.
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;***WARNING**** ***BEWARE*** I’m more than a little hesitant to add this review as I think the two bottles I sampled were infected, but I will add my two cents on what was there.. ----------------Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and choclately. A light bodied stout. I think this bottle is infected as I am picking up a lactic wine like quality that shouldn’t be here. Malts are roasted and a touch chocolate. Hops and other qualities are masked by the sourness. Mouthfeel is thin. Rest is impossible to judge.
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Pitch black beer - no light escapes at all. Mocha chocolate colored head, smallish really but decent retention. 1st pass - muted coffee tones mixed with red wine. Not real agressive given the bold appearance. 2nd pass - still laying kind of flat expecting the aroma to jump out. Somewhat disappointing. 3rd pass - some malt hints trying to escape but still essentially dead. Time to taste this bad boy. good mouthfeel- there is real body here. The flavor on entry is straight ahead coffee that dissolves into a winey fruitiness at mid-palate. finish is strong and clean. Not the best stout but certainly among the better.
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;"What you see is what you get with this beer. This could be a beer from an English pub. Strong, almost bitter flavor with a high alcohol content. Not my ""cup of tea,"" but if you like dark beers you will like this one."
Greenshields Stout;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Dark hue with a nice oat/malt aroma. Smooth flavor domintated by oats with a lightly roasted espresso undertone. Very smooth, tastey maltedness. Finishes somewhat thin with a touch of bitterness.

Olde Hickory Crawdad Red Ale;Hickory, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Hickory Brewery;Draught. Yeah, this is most certainly red with a firm tan head. The nose is a bit musty with notes of bread, caramel, and basement air. This proves to be very easy drinking due to a general absence of any assertive character. There is mild maltiness present with faint traces of bark, suggestions of hard candy, and hints of biscuits. The beer is well balanced with no off flavors, it’s a suitable session drink.

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Endo India Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Beer Company;Old rating but more of an old school caramel and pine ipa. It was fine as I recall but nothing amazing
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Endo India Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Beer Company;Let me start out by saying that I am an American IPA hop-head, this beer was a disappointment. It looked copper and had nice carbonation, good head retention and even some lacing on the glass, but there was close to no aroma, maybe a slight hint of bitterness. IMO, IPAs should lure you in with the smell of cascade hops. There was a lot of malt character and very little bitterness in this beer. I would not call it an IPA, maybe an ESB or a pale ale. Very disappointing, drinkable, but I would caution the other hop heads.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Endo India Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Beer Company;Hoppy nose on this with some stone fruit notes. A little bitterness to the taste with a dry finish. Pretty thin overall characteristic to it. Predominantly muted citrus notes leaning towards more of a grapefruit like quality.

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Endo India Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Beer Company;A slightly cloudy golden appearance. The white head doesn’t last long. The aroma is reminiscent of outdoors before a rain. It tastes like an IPA with a lot of banana-like belgian yeast flavor. White lace. Punchy finish & good bite. satisfying.

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Down Brown Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;This is the best beer I’ve had by Carolina Beer Company, but that’s not saying much. This brown is OK. There were hints of roasted malts, the appearance was dark, on the border between brown and black, and the taste was palatable. I was able to drink it and I’m not a fan of dark beers. There was steady carbonation and nice head retention, some lacing on the glass (although I don’t care about that, thought I would mention it). Overall, an OK beer.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Down Brown Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Hint of malts in the aroma, flavor has hint of chocolate but a lot of water and carbonation. Very weak and flavorless.

Cloudy tea colored brown hue with a soapy beige head. The nose is slightly nutty but is faint. Flavor is also nuts with soggy grassy hop notes. Occasionally some cocoa peeks its head up. The balance wavers and alternates between malt and hops. In the endvitbis grassyband a bit sour. An ok brown but no better than that.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Down Brown Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;"THOUGHTS: Not bad flavor wise at first. Kind of interesting really but it became cloying and unbalance. I wouldn’t mind drinking it as a knock back a few kind of way but it fails on the the sitting there and analyzing it style that I use for rating. Very flavorful, but a little too much like drinking candy, which is especially bad for something that was so thin. The slight sourness wan’t enough to balance the sweetness, which is something that bitterness could have easily achieved. TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark orangey brown with red highlights and an average to large, tan head that mostly diminished and left fair to good lacing. The aroma was overly sweet and had moderate to heavy molasses and caramel; lighter mild and strong coffee; light hops; grape, apple honey, maple syrup, fruit, something slightly off, but interesting that I couldn’t put my finger on it and ever so slight vinegar. The initial flavor was moderately to rather sweet and ever so slightly sour; while the finish was heavily sweet, lightly sour, and slight to lightly bitter with an average to long duration. The flavor was overly sweet ad a bit cloying by the ned. There was caramel, candy, honey, hints of coffee, apple grape, a bit of raison or prune, maple syrup, and molasses, but it was all a bit watery and then a little bit of bitterness from the hops, but it was not enough to balance things out. The light to medium body was watery and oily with carbonation that was bit soft, but still tingly and an ever so slightly metallic finish."

Appalachian Susquehanna Stout;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Poured straight from the Firkin into a standard pint. This version has Chicory and Vanilla added. A - Pours jet black with a tiny bit of tan film for a head leaving no lacing at all down the glass. It looks completely dead. S - Smells of robust coffee, dark malts, vanilla, chocolate, and a very faint hint of earthy hops hiding in the shadows. The smell is the best part of this beer. T - Starts off with a nice kick of fresh brewed coffee slowly giving way to a mix of vanilla and chocolate sweetness with some dark roasted malt helping to round out the sweetness. The body is extremely thin, which is really ruining all these good flavors. The finish has plenty of dark roasted flavors, lingering for some time. I liked the flavors this one had but the feel really brought it down. M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. The feel is very thin and really doesn’t help this one much. Plenty of dark roast in the finish. O - I really wanted to like this one since the base beer is one of the only beers I like from ABC but I just can’t. The flavors were good but the dead look and watery feel ruined it.

Appalachian Water Gap Wheat;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);RB says this is rating #6222 for me, a 12oz bottle from the Wegmans in State College, mine claiming 4.9% abv. Nose heavy wheat with lemon- and orange-leaning hops. Pour hazy, dull golden with a soapy but bight white head. Taste medium sweet, a bit had and minerally, finishes bready, more lemon than before, some yeast to mingle lightly with the wheat, touch of yeast. Only mild carbonation but the feeling is heavy, much harder and heavier than a medium or even medium-full body should be. Has the low but persistent and altering bitterness of tonic water. Refreshes well enough, much more enjoyable when I think of it as flavored seltzer. [2018.07.15: 2.8]

Appalachian Jolly Scot Scottish Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Pours a hazy copper color with a thin tan head. A little caramel flavor with some toffee. Not too bad, but I've had better beers. Maybe it's because I got an old one!
Appalachian Jolly Scot Scottish Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);12oz bottle from Wegmans in State College, this one listed at a higher 5.7% abv. Nose sweet malt with brown sugar, undefined red berry, hint of scorchier roast. Pour rich copper that collects to more of a ruby-brown in the glass, head soapy tan. Taste sweet with very little bitterness, nowhere near a cloy, though. Bit of soapy cleanse and herbals top note but otherwise no hops, hint of peaty undercurrent but not dominant. Very pleasant simple brown malt throughout, a bit flabby but bolstered by pleasant berry. Medium body, not too heavy on the whole, purple floral character with time and volume, a minor joy throughout. [2018.07.15: 3.3]

Appalachian Jolly Scot Scottish Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);This is a good beer. Full bodied and full of flavor, it doesn’t get in the way of what you’re eating and it’s really smooth on the finish. After about a week in the fridge, though, it had lost significant head and carbonation. I was pretty bummed to see how it didn’t keep very long.

Well, that’s 3 strikes for ABC...I didn’t rate the Jolly Scot, but that, this, and the Mountain Lager have all been very dirty and poorly made drain pours. Oh well.
Appalachian Hoppy Trails IPA;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);I’m not as crazy about this IPA as I am about the Outta Focus. It’s hoppier than I tend to like and it’s kind of bitter on the aftertaste, but it’s not awful.
Appalachian Hoppy Trails IPA;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);"DATE TASTED: November 15, 2015 ... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint.. OCCASION: recovering from the family football game--I threw three INTs!--and a much less enjoyable Browns loss... APPEARANCE: rather light. bronze/copper body that shows reasonable effervescence; nearly clear; slight, fuzzy off-white head that holds to a swampy halo ... AROMA: resinous first impression; pear, wheat grass, some citrus, and melon; very little malts to speak of.... PALATE: fizzy, light and lively at the teeth; short at the finish, with a muted, astringent mouthfeel; medium-bodied and drinkable... TASTE: the resin is clear, mingling with citrus like grapefruit and orange peel...the maltiness presents itself more in the taste than in the nostril or palate; a reasonable sourness ensues... OVERALL: aptly named, ably fulfilling its hoppy promise, with a serviceable 6.2 ABV and a pleasant if not unmemorable profile..."
Appalachian Mad Cameron Belgian White;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);"Not sure if this was ""Mad Cameron"", but it was the Belgian Wit on tap. Crystal clear--must be filtered. Brisk carbonation with a light cream head atop a golden body. Piquant coriander nose with a twitch of urea across a thick wheat body. The nose fills with coriander, but then veers to oxidated cardboard. Lots of wheat character balance it out."
Appalachian Mad Cameron Belgian White;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at the brewpub in Gettysburg. Pours a cloudy light yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of lots of spices, especially ginger and nutmeg. Flavor features the spices initially with bready malt and citrusy notes in the finish.

Nice hints of orange peel on the nose. Nice fruitiness on the tongue. Finishes with some dryness which is nice since the beer doesn’t become cloying.
Appalachian Mad Cameron Belgian White;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Cloudy light-yellow/white, as a good wit should look, with healthy white carbonation. Aroma is dominated by herbal, weedy, spices- I’m guessing a significant yet even amount of orange peel and coriander. The flavor favors the citrus though, like fresh orange with some yeastiness and slight spice. Good, refreshing, undertones of sweet grain. The flavors are still separable unlike some of the best wits I’ve had (notably Ommegang Witte). Medium bodied. Good.

Appalachian Kipona Fest;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);I know it’s far from fall but I couldn’t help grab this. Bomber into snifter glass, clear deep rusty-amber with light tan head. Aroma of toast, brown sugar and faint earthy hops. Taste adds roast malt sweetness, caramel, nuttiness, light cocoa and fruity hop bitterness. Light-medium body, low-moderate carbonation, soft with roasty sweet finish. Pretty straight forward marzen.

Appalachian Pennypacker Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Pours dark brown with thin fine tan/brown head that dissipates to nothing quickly. Smells evenly of chocolate, roastiness, coffee, and refreshing hops. Flavor: the sweet chocolate hits first, then comes a nice mild roastiness that’s more like the burnt stuff on marshmallows than coffee, and after a couple sips you get the refreshing hops, which I might even relate to mint in the context. Both substantially tasty and quaffable. Everlything I like about dark beers can be found here.
Appalachian Pennypacker Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Growler from the Camp Hill location, consumed within a few hours of the fill. Pours ruby hued dark brown with tan head. The aroma is ashy with some chocolate, caramel, and marshmellow. The flavor is ash, roasty coffee, and a little bit of toffee.

Appalachian Grinnin' Grizzly Holiday Spiced Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);"I see the negative numbers, but I don’t get it. This beer is really delicious! It very well may become my new favorite ""holiday"" beer. The Grinnin Grizzly pours a light copper color with a decently-sized and fluffly tan head. The nose just smells like the holidays, with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, orange, caramel malt and a little bit of bready yeast. The same notes in the nose also show in the flavors, with lots of sweet malt, nutmeg, cinnamon, citrus, a touch of alcohol, some gingerbread and some light hops. This is a very well-balanced and tasty beer."

Appalachian Grinnin' Grizzly Holiday Spiced Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Went to ABC brewpub at Gettysburg (Gateway), wife ordered this draft. Served in a pint glass, clear amber color with white head. Aroma of pie spices (nutmeg and cinnamon stand out) and slight toasted malt note. Taste brings out even more of the spices (general pumpkin pie spices, slight ginger and allspice noted) and some nuttiness. Light body, moderate carbonation, watery with dry finish. I’ll join the other reviewers and say the spice balance seems off, bump up the malt and balance the spices more. Otherwise light sessionable holiday ale.
Appalachian Grinnin' Grizzly Holiday Spiced Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Pours deep amber into the glass, with an initially foamed head that thins out to nothing except a tiny ring of bubbles to the fringe. The nose is of pie spices, with heavy nutmeg and Allspice. Medium-sweet malts meet cinnamon, nutmeg and pie spices, with a crisp, spicy finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected for the flavors at work, or at least the palate feels a little too zesty with overactive carbonation levels. Not a huge detractor overall, as this is a nice change of pace, and enjoyable for the style. I could see myself enjoying one bomber per session, as much more might become a little cloying. Decent spice brew.

Taste comprises dark toffee, hint of cocoa, sweet fudge, metallic nip, dark fruit. Medium body with bite, fine carbonation, sweet finale. Very mediocre for style, severely lacking in depth, really not much there at all ! The 12% ABV doesn’t show its face much in its defence.
Appalachian Broad Street Barley Wine;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);2010 bottle thanks to Rob and Karen in 2013. Holds up fairly well. Murky thick burgundy brown. Head fades into an oily thin layer after a minute or two. A touch brutal, as would expected if the ABV is 12.8%, but it somehow has some nice balance. Sort of like an English Barleywine, not much hop character..rich, deep, Rich caramel tones generally associated with barrels..but I think this one is just straight up. Grows on you...an interesting Barleywine.
Appalachian Broad Street Barley Wine;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at abc. Murky brown color, tan edge head. Aroma of vanilla, toasted butterscotch. Taste is sweet vanilla, bourbob, chocolate. Boozy and sweet.

Appalachian Broad Street Barley Wine;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);With a copper color, dark and reddish the Broad Steet barley wine has no defined head. It only leaves a bubbly ring in my glass. The aroma is very inviting with sweet carmelized malts, figs, brown sugar, and a cherry character. In the flavor I tasted sweet malts, butter notes, weak dark fruit, a slight bitter bite, and alcohol. The beverage is very watery. The aroma is spot on in how this will taste. Its going to be a sweet and alcoholic brew. An interesting take on a barley wine by Appalachian Brewing. Overall it was enjoyed and is one of their best beverages.
Appalachian Broad Street Barley Wine;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Growler from the brewery. Pours a deep brick into the glass, with a fully diminished head that leaves no real lacing. The nose is of dark fruits and possibly some figs. Flavors of figs, dark cherries, dates, bread and molasses, finishing with a note of toast and roasted cherries. The body is full, and the carbonation extremely soft. Alcohol is noted throughout the pull, but is well-integrated, provides some activity to the palate, and doesn’t lend a boozy note. A decent take on the barleywine style.
Appalachian Broad Street Barley Wine;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at the gettysburg location. Dark mahogany pour, little to no head. Very very sweet, sugary, notes of dark fruit and artificial cherry. Way too sweet, and not much complexity at all. A poor barleywine.

An amber beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet with light notes of berries. The flavor is sweet with primary notes of berries, but also light notes of bread and fruit (primarily oranges), leading to a dry end. All in all it is just too light for my taste.

Appalachian Rockville Rye Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at Gettysburg location, July 2006. Attractive, gingery amber colour. Like several of the Appalachian brews, I found this one a bit on the sweet side for my taste. Smooth and a touch bready. The idea of a rye beer is interesting but I’m not entirely sure what flavour elements it introduces. But I kept getting tastes of a soft drink called Vimto that we have in the UK (don’t know whether it gets to the US). Somehow, whilst an interesting concept, I felt this beer lacked attack and the overall effect was a tad bland.
Appalachian Rockville Rye Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft. Deep coppery pour with aroma of fruit, heavy malt, red grapes. Tastes fruity, grapey, with caramel malt notes.

Appalachian Rockville Rye Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Had this on tap at ABC’s Gettysburg brew pub. Has a malty taste to it that sticks around for a while as the slight hop taste fads away. But the hops makes it drinkable for me
Appalachian Rockville Rye Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Much better than their Kipona. hazy golden pour with a decent head, white. Hoppy aroma with little rye. Great on a warm day.

Flying Goose Split Rock Golden Ale;New London, New Hampshire, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Goose Brew Pub;4 oz. Sample at the brew pub. Hazy golden clouds that is impossible to see through. Nose is maltly with some spicy hop notes. The flavor follows the nose with the spiciness being abrupt in the finish. Nice level of malt that provides the balance. After it was warm with the final oz, I also got a faint floral nuance from it. Leaner body that is borderline medium. Easy to drink with a moderate amount flavor that makes it real easy to session a ton of it if you wished. Simple yet well made for the lighter beer drinker.
Flying Goose Split Rock Golden Ale;New London, New Hampshire, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Goose Brew Pub;"""I’m not a fan of ales. This beer was memorable despite the taste let down but I’d love to stop by for another. A - Poured into a pint glass with a 3 finger head. They call it Golden Ale with good reason as cloudy gold liquid barely let any light through. The head subsided slowly. S - The smell was sweet with traces of pine and marshmallows. Lavender also hit my nose. T - If the taste matched the smell, I’d be leaving a more positive review. A mix between Budweiser and Yuengling with traces of a great beer buried between the two. Low ABV and very light hops meant the beer wasn’t full by any means and left me unsatisfied with the residual tastes staying around for a while long after I finished swallowing. M - Carbonation explodes with one swish and sticks around for a while. I enjoyed the mouthfeel if only it tasted better. O - I’d get the beer again if my entree was a plate of chicken wings or cheese fries. I wasn’t too impressed with it but, as another reviewer mentioned, if you’re driving through, avoiding the 9%+ ABV beers is probably a good idea. For a low ABV beer that’s light on the stomach, I was satisfied but, at Flying Goose, this wouldn’t be my first choice out of their selection of 15 on tap."""

It pours a hazy, pale yellow with an off-white head and a goodly amount of lacing. Not much in the way of an aroma and that which I could whiff was grassy and wheaty,. The mouthfeel wasn’t too bad so it had a decent enough body. The taste was very sour and very tangy. It wasn’t what I’ve come to expect from a golden ale.

Flying Goose Perley Town IPA;New London, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Flying Goose Brew Pub;From a growler obtained from the brewpub. Slightly cloudy pale yellow to medium amber pour with a lingering cream colored head. A nice aroma of caramel, toffee, and bready malts with an earthy hop bitterness adding a balance. It is not meant to be floral or citrusy. The body is medium. The taste begins with the malt character but then an assertive bitterness jumps in from the backside and lingers dryly at the finish. Too bad this gets such low ratings because I think this is one of Flying Goose’s best offerings.
Flying Goose Perley Town IPA;New London, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Flying Goose Brew Pub;Draft @ the pub. Nose is citrus hops with a very English aroma and flavor. Funky hop and musty grain flavors. I guess this truly is a nice example of the style since all “English” beers taste old and musty. Light pine hop notes. Slightly lingering bitterness. For what this it is a decent representation of the style.
Flying Goose Perley Town IPA;New London, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Flying Goose Brew Pub;Orange brown. No head. Up front Malts. Sort of floral. Mango. Sort of tropical but very faint. Yeah.

Flying Goose Weetamoo Raspberry Wheat;New London, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flying Goose Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a semi-clear amber color with just a cap of a little white head that slid off at a decent pace. Some messy lace. The aroma had a sweet to tart raspberry quality up front with a little bit of sweet to tart wheat trying to come through. The flavor did a decent job of blending together. Nice sweet to tart raspberry and wheat sort of aftertaste and finish. The feel was between light and medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fairly low but that didn’t bother me. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, it did the trick. I didn’t expect too much and this came out above par for me.

Flying Goose Hedgehog Brown Ale;New London, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Goose Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a milky brown color with a cap of a little white foamy head. Slides off into oblivion, no lace. The aroma had some caramel/toffee malts, some banana, light earthiness, somewhat grassy tones. Ample herbal qualities at the end. The flavor leaned towards a malty and herbal sweet carrying all of the previously mentioned aromas in fairly nice. Aftertaste was semi-smooth sweet banana and herbal. Finish was wet sweet malts. The feel was roughly medium bodied, perhaps just a tad under. ABV felt as projected, though, makes me feel like I was drinking water, but there’s some beer qualities here. Overall, weird beer with the banana flavoring, wasn’t sure if that was intentional or not. Makes for a great session if one can let the banana agree with them for this style.

Flying Goose Pale Ale;New London, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flying Goose Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a light amber to orange sort of color with a small off white foamy head that slid off pretty quick. The aroma had some semi-sweet and dried biscuit to white bread notes up front and having a little bit of floral to grassy hops underneath. The flavor had that same sort of dried biscuit/bready sweet maltiness all throughout with a light aftertaste. Finish was all about the breadiness. The palate was between light and medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Fairly low carbonation and an ABV that felt appropriate. Overall, not much of an APA, but also not exactly a top notch beer. It’s just an all around drinker easy to take down with food.

Flying Goose Ragged Mountain Red;New London, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flying Goose Brew Pub;Poured from a growler acquired at the pub in Nov.2008. It pours more brown than red although there are some reddish tones and cloudy. Foamy light brown head that dissipates in just a couple of moments. The aroma is crisp and clean but the usual scents of beer are fairly weak. Some hops are noted. Moderate mouthfeel. Hops are the overpowering element of the flavor and it is a bit on the sour side. Flying Goose has its ups and downs. They say this is one of their more popular brews but I favor their darker brews more than this one.

Flying Goose Hominy Pot ESB;New London, New Hampshire, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flying Goose Brew Pub;From a growler acquired at the pub. The pour is a nice looking amber-red with carbonation bubbles clinging to the side of the pint glass and very little upward flowing. Kind of interesting in that way. The aroma has a subtle scent of malts.. Decent mouthfeel. I would characterize the taste as bitter and of caramel. It ends with dry hops. It actually goes down fast, which is probably not a good idea when the ABV is 6.3%. I might drink too many of them.

Nutfield Summer Wheat;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Nutfield Brewing Company;A brownish, slightly cloudy look to it. Actually a little darker than most other wheat beers I’ve tried. The aroma is somewhat sweet and fruity, pretty nice. Moderate amount of head, doesn’t stick around though and fails give a whole lot of lace. Wasn’t quite as refreshing as I thought it would be. Flavor is a sweet malty taste with a flowery, fruity note mixed in as well. Pretty smooth, but not as smooth as I was hoping for. All around I’d have to call this an average beer - I liked their Old Man Ale a little bit better.

Nutfield Summer Wheat;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Nutfield Brewing Company;Orange cloudy color with a nice malty aroma. The flavor can be best described as malty blending into the hoppy.
Nutfield Summer Wheat;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Nutfield Brewing Company;"Bottle - Pours a darkish amber with a thin white head that starts foamy and fades quickly. Aroma is faint of the banana that defines the style, but is not too strong.... none of the clove flavor that should be here. Flavor is weak of wheat nutiness. Not a good effort and not one that I will repeat; after the other 2 bottle are gone, of course."
Nutfield Summer Wheat;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Nutfield Brewing Company;Deep golden. Frothy whitish head. Grainy nose. Not much in terms of flavor or body, but reasonable and does have a nice clean toastiness. A strange bitterness emerges, overhopped?!

Nutfield Summer Wheat;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Nutfield Brewing Company;I have to agree with the other raters here. This fell far short of par for american wheat ales. For one thing, perhaps this is just my opionion, hoppy wheat beer is just plain wrong, and wheat beer should never be this clear. This just tastes odd.
Nutfield Summer Wheat;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Nutfield Brewing Company;Well....there is nothing WRONG with this beer....but there isn't really anything RIGHT with it either.
Nutfield Summer Wheat;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Nutfield Brewing Company;This reminded me more of an American Standard more than any wheat I've had. Orange (slightly cloudy) Hardly any aroma, besides sweet malts, no real body, virtually no wheat character. Any other beer Nutfield makes is better than this. Perfect for giving an ice cold one to a Budcoorsmiller person on a hot day. Suckers...

Nutfield Harvest Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Nutfield Brewing Company;While Octoberfest beers are typically not my favorite I did enjoy this one. Amber in color with a moderate off white head. The aroma is pretty mild, with some malts and wood characters in it, although nothing really stands out. It’s a clean tasting Octoberfest. Malty with caramel flavors and a touch of bitterness in the finish. Pretty warming but not as much as other beers of the style. 6.25 percent is relatively high considering and they hide it well. There are some hops in the background but they don’t hit you until well after the malt/caramel flavors. It’s a good beer and when considering the style again I’d definitely give this another look.

Very hoppy, in both the aroma and flavor...none of the spices or fruit tones that I expect in a fest beer. Bitter on the tail, with only a little bit of body. Not making my top 5 marzens.
Nutfield Harvest Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Nutfield Brewing Company;Poured golden orange. Good sized head, as It dissipates it leaves very nice lacing. Good aroma of maple sugar cookies, and pine like hops. Flavor is just not there. There is a slight after taste of hops, but this is more like watery nothing. So disappointed.the alcohol is well hidden. As this warms, the complex flavors come out , and I think this is a good Marzen.
Nutfield Harvest Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Nutfield Brewing Company;Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium amber.

Nutfield Harvest Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Nutfield Brewing Company;I want to love Nutfield, I really do. I lived so close to them I could hit them with a golf ball. I think American brewers kick ass and are teaching the Europeans how to make some beers these days. However, no American brewer makes a truly great Oktoberfest. Lucky Germans. And Nutfield can't make one that I'd buy again.
Nutfield Harvest Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Nutfield Brewing Company;Solid fall seasonal. Thick malt base of toffee and toasted bready malts with a slight Ringwood fruitiness. Tingling hop balance and a mellow sweetness. Taste is reminescent of a combo of apple and pumpkin pie.

Nutfield Winter Frost;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Nutfield Brewing Company;This offering from Nutfield pours a delicious maroon that leaves a thin white lace that sticks to the glass, the body is clear and has small carbonated bubbles in the body. The aroma of this porter is tart, the smell is grassy and funky. The taste starts on the palate with a sharp unripened plum tartness that laces your throat. It then moves to a bitter hop feel, that has a small spice taste to the body. The finish is nice, although this is a bit rough for a porter not as smooth as I expect for the style but overall decent.

Deep auburn/amber tinted body with ruby highlights when held to the light. Lightly transluscent with a smattering of light tan-beige head that sticks lightly to the sides. Aroma of fruity yeast esters, good solid English yeast apparency! Flavor, while the beer is served too cold, is still delightful. This is far and away the best beer I’ve had at an airport. This tastes nothing like a porter, perhaps it was changed this year? Toasted caramel malt, fruity English yeast, a bit of dustiness and a chewy, nutty finish make me classify this, loosely, as an English Strong Ale. Medium body, low bitterness, but good balance, low carbonation. Some spicy hops on the very end. Light cream and honey notes play with the hops as well.

Nutfield Winter Frost;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Nutfield Brewing Company;"Has a dark amber/ruby color with moderate carbonation and a roasted malt smell. Taste is also of roasted malts and finishes with a typical bitterness. Overall this is not a bad porter, but I was expecting it to be a more filling beer for a ""winter"" style."
Nutfield Winter Frost;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Nutfield Brewing Company;Gorgeous ruby red color in the glass with incredible lacing. Hoppy malty aroma, hops dominate the flavor though not overpowering, the body is a little thin however, and the malt base is not adequately pronounced. Quick, dry finish. A solid beer, but it won''t win a lot of points for complexity.
Nutfield Winter Frost;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Nutfield Brewing Company;The commercial description will suffice. It's been a while since I've found one of these, however, if you like porters and enjoy other porters that I have ranked highly, this seasonal is definitely worth a try if you can find it.

Woodstock Inn Red Rack Ale;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Not really red, more like darker iced tea.

Dark brown pour with a tan head that doesn’t last long. Nose is chocolate, maple syrup. and nuts. Taste is initially sweet and then more bitter. I like it. Tasty brew.
Woodstock Inn Kanc Country Maple Porter;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Woodstock Inn Brewery;dark brown 1 finger head. Smells like maple and pecans. tate is actually pretty good. sweet, english bitterness. maple is present from start to finish. plenty of maple flavor. really drinkable.
Woodstock Inn Kanc Country Maple Porter;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Bomber I got on an east coast trip. Dark brown with amber highlights. A nice tan head does not last long. A pleasant, although fairly small, aroma of milk chocolate and maple. I wish more maple was tasted but it is faint. More nuts and mild astringency. Brownies, almost, but not that sweet. Mid glass this gets more earthier and more bitter. Some citrus fruit also emerges. In the end this was disappointing. A maple porter was hoped for. Someone forgot to add the maple.
Woodstock Inn Kanc Country Maple Porter;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice hazy brown to black color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dies within about a minute. It left some light lacing sticking finely to the glass. The smell had a nice blend of sweet roasty nutty malts but also had a good makeup of the maple flavoring invading my nose. The taste was sweet and roasty combining the maple, nuts and adds a light coffee to the background. On the palate, this sits about a medium with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation is actually fairly easy going down. Overall, good maple flavored Porter worthy of having again.
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;On tap. An old favorite, this pours clear golden with a thin white head. Aroma of malt, biscuit, and bread. The flavor is original, but not unique as I find a similar (others have noted maple) sweetness to most all their brew. It’s impeccably smooth, and the finish is just lingering deliciousness.
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Light yellow appearance. All i get from the nose is butterscotch candies. Sadly, the taste is also weak. thin body, butter, cream soda.
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;A very thin, faint wheat. Pours a light golden with almost no head. Not much going on. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Bottle. This is just bad bad beer. Not sure what they did to it but its nothing good.
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;"On tap in 2010; poured a yellow/gold with a white head. Aroma wheat and perhaps a hint of fruit. Flavor was the same. A forgettable beer."
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Weak sauce, tastes like a wheat beer that has been substantially watered down. OK for a light beer, but bad for a wheat beer.
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;on tap-pours a tight off white head and yellow color. Aroma is light malt/wheat-slightly sweet, hint of fruity hops. Taste is light malt/wheat-slightly sweet, hint of fruity-lemon hops, yeast. Easy.
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;"Notes from ""brew weekend."" Light with some body from the wheat but still very light. A bit of a vegetal character with some bitterness and earthy notes."
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;On tap at Woodstock. Light yellow gold no head or lacing. Nothing much on the nose, grassy with a light malt texture. Some mild bitterness.
Woodstock Inn White Mountain Weasel Wheat;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Multiple tastings. I have had everything they have to offer as we come here often for dinner while in the area. As with their food, the beer is OK but nothing spectacular. In fact, most of their beers are in my opinion, sub-par. Wasn’t impressed with this one.
Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;I sampled 3 beers, and got to choose one for a growler. This one was runner-up.
Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;A big, roasted but aroma with some iron to it. Smooth caramel and chocolate are overwhelmed by a pretty intense bitterness. A lot more than I was expecting.
Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;Taster - Oregon Trail Brewing - Corvallis, OR Aroma – Nice malt flavoring with a light hops backing. Appearance – Dark Amber in color, Thin head and clear. Flavor – Good malt flavor the mixed malts added quite nicely. Liked the hosp where not too much either. Palate – Nice Mouthfeel, good texture with a dry finish. Overall – I could drink this all day. Loved the crisp and fresh flavor of the beer. This could be a staple beer if I lived near here.
Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;On tap at Corvallis brewpub--Dry and hoppy amber colored beer with a nice roasted aftertaste. It appears that OT is more concerned with flavor than alcohol content in their beers. Nice!
Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;The guy pouring beers made a point to tell me it was only a brown ale NOT a nut brown ale. Well this beer had a huge nutty and malty aroma. Flavor a bit on the dry side. Smooth mouthfeel. The best they had on tap at the deli.
Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;on tap-pours a tan head and mahogany color. Aroma is molasses-caramel some hops. Taste is molasses-caramel some hops.

Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;Pours a dark brown with a good sized persistant head which leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is sweet malt with a few fruit notes. The taste is dominated by sweet caramel malt with a lot of roasted malt which adds complexity and bitterness. There are some faint chocolate and fruit notes. This beer has a nice medium body and is quite drinkable.
Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;This was incredibly rich and nutty, with some great malt character and slight sweetness on the tip of the tongue. Hazelnuts and fresh maple syrup make up the flavor with a rich creamy mouthfeel. A little too cold when I tried it but very well made.
Oregon Trail Brown Ale;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Oregon Trail Brewery;Draft at the brewery. A very well-made classic style brown ale, and I think the Oregon Trail house yeast (not sure exactly what it is) fits this beer the best. This brown ale is wet and sweet up front with ample maple and a light nutty spice note, changing to a more dry and starchy finish across the back of the tongue. Very flavorfull when fresh, and very well-made.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. An average, smooth drinking India Pale Ale. Could use a stronger bite at the end.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;Taster - Oregon Trail Brewing - Corvallis, OR Aroma – Nice hops aroma with slight malt background in the aroma. Appearance – Amber in color, Thin head and clear. Flavor – Strong hops flavor the malts held up there end and added to the flavor as well. Palate – Nice Mouthfeel, good texture with a dry IPA finish. Overall – A very nice PAC NW IPA. This beer had the hops it better in Hops country. Liked this as it was not super IPA strength which some brewers do and try to kill your taste buds with hops.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;Pours amber with good head. Citrus aromas but also plentry of malt. Flavor is balanced. Bitter finish is a bit coarse but still plenty good.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;on tap-pours an off white head and amber color. Aroma is c hops. Taste is c hops, nugget and centennial, slight pungent and bitter, some malt.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;Pours a fiery golden copper color. Clear. Lazy carbonation floats to the surface. Off-white creamy head forms easily and leaves a wet sloppy doily of lace behind. Pleasant aromas of juicy grapefruity citrus flesh along with the bitter rind. Deep inhalations reward you with sweet caramel square notes. An occasional flare-up of alcohol is noted. Maltiness is not shy here at the beginning. A blast of molten caramel and the warm homey feel of bread dough. Citrus hops kick in to give their two cents. Bitter (almost too bitter) rind tones appear. The initial malty creaminess that was welcomed is soon beaten about the face and head by a trifle unbalanced nature. (I shudder to think what this would be like if the initial maltiness was weaker.) Too bitter. Too rough. Needed a little bit of caressing to meld the characteristics. As it stands now it’s just too disjointed. I’ll try next month it will prob smooth out.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;This has got very generous portions of hops, and if you love hops like I do, then this is a beer for you. The structure from the malt backs up the hops perfectly. This is not over the top, very well balanced and incredibly yummy!
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;Draft at the brewery. What I would called an American-British hybrid IPA with a homebrew flavor. Nutty and malty while still a little overhopped - and the hops are more of a bread crust and viney husk flavor than a sweeter citrus flavor. Full to medium bodied with a slightly rough texture - and like I said, a bit of a homebrew funk. They use the same yeast in every brew, so perhaps some experimentation with other strains for the IPA would resolve the problems... although to be honest the problems are very small... this was overall a very tasty IPA.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;Amber with a thin creamy head and some lace. Floral and bitter hop aromas with oranges and pine. Some biscuits show up. The flavors contain lots of floral hops with some bitter orange peel flavors. Caramel with some spice and alcohol. Flowers. Tangy palate with a floral bite at the end.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;Sampled draught at Old World Deli/Oregon Trail Brewing, CorvallisAuburn color, nice head & lacing. Nose of floral citrus tones, creamy but resinously bitter. The flavor is bitter & dry, fairly average IPA for the region which means it’s above par as IPAs come, meh.
Oregon Trail IPA;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;IPA;Oregon Trail Brewery;Sampled at the KLCC brewfest 2005. This was a very lemony sweet IPA, sweet citrus hops throughout, not overly crisp, but very smooth. This IPA was a bit overly sweet up front focusing on more of a lemon candy taste. This finished off with some bitter citrus hops, not very hoppy tasting, just bitter.
Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Had to be one of the worst beer experiences ever! so sweet so disgusting thank the lord i have not seen this beer since that horrible day ..... don’t do it please just don’t
Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Called Red Dragon Xtreme. Wow, this is bad, as expected, but its bad in new and unexpected ways. Points for originality, I suppose. Mildly citrusy aroma. Weirdly greasy palate. Flavor is bready and, um, tobacco? Chewing tobacco? At this point I’m having some quetions about hygene in the brewery.
Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);The aroma is a lot like an apple cider mixed with sweetened green tea, except with more herbs. The appearance is golden/orange with some particulates. It has the smallest head I have ever seen on a lager and is very lightly carbonated. The taste is sweet, herbal, nutty, buttery, and malty. Even with all that, it’s still bland. There is a paper and yeast aftertaste. This is an odd beer.
Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);My bottle says this is XTREME Beer. Market to America much, China? Oddly herbal and grassy aroma. Looks like ginseng tea with about as much head. Sweet malt mash with an even sweeter honey finish. Almost no carbonation.
Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Confucious say man who drink watery beer, buy chinese budweiser. Dishwater flavor. totally gagged me and i poured the sucker out. very light carbonation too, like it was already flat.
Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Keg at the local Chinese Restaurant. Never expected to pick up a rating here, but there you go. Pale yellow, highly gassed, small white head. It wasn’t all that bad, lightly malted with a delicate hop and a floral sweet note. Refreshingly dry, went well with the crispy duck and sizzling beef.
Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Not much to be desired here. Typical dry, light, rice beer. Small white head.

Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);"The bartender said ""it's a little dry"" - she was right - I was thirsty for beer after this! Would not have been bad with some Kong Pow but leaves a lot to be desired by itself. Well, now I can add another country to my list!"
Red Dragon Light Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Slightly, but not unpleasantly skunky and malty aroma. Green bottle so watch out. Pours up about a 3 inch head in an 11 inch pilsener glass, but the carbonation seems to fizzle quickly. The flavor is oddly complex -- lots of grain and some faint molasses, hops, anise and malt on the front end, but the backend becomes acidic and metallic.
Krombacher Pils;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;Bottled. Clear yellow colour, medium white head, fair retention. Weak malty nose with some herbal hops. Taste of sweetish malts, hay and weak herbal hops. Light body, average carbonation, watery texture, dry finish. Not so bad, but its just an average faceless lager.
Krombacher Pils;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;A tall can from BC Liquor stores. Widely available in government liquor stores. A pale amber beer with a generous white head and a sweetly malted nose. On the palate it comes across as a typical pale lager, no surprise, not as sickeningly sweet as some. Not much hop presence here. Meh.

Pilsener of El Salvador;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Pours clear, pale golden with a one finger, white head. Aroma is corn and light Saaz hops. Taste is corn, moving to faint hops. Finish is corn.
Pilsener of El Salvador;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Shared 12 oz. bottles poured to snifters showing a clear, golden hue, with a light layer of soft white froth, and some foamy spots of lacing. The nose was Pils malt & light lager scent, graininess, and a touch of DMS. Light bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar notes, adding modest grass & grain bitterness. The bottles showed some back of the refrigerator wear, and subsequent age, but otherwise presented a rather clean finish.
Pilsener of El Salvador;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);"[12oz bottle from Total Wines, Brea, CA.] A pale straw coloured pour with a thin white head; light carbonation; cereal aroma; cereal taste, sweet but with a reasonable grassy bitterness. Better than some beers from this region."
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle at a tasting, from old notes. BLUE. Really blue. Blue head. Awful. Blueberry, cardboard, fake shit. Terrible mouthfeel. Wow, why does this exist? At least ticked El Salvador...
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Oooooof, No, Bought this at Star Trek Experience when it was still in Las Vegas. Taste and smell is pure fuckin skunk. Corn, hay, sweet bullshit. No, no no, Camo is better
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Rated in 2010 (Backlog) - Teal in color with a small white head. Aroma is of corn, rice and grain. Taste is of corn and grain.
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Star Trek geeks rejoice. This tastes like Miller light that has been dyed a vibrant blue. Very little aroma and a very slight, but again it is a vibrant blue. I have and this out a bottle and off of a tap at the now defunct Star Trek experience in Las Vegas. As far as beers go it rates very low, but for Star Trek fans it’s a solid 10, for nostalgic purposes.
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);The smell is corn, grainy, weird, wheat, floral, and yuck. The color is blue and the look is clear. The taste is weak, corn, and water. Bad stuff.
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle. Pours blue green with lighter blue head. Almost fluorescent. Nose/taste of sweet corn, sweet grain and toasted cereal grain. Body is paper thin. Interesting beer nonetheless.
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Awesome bright blue with a hint of green, cool light blue head... Light nose, basically adjunct lager, light sweet grains a bit generic... Light sweet sugar water, grains, doesn’t taste like a whole lot but not offensive... Glad I got to see this in person, looks so cool
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);"Ok, I admit it, I was a trekkie. Back in ’01 I went to Vegas, and had to go the ""Star Trek Experience"". While there, I proceeded to get hammered at ""Quark’s Bar""- I purchased a 6 of the ""Romulan Ale"", and I must say...meh. It wasn’t unpleasant in any way, but it was average, and -oh- BLUE!- By the way, It makes one’s feces turn totally green- no kidding, if you drink enough, which may just be the incentive needed to try this! It was enough for me- 2 years later, I purchased 2 cases of this stuff, and had an awesome Bachelor Party for a co-worker (a old school nerd from the seventies!) Green poo all around!- Annyhoo, Don’t buy this expecting some fine, well crafted beverage, just because they got a licensing agreement. But it is better than Bud Lite, which, apparently, the baseline at most parties.- live Long and Priosper...no wait...that’s Vulcan..."
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Well it comes in a clear bottle, wasn’t skunked but all this really is is blue colored club soda so I’m pretty sure it can’t. Pours an exotic greenish blue with a puffy large neon blue head. Looks pretty cool. Tastes even more watery than american light lagers. It gave me a blue tongue and blue teeth. Vague sweetness in my burps. Just buy it and chug it for laughs, take a picture with it, add it to your bottle cap/bottle collection, just don’t try and savor its flavor.
Romulan Ale;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);It is what it is. I’m a big Star Trek fan, and this beer had huge potential to be awesome due to the quality artwork and packaging, but the beer was absolutely atrocious. I might venture to say it was one of the worst beers I’ve ever tasted. Thin, corny, skunky, watered-down. Looked cool, though.
Sleeman Original Dark;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Aroma 3. Appearance 3. Taste 4. Palate 2. Overall 8. Light aroma of malt and caramel. Same light taste with a bit metalic aftertaste.

Sleeman Original Dark;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Ruby, red ale. Quite flat. Some bitters, some roasted malts, bits of caramel. Fresh taste
Sleeman Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Pours clear medium gold with a dense white head. Smells pilsner-y. Tastes mostly like a pale lager, but with some of the richness and fruitiness of an ale. I feel like it's too bitter for it's own good.
Sleeman Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Pours clear gold with a small white head. Aroma is light pils and carbonation. Flavour is smooth and light. Finish is just barely bitter.
Sleeman Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);"Bottle at the Mandarin restaurant Burlington Ontario. Almost no aroma, hint of honeyed biscuit. Bland ""beer"" flavour. Too dull to dwell on. Great Chinese buffet restaurant though."
Sleeman Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Pours a foamy white cap of head but doesn’t produce much lacing. Has a golden appearance. Typical wheaty and grainy aromas, light malts and very mild citrus hops. Somewhat distinct corn aroma as well. Mild citrus hops, corn, grains. Slightly sweet in the finish, but nothing too excessive. Light floral hops and wheaty malts as well. Has a slightly oily and slick mouthfeel, average carbonation and is medium bodied. Not too bad Sleeman brew. Goes down real easy, refreshing. Perfect for summer parties.
Sleeman Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Got this one with colleagues at Pizzaros. Didn’t know what to take from the limited commercial beer selection. Not bad, faint, lack taste. The usual large distribution common beer.
Sleeman Cream Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Underwhelming cream ale. Flavour is pretty mild, but suppose that’s a bit more characteristic of a big brewer.
Sleeman Silver Creek Lager;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Gold, thin white head and good condition. Gentle grain and a faint hoppy bitterness in the nose, low bitter hop and fruity malt in the mouth and a low grainy bitter chalkiness in the finish.
Sleeman Silver Creek Lager;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);The nose is malty and semi-sweet. Semi-creamy mouthfeel. A quick hoppy attack in the finish. An after-bite that is very nice. Recommended to fans of Moosehead and other above average lagers. Don’t drink before driving (a little humor). Cheers!
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Originally rated August 2006 when it was still made (and was one of the better light beers around). This is one of the best light beers from a macro. It pours a real golden colour (unlike those others that are pale yellow or almost transparent). The head is decent in size, white, slightly creamy, creates light lacing and leaves a coat over the brew. Carbonation is mild, but still a bit active from a few spots. The nose is also mild with malt and a touch of honey sweetness. Watery mouthfeel with slight stickiness. The taste is very light, with a tad of malt mixed in with soda water. Overall, quite refreshing and well-brewed for a light beer.
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);"That was a ""not so bad"" light. Watery and fizzy. But not so corny for that kind of beer. If I was forced to drink a light, maybe I’d take that one."
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Corn in the nose, yellow, a tiny white head, corn flavour, light bodied, yikes.
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);"""Darker"" than most light beers. Foamy head that slowly dissipates. Smells like a Sleeman’s Lager, but taste isn’t quite there. Oily mouthfeel. Good for a light lager."
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Bottle- Pale yellow pour with a fizy shor tlived head. Faint aromas of tonic water and watery hops with a dash of malt. Almost tasteless. Club soda with some hops and a touch of sweetness. There’s no real point to this one. It scores its points for its ability to be completely inoffensive. Not again.
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);[bottle from peckhams] Yellow, fizzy, quickly dissipating head. Almost no aroma, thin body, watery finish.
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Bottle. Light golden-yellow in colour, fizzy non-lasting white head, no lace. Aroma was like a pack of skuks, grainy, slightly sweet. The flavour was grainy, some cheerios, very bland. Bitter dry mouthfeel, very light watery body, medium carbonation. Finishes fairly quick. Unremarkable and forgettable.
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Pours light golden with a fizz, and momentary head. Faint cereal and floral aroma. Not much to speak of in the flavor, pretty much what one would expect, basically watered-down lager. Drinkable, slightly better than most macro light beers.
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Initial big head that had no chance too stay for more than few seconds . Pale gold . Aroma of plastic , and chew out pale malt . Thin, no front flavours, watery, just with very light malr nose. Non-present finish . Poor.
Sleeman Premium Light;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Very sweet aroma.

Sleeman Honey Brown Lager;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Standard lager, adding strong sweetness in an attempt to add distinction. It adds about as much distinction as an ambulance-chasing lawyer’s new Porsche Boxster
Sleeman Honey Brown Lager;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);A single short can from the High Point in east Vancouver. Straight from the can. Sweet yes, but some serviceable hop bitterness and malted goodness as well. It'll do for a sunny Sunday afternoon.

Sleeman Honey Brown Lager;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);"341 ml clear bottle with screwed crown cap bought at CitySuper in Harbour City. Tsim Sha Tsui. Clear amber orange colour; One finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasts for 90 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with quite fizzy carbonation; Aroma of malt, with mustiness, honey, caramel, toffee, strong cherries, floral, sugar, light spices, dry biscuits, lemon and light grass; Medium sweet taste of watered-down Amber malt, with strong cherries, light caramel, floral, fair sugar, light herbs, biscuits, light lemon, mid to fair bitter hops and grass; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is very thin Amber maltyness in a watery background. Strong cherries set the tone with light caramel and light herbal honey and spice. Flowery with fair sweetness. Biscuity with light lemon to round. Decent but just too slim... Hoppiness is floral, light spices, light lemon and grass in nose and taste; Bitterness is light for an abrupt, mid to low astringent sweet-bitter light malty finish; Quite dry after taste. Watery cherries and fairly bitter to mouth. Comments: After the gawd-awful Original Draught and sub-par Cream Ale, this one is probably the more decent effort from Sleeman, as all the elements of a proper Amber Lager is all here, including some nice cherry maltyness, but it was ultimately undone by serious diluting and it was so weak to be considered good. A cheap way to lure public for mass consumption, luckily for me the damage is limited because it was discounted."

Sleeman Honey Brown Lager;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Valemount 20/7 2018. 34,1 cl bottle on Don’s Social house in Valemount. No label but Brewery name printed directly on the bottle. Pours clear Maroon with medium-sized white head. Settles as thin, almost transparent layer of foam covering the surface of the beer. Crawling up the side of the glass. No lacing. Aroma is not particularly strong. Sweet caramel, light slightly artificial honey, nuts and brown sugar. Strong carbonation. Thin, watery, lively texture. Flavor has strong sweetness followed by very light bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and fairly short. Sweet brown ale which feels rather light due to the strong carbonation. A little bit generic but not too bad.

Sleeman Steam;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;California Common / Steam Beer;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Originally rated July 2006. This one is one of my favorite Sleeman brews from the beginning, but is rumoured to be discontinued (or at least is hard to find now... no longer available at The Beer Store). But I was surprised to get one in their new mixed 12-pack (well, you get 3 of them). Pours a clean amber colour with lots of carbonation. The white head is creamy, has decent retention and leaves great amount of lace all around the glass. The nose is mild with some metallic water at first, but then goes into a nicer malt grain and some light fruit and floral aromas. Kind of a grainy mouthfeel too. Refreshing taste of light sweet malt with some decent hop in the finish and a clean light fruit aftertaste. One of Sleeman’s better offerings, with their Fine Porter.

Basil Ts Ms. Lucys Weimaraner Wheat;Red Bank, New Jersey, United States;Wheat Ale;Birravino;Clear golden beer with very minimal haze. The head is small, white and slowly diminishes. Indeed wheaty nose, but kinda cidery, almost celery-like. Minimal banana notes. Kinda fresh, but very simple and a bit overly tart. Very light-bodied. A small flowery touch from the saaz fits, but the following limey finish seems exaggerated. A very thin example of dubious filtration.

Basil Ts Maxwell's Dry Stout;Red Bank, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Dry;Birravino;sample: best beer in the place. Nose is complex, the coffee and roasted notes I would expect come through immediately. No head to speak of, however this was one of the last in the sampler. The body was thin but taste had some depth... again with the coffee and roasted malts... definitely some bitters at the end. Think this beer was pretty true to the style. Nice beer... award winning as they claim?! not too sure...

The nose is heavily roasted barley, ethyl lactate, butter, cream and pungent caramel. The flavour is a smooth blend of coffee, heavy cream, roasted malt and grain.

Basil Ts American Brown Ale;Red Bank, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Birravino;sampler: Pours a clear mahogany brown, leaving a thin ring of head. The nose is mild, the hops are present but not overbearing, some roasted qualities are available. The taste reveals some of the same notes, however nothing too deep. The body is more thin than I like to see making it easily drinkable, but not incredibly enjoyable. Wouldn’t be my choice for a summer seasonal, but not bad.

Kaiserdom Rauchbier;Bamberg-Gaustadt, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kaiserdom Privatbrauerei;Wow last ratings are from 2004 until now. I need to check my bottle date. Poured a clear amber color with a minimal sized off-white head. Sweet aged malt aroma. Smoke plays a small part in the background. Aged malt flavor with a smokey backbone. Kind of dull in the flavor and dull in the mouthfeel. Not a whole lot going on.
Kaiserdom Rauchbier;Bamberg-Gaustadt, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kaiserdom Privatbrauerei;This is an awfully mild beer to be applying smoked malt. The aroma is soft and grainy, with the smoke being more pronounced in the actual taste. There is a platate saltiness that makes me thirsty after finishing - strange.
Kaiserdom Rauchbier;Bamberg-Gaustadt, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kaiserdom Privatbrauerei;"Rauchbier is a German beer style which has its roots in the Northern Bavarian brewing city of Bamburg. Rauchbiers are very pungent with salty, sooty, smokey flavor and aroma. A portion of malt in brewing of this beer style, is smoked over a beech wood fire. Its a very distinctive aroma and flavor, even a small portion of this malt in a beer goes a very long way. This portion of ""smoked"" malt added in some cases, can be as high as 60% of the grain bill. That makes for an intensely smokey beer. It has been said the locals in Bamburg say you need to try six or seven liters of this beer style before you can really enjoy it. I’m like Michael Jackson, The Beer Hunter when he said: ""I loved it the first time I ever tried it."". I love rauchbier, and Kaiserdom Rauchbier, was my introduction into this style. Schlenkerla Ur-Bock and Marzen, are my favorite German examples, and I belive Degroen’s Rauchbock is the best example I have ever tasted. Kaiserdom doesn’t use a marzen or a bock as a base to their rauchbier, though I wish they would. They use a helles, and while outstanding, I belive a beer style such as bock or marzen is more suited for rauchbier. Kaiserdom Rauchbier pours to a deep blonde/golden color, with a nice white head, and a good carbonation. The nose is very smokey. Whiffs of salty, sooty, beech wood smoked malt aroma flood the nose. The palate is a lean malt back bone of pale malts, and of course that salty, sooty rauch malt flavor. Smoke dominates in this beer, the pale malts don’t stand a chance. This beer finishes with a long, dry, salty, smokey finish. This beer is liquid smoked ham in a glass. It really is a great introduction into rauchbier, you’ll know what smoked malt tastes like after one sample of this. I have had mixed experiences with this beer. On draught it is devine. In bottles, you have to be careful. Kaiserdom Rauchbier is packaged in green bottles, and if old and light struck, you’ll get some ""skunky"" aroma and flavor with your smoke. This beer is a bit pricey as well, Schelenkla is a better example of the style in my opinion and can be purchased a little cheaper. Still a great beer to try and a good example of rauchbier. I would match this with grilled bratwurst, roasted chicken, and smoked cheeses."
Kaiserdom Rauchbier;Bamberg-Gaustadt, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kaiserdom Privatbrauerei;its funny,this brew smells alot like a samuel smiths brew.the appearance is also alot like a sammy smiths.as for the flavor,its alot different.it has a light watery body with al little smoke taste at the end.(and when i say smoke,i mean camel non-flitered smoke)not very good at all.

Ramstein Blonde;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;High Point Brewing Company;From Apr 2007 It pours from 12oz bottle(best by Aug 2007) a cloudy straw colour with a very small head of foam that dissipates completely after a very short time with no lacing. The smell has a wheat nose with some citrus and spice. The taste on first sip has a nice burst of banana and clove followed by wheat and yeast. Another sip and there's some tartness, no actually, a lot of tartness...very lemony. That's something that would work quite well in the hot summer days of Casper, no doubt. The mouthfeel is good for the style, the carbonation is light. and the finish ends up with the banana that I noted on the first sip. Solid. Good. Tasty. Bottom line: This would be a good thirst quecher for the summer season and I thank jwc215 for including this one in our trade!

Aroma: lemon, clove and a bit of pepper make for an inviting profile; light malts suggest a balanced blond... Palate: smooth, medium-bodied, and with a bit of fizziness...drinkable and sessionable, but not nuanced or textured...

Pours murky dark brown with a huge tan head that falls slowly. Aroma of roasted malts, yeast, a touch of clove. Has a tart acidic backbone with dark chocolate and roasty flavors. There’s a touch of yeastiness in the finish. Not what I expected, but I like it.
Ramstein Classic;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;High Point Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours brown with a dense light brown head. Aromas of clove, light bananna, chocolate, and some bread. The flavor is full of fruit, yeasty goodness, and finishing full. Really nice example of the style and a joy to drink.
Ramstein Classic;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;High Point Brewing Company;Best by January 2013. Appearance: The body is opaque but light is seen through the edges exposing a murky brown body. The head is a thin and creamy brown that settles into a light coating and a creamy ring. Aroma: Very interesting aroma, at first I smell cocoa and roasted malts, but they are mixed with banana. This reminds me of a chocolate covered banana actually, without being cloying or artificial. Taste: The intro hints at caramel while the flavor picks up towards the middle adding earthy and light cocoa flavors with banana, chalky yeast, and slight roasted malts on the finish. Palate: Medium bodied with medium amounts of carbonation. Overall: This is a very interesting beer, nice balance and a good combination of flavors despite the potential for a trainwreck with this many conflicting flavors. I enjoy this.
Ramstein Classic;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;High Point Brewing Company;Dark amber that approaches brown with a thin, off-white head. Nice wheat beer aroma of banana, clove, chocolate. A moderate body. The flavors are present but soft and light. The finish is creamy and clean. I really wish the flavors were more pronounced, as that would have made this a much better beer
Ramstein Classic;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;High Point Brewing Company;Bottle (12 oz). Dark brown with a medium creamy brown head and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and smoke. Taste is the same. Acidic mouthfeel. Thin body. Too acidic for me. Nothing but roasted malt and smoke.
Ramstein Classic;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;High Point Brewing Company;Bottle 355ml. Pours dark brown with low beige head (diminishing). Some lacing. Aroma is of roasted malt, smoke. Taste is of roasted malt, acidity. Overall: refreshing. Surprisingly acid. Not my kind of beer.
Ramstein Classic;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;High Point Brewing Company;"pours a darker dunkel color. This is the loudest beer I ever heard..As soon as I start pouring an immense head forms and you can hear the activity of the bubbles as they ""snap crackle pop"" like rice krispies.. minutes after the pour, it is still audible. Get a toasted malt aroma, dark bread, and caramel sweetness. Not really picking up much banana or clove as expected with a wheat beer. Likewise in the flavor..the traditional wheat flavors are only subtle. More predominant flavors are roasty malts, caramel, diactyl, and a light hopping at the end"
Ramstein Classic;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;High Point Brewing Company;Smokey, malty, and strong overall. Dark malt, a bit of bitterness, and some dried fruit in the taste.

Very good.
Ramstein Winter Wheat;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;High Point Brewing Company;From Jan 2007 This one pours from 12oz bottle(room temp, best by Sept) a rich and thick looking very dark brown with a very small head of foam that disappeared almost immediately. Still, there's some lacing when I tilt my glass. The smell is complex. I note wheat, dark fruit, clove, banana and more. The taste on first sip is very clovey with big hits of wheat and plum. As I swish the brew in my mouth, I'm getting good banana and more of the plum and clove and they're all working so well together with the finish being on the dry side.. And... where the heck is the 9.5%abv?? I hardly notice any warming as it goes down and I find that almost unreal! I'm on the last third of my glass now and the tastes just seem to get better and better as this liquid nectar warms up even more from the body heat transmitted from my hand to the glass. Wow, just wow. As I take my last sip, I notice just the tiniest bit of sediment in my New Belgium goblet but more importantly, I realize that I've just had a thoroughbly enjoyable drinking session with one, fine American Weizenbock! Bottom line: This is, imho, a world class brew and a *must* try if you see it in your area. Me? I got my sample from my buddy in NYC, nutbrown. Thanks a bunch!!!
Ramstein Winter Wheat;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;High Point Brewing Company;From a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a very cool purpleish color. Little lacing or head. Fantastic fruit aroma! Cherries, berries and grape soda... but in a good way. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick, but in a lager type way. Taste is also straight dark fruit with some minor whiskey or bourbonish flavors. Fantastic. Definitely let this one warm up a bit, it makes it 5X better than if it’s fridge temp. Great stuff!
Ramstein Winter Wheat;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;High Point Brewing Company;Grower poured into a snifter. Opaque medium with no head. Aroma is clove, medium body, a little carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is clove, bread, chocolate, and some caramel.

Ramstein Winter Wheat;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;High Point Brewing Company;Old review from 2008. 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass Pours very dark brown light barley penetrates but does show a slightly reddish hue. Head is light tan which falls to a ring. I get dark bread, wheat, toasted malt, fruit and some molasses. Sweet and fruity in flavor. I get prunes as well as the molasses malt with a little bit of spicy hops on the finish Medium body and quite smooth with a little carbonation tingle. This is a very nice wiesenbock - great for a cold weather drink. Has similarities to a dopplebock in it’s richness and fruitiness. Interesting take and delicious. It’s hard to believe that it’s 9.5%!
Ramstein Krystall;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;High Point Brewing Company;nice clean taste of medium malty wheat with noble hops, a clean golden color and fresh crisp finish
Ramstein Krystall;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;High Point Brewing Company;Clear straw yellow in the glass. Nose and taste is toasty malts and bitter. Rated 1/24/2000
Ramstein Krystall;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;High Point Brewing Company;"I have two hands and two glasses; the glass in my left hand is direct from the tap at the brewery, my right hand holding a glass from a bottle opened by the brewer himself. Bright and clear. Straw yellow. Nice white head. The bottle sample was served a bit warmer than the keg, making for some difference. The warmer sample’s hop aroma was a little more pronounced. Both had noticeable sulfur aroma, a byproduct of fermentation and the sign of a very fresh lager. It is not for some people, but at the right level I’ve learned to appreciate it. (And since it exceptionally easy to scrub the so2 smell out of the beer by venting a little co2 through it, I consider it an attribute, as opposed to a flaw.) Overall this beer has a very light body, with some sweetness to it. There is wheat graininess along with a little hop bitterness. The sulfur might get in the way of some, but I think this is really refreshing,. It’ll make for a good session beer."
Ramstein Krystall;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;High Point Brewing Company;This beer did not go over well. Somewhat bitter and a horrible smell meets the nose. Thoroughly nasty.
Ramstein Krystall;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;High Point Brewing Company;Slightly hazy gold with a thinnish white head. Leaves a solid pattern of lace. Moderate carbonation. 100% German aroma of Hallertau/Tettnang hops and lightly toasty malts. Crisp and refreshing and spicy with hops, but lacking any Weizen flavors. Easy drinking. Malt flavor shines as this sits and warms from fridge temp. Toasty and grainy. Drys out and bitters in the finish. Taste is clearly German Pils and nothing like a true Kristall Weizen. Can't anyone in the US replicate this style?
Ramstein Krystall;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;High Point Brewing Company;A wheat beer with some attitude. It's head lingered longer than I expected. It's got a unique, kinda citrusy aroma to it. The flavor is stronger than most wheats, and it's got a pilsener - like aftertaste.

Kroghs Gold;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;On draft at Krogh’s. Pretty ordinary pale ale. Lightly hopped. The first release from this brew pub. Pleasant enough and would probably go well with most dishes.
Kroghs Gold;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Draft at the brewpub. Clear dark golden color with a white head and coating lacework.

Kroghs Gold;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;(flight sampler) Very light flavors with a watery weak palate. A bit of skunk in place of the hops. Please clean the lines!
Kroghs Gold;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Pours a nice yellow with little head. Sometimes it can be watery and other it can be a nice hoppy taste. Everyone needs to make a few trips to this bar to give it a fair score. 2nd favorite beer at this bar.
Kroghs Gold;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Deep golden pour with tight white head and lace. Medium malt on the nose. Semi sweet start with a dry finish and light bitter finish. Light/medium bodied beer that is just a tad over carbonated. Nice balance and I enjoyed the light bitter.
Kroghs Gold;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Amber gold coloring, with a malty and almost sweet flavoring which keeps it from having the crisp taste I like in a style like this. Needs hops. I don’t understand brewpubs who design their beers around beers that already exist, and this one seems to be designed to appeal to the BMC fans of remote Northern New Jersey.
Kroghs Gold;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;on tap-pours a white head and gold color. Aroma is medium malt, secondary hops. Taste is medium malt-light caramel, secondary hops, creamy. OK/mild carbonation.
Kroghs Alpine Glow Red Ale;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;DATE: February 7, 2019... OCCASION: watching Penn State try to finish a comeback against Ohio State... GLASSWARE: Victory Hop Devil nonick... I was disappointed at this one's price tag ($14 for a grunt before tip, for a flagship with a low ABV to boot), so it's got some catching up to of its own... pours a dark amber red body with an army of cascading bubbles building a thin, off-white head that smears... thick caramel malts, sharp sugary esters, tea, butter, toffee, and woody pulp all factor in the aroma... first sip is creamy, sweet, and light-bodied--it begs for a second sip, though it doesn't sit deeply.... at the throat, it slips away quickly... refreshing, but not balanced as a red might be.... the butterscotch, copper, vanilla, toffee, and beech wood (like a Budweiser?) combine to make a strange, light, somewhat inoffensive sipper that could work in a quaint locale like Krogh's... at home, in full view, it is a less than impressive sports-watching accompaniment.... definitely not worth its price... and I went there hoping for their IPA, only to find that (for the second time), it was kicked....downer..
Kroghs Alpine Glow Red Ale;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Draft at the brewpub. A smooth and easy pale ale, hopped with fuggles. Not bad but nothing to get excited over.

Kroghs Alpine Glow Red Ale;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;(flight sampler) I love how this ale was named and this brew pub has a great location.

Kroghs Brogden Meadow Pale Ale;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;DATE: June 13, 2016... GLASSWARE: Victory Nonick...OCCASSION: Watching the Cavs in Game Five, down 3-1--can they stay alive?... Picked up this growler tonight, with the hopes of celebrating something.... pours a solid amber body with a hairline of white that rims the glass... a smear of white hazes the surface... a maltier, caramel allure with some earthy peat... the citrus is subdued, so much so that the beer resembles an ESB... the palate holds a buttery smoothness, with an effervescent start and a hearty finish that lingers slightly... unfortunately, buttery is not the quality sought after in a pale....no resin, no spruce--this is the knock most easily leveled against this, in a land where there are more flavorful pales--not to mention session IPAs--than I can count...the caramel and slight nuttiness make for some interest in an otherwise pedestrian, sessionable drink I have had quite often....

Kroghs Brogden Meadow Pale Ale;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Light amber with not much of a head, but enough to do the job. Lacing was decent, but I couldn’t grab much of an aroma. The flavor seems to be a cross between English malts and mild American hops (and I do stress mild).......basically, a pretty run of the mill brewpub attempt at pleasing the masses. Didn’t really didn’t impress.
Kroghs Brogden Meadow Pale Ale;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the brewpub.

Kroghs Log Cabin Nut Brown;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Chocolate and nut smells--this bodes well.

Kroghs Log Cabin Nut Brown;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Dark in color. Roasty flavor. Nothing special. Worth a try. Thin bodied. Malty.
Kroghs Log Cabin Nut Brown;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Unfortunatly none of their beerrs are really worth drinking. You kind of get your hopes up having to drive so far to get to a place in the middle of no where, but I guess they have a captive audience. The Nut Brown was watery without any characteristics worth mentioning.

Ship Inn Golden Wheat Light;Milford, New Jersey, United States;Wheat Ale;The Ship Inn Restaurant & Brewery;"Unobtrusive is how I would describe this beer. While it certainly has no ""off"" qualities, it really does not have many ""on"" qualities either. It would cerrtainly be a good thirt quenching summer libation, but it would not stand up to the rigors of a charred BBQ meal. Pouring a light golden color with a single finger of white head, the aroma is sugar cookie-like with a slight hint of lemon. Light bodied with a soft cottony mouthfeel, this beer ends abruptly, with nary a hint of aftertaste. Dry and soft, it was what I expected, and that’s not that great."

This brew poured slightly hazy (it was cask pumped) with a small creamy head and a light amber color. The aroma was strong with sweet toffee, with a slight hint of peaches and mustiness, like fruit stored in a cellar.

Tun Tavern Hefeweizen;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Tun Tavern;In short: Extremely boring beer offering basic wheat, honey and lemon. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Almost clear blonde body topped by a short-lived white head In long: Flavour is dominated by wheat and lemon with (surprisingly for the style) very little banana. Honeyed wheat with a lemon twist. Aggressive carbonation. This beer is boring, very boring, almost offensively boring. A lot more boring than my description sounds. The few flavour elements it had just didn’t stick together. Overall filling of some kind of commercial macro beer with forced flavour. Just like most people walking the street of this city, this beer is not a winner. As bland as a mashed potato sandwich.

Malty aroma with hop undertones of pepper and pine. Foamy mouthfeel. I’m usually quick to malign anything called an amber but this beer almost tastes like a bottle-conditioned homebrew rather than an obnoxious, clingy amber (read: Fat Tire).

Now packaged and sold as ""Slammin’ Amber,"" made by the Isotopes Brewing Co. in Moriarty, NM (a town near Albuquerque). This brew has a clear red-copper color and a thin head that quickly dissipates. Its aroma is tangy and initially somewhat unpleasant, but in a few moments it settles into an intriguing caramel and rye blend, with spicy hops undertones. The taste is very refreshing and crisp, while also being a bit earthy and chewy. It has a good amount of hops tingle. Mouthfeel is silky and rich. Aftertaste is clean. This one was better than I expected."

A decent beer but not much distinguishes it from so many contemporary Pale Ale microbrews.

Sea Dog Golden Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);I didn't really care for this. A very unassuming brew without much pizazz about it.

Cintra Pilsen;Itu (SP), Brazil;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasil Kirin (Heineken);Can in Bogota. Simple white bubbles, very pale yellow gold. Fruity, corny malt. Simple fruity lager body. A bit too corny and flavorful to be really refreshing, even in this context of this style. Fizzy carb and round mouth. Not great.
Cintra Pilsen;Itu (SP), Brazil;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasil Kirin (Heineken);I bought this beer in Spain. I drank it in Sevilla. It is again the typical product of globalized lager, without interest. The kind of beer that it it is cheap and boring. The color is gold, average carbonation, thin and white foam, the taste is watery, some cereals, no hop.
Cintra Pilsen;Itu (SP), Brazil;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasil Kirin (Heineken);Company ran by a notorious portuguese swindler. The beer disapeared of the portuguese market after a couple of months. The product was not that bad but quite forgettable.
Cintra Pilsen;Itu (SP), Brazil;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasil Kirin (Heineken);A watered down pilsner, drinkable but I’d question the 4.8% APV but for the price not bad - drank copius amounts of this stuff in 2007
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);On tap @ The Dublin, Copen. A clear ish deep amber looking one, a nice medium sized beige lacing head. Sweet thin caramel aroma, some fruity elements. Quite mild I would definitely say. Really needed a beer now, so I guess anything would be just fine, but it’s not bad tasting. A thin light oily feeling in the mouth and a high carbonation level. Soft fruity, some strawberries and then caramel. No IPA at all, but it did the job just fine cause thirsty as heck I am. 01.05.2014
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Rated from old notes. Starts off like a light British bitter, sweetens inexorably, until halfway through you feel like your drinking a flat soda with strong caramel notes. Unpleasant. Avoid this mess.
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Red-orange-brown beer. Malty with caramel and roasted notes. Terrible smell and taste. Never more
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"""not a huge fan of this one. i bought it out of respect for their scottish ale, which i like, but this one fell pretty flat. tame for an ""ipa"" by any sane person’s standards, boring to most."""
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"Originally rated June 2004. 500ml can. Redish-brown with a nice lasting bubbly head. Very little aroma, very light carbonation. Bitter caramel taste with a smooth metallic finish. Like other mentioned, hard to take it as an IPA (more like an ""English Brown Ale"")."
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Pours a surprisingly brownish color with a little bit of a head that quickly goes away. Aroma is weak and hard to pin down... Taste is a bit watery. Floral and nut flavors come through (weakly) followed by a bit of acid and a little hoppy bitterness. It feels like an IPA light or something.
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Clear amber with a white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, caramel and fruity. Flavor is moderate sweet and light bitter. A bit light bodied. More sweet than bitter. 241004
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Absolutely the WORST IPA I have ever had. True, I was taking a chance with an IPA from Scotland. Chances are it was brewed when I was in grad school. Nose - that nauseating smell you got as a kid, going through your parents’ or grandparents’ liquor cabinet. Finish, cloyingly sweet. No bitterness, no flavor other than stale bay rum. Let me add - this dirtwater was drainpour. I would rather drink Bud, Coors or MGD than this shit.
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);A fairly average ale. Can’t really remember it but I did not think it was great.
McEwan's India Pale Ale;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);I thought this beer was a little flat and tasteless. Pour is amber. Nose and taste is just not really there. Some citrus and spruce. Light caramels. Rated 11/22/02
Suprema;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Shared 12 oz., green bottle poured to snifters showing a clear, straw color, with a modest layer of white froth, and light spots of lacing. The nose was light Pils & lager scent, grain, jungle greenery & grass, and a notion of oxidation. Light bodied, with low carbonation, the taste followed similarly, with thin texture, slight grainy & earthy bitterness, and a bland disposition.
Suprema;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Pours clear, pale golden with a two finger, white head. Aroma is grass and corn syrup. Taste is corn syrup, moving to light citrus and grassiness. Finish is thin hops.
Suprema;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Unremarkable pour, not much foam. Tastes like a typical tropical beer. Nothing to differentiate it.

Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;The beer this brewery is known for. As far as Chile beers go, its not bad. Very vegetal. Tried for the first time in 2007.
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;On draft at the brewpub. Light aroma of pear and flowers. Starts out watery and a little citrusy, then the scovils begin to kick in and spread around the palate. Good stuff.
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;tap at the brewpub - Nice well balanced. Touch of hay and kick. Some floral orange spice
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Tap @ Eskes. Pours a fairly clear golden appearance with a white head. Straw, veggie, lightly spicy aroma. Kind of bland, watery, green chili, pale malty flavor with a fair amount of spiciness on the finish.
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;This is the 3rd chile beer I’ve tried, and only gave it a chance because it was a free sample. Thank goodness I did give it a taste because it proved to me this style can be rewarding. The chile scent and tongue tingle was there, but it didn’t overtake the palate or have nasty lingering effect.
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;A friend brought this bomber at the brewpub. We shared it. Dingly and cloudy golden with sediment in the bottom of the bottle. The nose is green peppers and that is also the taste. Decent malt, too, but subtleties are difficult to pick out through the peppers. They are warm but not over powering. A decent version.
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Tap at the pub. This beer pours a clear light yellow to straw color. Has a very small amount of white head. Very little. Aroma is sweet, grainy, with maybe a bit of spice. Hard to pick out on the aroma. Flavor is dry grains, a touch of popcorn with the chili spice and heat on the finish. I’m pretty sure there might be a touch of diacetyl in this but the spice covers up a lot.
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;bottle brought to dak’s on 1/31/11. pale hazy yellow with a short lived white head. it smells like the inside of a fresh chocolate pepper... mixed with hatch chiles, rice and a touch of citrus. the palate is a bit too sweet for me... kinda like a sprite with chile added... but it rocks a great chile aftertaste. it is crisp and mild (heat) enough to make me want to drink more of it though it does seem to have an artificial sugar thing going on.6/3/6/3/14
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draft @ brewpub. Hazy yellow. Bright and assertively green chili aroma is unmistakable. I like how they didn’t hold back on it. The body is light and quaffable. Considered giving the palate score a 4 because of how welcome the heat is on the back of my throat. The flavor is really mellow, and balanced. Seems like just the right kind and amt of green chili and the right type of pale malts. Finishes clean, even crisp. Good enough to have a pint of, and actually a good job for what can be a difficult style. But if anyone is going to succeed with a green chili beer it better be a New Mexican!
Eskes Taos Green Chile Beer;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Hazy blonde. No head. Abundant green chile aroma. A little watery but a very pleasant, mild chile character to balance.

Eskes Wandas Wicket Wheat;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Hazy, dark lemon color and a soft clean white head. Unexpected richness and mild spice in the aroma plus some light esters. Flavor has a crisp citrus tanginess, some pepper and plastic phenolics, a grainy malt character that I haven’t detected in other wheat beers, and spicy hop notes.
Eskes El Jefe Weizen;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;A summer seasonal, draft @ brewpub. Hazy yellow. Floral aroma. More wit than weizen in character. Delicate, light, with a good yeast character on the palate.
Eskes Taos Mountain Gold;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Tried for the first time back in 2008 on my first visit to the brewery. Gold and light. Thin grassy hops, some light citrus. Pretty decent malt balance.

Eskes Artist Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;cloudy unfiltered dull orange. awful chemical cleaner and rubbing alcohol smell and flavor. soft texture, smooth and creamy but absolutely foul-tasting. lasting ethanol and disinfectant.
Eskes Artist Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draft @ brewpub. Warm honey color with stable head. Buttery aroma, but not offensively so. Weird how the diacetyl blends with the hop bitterness in a way that actually works.
Eskes Artist Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Buttery, spicy. Very mild. Light fruity and spicy hops. Light bodied. 2.5 Peach Naked Ale: Light peach aroma. Palate is bitter, fruity peaches. Too sweet. Light body.

Aroma is mild yet pleasing with floral/wet grassy hops and some lighter pale malt accents and melon-like notes. Taste is nice and mellow with an easy going hoppyness thats yielding with good pale biscuit malts. Very slight bittering, kinda grassy, a touch fruity over the top and has a good medium body with a fluffy carbonation making for it one easy drinker. One of the better brews at Eske’s that I had. Really hits the spot after a day of walking through town on a hot spring day.
Eskes Artist Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Golden body and tight sudsy head. Hoppy aroma of savory cheese and apples. Fresh flavor. Very bready with a decent bitter finish. A bit thin and soapy in the mouth.
Eskes Brown-Eyed Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Tried for the first time in 2007 at the brewery and only now getting to the rating. Light brown appearance, though the chocolatey body I would’ve expected it pretty nondescript. Underwhelming.

Eskes Mesa Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;On tap at the Eske’s brewery with a green chili veggie burger for lunch. Nice afternoon. Quiet little bar and the beer went down pretty nicely.

Aroma is light, some hops and bitterness on the nose. Flavor is dry hops, banana sweetness, and hop bitterness on the finish. Not bad.
Eskes Mesa Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Hazy light amber. Light and fruity with some light malt. Earthy and lightly citrusy, with some phenols. The finish is a little funky.
Eskes Mesa Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draft at the brewpub. Has a nice warm golden haze with thin but even lacing. The Amarillo hops are not yet coming through probably because of how cold the beer is. But the flavors finish with a lovely honey character that is intriguing. Smells very resinous. Tastes so too. Some lemon zest. And Starbucks level pastry crust. OK but where’s the Amarillo?
Eskes Mesa Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;My first beer tasted in New Mexico while on a trip with my Brother and Sister in law. This is a Taos Brew pup with excellent food and average beer. This was a10 oz glass with a good head and lacing. Nose was a little a yeasty. Bitterness was present at the nose and finish. The Mesa Ale had an acidic finish
Eskes Mesa Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Creamy texture and light-to-medium body made it easy to drink. Cloudy amber-orange hue with its foamy head made it look appealing. Surprisingly malty, with elements of caramel, bread and earth. A balanced bitterness followed. Overall, it was a decent drinker, but it was a bit too mainstream and unexciting.
Eskes Mesa Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draught. Pours amber with an edgy rocky tan head. Fruity hop perfumey aroma with caramel malt notes. Sweet fruit hop and caramel malt flavor with yeast notes. Medium bodied and thin clean palate.
Eskes Mesa Pale Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;On-tap at the brewpub: Clear gold color, thin whitish head, some spotty lace. Smell is way off, strongly sitting alcoholic waft with mixed buttery nuts and wet cloth sit on top of some slightly fruity malt tones. Flavors are flat and laced habbadashery with alcoholic warmth that doesn’t sit well anywhere on the palate. Some slight fruit tones and hop bitterness make it in, but its quite tasteless and has a very booze filled sense that just doesn’t sit well. Feel is flat and fairly watery, no body what so ever really. This was one 10oz glass unfinished.
Eskes Scottish Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Attractive chestnut-colored body with a silky beige head. Nice sweet caramel and toffee nose with a faint roasty note. Mouth-watering aroma, like candy. Rich malty flavor with medium apparent sweetness and low bitterness. Has a tannic quality on the tongue. This is a solid and enjoyable batch of Scottish Ale.
Eskes Scottish Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Dark copper in color. Light toffee aroma. Moderate bodied, lots of molasses. Aaagghh acetaldehyde up the ying yang. Granny smith apple flavor just ruins this. Thanks to Gary from the homebrew club for sharing this.
Eskes Scottish Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Deep red with thin head. Candied malt flavors, light alcohol character, bit of herbal spiciness. OK.
Eskes Scottish Ale;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;A beer that the Scottish would scoff at. Pours a deep amber. WAY TOO HOPPY! Terribly low in a malt profile and NO, I mean absolutely NO peat. Just a sad beer from a pretty poor brewery in a town that deserves something better.
Eskes Doobie Rock Heller Bock;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Buttery, sweet palate. Oily. Lots of german hops, sweet malts. Cloudy. To style.

Light ring of beige colored head. Aroma is very chocolatey, roasted malts and dark sweet sugar. Flavor is dark malts, big roast, light bakers chocolate and perhaps a hint of coffee? Has a pseudo sweetener finish. Still, the best beer from them I’ve had so far.
Eskes Oat Cole Porter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Amber-brown. Toasty aroma. Thin but with toasty, cocoa notes. Simple, but respectable porter with light oaty character late.
Eskes Oat Cole Porter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draft @ brewpub. Nice black with thick lasting head. Silky astringent coffee aroma. Continues to be silky in the palate. Lightly acidic coffee and chocolate flavors with nice subtle roast too. One of their better ones.
Eskes Oat Cole Porter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;"Draught. Pours black with an average, creamy, off-white head, mostly lasting with good lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (roasted grain, bitter chocolate, burnt coffee), average hops (perfume), average yeast (leather, sweat, soap) with notes of wet charcoal, tar, and prunes. Light bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Average duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity and bitterness; a sour, wet sock flavor comes through at the end."
Eskes Oat Cole Porter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Watery, sour. Light roasted malts and chocolate. Very roasty finish. Drinkable.
Eskes Oat Cole Porter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;On-tap at the pub: Tarrnished dark brown color with crimson highlights, clearish body overall with a thin ivory cap and thinly placed strings of lace stick. Aroma is faint of roasty blackened malts with slight charred chocolate notes. Flavor has a bit more action but still misses the mark. Oaty dark sweetness with hazelnut and vanilla mixing with notes of chocolate and coffee roast. Tiny hint of hop bite towards the finish. A bit thin on top but finish is decent enough with mostly a thinner body throughout and drys out a bit. Drinkable but lacking.
Eskes Oat Cole Porter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Pours black with a lasting off-white head. Aromas of caramel chocolate and highly kilned grains. Very full bodied for the style. I would say a hopped-up oatmeal stout is more a more accurate category. I agree, this is Eske’s best brew.
Eskes Oat Cole Porter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Dark brown with auburn edges. Aroma of green and black olives and dark-roasted coffee. The aroma notes follow through into the flavor except the olive is more subdued and some chocolate malt quality comes to the forefront. A very roasty and fairly interesting porter.
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Not a bad dry stout. Tried it back in 2008 in Taos. Light and pretty watery. Sweetness is very understated.
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draft @ brewpub. Looks nitro poured with a nice soft head. Very thin beer, but no other flaws. Is very soft and is characterized mainly by a light dusting of cocoa.
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Light brown colour is a bit odd, and doesn’t suit a stout-drinker’s eyeballs. Toasty, lightly nutty character. Thin. This is a bit like a weak porter, so disappointing.
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Dark brown with very little head. Light and watery texture with very little carbonation. Flavors were nice (dark chocolate, roast, slight sourness) but their complementing aromas seemed to die too quickly. Overall, I thought this one was a bit flat and boring.
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draught. Pours opaque with no head. Dark coffee roasted and toasty malt aroma with chocolate notes. Bitter-heavy chocolate and coffee malt flavor. Dark bodied and thin palate.
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;"The problem with rating beers from here is that they never have the same brewer for more than a year and the consistency is just terrible with all of their beers. This one pours a muddy unfiltered black with a tan head. Aroma of coffee and burnt toast. Nice burnt flavors with some subtle off-flavors. This beer has a very ""homebrewed"" quality to it. Unrefined but enjoyable all the same."
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Nice black finish with a standing tan head. Smooth, but only a tickle of coffee flavors and mildly bittered. Just OK.
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Very dark, muddy-brown with ruby highlights and a creamy tan head. Black coffee and dark chocolate aroma and flavor. Lacking in bitterness. Very smooth mouthfeel. A decent stout.
Eskes Seco Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;"Deep brown color, medium tan head. Smells like coffee beans; very pleasent mix of nuts/coffee and chocolate. Mild feeling in the mouth, with a good mix of roasted and chocolate flavors, but lacking something definite."
Eskes 10,000 Foot Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Tap @ Eskes. Pours a clear, reddish brown appearance with a light head. Dark chocolate, herbal, a touch earthy aroma. Watery, anise, plum, blackberry, syrupy, chocolate flavor. Yuck.
Eskes 10,000 Foot Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma of chocolate syrup, light roast, and sweet malt. Smells good, but doesn’t taste so great. Flavor of an odd sweetness with a paradoxical light palate, some roast, and a sharp alcoholic finish. Boozy without the strong palate to back it up and the flavor lacks all the nice notes contained in the aroma. A disappointing imperial stout. 7/4/5/3/12 [3.1/5]
Eskes 10,000 Foot Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Sampled at the Colorado Beer Festival this past summer. Three-finger sample poured a rich black with cappuccino head. Nose is predominantly chocolate and honey. Some light brown sugar comes through on the tongue, with more chocolate (of the dark, 90% cacao variety) and honey lingering on the palate. Served a bit cold, so that likely deadened the flavor a bit, but an otherwise solid brew.
Eskes 10,000 Foot Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Black in color...opaque. Thin head, though it was poured from a growler. Laces quite well despite this. Bold, fragrant aroma, with notes of chocolate and coffee. Roasted malt flavor fills the front, accompanied by a heavy sweetness...smooth mouthfeel. Sweet maltiness continues into the back, though mellowed by an aura of alcohol. Finish is of roasted malt, with a slight burn from the ABV. Not one of the most well built or balanced stouts...with some refining however, this brew could be pretty tasty.
Eskes 10,000 Foot Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draft at SBR 7/11/09. Pours a beige head, over a clear and very dark brown (SRM 30) body....nose is coffee, chocolate, but there are also heavy unpleasant phenols....taste has some sweetness to start, but is very sharp and harsh toward the finish.
Eskes 10,000 Foot Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;This is supposed to be an Imperial Stout according to Eskes staff. A major geyser erupted when I popped this bottle ejecting one-third of the contents. Opaque muddy black body and fading tan head. Big coffee notes in the nose. Sour flavor like old coffee and raisins. Body is thin and oily. This was a sad and disappointing drainpour. The fact that it gushed plus the sourness makes me think this was infected. I want my 6 bucks back. I chased this one with a Stone 6th to make me feel better.
Eskes 10,000 Foot Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Pours pitch black with a hazel colored head. Nose of rum raisins similar to Sammy Smiths. Thin body for the style. Good flavors of rum and dried fruits. Major complaint is the alcohol,...and I don't mean that there is too much but that it is poorly masked. Descent but unbalanced.
Eskes 10,000 Foot Stout;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Back when I had this last, in 2002, I wasn’t very impressed. Seems they’ve improved things a bit ... Dark color with a tan creamy head (nitro, I presumed). Texture was light, soft and milky. Slightly musty aroma. Very light roastiness. Noticeably hot alcohol nips kind of turned me off. Drinkable, but unexciting.

Eskes Irish Red;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;On-tap at the pub: Browned copper color, thin ivory compact top, minimal thin strings of lace stick. Aroma is quite interesting and very nice, its alot of dried cedar thats very deep and earthy with a peet moss richness thats just lovely to behold. Notes of walnuts and vienna malt sweetness of darkened breads. Taste is of dark sweetened malts, heavy earth/stone oven baked bread toastiness thats quite nice. mild hop notes of pine and grass linger a smidge but overall ends a bit shy. Could’ve used more, but still is favorable. The earth tones are really nice in this. Feel is near medium with a thin drying finish that has a bit of hop spice and nuttyness. A very nice surprise.
Eskes Irish Red;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Pours a nice deep amber with a nice creamy head.

Pretty poor but the best thing they had on tap.

Eskes Irish Red;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Very deep red hue, great looking beer. General aromas were very light, very hard to distinguish anything. Taste was a little sour and bland, like chewing on a peice of plastic. Overall the beer was too watery, with a taste close to appauling.
Eskes Why Rye;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Rye lends it a very subtle spicyness, but its very much the background to a mildly sweet amber. Tried for the first time back in 2008 on my first trip to the brewery.
Eskes Why Rye;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;On tap at Eske’s. Unexpectedly fruity aroma on this. Dash of rye in there, but this is surprisingly soft and Belgian-like for the style. Good one.

The amber color was clear and inviting. The ale had a medium body and with nice head and smooth taste. One of their best. The food was special at Eske’s. The green chili stew is a winner. The salsa was also the best we had in New Mexico.

Eskes Special Bitter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Special? Not REally? Bitter? Not too much, but it IS somewhat sweet. Slightly less sweet and slightly more bitter and a session pint it might be.
Eskes Special Bitter;Taos, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Eske's Brew Pub & Eatery;Draught, listed as Victory Bitter but I could not tell for sure that it was a different beer, and the website only lists this one and the organic bitter.

Hints of alcohol build and become comfortably warming."
Santa Fe Hops Sky Patrol Porter;Santa Fe Springs, California, United States;Porter;Santa Fe Hops Brewhouse;"Had this -- I''m pretty sure -- in NM. The adept bartender told me it was Santa Fe Brewing''s Porter. I asked if it had a name. She said, ""yes, it''s their porter."" So I''m assuming this is it. Anyway, it was a decent porter. Albeit thin bodied. Though, it had an interesting, smoky nip and a sharp and roasty finish. Rather carbonated. Not very sweet at all. A little ""too easy"" to drink."
Second Street ESB;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Second Street Brewery;Tap@Brewery. Pours copper with a small head. Not much here on the nose - little hops and a slightly caramel nose, finishing one-dimensional. Overall, the beer lacked nerve.

Pours a murky dark amber with a decent head that resides quickly. Aroma of floral hops with a slight roast in there. Hits with a strong bitterness that rounds out to a solid malt base.

Second Street IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;Draft @ downtown location. Hazy, almost cloudy, red-orange. Mango aroma is surprisingly bright. Juicy beer overall. The sweet malt profile helps it to be very balanced in general if not too sweet due to a yeasty character.
Second Street IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;Hazy amber with a thin head. The aroma is quite earthy, maybe a little cheesy. I found the caramels lead the beer. It’s quite soft, with light woody hops. OK IPA, maybe a bit easy-going.

Has a lightly sweet pale malty nose with a crisp citrusy hoppy presence.

An ok pale ale, but could use a little more assertive hoppy presence.
Second Street Pale Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Second Street Brewery;Pours darker than the style. Thick creamy head. This is hoppier than their IPA and a much better beer overall. Not complex but a great session brew. Definitely must try this place while in Santa Fe. Good atmosphere and food. Real good brew!
Second Street Cream Stout;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Second Street Brewery;Tasted on tap in a sampler flight at their Railyard location.

Nicely balanced with a sticky, moderately bitter finish and a fairly clean yeast character.
Second Street Kidder Special Bitter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Second Street Brewery;Draft @ brewpub. Had side by side with Rod’s ESB, and made a great comparison. Kidder is darker with richer hue and richer malt character throughout. Reddish color. Aroma has some dark woody malt. Smells and feels bigger bodied than the Rod’s. The toasty aftertaste is pleasantly bitter. Is bready, earthy, pretty rich and toasty. Higher gravity feel than Rod’s, which might come into play if looking for a session ale. This is overall a little better of a bitter but both very good.
Second Street Kidder Special Bitter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Second Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub in August 2009. Reviewed from notes. Pours the color of bread crust with a light off white head and a small amount of lacing. The nose brings out some bread and caramel with some very mild earthy hops in the background.

Second Street Kidder Special Bitter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Second Street Brewery;Tap at Brewery, pours a deep dark copper with good head and lacing.

Second Street Kidder Special Bitter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Second Street Brewery;Deep copper body. Aroma is vegetal with DMS and sulfur notes and an earthy hop character. Spicy, EKG quality flavor with some hoppy, tannic properties. Seems off.

Second Street Old Pecos Porter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Second Street Brewery;Draft @ brewpub. Is black, looks rich and thick, and has a thick tan head. Viscosity looks promising. Has that good sort of metallic/mineral and inky aromas and flavors that I like in porter, with a very smooth body. Highly drinkable. These guys really know how to work with malt.
Second Street Old Pecos Porter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Second Street Brewery;Dark brown. This was actually poured with a thin head - a nice change of pace. The aroma is chocolatey, maybe a bit of roast. On the palate, it has a more toasty, chocolatey accent. The mouthfeel is creamy, and there’s a bit of dryness from hops to balance the creamy malt sugars. Not perfect - there’s a bit of huskiness late - but it’s pretty nice.
Second Street Old Pecos Porter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Second Street Brewery;Sampler at the brewery. 5.2% ABV. Pours a thin head over a dark brown (SRM 35) clear body.....nose of coffee, chocolate, bit of spicy hop......taste heavy in roasted malts (coffee, cocoa), with a lingering mild hop bitterness....mouth feel was rather light, carbonation low. Overall this was a rather light Porter. The basic flavors of the malt back bone were there but there was much missing in the depth of flavors and textures
Second Street Old Pecos Porter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Second Street Brewery;Dark brown with almost no head. Choco-coffee aroma. Woody-bitter flavors, with smoky overtones. OK.
Second Street Old Pecos Porter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Second Street Brewery;Pours very dark brown, maybe black with a medium tan head. Medium hopped, coffee aroma. Served way too cold. Lightly sour and bitter finish. Medium roasted malt flavor. A nice porter.
Second Street German Altbier;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Second Street Brewery;Amber. Slight haze. Earthy, malty aroma. Very rich, malty with lots of alcohol and light fruitiness. As a random amber I don’t think it works, and it is definitely not an alt.
Second Street German Altbier;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Second Street Brewery;Draft @ brewpub. Amber and clear, small head and scant lacing. Aroma is woody, toasty malts. Very toasted, malts probably too toasted for the style and also seems very high gravity. Ends up seeming harsh and aggressive. Drinkable but not authentic or particularly enjoyable.
Second Street German Altbier;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Second Street Brewery;Draught. Pours clear copper/red with nearly no head. Nice malt depth, not too sweet. Caramel with a strong toasty finish. Aroma shows slight fruit among all the maltiness. Good texture. Quaffable but still full-bodied with slight astringency in finish.
Second Street German Altbier;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Second Street Brewery;Pours a lite amber with a very small head. Aroma is of cookie maltiness with some big earthy and floral hops. Flavors are somewhat caramelly with some really spicy hops. Body is med. Finish is bitter and somewhat minerally and dry. Not bad but the hops are too much for the style. Bitterness needs to be kept below 50 and the aroma and flavor need to just compliment the hops. In this interpretation the hops somewhat overpower the maltiness. Earlier Rating: 2/14/2005 Total Score: 2.4 I am rating this based on the fact that they have called it an alt. Pours a lite cloudy amber. Aroma of some caramel and,... what’s that? HOPS! Firm body (that’s good) but the hopy flavors mask the munich malts. There’s even a dry heavily bitter finish. Since when were altbiers 45 IBUs? This tastes like an APA with a differentiated hop bill.
Second Street Belgian Witbier;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Second Street Brewery;Draught. Nice cloudiness, orange-yellow with no head. Sweet citrus aroma. Little spice. Flavor is slightly tart citrus. Boring wit, too sweet and one-dimensional, though with a nice creaminess.
Second Street Belgian Witbier;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Second Street Brewery;Sampler at the brewery.

This is a fairly typical Witbier in nose and taste, but the cloudiness overwhelms the appearance. Tasting of 10/10/09.
Second Street Belgian Witbier;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Second Street Brewery;Hazy, straw-lemon color, and low carbonation. A musty/earthy yeast aroma plus grapes and citrus. Flavor of oranges, grapes, and grain with some non-hop bitterness in the aftertaste suggesting citrus peels. Medium-body and wheaty mouth.

Second Street Bohemian Pilsner;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Second Street Brewery;Draft @ brewpub. Dark coppery gold, nice color. Poured with no head, would look so much better in proper glass with a head but whatever. Second visit got pitcher and it gave nice head to the beer so yeah it’s nice. Slight diacetyl in aroma, then bright pale malt and distinct earthy hop and mushroom character. At first I do not like but upon revisiting I like. Palate is thick and soft, and buttery. Personally I would prefer a lighter, lower grav version that was more refreshing but after all it does go down well. Has a really nice hop character, which is leafy in the body, and is very balanced by big malt backbone.
Second Street India Pale Ale 500;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;Light, golden color with creamy white head. Dank aroma. Medium/ light mouthfeel. Bitter, nutty flavor. OK IPA, but not my favorite. Some lace retention, but not heavy.

Aromas of spicy , citrusy hops with some minor fruity esters in the back. Flavors are heavily floral with just a boat-load of hops. Med-lite body. Dry bitter finish. No phenolics. I would have fermented in it warmer and let it sit to get some flocculation but this is enjoyable if not a bit overly-hopped.
Second Street Oktoberfest;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Second Street Brewery;"i really like this place, hell both locations. so it pains me to rip into as i am about to. so, from the preceding sentence you know the beer sucks. but, let’s discuss how bad. it pours decent, bit more brown than orange and the head runs away like me facing commitment to a nice young lady. i understand that, hell, maybe you only had pilsner malt and cheerios to make the beer, we all make due. smellls, well of cheeerios and pilsner malt. swear to god there is honeynut cheerios in this. smells of it, tastes of honey nut cheerios, pickles and old milk. i drank a fucking pint of this thinking, ""no way is this honey nut cheerios, and sour milk with some pickle juice mixed in"" i was wrong. it is. i paid 4.50 for this husky sour grainy mess. and i tipped as i liked the folks bringing me this monstrosity. bad beer by a good brewery. next year had best be better, and i believe will be."
Second Street Oktoberfest;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Second Street Brewery;Amber-brown colour. No head, but that’s normal at Second St. The aroma is mostly caramelly, maybe into toffeeish territory a bit. On the palate, some caramel and alcohol. Definitely some phenols (bubblegum) and esters that shouldn’t be there. Similar to the Altbier, lots of flaws.
Second Street Oktoberfest;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Second Street Brewery;Sampler at the brewery. Pours a thin head, with lovely lacing, over a clear dark amber(SRM 10) body.......nose is primarily kilned malts, with toffee and caramel dominating, mild hop spice......taste is toffee, caramel, roasted malts, with a light spicy hop finish.....mouth feel is medium, carbonation low. This is a nice rendition of the style.
Second Street Oktoberfest;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Second Street Brewery;Draught. Pours bronze to brown with patchy off-white head. Caramel malt and yeast aroma. Yeast grainy malt flavor with caramel notes. Medium bodied and watery palate. I was not impressed with this beer especially after having five other beers from them that were good.
Second Street Imperial Stout;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Second Street Brewery;EXCELLENT! SMOOOOOTH! Perfect amount of smoke flavor combined with a slight sour taste. Great combination of sour and smoked flavors. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Second Street Imperial Stout;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Second Street Brewery;A very nice, dry, bitter imperial, unlike a lot of american-made renditions - quite smooth and balanced, with a creamy mouthfeel - starts off with moderate sweetness, with flavors of chocolate and anise - dries out through the middle, with a lot of roast and dark malt bitterness arriving and sticking through the finish - a lot of espresso character in the finish - a hint of tartness, even - complex and tasty, with well-masked alcohol.
Second Street Imperial Stout;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Second Street Brewery;Poured from a growler of Nico’s @ TMBC. Pours opaque with a deep brown head, nice lacing. Straight foreward aroma of burnt grains and alcohol. Some good high alpha hops in the nose to. Med. heavy body. Flavors of coffee chocolate and burnt grains. Very straight foreward without any of the dried fruits or ruminess that I like in Imperial Stouts but this is well made. Resiny bitterness in the finish. Thanks Nico.
Second Street Imperial Stout;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Second Street Brewery;Very deep brown head on top of a black body. Smells like roasted wood and plums, though a little like sardines. Taste is full: like chocolate syrup in coffee, with a very sweet finish. Tastes and feels like smoking a fine cigar, though it doesn’t mask the alcohol very well.
Second Street Imperial Stout;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Second Street Brewery;Black and bitter. No sweetness at all. Expected alcohol presence is absent.
Second Street Imperial Stout;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Second Street Brewery;Light plum, other fruit esters blend well with some substantial roastiness, some cola-edged brightness, slightly herbal and a touch sticky, hints of must. Complex and interesting.
Second Street Golden Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Second Street Brewery;Draught. Pours hazy gold with edgy white head. Sour yeast (sweat) malt (grain, straw) aromas. Bitter acidichop flavor with a yeast body. Light bodied and clean palate.
Second Street Golden Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Second Street Brewery;tap at brewrey-pours golden yellow with white head around glass edge. Very citrus aroma, probably the most hoppy golden ale i have ever wiffed. Flavors are german and american hops with some spicy bitter notes. Not much finish and the body was slightly thin. Had a good start, but just couldnt keep up with the pace.
Second Street Golden Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Second Street Brewery;Draft: Poured yellow with a thin white head. Light citrus aroma, hops. Taste is hoppy with some orange notes and a strong flavor of cilantro or some other kind of plant. Moderate alcohol finish. This is a pretty decent Golden Ale that actually has some flavor.

Second Street Golden Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Second Street Brewery;Clear yellow hue, white head. Taste is very light, not much body, middle-of-the-road ale, fairly bland. My least favorite of the brews.
Second Street Golden Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Second Street Brewery;"Crisp and fairly refreshing with a moderate amount of carbonation. Flowery and herbal, aromatic nose/aroma. Rather hoppy for a ""golden"" style, which I liked. Malt side was light, but nice, with a ""malted milk"" sweetness to it. Flowery and leafy bitterness in the finish."
Second Street Golden Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Second Street Brewery;Herbal, peppery hops, some light fruit esters, a faint Coorsy aroma, light bodied.
Second Street Alternator Doppel Alt;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Second Street Brewery;Tap @ Second Street Santa Fe Railyard. Pours a bit hazy, dark orange appearance with a light brown head. A touch smoky/roasty, thick caramel, grassy aroma. Carbonation is a touch low. Thick caramel, slightly syrupy malty, slightly flavor, mild dark fruity flavor. Ok, I guess. Maybe the best I’ve had here but it’s flawed.
Second Street Alternator Doppel Alt;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Second Street Brewery;Slightly hazy. Amber, it’s flat looking and a bit dull. Has a heavy caramel character. A simple beer, I guess somewhere between a sticke and a bock.
Second Street Scotch Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Second Street Brewery;Tap at the railyard. Hazed dark burgundy with a thin head that fades to a tan ring quickly. Light smoke in the nose with a promise of sweetness. Sweetness denied! And this is a good thing. Smokey peat notes hit me 1st then a mellow roast. Some fruit notes come through in there with some plum, but just on the periphereal. Tobacco like finish leaves me wanting another sip.
Second Street Scotch Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Second Street Brewery;Dark brown. The aroma is chocolate, earthy and a little bit smokey. Rich, earthy, smokey, malty with light alcohol. Complex but easy-drinking. This was worthy of a few return trips, probably the best beer I’ve had at Second Street.
Second Street Scotch Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Second Street Brewery;Draft @ brewpub. Nearly black, looks like a porter, albeit on the oilier side and doesn’t have much head. Aroma is lovely blend of licorice and coal and enticing dark smoky malts. Great malt character throughout, silky palate, substantial body and delightful peaty flavors. Feels much lower gravity, is very well-made. Licorice and peat and roast. And just enough hops are here to keep it dry and complex. Surprisingly sessionable, happy beer.
Second Street Scotch Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Second Street Brewery;Pours a barely transparent dark amber mahogany with a frothy, well-lacing light tan head. Has a sweet dark caramel malty nose with an earthy smoky peat character. Body starts full and malty sweet with a nice, authentic smoked peat balance before a slightly drier toasty finish. Very true to style and enjoyable.
Second Street Barley Wine-Style Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Second Street Brewery;Tap @ Second Street Santa Fe Railyard. 2011 vintage. 11.2%. Pours a hazy maroon, red appearance with a small brown head. Rich dark fruity, light berry, caramel, vaguely sweet, pretty nice aroma. A bit strong, nice bodied, toffee/caramel malty, dark fruity, grape, plum flavor. Fairly smooth for 11.2%. Not too complex but pretty nice. How this is less sticky and syrupy than every other one of their beers is a fucking mystery to me.
Second Street Barley Wine-Style Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Second Street Brewery;Comes in an 8 oz. wine glass with very little head. Alcohol nose with faint hints of floral hops. The abn is not really hidden well even though the there is a defined maltiness. The flavor is rather one dimensional with the hops overpowering everything but the alcohol (ala bigfoot). A good offering but not the complexity of some other barlewines.
Cooperstown Old Slugger;Milford, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;Dark clousy orange color. A bit malt heavy for me, pine and classic apa bitterness, cracker bready malts, bittersweet finish. OK.

Cooperstown Old Slugger;Milford, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;The body has a slightly hazy look with a good amber color and a creamy off white head. The two finger head slowly settles as I drink and makes some spotty lacing on the glass. It has a nice blend of bready maltiness with a pleasant butterfinger like caramel/toffee sweetness and citrus/grassy hops. It starts with a good base of bready malt and very light toasted grain. This is balanced buy mildly bitter hops that add a touch of citrus and grassy flavor to the overall character. It finishes with a mild bitter fade on a smooth yet well carbonated medium body.
Cooperstown Old Slugger;Milford, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;"12oz bottle from Wegman’s, Buffalo, NY. Golden amber with a tight cream head; sweet grapefruit taste; and crisp fruity finish. A passable APA."

Medium bodied, sweet and oxidized, old dirty paper and prunes. Bitter paper into the finish. Not good.
Cooperstown Nine Man Ale;Milford, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;APPEARANCE- copper color w red hue, very nice head. NOSE- very earthy hop scent. Not floral, fruity or resin. FLAVOR- maltiness is evident. Hops are slightly perceptible, which works for a pale ale. NOTES- this is rated pretty poorly for what it is. It’s a drinkable pale ale. I suspect the lower rateing is because the ninth man knows what he is and isn’t trying to be like every other hopped up pale ale or ipa out there.
Cooperstown Nine Man Ale;Milford, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;It has a golden body with a good clear appearance. Its head is bright white and faids slowly. In the nose there are notes of pale maltiness and mild citrus hops. Like the aroma, the hop flavor is fresher and more vibrant. The light pale maltiness is cleaner as well and I didn’t notice any diacetyl notes. It is still light and fairly clean on the finish with just a little more citrus hop character. This is very refreshing, light bodied and easy drinking.

It isn’t a terrible beer, but it is hardly memorable. Eh...
Cooperstown Nine Man Ale;Milford, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;Bottle. Bottle was a huge gusher, spilling a quarter to a third of the bottle before I could get it into a glass. Finally pours a very hazed amber with a big fuzzy white head that eventually deflates. Smells horribly infected, big paper and old nastiness. Medium bodied, a touch lactic, infected and sweet. More old paper. Just bad.

Cooperstown Nine Man Ale;Milford, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;Picked up on a visit to the brewery while on vacation in the Cooperstown area.

Cooperstown Nine Man Ale;Milford, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;My wife brought this one back from a trip to Rochester. Pretty tasty for style. +++ Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer gushed a murky apricot color with a large foamy yellow-tan head that faded quickly and left no lacing.

On top is a tan colored foamy head. It slowly fades down to a thin wisp covering that makes some slick lacing. Its aroma has dark bready notes with some dark roasted and chocolaty barley malt. Hop notes are very mild and add a very light herbal quality to the overall aroma. There is a dark bready base with lots of dry, roasted, toasted and chocolaty maltiness. There is a very mild toffee like sweetness underneath that I really like. Hop flavor is well balanced for the style and adds plenty of dry herbal notes to the mix. It finishes very dry with dark chocolaty, toasted and very light coffee notes. The palate has strong medium body with a smooth texture and mellow carbonation.

On top sits a small one finger thick foam head. It is tan in color and quickly settles down to a thin wispy layer that just covers the top. Lacing is minimal and slippery. There is a firm aroma of sweet roasted/toasted malts with notes of fresh brewed coffee and just a hint of dark chocolate. There is a solid sweet roasted malty character with a good balance of toasted bready notes and dark roasted bitter coffee notes. As the beer warms hints of dark chocolate and mild spicy hops sneaks in there here and there as well as some mellow almost brandy like alcohol notes. The palate has a solid medium feel with mellow balanced carbonation.
Cooperstown Strike Out Stout;Milford, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;Head is short and fizzy, no strength in it at all, like soda pop. Cap falls into a beer that looks nearly still with no lacing or head except the constant carbonation rising to the surface. Aroma is weak and watery roast with a lot of lactose. Flavors have a lot of lactose also, i can’t believe this is a regular beer for this brewery, it is such an obvious flaw. Watery coffee. Thin mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. They need to stop making this, it’s embarrassing.

Cooperstown Back Yard IPA;Milford, New York, United States;IPA;Cooperstown Brewing Co.;"Pours a hazy golden amber. Pours with a tall head but fast fading. The head is white and soapy looking. Carbonation is pretty aggressive. Aroma is pretty good for an EIPA; light hops and caramel malts. There are low levels of diaceyl in the taste, not an issue here.Light fruitiness just before the finish. Finish is tart and dry. Medium in weight smooth drinking with a clean finish. Overall its a good beer. I think its a bit too tart for an EIPA."

Empire Hefe-Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Empire Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Yellow and hazy. Aroma is nutty with clove, light banana.

Plesant dry finish. Well-done standard Hefe. Anny more conventional and it would simply be called Hefe-Weizen… oh wait… it is.
Empire Hefe-Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Empire Brewing Company;Tim Burton gives his facelift on this one. Little lace and amber colour. Significant wheat though sour, too sour. Above average carbonation detracted. Maybe not as fresh as it could be. Quaffable, but not my type of hefe.
Empire Hefe-Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Empire Brewing Company;Ditto on the prior rater’s comments. Good beer but for me the banana was a little to overpowering to have more than one in a single sitting. Great beer though.

Empire C.C.s Bootleg Apple Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Empire Brewing Company;This is a cider, but better and less carbonated than your average store variety. I was surprised by how little carb it had. Still, too sweet for my liking, and not very reminiscent of beer.

Gilded Otter Three Pines IPA;New Paltz, New York, United States;IPA;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Draft. Pours orange with a white head. Muted floral hoppy notes, light diacetyl, and toffee. Not completely awful, but after a few solid offerings from this place, this was pretty disappointing.

Gilded Otter New Paltz Crimson Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Sampled @ Otter: Eh. The color is enticing but there’s not much else going on here. A solid copper colored pour with a ring of head remaining. No aroma to speak of, thankfully the initial taste was better. Hops and sugars were noticable, but again not much going on here. It’s clear from the disparity of ratings Otter may still be fine tuning their approach on this one.

Pours a deep rich black with a fairly dark tan medium sized head. Nose is sweet ripe stone fruits, coffee, and chocolate. Body is a little bit thin for an impy stout, bordering on medium, but I’d really like a big thick as motor oil body on this.

Gilded Otter Stone House Imperial Stout;New Paltz, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;A beer that was very well made but when layed next to other Imperials it didn’t quite make it. Poured a dark brown/black from the tap at the brewry. The smell of coffee hit me right away, very nice. I think I liked how this one stuck on the palate for so long. To be fair I had just ate so I would like to try it again some time. It was very very smooth.

Gilded Otter Weizen Bock;New Paltz, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;(Draught) Cloudy gold with a thin, white head. Nose of ripened bananas. Slightly tart with an initial banana punch. Wains quickly.
Gilded Otter Weizen Bock;New Paltz, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;First off, this is the palest weizenbock I have ever seen...Second, the omnipresence of the clovey bananas and the absence of any other kind of fruitiness and maltiness suggest that this is not a weizenbock as advertised but rather a regular weizen...A good beer, but would certainly be a disappointment for lovers of Aventinus Weizenbock or Ramstein Winter Wheat...
Gilded Otter Weizen Bock;New Paltz, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;For starters, everything about this beer says witbier not weizen bock. Pale straw colour.

Gilded Otter Winter Wassail;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a dark red color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white head, somewhat foamy and sustaining. Some sliding lace. The aroma had some clove, light breadiness, some nuts, light woodiness, vanilla extract and ends with a light earthiness. The flavor blends all of the previously mentioned aromas together, somewhat sweet and dry with a touch of spice. Mostly sweet aftertaste with a quick sweet nutty to vanilla and clove-like finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Once again, the spice is tame enough to not distract in the harshness along my tongue. ABV seemed reasonable for what the brewer projected. Overall, pretty nice winter warmer worthy of having again. Recommend to fans of the style when in season.
Gilded Otter Winter Wassail;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;On tap at the Otter. Pours a hazy red amber with a medium sized tan head. Sweet toasted malt aromas with a little light spice on the nose, though nothing prominent. Flavor is sweet with a little more spice. Finishes with a light bitter which contrasts well with the sweetness in the aroma and body.
Gilded Otter Winter Wassail;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Pint pour @ brewpub. Very very dark ruby red with a small but lasting and sticky head. Aroma is perfect for this style with lots of spices, mainly clove. However, what makes this special is there is a bit of hoppiness breaking through, just peaking its head out. The taste is again full of spices but there is also a nice light chocolate and dark malts. This aspects grows stronger as the beer warms up. The combination of the light hops in the aroma with the chocolate in the taste surrounded by those great spices makes this so awesome. On top of that its very easy drinking with average carbonation and low bitterness.
Gilded Otter Winter Wassail;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Perfumy nose, brown color, low biege head. Caramelly toasted malt front with hints of dark fruit. A perfumy effect emerges in the middle once the brew evaporate a little into the nose. Spiced end. Thin and weak. An interesting experiement, but this needs more refinement.
Gilded Otter Winter Wassail;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Nice brown-red color. Creamy head layer. Sweet and intense rhasberry taste- also sweet fruitiness in the nose.
Gilded Otter Winter Wassail;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Delightful, sweet candies in insightful cigar sagacity...Indolent wheat malt within redolent berry fragrances...An inquisitive bitterness in the back surprises and comprises, with the full malt, a creamy dunkel weizen which borders bockland...
Gilded Otter Winter Wassail;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;"Moderately sweet, slightly spicy, fairly malty, medium carbonation and hops, vague cookie nose, slight alcohol flavor, decent head and brick-red body. Nothing outstanding to make one think ""winter seasonal"", not sure what it is besides a slightly more alcholic pale ale, honestly. Just ok."

Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;Sampled at Craft beer store (Ithaca night) Reddish pour with aromas of Mild Hop and caramel malt. A little thin for my tastes but it was an easy beer to drink.
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;Growler from the brewery. 2007 version. Light chestnut brown with a moderately thick beige head. Aroma of flowery hops, walnuts, and a slight fruitiness. Pretty hoppy for an Amber, slightly citrusy upfront with pine tar in the finish. Sweet nuttiness throughout, with just a hint of roastiness, though that may be a combination of the nuttiness and the pine playing tricks on me.
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;"12 oz bottle. Medium copper, quite clear; massive forever-lasting head...gushing, in fact (infection? uh oh). Light grapefruity aroma with a bit of chewy woody malt. Odd but interesting flavor -- cherry cola comes to mind, and a bit of oakiness, grapefruit near the end. Medium body, too sweet and odd overall...doesn’t really work though I give it points for creativity."
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;Aroma is vile. Smells like vomit. Pours a cloudy copper/amber with a huge off-white head. Watery with sweetness in the middle. Watery finish with puke aftertaste. This is hideous.
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;The appearance is somewhat pale amber and isn't that impressive. The aroma is neutral, but slightly fruity. The flavor is almost of grapefruits, with a smack of hoppiness. The finish is on the bitter side. Admirable.
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;Starts off with a fruity, citrusy sweet aroma. The appearance is dark orange with a good sized white head - good lacing. Has a hoppy - citrusy bite to it - more akin to a California PA than an upstate NY amber. HInts of caramel mellow out the hoppines a bit - but still a litle too hoppy for an amber. Palate is a bit tonque numbing. Better than other Ithacas I have tried thus far though.
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;"Fairly dark amber colour with a perfect sized light tan head - spot on for the style! Aroma consists of hop pellets, mushrooms and a bit of yeast - ODD! Medium-bodied; Hoppy taste with some astringent characteristics and a strong malt background. Aftertaste shows almost nothing but a mild hop and malt taste. Overall, about average for the style. Not great, nor bad! I bought this twelve ounce bottle from Beers of the World in Rochester, New York and sampled it on 2-October-2003."
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;This amber's got a hop/caramel aroma. The flavor is nicely balanced with hop flavor and malt, the bitterness isn't severe. Very pleasant.
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;Aroma remeniscent of an English Pale Ale. Big head that shrinks to nothing quickly with minimal lacing. Body color is just as adverstised, amber. A nice hoppy beer upfront with the malts coming through in the long finish.
Ithaca Amber Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;A good enough amber ale. Beautifully clear golden appearance, with a good white head that fade too fast. Sort of a smallish tasting amber, in that it has nice balance but not much hops or caramel or malt. Nice balance also of floral aromatic hoppiness at the beginning and bitter hop finish, but nothing remarkable. My Ithaca friends say that there is high variability from month to month in Ithaca Beer Company's beers, so maybe this explains the greater enthusiasm of some of the earlier reviewers.
Ithaca Pale Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ithaca Beer Co.;Not bad at all! Aroma was a bit meh out of the bottle and not much if a head. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Ithaca Pale Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ithaca Beer Co.;1/5/14. 12oz bottle thanks to JBVatkeens! Best before January is ticked on the side of the label. Just in time. Lightly hazed orange pour with a solid khaki head that cuts in half but laces really well. Mild aroma, earthy, floral, seems the hops are fading. Much better flavor, more pungent hop character, resin, dank, pine, some citrus, very American. Tasty.
Ithaca Pale Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ithaca Beer Co.;Starts with citrusy smell and golden pour with some head and lacing. Nice grapefruit and pine in hops here. Hay and grassy bitter finish. Average carbonation. Good varied palate. Above average pale ale, reminds me of some of Bellwood’s monogamies. Tap at brewpub.
Ithaca Pale Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ithaca Beer Co.;misty golden orange with a rocky white head that stays awhile, puffs and swirls of lace. Good looking. Taste is clean caramel malt that grows, adding hay and biscuit as it passes through, finally swept away by floral and pine hops during a lingering finish. A tasty brew, good for simple drinking days. Recommended.
Ithaca Pale Ale;Ithaca, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ithaca Beer Co.;12oz bottle. Pours a hazy pale gold with a white head that doesn’t stick around for long. Lots of grapefruit/tropical fruit on the nose with some light alcohol, and syrupy notes. The taste is peach/apricot/ tropical fruit notes followed by some resinous hops, and citrus pith in the bitter finish. Good, easy drinking fruity pale ale with some decent bitterness.
Ithaca Apricot Wheat;Ithaca, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ithaca Beer Co.;This is. Not. Great. Like a magic hat but with a fuller palate. Finishes with an odd astringency. Not my favorite. Bottle from the hotel bar in NYC, Harry Potter & the Cursed Child trip of May 2019.

Ithaca Apricot Wheat;Ithaca, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ithaca Beer Co.;$2.29 can, Vintages by the Dan. Pours slightly hazy golden with a large white head. Sweet apricot, somewhat artificial, wheat aroma. Flavor is jolly rancher candy dropped in beer. The can says natural apricot, but boy this tastes artificial.
Ithaca Apricot Wheat;Ithaca, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ithaca Beer Co.;12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy gold orange fast dissipating white head. Big apricot scents. When the apricot tastes start sweet the transition to a little wheat sour is good but not a full wheat style . Short finish with medium carbonation. Nice experiment.
Ithaca Apricot Wheat;Ithaca, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ithaca Beer Co.;Slightly cloudy copper beer with a thin crackling bright white head. Nose of candied apricot, orange creamsicle, fruit-infused soap. Flavor is less sweet with dried apricot, vanilla, and a bit of tangy sour yeast. The finish is a bit abrupt, but what's there is tasty.

Ithaca Apricot Wheat;Ithaca, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ithaca Beer Co.;From Mar 2007 Pours from 12oz bottle a hazy orange with a small head of foam that dissipated quickly leaving a fine ring around the glass. The smell smells very much like apricot...imagine that! The taste is a mix of semi sweet apricot and wheat but it's on the delicate side. A little more oomph with the apricots and this would be a very good taster...still, not a bad drop. Thanks to Wasatch for this sample!

The taste is chocolate, caramel, and roasted coffee. It's smooth and malty. The coffee bitterness balances it out a bit. This is a pretty standard brown. It's decent though.

Ithaca Nut Brown;Ithaca, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;Poured into a mug, the appearance was a rugged burnt dark amber close to brown color. Sly little white head. Messy lace. The aroma takes on nutty to light chocolate maltiness. Big caramel / toffee tones and a clean earthy to grassy quality. The flavor leans nutty sweet with the chocolate, caramel and toffee notes combining sweetly. Sly crisp earthy, and malty aftertaste slyly moving into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Low carbonation feels good. Overall, nice English styled brown ale that I would have again.

Overall a solid brown ale offering.
Ithaca Nut Brown;Ithaca, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;From 12 oz bottle. This beer started out great. I was very surprised, a deep nutty almost wooden flavor. Silky texture. Decent but run of the mill smell. Then suddenly by the third drink it was watery and flavorless. Almost a great brew. Very nice patently nutty aftertaste I should add somewhat saves it.

Kobors Brown Ale;Schuylerville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Kobors Brewing Co.;"Maybe the last one in existence? Not that the vast majority of people have heard of this. Nice looking beer, clear mahogany with no real head or lacing. Smell is faint dark toffee and pumpernickel; fairly standard and nothing exceptional. Taste is sweet, mostly watered-down medium caramel with bready, slightly toasted malts. Spritzy carbonation, smooth and watery mouthfeel. Overall about as exciting as I expected, but glad to be the second review ever (first in 11 years)."
Kobors Brown Ale;Schuylerville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Kobors Brewing Co.;Very, very nice brown ale. Pours a clear deep umber, with minimal head, mostly just a thin lace around the edges. Very dark, almost porter-like. Aroma is heavy on the roasted malt. Flavor is much the same. Very clean tasting, with a lot of roastiness, a touch of caramel or toffee, and a subtle nuttiness, most likely from the ringwood yeast. Excellent mouthfeel, with light carbonation. I've never thought of a beer as smooth until this one.

Market Street Mad Bug Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Market Street Brewing Company;On tap 8/1/2011 Pours a deep clear golden color with a stingy white head that shows a lack of retention. Smell is sweet grainy malt with a touch of honey like sweetness. Yup smells like a macro lager only a hint sweeter. The taste follows the aroma fairly well. Medium body and carbonation level, slick watery mouthfeel. Decent lager, better than the macros, but not outstanding.
Market Street Mad Bug Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Market Street Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pours golden yellow with a thin white head. Grainy malty aroma. The flavor is plain, with some grain and straw. Better than most mass produced pale lagers, but still pretty boring.

Market Street Mad Bug Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Market Street Brewing Company;Brought to me from the wifes travels for work. Hoooray another travel growler. Pours a plae yellow with little head, but then again I didnt expect a bunch from the screw top growler. Thin and uninteresting body. Ends in a bit of alkalinity. Sweet finish and a kiss of hops. Ehhhh.
Market Street Mad Bug Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Market Street Brewing Company;Clear gold, thin white head. Nose held light tones of lemon gassiness, and hints of floral. Balanced lemony grassy flavors with just a touch of bread. LIght bodied, soft carbonation, light citirc finish. Not my thing at all...

This light bodied brew was an ok attempt. Was expecting more.
Market Street Brisco Bridge Blackberry Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Market Street Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub - aroma of berries. Very fruity but a bit fake. Hazy orange pour. Caramel malts. Not terrible but not great
Market Street Brisco Bridge Blackberry Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Market Street Brewing Company;On tap 8/1/2011 Pours a shade darker than golden with a thinnish off white head that dissipates to a ring. Smell is sweet syrupy and fruity with a bit of a honey grainy edge. Smells like someone poured blackberry syrup into their regular lager. Taste confirms that my nose is working. Very sweet fruity taste attached to a backbone of hay and grain. Sickeningly sweet artificial flavors abound with this one. Fizzy carbonation medium body with a syrupy mouthfeel. I should have known better than to order this one, but it was a nice sunny day and we were sitting outside, it seemed like a good idea.
Market Street Brisco Bridge Blackberry Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Market Street Brewing Company;draft at the brewpub. gold with a small white head. aroma of berries. berries were forward in the taste but not overpowering or sweet. nothing special but not a bad draft on a warm evening.

Market Street Brisco Bridge Blackberry Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Market Street Brewing Company;Well I didn’t sense any Blackberry. No Head or lacing to speak of. Very slightly cloudy but no color of blackberries influencing here. Only the faitest if any sense of Berries, but a clear sense of Paprika. Sweeter than their Light lager but not much else.
Market Street Brisco Bridge Blackberry Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Market Street Brewing Company;Sample on tap at brewpub. Very little aroma to this one - maybe some berry aroma but not much else. Mild copper clear with thin off-white lacing head. Medium body with medium carbonation. Starts dull with light fruity flavor. Mild berry. Bitter finish and light bitter after - not true berry flavor but a syrup, so there is a chemical concentrate bitterness in the after as well.
Market Street Brisco Bridge Blackberry Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Market Street Brewing Company;I am not a fan of the vast majority of fruit beers, which are only synthetically injected. They must sell to some crowd to be included in lineups, and this must be a case in point despite poor ratings by a knowledgeable crowd. This sour lager had the addition of blackberry juice and no aroma, suggesting an injection of something. It’s clear to me it’s artificial. Thin, and a falloff in appearance from the regular lager.
Market Street Brisco Bridge Blackberry Lager;Corning, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Market Street Brewing Company;Hazed gold, white creamy head. Nose was all blackberry with hints of bubblegum and yeast. Fruity throughout, crisp, with a light bitterness in the end. Not to sweet which is a good thing. Light bodied, light carbonation, fruity finish. Not half bad...

Aroma of malt, caramel, and toffee. Taste of the same. This medium bodied brew was a bit weak but still not bad.
Market Street Wrought Iron Red Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;"Sample at Seneca Lodge Brewfest. 03DE11. App.: Clear copper, off-white rim. Aroma: Earthy, British malts, a little wet ash, hints of fruit, stern caramel and leafy hops. Palate: Medium body, fairly aggressive effervescence. Flav.: Earthy, British malts, wet ash, follows the nose well (unfortunately); dry with some bitterness and an oddly watery finish, some fruity, earthy caramel. Too British for my tastes. Sorry, Britain."
Market Street Wrought Iron Red Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;tap at Brewpub - although the malt profile was underwhelming, I liked the hops in this one. Aroma is great - plenty of spice, pine and citrus. Something out of balance in the taste, but kudos to being able to figure out how to use hops. Cause Market St isn’t doing much else all that well.
Market Street Wrought Iron Red Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;On tap 8/1/2011 Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thinnish off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of earth and caramel. Gives off hints of prune and dark burnt sugar but is really kind of boring on the nose. Taste is malty with caramel toffee and barely enough hops to provide any balance. Slight astringent taste in there actually cuts through some of the sweetness, but hops would have been a better choice for that. Medium carbonation with a medium to thin body and a watery sweet mouthfeel. I didn’t enjoy this one much.
Market Street Wrought Iron Red Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pours golden amber with a thin head.

Market Street Wrought Iron Red Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;Just easy drinking with a good balance, not a big beer. Maybe a little more to the Malt side. Head and lacing OK
Market Street Wrought Iron Red Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;Sample on tap at brewpub. Very little aroma, maybe some dirty grain and grass. Golden amber clear with foamy off-white lacing head. Medium body with medium-light carbonation. Nice flavor.

Market Street Wrought Iron Red Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;Medium amberf, creamy light tan head. Nose was soft with touches of florals, earth, and roasted chocolate. Flavor has a nice underlying floral bitterness that carries hints of roastiness, chocolate, and nutty earth. Light to medium bodied, moderate carbonation, dry, semi-bittersweet finish. Decent...
Market Street DArtagnan Dark British Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Old Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;This one is definitely the best at Market Street Brewing Co. But for me it is a little too complicated. You really cannot say one flavor from another.
Market Street DArtagnan Dark British Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Old Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;Sample at Brewery 7/26/13-Pours a darker brown with a small head. Aroma of malt, chocolate, and brown sugar. Taste of the same. This full bodied brew was done very well and it was quite tasty.

Market Street DArtagnan Dark British Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Old Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;A clean dark brown ale with a thin off white head. In aroma, a sweet nutty malt with light solvent notes, oily. In mouth, a sweet nutty malt with solventy notes, caramel, diacetyl, boring. On tap at Seneca Lodge Brewfest, Dec. 3 2011.
Market Street DArtagnan Dark British Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Old Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;tap at Brewpub - this one sort of defies style description. Lightly roasted malts with some chocolate and nut character. Plenty of caramel and some toffee notes. Creamy body. Not bad.
Market Street DArtagnan Dark British Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Old Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;On tap 8/1/2011 Pours a deep dark brown with a tan head that seemed to last forever. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, roasted grains, and a bit of toffee. Smells is quite inviting. Taste is roasty and malty. Chocolate caramel and toffee mixed with a hint of astringency sum up the taste experience here. Fizzy carbonation ruined the mouthfeel for me here, this one seemed a bit over carbonated. Decent brew that might be better served a bit less bubbly.
Market Street DArtagnan Dark British Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Old Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pours copper brown with a beige head. Roasty sweet malt aroma with a hint of coffee. The flavor has roasted malt, caramel, nuts, and coffee. Easily the best offering I had.

Bit of chocolate with neutral fruit and some mild herbal hops. Dark copper brown clear with hops and light tan lacing head. Medium body with medium carbonation. Starts with a bit of caramel and chocolate, coffee and nutty roasted grain. Neutral fruit and light nutty bitter after.
Market Street DArtagnan Dark British Ale;Corning, New York, United States;Old Ale;Market Street Brewing Company;I don’t get how this is a mild. It’s more a cross between a shwartbier and an old ale, with lots of different malts use to give it an interesting malt complexity. It is also 6.5% not consistent with a mild. IBU is 28, there is a modest hopping. Very decent dark malty aroma and taste. Moderately Chocolate creamy.
Park Slope Amber Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Park Slope Brewing Company;Visited the brewpub on my second visit to New York in 1996, I think. I remember enjoying the beer a lot.

Sackets Harbor War of 1812 Ale;Saratoga Springs, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Saratoga Brewing (Mendocino Brewing Co.);New penny color. Light caramel mixed with munich malt base. Subtle fruitiness and honest biterness leave a dry clean finish which make this a session beer.

Aroma of nuts, citrus, and caramel. Flavor of nuts, caramel, and some hops. Sweet-almost too sweet-, crisp and enjoyable. Not a great beer, but one you can drink several in a sitting.

Pours copper-amber with average white head. Aromas of hops and roasted malts. Taste of malts with hints of citrus with a light bitter hop finish. A solid beer but it doesn’t stand out.
Sackets Harbor War of 1812 Ale;Saratoga Springs, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Saratoga Brewing (Mendocino Brewing Co.);Bottle from a mixer . Nice nuttyness with some dry aftertaste. Nothing to brag about, but a descent beer.
Sackets Harbor War of 1812 Ale;Saratoga Springs, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Saratoga Brewing (Mendocino Brewing Co.);Orange-amber in color. Fairly sweet and creamy in taste, sort of reminds me of cream soda. Finishes cleanly with just a slight hint of malt left on the palate. Pretty highly drinkable, though too much of the sweetness may be distracting.

Sackets Harbor War of 1812 Ale;Saratoga Springs, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Saratoga Brewing (Mendocino Brewing Co.);Bottle-hmmmmm, my review will go against the grain with most of the other ratings, of course, my tastes perfer the ambers and oktoberfests. There really isn’t an aroma I could detect. I’m marking this down to the single bottle purchase and that the beer might be a little older than prefered. The beer was a solid copper color with a small head and a slight, consistant amount of carbonation that kept the head refresh the entire time. The beer had a bready taste mixed with caramel and the feel of a pub ale. Produce place 1.49
Sackets Harbor War of 1812 Ale;Saratoga Springs, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Saratoga Brewing (Mendocino Brewing Co.);Tap. Amber colored with a nice head produced by the tap. Better aroma than expected. A nice caramel and toast aroma left me thinking I had been missing out on a gem. But the flavors were disappointing. The toast-bread flavors didn’t translate well in the taste and I was stuck with a almost metallic bitter taste that was a big turnoff.
Sackets Harbor War of 1812 Ale;Saratoga Springs, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Saratoga Brewing (Mendocino Brewing Co.);From bottle. Mild caramel and biscuit notes, light hoppy acidity, neutral fruits. Medium orange-amber clear, with quickly dissipating head. Light body with medum carbonation. Starts with a little sweetness, light acidity and some nutty-dry caramel. Dull sweet malt until the end, with a mild bitter and nutty after.
Sackets Harbor Railroad Red Ale;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a deep red color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Light stringy lace. The aroma had a slight roasty to smoky nose at first and then developed a little bit of dark chocolate gently blending with some nuts, and grassy hops. The flavor seemed to do a good job of blending the prior mentioned aromas. Aftertaste was a quaint semi-sweet to roasty sort of balance. Finish was the same with a little bit of vanilla. The palate was almost medium bodied but sat just a touch under and had a decent sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. ABV felt good. Overall, pretty nice Irish ale, different, but would be one I’d come back to.
Sackets Harbor Railroad Red Ale;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;Pale bronze, gentle white cover. Mellow almost smoky nose, burnt malts appear cookieish and with an almost spicy bite. Mellow taste, floral and earthier than most. Toasted malts are balanced very well with the soft comfortable hop undertones. Firm medium body, very smooth soft carbonation.
Sackets Harbor Railroad Red Ale;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub. Pours a thin, yellowish, foamy head with a deep copper body. Nose is very roasted along with the flavour. This is easily their best beer - it has much complexity and flavour. Very good!
Sackets Harbor Railroad Red Ale;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;Reddish amber ale with thin off-white head.

Sackets Harbor Lake Effect Lager;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;This pilsener-style beer is golden in color with a decent white head that seems to linger around a while. A very fruity hop aroma stands out on the nose, reminding me more of an ale than a pilsener. The fruitiness is evident in the flavor as well, but a good dose of peppery hops follows. Then strong citrus notes come in on the finish. The mouthfeel is adequate, no more.
Sackets Harbor IPA;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;IPA;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;Orange amber ale with a good off-white head. Malty and strong diacatyl aroma, with no hops. rhater nutty beer with an oily mouthfeel. Did they make an error on this keg??? Tap at brewpub.

Aroma of banana & band-aid (but not band-aid in a good way). Light, somewhat sugary body. Some banana & clove flavour but also somewhat plastic-y. Harsh, burning finish.
Sackets Harbor St. Stephens Stout;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;Stout;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;Was a bit surprised when I tasted this to find it is an Irish style dry stout. Pretty decent. Kathy enjoyed this one. I found it acceptable. Very true to style, seemed to be a nitro pour.
Sackets Harbor St. Stephens Stout;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;Stout;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;Had this on draft at the brewpub. Pleasant if fairly standard stout with some coffee and chocolate flavor and lightly bitter finish.

Spring Street Wit Amber;New York, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spring Street Brewing Company;Hmmm.... I can''t really decide on this one. My beer may be old. I''m not too familiar with this brewing company, but I found some stuff in a small store, and haven''t seen it elsewhere. It may have been there since europeans came to the americas for all I know. It tastes a little past it''s prime, but still ok. On to the characteristics, fellers. It''s very light bodied, with little to no hops evident. I guess it''s not the kind of beer to be drinking in freezing weather.

Spring Street Wit White;New York, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Spring Street Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Cloudy yellow color. Creamy fine bubble head. Perfumy aromatic wheat malt nose. Refreshing light citrus malt flavor lacks any real depth or character. Reminiscent of the style, but still a bit lacking.

Spring Street Wit Black Ale;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Spring Street Brewing Company;Starts in a fine roasty Porter-like way but gets more like a stale, forgotten Pepsi towards the finish.
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;Objectively speaking: A mistake. It has to be a mistake that this was 1) on tap, 2) named lambic I like: Not so lucky… I dislike: Let’s see. It looks dull with its murky brown coat. It deployds an oppressive strong candied cherry aroma, say cherry blossom and chalk, half and half. Hugely medicinal as well and especially in the finish which is a sad remake of the rumoured horror movie The attack of the phenols. Useless to point out it’s also cloyingly sweet. Ultimately, I found it a bit unrespectable.
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;Black with tan head and lace. Large cherriness that even smells tart. Fruity finish it almost tastes as good as it smells. A bit thin but overall a very nice offering.
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;Draft at the brewery. Listed as Black Cherry Lambic. Pours very dark, reddish black. Aroma is a medicinal cherry. Flavor is a very medicinal cherry, cough-drop like. Could only drink about 25% of this, had to order a different beer. Pass on this.
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;Had this one labelled as Black Cherry Lambic. It’s really too bad, but it seems that lambic is becoming the new buzz word when describing fruit beer. Not good for authentic lambics. Anyway, the aroma was disgustingly sweet like pure cherry syrup. After getting a whiff of that crap, I was surprised that the flavor was completely different. It had a slight tartness, but there was no funkiness and the cough syrupy sweetness crept in after letting it sit for a while. Not too good, and not one I would order.
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;Pours a dark mahogany color with ruby highlights and a thin pinkish head. Aroma and flavor of sweet, artificial cherries, urgh. The palate is light and dry and the carbonation is gentle. This is not good, I mean if you want to do a fruit beer, fine, but make sure that the fruit feels genuine and real rather than artificial.
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;Aroma:Cherry all the way... Appearance:Very dark redish,good head... Flavor:Good sour flavor,cherry... This is the best beer of this place...
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;"Sample at the brewpub, listed as ""black cherry lambic"". Near-opaque dark cherry-brown...sweet black cherry soda nose, rather artificial...sour-cherry body is reasonably pleasant and not infected like some of the other samples, but watery and very simple."
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;(Draught) Thin, white head with a near opaque reddish body. Pleasant, yet artificial cough syrup nose. Good sour notes with a faint sour cherry finish. Good.
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;I decided to post the black cherry lambic here, because im sure its the weizen turned bad!!!Cherry cough drop aroma with sour taste , some pepper, and candy sweetness...
Syracuse Suds Factory Black Cherry Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Syracuse Suds Factory;Smells and tastes like cough syrup, though that's better in the aroma than in the flavor. Creosotic and nasty.
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;Malty aroma, almost cherry like. Has a lot of body and descent flavor. It does have a soapy aftertaste and bitter cleanser like finish. That doesnâ€™t make it sound good but it is drinkable. I put it in my category of I would drink it if free and given to me, but wouldnâ€™t pay for it again. Almost like your first homebrew you ever made. Not sure how they have been brewing as long as they have and the beer is as good as my first college homebrew? Maybe I brewed really well the first time. Also not fully convinced this was the pale ale. Could have been but the cherry aspects make me think maybe it was actually the black cherry weizen (which they said they were out of). Or maybe the cherry aspect was from the malt (like caramelized maltiness but the soapy character made if seem a little cherry cough syrup like??) Not convinced it would have been rated much different so I am rating it under what I was told the beer was. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;Wow, the description makes this sound drinkable. Not. Tasted like an old school pale ale mixed with Ambesol. I couldn’t even finish it. Yes, that bad.
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;Draft. Pours a clear light amber with a thin off-white head that leaves streaks of lacing down the glass. Aroma is mild, somewhat metallic with limited bitterness. Flavor is equally boring with a slight sweet note and no discernible hoppiness. Moderate carbonation.
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;Draft @ The pub. Small light amber with a small white head. Nose is only light malt. Dry, watery texture. Low on any kind of flavor. The taste is like carbonated sugar water. This is one of the saddest APA’s I have drunk in years. Not sure who is brewing these beers.
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;A reddish amber ale with a thick light moka head. A light caramel malt in aroma with light floral hops. In mouth, a sweetish malt with loads of orange pulp, good hopping, treacle, surprisingly good. On tap at brewpub, Oct. 23 2009.
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;An orange gold pour with a creamy white head and lace. Light hops and medium malt on the nose. Tastes alot like a Marzen/Oktoberfest but a decent bitter. A tad thin and foamy. With some faults was still a drinkable beer.
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;Draft at the brew pub. Pours a dark brown, small off white head. Aroma was sweet hops. Flavor was almost dead on like a Sam Adams, hoppy, but not over the top. A very solid brew, well done !!!
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;Best of the bunch this night. Hoppy yet sweet aroma. Looks very nice in the glass. Rather hoppy but balanced by a sweet malt backbone. Can taste the dry hopping, but I’m relieved they didn’t get too excited in the dry-hopping chair. Decent, and probably the one I’d order again, if I ever return.
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;Aroma:Good hops aroma... Appearance:Brown orange,good head... Flavor:Hops and soap flavor...
Syracuse Suds Factory Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Syracuse Suds Factory;Sample at the brewpub. Light maple syrup color, lasting foamy ring...pleasant apricot nose with some citrusy hops...smooth body with a tangy bite to begin, softens later but lingering piney hops give it a nice kick...decent body could be fuller, but far and away the best this brewpub has to offer.
Syracuse Suds Factory Honey Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Got a glass and then a pitcher. My first honey ale, so I remember it fondly. Maybe a bit light, in body and taste, but it was good for downing multiple glasses with the greasy food.
Syracuse Suds Factory Honey Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Honey gold with white head and lace. Light malt and lite honey as well on the nose. Malt and honey with a very light bitter. Good carbonation but a bit thin. A tad better than your standard pub fare light beer.
Syracuse Suds Factory Honey Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Not much going on with this, pretty much like every other honey infused light ale out there. Basically, take Bud Light, add honey and voila! Very average, very light and somewhat sweet. No hop presence at all. However, my Bud Light drinking buddy thought this to be the best of the offerings. Go figure
Syracuse Suds Factory Honey Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Aroma:light malt aroma.... Appearance:Light hazy gold,small head... Flavor:Light malt and honey flavor....
Syracuse Suds Factory Honey Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Sample at the brewpub. Hazy light amber...simpering honey-sweet nose...watery, bland, somewhat sourish lactic qualities dominate the early honey sugariness.....keep going.....
Syracuse Suds Factory Honey Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;(Draught) Thin, dissipating white head and orange body. Slight honey and hops nose. Sour flavour. Must be off because sourness lingers...

Syracuse Suds Factory Honey Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Good honey gold. Pronounced tart, fruity, floral aroma. Cidery and a little raw-homebrewish, light sweetness and some astringency. Woody with medium light hopping. Saazy(?) tart hop finish.

Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;Black with tan head and lace. Chocolate and coffee with a toasted maltiness. Nice chocoffee flavor with a decent bitter finsih. Just a tad thin but drinkable.
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;In short: A messy, borderline infected black beer. Avoid How: Tap at brewpub The look: Dark-brown body with a little beige head In long: A clash of roastiness, honey and vinegary tartness. No need to say that it was pretty bad. I’m not gonna waste any more time describing this as I believe it would be a waste of valuables Zeros and Ones.
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;Ugh, this was downright horrible. Looked nice enough in the glass. Somewhat of a roasty and chocolatey aroma, but it’s mostly sour. Mouthfeel is disgustingly sour and vinegary. I thought maybe there was something wrong with the batch, but it looks like I’m not the only one with this observation. Ugh, horrible.
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;Aroma:Light rosted malt.... Appearance:Dark light head... Flavor:Watery for a stout,light rosted malt.....
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;Sample at the brewpub. Dark but thin-looking, thin lasting head...chocolate-vinous nose is alright but a bit weird...extremely vinous/grapy body with little carbonation, syrupy in the middle and carboardy and unfinished-feeling at the end. Thank you, no.
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;(Draught) Thin, beige head and a opaque body. Nose of strong cocoa and coffee. Slightly tart with good cocoa tones. Sour finish. Slightly off?
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;Smooth chocolate aroma, with some fruits and alcool. Tart acidic taste again, also going off.
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;Same rancid aroma as their porter. Same uninteresting and flat falavor profile with some lactose thrown in. Sub-standard.
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;Odd sour cream note. Touch of roast, but that''s it. Again, too sour in the finish. Little else. Very empty.
Syracuse Suds Factory Sweet Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Syracuse Suds Factory;Dark brown. Sweet roasty, malty aroma. Sweet body, very little roast......
Troy Smoked Lager;Troy, New York, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brown's Brewing Company;Deep amber color with little head. The aroma was malty with cedar smoke accents. the flavor was full of strong smoked malt flavor.
Troy Uncle Sam Amber;Troy, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;This used to be my favorite brew from Troy Pub (back when it used to be called Troy Pub). Color is a deep amber, with a very thin white haed. Taste is very hoppy and refreshing, but as with the rest of Brown’s beers, not too distinguished. Body is medium. Refreshing and drinkable though, and does not sit heavy.
Troy Uncle Sam Amber;Troy, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;A light-bodied amber with an abundance of hoppy character, almost like your typical Pale Ale. The finish was quite metallic. Nothing special.
Troy Uncle Sam Amber;Troy, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;Well balanced sweetness and hop charcater.Finishes with some citrus hop charcater and it's also present in the aroma.
Troy Uncle Sam Amber;Troy, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;Pours with a crisp clear deep amber body topped by a thin head with decent lace left on the glass.

Smooth, light to medium bodied and slightly dry.
Troy Sids Brown Ale;Troy, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;"Um ok. Bottle from brewpub. And this isn’t a porter? Poured a black body, small head, aroma of roast, coffee and some nut. Roasty doughy taste with some nut. Fairly watery on the palate. This really looks like a Guinness, but when it’s right in the light it’s a very dark brown. Almost everyone seemed to hate
…"
Troy Sids Brown Ale;Troy, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;April 2004. Clear brown ale with a very light malt aroma, some soy sauce. Nutty taste with malts, light hops. Watery , too light, needs more malts???
Troy Sids Brown Ale;Troy, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;Brown with reddish hues when held to the light with a thin white head. The initial taste is nutty but it is quickly overpowered by a sour, stale taste. The body is thin and watery. Extremely disappointing. Newcastle is better, and I don’t believe a macrobrewery should ever beat out a micro.
Troy Sids Brown Ale;Troy, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;Practical absence of aroma leaving way for little earthiness and nuttiness in the malt...Otherwise, near absence of malt flavors and true vapidity in the hops...This is an aqueous void for a brown ale...
Troy Sids Brown Ale;Troy, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brown's Brewing Company;Roasty aroma. Fairly dark brown, clear body with off-white head that diminishes to ring. Chocolate malt flavour. Some dark malt in finish. Medium-light mouthfeel without being watery. A fair brown ale. On tap at the brewpub.

Troy Black Collar Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout;Brown's Brewing Company;April 2004. Clear black with a very light malt aroma, slight hops. Extremely light bodied, like drinking Perrier with bitter chocolate. Watery. Oh, did i say, watery???
Troy Black Collar Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout;Brown's Brewing Company;Almost no aroma covering a light yet creamy body...This is like a pathetic attempt at a low-carb stout...They were definitely having trouble with their dark malts that day...
Troy Black Collar Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout;Brown's Brewing Company;Solvent-like aroma. Dark brown. Fairly clear. Thin white head. Slightly sweet but fairly bland. Really watery and low carbonation.
Troy Black Collar Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout;Brown's Brewing Company;(Draught) At the brewery. Thin, biege head with great lacing and the faintest nose of roasted malt. Unfortunately this doesn't work either, the body is too thin and near flavourless.

Troy Harwood Porter;Troy, New York, United States;Porter;Brown's Brewing Company;Faint roastiness commingling with fruity esters on top... Frail body of dry roasted malt which gives away not much more than that roastiness...An easy porter...
Troy Harwood Porter;Troy, New York, United States;Porter;Brown's Brewing Company;Sweet cola aroma. Dark brown, clear body with thin fully diminishing head. Some roastiness but generally cola sweet. Very thin and watery mouthfeel. On tap at the brewpub.
Troy Harwood Porter;Troy, New York, United States;Porter;Brown's Brewing Company;(Draught) At the brewery. Deep brown with no lasting head. Too thin and clear. Tart and rather upsetting finish. I'd likely lick the curb before trying this again.

Troy Wheat Beer;Troy, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brown's Brewing Company;Very light yellow collor with a thin white head. Has a very spicy, lemony or melony character. Body was average. Came with a slice of lemon. A very unusual beer, and the strangest hefe I’ve had. However, one of their better offerings by far.
Troy Wheat Beer;Troy, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brown's Brewing Company;Dominating cloves and creamy yeast...A citrus bite excites the palate in this thin but flavorful rendition of an American Wheat...As good as their pale ale, their best offering that day...
Troy Wheat Beer;Troy, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brown's Brewing Company;Cloves, banana, a touch of sulfur in the nose. Straw colour with thin white, fully diminishing head. Big banana flavour with a touch of tartness toward the finish. Light and refreshing mouthfeel and decent carbonation. Simple but tasty bavarian weizen. On tap at the brewpub.
Troy Wheat Beer;Troy, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brown's Brewing Company;(Draught) At the brewery. Slightly cloudy, thin white head with a yellow body. Appears thin. Nose of bananas, cloves and nail polish remover. Thin, too sweet and the flavour of ripe bananas send me looking for something more promising.

Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Light golden with small white head. Aroma grain, possibly faint honey. Light body. Some honey up front, then fades into nothing in particular. Ok overall.
Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;I don’t remember much about this one. Had on tap at the brewery/vineyard. Most of their beer was pretty forgettable.
Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;The beer pours clear, light gold with a bit of foamy white head that fades rather quickly. The aroma is fairly light, grainy with some wheat, some light floral hops, and a fair amount of honey. The taste is somewhat bland, a bit of honey sweetness up front, more wheat in the middle, and honey and orange on the finish. The honey doesn’t make it too sweet, which is always a bit of a concern with a beer like this, but the honey flavor really takes over the beer, leaving little complexity. This beer is refreshing (only 3.8% ABV!) and has a nice honey flavor, but is pretty one dimensional. Might be nice for a hot summer afternoon, but not good for much else.
Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle- Pours a nice golden color with a small head that fades quickly with no lacing. Has a primarily grain aroma woth a hint of honey sweetness. Has a mild wheat taste with a like sticky sweetness. Light body with a light grain & sticky aftertaste. Decent for a small brewer. Got this as part of a 6-pack mixer.
Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle that we sort of discovered while doing inventory. No idea how old this is, but I don’t think it’s something that’s been around in quite a while. Pours an almost clear golden amber with a huge white head. Smells like old cardboard dipped in honey, lots of age on this and none of it good. Flavor is just old stale paper and some weird honey sweetness. Finishes with a bit of a booze note. Not so good.
Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;There is the gentle, sweet smell of honey to start off. It pours very light in color, completely clear light straw yellow in color with a small head. This is its weakest component. The flavor is light floral honey grazing the palate ever so gently with sweetness. There is no potency of flavors or bitterness.
Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;&#40bottle - 12 oz&#41 Gold color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is sweet and odd at the beginning with some light hints of wheat. Flavor is sweet honey at the beginning with a very bitter wheat middle. The honey disappears and leaves only wheat and bitterness on the finish.
Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;"bottle: mixed feelings about this one. The arouma had a sweet smell, but one of my friends immediately identified it as vomit. I think that’s a bit harsh, but I do sense some ""bile"" notes and cardboard in the nose. The brew pours amber, tastes of sweet malts, honey and clover, sweet lingering honey in the aftertaste. Brightly carbonated with a light body. I thought it was balanced with just the right amount of bitter. Not a bad brew, but once you get the ""vomit"" label in your head, its hard to get out."
Wagner Valley Grace House Honey Wheat;Lodi, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Deep gold with fluffy white head and lace. Aroma of paper honey and mustiness. Sweet malt and honey flavor. Nice body with good carbonation.

Wagner Valley Mill Street Pilsner;Lodi, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Clear yellow. No aroma in particular, a little grain. Light body. Slightly although not too sweet flavor, a tad crisp at the finish although not much hops to speak of. Inoffensive and unmemorable.
Wagner Valley Mill Street Pilsner;Lodi, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle. More orange than yellow and not much of a head. This isn’t a crisp hoppy North German pils, but something mellower and perhaps a bit sweet. Not my style.
Wagner Valley Mill Street Pilsner;Lodi, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery in Toronto. Great hop/spice taste. Great pilsener. Should have had more than a sample ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wagner Valley Mill Street Pilsner;Lodi, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Clear straw yellow color with a soapy white head. Grain aroma. Seemed watered down. Not much flavor-some grain/grass, a touch of bitterness. Not much else.

Wagner Valley Mill Street Pilsner;Lodi, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Gold pour with almost no head or lace. Aroma is corn like and wet paper. Flavor is sweet corn and light paper. No bitter to speak off. A drinkable beer.
Wagner Valley Mill Street Pilsner;Lodi, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;"Clear golden coloured body with a frothy white head. Aroma of metal, light hops and very light malt - perhaps with a bit of citrus. Light-bodied; Sharp pungent taste of malt, funky metal and some citrus, with a bit of a sweetness near the end. Aftertaste shows some floral essences, corn, metal and some light off-flavours. Overall, not such a great offering, and worth trying something else. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Half Time in Poughkeepsie on 11-June-2009, sampled on the Eastern Shore of Virginia on July Fourth, 2009."
Wagner Valley Mill Street Pilsner;Lodi, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle: Poured a yellow color with a thin head. The aroma was grass and malts. The flavor was small hops, hint of caramel, and corn. Overall, just OK.
Wagner Valley Mill Street Pilsner;Lodi, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Could have been a solid pilsner (I want to say that the hop profile was close to perfect) but had this very distracting extract-like twang to it. Oh well, not bad for a brewery attached to a winery.
Wagner Valley Dockside Amber Lager;Lodi, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from the brewery. Amber pour, fizzy tan head. Light, bready malt aroma. Bit of grain. Milder taste. Lively feel. Fine.

Wagner Valley Dockside Amber Lager;Lodi, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear ruby amber with a thin beige head. A touch of paper and old malt, hints of prune. A bit papery, old plum and prune, touches of malt. Medium bodied, toasty, warm malt. The paper notes kill it though. I’d imagine this was decently crisp and tasty a few months back. Alas.
Wagner Valley Dockside Amber Lager;Lodi, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Light orange-red with small white head. Aroma malty. Medium light body. Off-dry with some caramel malt sweetness. Finishes off-dry as well. Ok.
Wagner Valley Dockside Amber Lager;Lodi, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle. I drank this with a meal (grilled pork chops) and thought it was spot on A nice hefty Vienna-style lager. Some malty sweetness, not much hop flavor. Possibly my favorite from this brewery/winery.
Wagner Valley Dockside Amber Lager;Lodi, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;I don’t remember much about this one - other than that it was pretty sweet for my taste. Had on tap at the brewery/vineyard. Most of their beer was pretty forgettable.

Mostly a grain aroma with a hint of sweet malt. A mild sweet malt & caramel taste. A very light bitterness with a mild sticky sweetness for an aftertaste. Fairly light body, quite smooth.

Wagner Valley Dockside Amber Lager;Lodi, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Brown pour with am off-white head. Aroma is malt a bit metallic some hops. Flavor is thin watery, a little malty. Pretty mediocre.
Wagner Valley Dockside Amber Lager;Lodi, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;On draft at the brewery. Award winning for a reason. A very flavorful amber with toastiness and sweet malts. Not bad at all.
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Hoppy and can taste the cascade so it’s almost like some IPAs I’ve had. Citrusy aroma and flavor to boot. Yellow-gold color. Served too cold and has little head. Not outstanding in any way but enjoyable, quaffable beer with session potential. Finishes dry.
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Nice amber color, with a nice caramel sweet aroma. Lite off white head with very little carbonization. A little on the sweet end of the Pale spectrum, but nicely ballenced. A nice after dinner beer.
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Hazy amber in colour with a thick froathy off-white head, lacing. Nice aroma of caramle and c-hops, light citrusy notes. In mouth, classic pale ale with nice malt base, and nice mix of bitterness and grapefruit, dryish, and lingering. Light to medium in bodied, but quite quaffable. Bottle is about a year old.
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;(Bottle) Pours a very thin, white head and a non-carbonated amber body. Nose is nicely hopped with mild malt playing into the fold. Very hoppy flavour with a mild tinniness. Last cascade hop bitterness in the finish. Good.
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;The classic grapefruity C-hop fragrance portends an all-hop affair...Oranges surge in the mouth to diversify the linear hoppy path and earth accompanies them not far behind...The C-hops dominate the palate and sometimes reach chemical freshener level if you look deeply...The clean body is perfect for tasty quenching, which I think to be this pale ale’s purpose...
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Copper color, medium head, nice lacing. Nice aroma of floral hops and grapefruit. Very good flavor of floral hops, grapefruit and something sweet. Bitter finish. Very good pale ale.
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;sample at brewery. The pale is a gold color with a nice hop aroma. The flavor is quite dry, leaving the hops somewhat out of balance and astringent.
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Pours your standard brassy yellow pale ale color with minimal head and spotty lacing. Aroma is of freshly roasted malt and some refined hip floral essence. Wow. Much more bitter up front than I was expecting, considering the nose I got. Mouthfeel is medium, and this beer is lacking the malt sweetness and body required, I feel, to combat that hop bitterness. The bitterness itself is not the round, full one I favor either. I am trying to think which kind of hops they use. I know they are NY hops, so cascade? The finish is crisp and dry. Not a terribly good beer, sorry to say.
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;12oz. bottle: This one poured a golden color. It was just a touch hazy. Not much of a head to it. The aroma is a bit grapefruity. A fairly good bit of bitterness to the taste. Some maltiness to the body. The bitter taste lingers wit you awhile. Somewhat dry also. A fairly decent APA!
Wagner Valley Seneca Trail Pale Ale;Lodi, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Slightly fruity aroma w/nice bit of hops. Grapefruit and ozone. Clear dark amber w/little head. Med body w/light carb. Smooth. Light maltiness up front, with some fruity hops. Finishes dry and bitter! Bitter after.
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Twelve ounce bottle Mediciney. Wow, this must have been sold off of a hucksters cart back in 1870. Smells and tastes old
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Draft at Rattle. Pours golden amber with a white head. Crystal malt, toasted malts, some lingering astringent bitterness, and background diacetyl. Not good.
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;12oz. bottle: This one is kind of a deep coppery amber, almost brown in color. The head on mine wasn't too big, and went down rather quickly. A little bit of a caramel aroma with the hops. The flavor is a good balance of medium malt body and slightly piney hops. Fairly decent.
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;172** Damn, Captain Curry gives big, frothy, caramel colored, storm cloud sized head, I could only fit a quarter bottle of this ESB into the 16oz glass before the head billowed over the top of the glass by several inches. I’m talking insolating foam head,
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Very very dark. In fact, I'd say this is more of a brown ale color. Head forms only as patches of white mist, with a ring of head around the edges. Aroma is a little different, with a bit of caramel. Sort of like a cross betwen a mild and a bitter. That's ok by me. Flavor is malty and slightly fruity, with a touch of breadiness and enough hopping to support. Body is medium, on the heavy side of the spectrum, with mild carbonation and a long malty finish. While not an ESB in the strictest sense, i thought it was pretty damn good.
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Dark, Dark in colour with an insanely large head. The taste strikes the palate instantly and hits with bitterness and some malt and hops. Soon after the initial taste is a feeling of nothingness, which is somewhat odd given the colour and initial flavour. Not a great beer, especially if looking for a beer a good aftertaste!
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Somewhat thin body, but full of malts and earthiness. Not really very bitter at all, but its not a bad-tasting beer.
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Amber-copperish color with a tiny head and an aroma of subtle hops and fruit. The flavor is very floral, with a decent amount of hops, and a slight bitterness lingering within a slightly dry finish. This is a decent beer that would go great with seafood.
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Reddish body with rising carbonation, got cloudy once I finished pouring, huge (and I mean HUGE) head, fruity nose. Bitter, metallic, grainy, unpleasant. Drain pour. May have been a bad bottle.
Wagner Valley Captain Currys ESB;Lodi, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Iced tea color with particles suspended. Thin, foamy off white head. Scattered, big bubbled carbonation. Caramel and roasted malt aroma with toasted grain notes as well as some grassy hops. Toasty and lightly crisp with a strong Goldings bitterness and flavor. Sharp metallic bite and lengthy grassy aftertaste. Wafer thin sweetness. Medium light body. Metallic notes fade thankfully. Goldings and Willamette hop flavors take over as it warms. Finishes better with toasted grains and a leafy hop underlay and bitterly balanced ending.
Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;12oz bottle labeled as Oatmeal Stout (no Caywood Road). Pours black with a tan head. Notes of burnt malt and coffee. Slightly on the sweet side. Not bad.

Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;"Bottle sample at a tasting at Dancing Camel Florentin. Thanks Tom L. As ""Wagner Valley Oatmeal Stout"". Black. Great aroma with lots of dark chocolate and some roast. Sweetish and slightly bitter flavor, roasty, with some dark chocolate. Medium-bodied. Flavor is not as great as the aroma, but still a pretty nice one."
Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Pitch black, dark as motor oil. Whatever head there is, is swallowed up by the black hole of liquid below it. The aroma is dark grapes, charcoal, gravel, pine, dates, plums, all in a rather incongruous mix of scents. Not unpleasant, but kitchen-sink exclusivity. The flavor is more grape-y stuff, with some charcoal, some dusty pavement. The feel is slick and oily. This is one dark, gritty beer. There is a very good beer hiding somewhere in here, I wish it could break out.
Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Lost rating from 2008: Dark black brown with tan head. Malted roast aroma that is somewhat weak Body is watery roasted malts, bitters on the side of tongue. Flavour is really just sweet malted roasted malts.
Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle, dark pour. Mild roastiness in aroma, some milk chocolate notes. Touch of peat and smoke in roasty and chocolate flavor. Some sour twang, bottle is rather old though.
Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Muted roasted aroma. Pours a near black with a tan head. It’s pretty cold, so not much on the nose. Taste is slightly sweet with a modest roast and slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is this beers best asset. Meh. On the sweet side with no real redeeming qualities.
Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Dark brown, tan head. Aroma coffee, chocolate, and roasted nuts. Medium body, less creamy than expected. Flavor is mildly sweet, cocoa, licorice, roasted malts. Most of the beer here was just ok, this was probably the best one or at least the most interesting.
Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle from Ithaca coffee. Pours black with very little brown head. In fact it’s more of a halo than anything else. Some roasted maltiness on the nose though it’s not far from being burnt. Some coffeeish flavor on the tongue. Not getting much smooth or silky which makes me wonder how much oatmeal they used. It’s a bit thin in mouthfeel. It feels unfinished this beer.
Wagner Valley Caywood Station Oatmeal Stout;Lodi, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;I don’t remember much about this one, but it was the best of their offerings. Had on tap at the brewery/vineyard. Most of their beer was pretty forgettable.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;16 ounce glass on tap at the brewery. Pours a copper brown with a bit of a fruity taste. Well Balanced.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a red-caramel color with a large creamy orange-tan head that left decent lacing. The aroma was sweet with molasses, malty syrup and toffee. The flavor was sweet molasses, malt syrup, dark fruits and toffee. Medium length finish. Moderately full bodied and smooth. Solid.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Roasted Caramelized malt aroma and flavor. Almost a bit of chocolate in the malt. Very malty, almost slightly sweet and bordering on a sticky palate. Little spice to the flavor, but really malt dominant but flavorful. Maybe just a bit too malty but still a good beer. Would try more from this brewery. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Found some old rating notes from TapNY 2013 that somehow never got entered. (I’m keeping this a little shorter than my normal rating style to help catch-up my backlog a little faster.) An amber colored beer with a strong malty flavor, toffee, toast, and some dark fruit. Solid stuff.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Pours a brown caramel color with a sweet aroma. The caramel is distinct in the taste, almost too powerful. It overpowers the malt and chocolate from this beer. This beer is good as a dessert beer due to its sweetness. I couldn’t drink this everyday but it has some complex flavors.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Pours dark amber with ok head and lacing. A little coffee on nose with some of that characteristic doppelbock aroma of sweetened, toffee-like malt. Palate is pretty light here though, and aftertaste only leave a little bitterness and sweetness. Needs more of almost everything. Bottle.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a mug. The label has no freshness date or abv%. Appearance: Looking into the glass I am presented with a deep garnet red brew with good clarity and a tall off white to light tan head. This head slowly fades out leaving some spotty lacing at the top of the glass. Smell: There is a big rich malty character coming out of the glass. In it I get candy sweet notes like a grape sucker or grape soda. This is backed up with a big bready sweet maltiness Taste/Palate: The big malty sweetness from the aroma hits the tongue with candy like grape notes inside of a somewhat modest medium to full bodied bready sweetness. In the back ground there are some very subdued hop notes that offer a touch of herbal leafy spice with almost no bitterness. The palate is very smooth and lightly carbonated. Its sweetness sticks on the palate a bit but not in a heavy or to cloying a way. Notes: It’s not the most complex Doppelbock but there is something about its basic character that I like and find enjoyable to drink.
Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock;Lodi, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;This beer is flavorful enough, although the nose is weak. It’s very malty with bitter edges. The body is actually rather full with lively carbonation.

Wagner Valley Sugar House Maple Porter;Lodi, New York, United States;Porter;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from the brewery. Dark brown pour, small light brown head. Roasted malt, a little chocolate. Some nutty notes. Not much maple. Slightly bitter close. Mid-plus bodied. Solid.
Wagner Valley Sugar House Maple Porter;Lodi, New York, United States;Porter;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Poured from a bottle into a tulip: Pours dark brown with a light brown foamy head. Aroma of maple, booze, caramel, roasted malts. Taste is moderately sweet, nuts, maple, dried leaves, roasted notes. Surprisingly light body for something I was expecting to be sweet and heavy. Lacks flavor in general but isn’t offensive. It’s alright.
Wagner Valley Sugar House Maple Porter;Lodi, New York, United States;Porter;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Tap. Almost black on pour. Burger head. Some webbing. Banana and maple syrup aromas. Roast malt behind. Taste follows. Drinks sweet, but if that’s your bag add a couple to taste and overall. Well executed, but aimed at the niche.

Pours brown to black with a beige head, aroma of chocolate, maple, honey and nuts, flavor of chocolate, roasted malt, smoke, moderate acidity, medium bodied
Wagner Valley Sugar House Maple Porter;Lodi, New York, United States;Porter;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;On tap @ Rattle N Hum. As good as black bin the glass with a small quickly sidesticking dark beige top. The nose is nice and roasty with lots of chocolate paper and softly roasted malts. Some coffee as well. About average soft prickling carbonation and a good thick oily mouthfeel. Chocolate, coffee and dark roasted malts dominates the taste. Some brownie cake also actually. Quite a tasty one. 13.06.2013

Wagner Valley Sugar House Maple Porter;Lodi, New York, United States;Porter;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle around my sisters pool out of a big ol’ plastic cup on the fourth of July. Pours a clear cola brown with a medium sized tan head. Sweet paper and a touch of malt and roast. Bitter paper. Medium bodied, roast and paper. Nasty paper flavors overpower a small bit of roasnt and cocoa. Chocolate, roast and cocoa, more nasty old paper and hints of infection. Unpleasant. The bulk of this went over the fence into the woods.
Wagner Valley Summer Sail Hefeweizen;Lodi, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Nice wheat and spice aroma to the nose. The color is a light amber color with a nice foamy head. To taste you pick up bananas and cloves, lingers slightly on the palate

Wagner Valley Summer Sail Hefeweizen;Lodi, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Location: 12 oz bottle from Half Time, 10/14/12 Aroma: The nose is nothing much, some lemon zest, a little least, and not too much else Appearance: It pours a hazy goldenish color with a small head and minimal lace Flavor: The taste is medium sweet, a good amount of clove, and a light-medium bitterness Palate: The body is light-medium, it has an aliright feel, and a slightly dry, slightly spicy finish Overall Impression: Overall, I was not overly impressed by this one. It was not a bad beer, but it just felt like a miss in quite a few different categories. I wouldn’t rush out for this one again.
Wagner Valley Summer Sail Hefeweizen;Lodi, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle. Nose strongly phenolic with medium wheat, still a little weak. Gradient golden pour and an ephemeral head (doesn’t last long at all). Medium-full body with great crispness, very faint clove with fainter rubber. A touch of slime, and very good carbonation. Just citrus and sweet malt. Refreshing, indeed, but not worth the Maisel’s glass it was poured into.
Wagner Valley Summer Sail Hefeweizen;Lodi, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Bottle 355 ml Aroma frontal citric wheat character , slight harshness , spice on side. Appearance thickly hazed amber-gold. Initially good head that reduced quickly. Flavor and Palate : medium bodied, hint of cellar feel, hint of clove and spice at finish.

Wagner Valley Summer Sail Hefeweizen;Lodi, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;On draft at the brewery. Plenty of banana flavor up front. The aftertaste is a little cloying, but the initial flavors are very nice. The cloves are backround noice, and the banana is front and center. Light and easy to drink if you don’t pay too much attention to the finish.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;Average beer overall. Lighter in flavor than I prefer but maybe common to this style. Unfortunate end to an up and coming Akron area Brewery. Someday we may only have the Ugly 3 to drink so appreciate the crafts.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;Interesting aroma. This is a new style for me, so I'm trying to keep and open mind. Aroma is buttery?, mildly sweet and floral. Appearance is light honey golden with egg white head that is presently retained. Flavor is popcorn buttery which is not incredibly pleasent. I'm thinking this beer might be a bit long in the tooth.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;Pale clouded amber color, moderate head formation. Clean malty aroma, hints of caramel. Light bodied with a sweet caramel flavor, very little bitterness in the finish. Not bad but I'm not sure why they'd want to call this a US Blonde. It's much more interesting.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;Thanks to Dogbrick for this sample. This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that left behind a very hazy straw yellow colored softly carbonated body and a fair lacing. THe aroma is a typical mild malt hop one and the mouthfeel is thin crisp and bubble. The flavor is also that of malt hops and something else I could not put my finger on. Its not a bad beer, but it is different although somewhat subdued.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;Nothing really special about this beer...just kind of average. It poured a very small sized white head with fine-small bubbles that completely dissipated. The body was cloudy with lively carbonation and a pale yellow hue. The nose was that of citrus, sweet and fruity with a bit of a hop and spicy flavor to it. The mouthfeel was smooth with a watery-thin texture and it was light bodied. There was no lacing with this beer.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;Hazy light gold colored with a snow white head that sinks like the titanic. Has a wheat like aroma similar to a wit with a hint of citrus but a bit stale. Medium body and nice mouthfeel. Flavor is like a pale and I can't help but be reminded of Magic hat #9. Very similar. Slight metallic finish. Nothing great but not too bad.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;An OK beer, defintely not a favorite, but I would drink it again. I've had better, but wouldn't hesitate to drink this if it was available.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;Pours a hazy golden color, head lasting less than a minute, was thin and almost completely clear, almost no lacing whatsoever. Smells light and a bit fruity. Flavor is definitely sweet and fruity on the start, nice and malty in the middle, with an ever so weak finish. A very drinkable Kölsch, which is the entire purpose of the style. Thanks to Dogbrick for this one.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;This is a smooth and mellow beer. You might even say somewhat bland and perhaps past its prime. It has no distinguishing characteristics, but is easily drinkable. A great session beer.
Blimp City All American Blonde Pale Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Blimp City Brewery;Actually a very good Kolsch, but variable. Two samples have yielded one quite Noble hoppy, with tons of grassy maltiness (slivhtly sweet) -- the other sample was quite sweet without the hoppiness (more like the kolschs I've had) - both were good, and wonderfully unfiltered gems. This rating is for the less sweet sample. Too damn bad this brewery is gone!!!!
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;A quality beer from the now closed Akron area brewery. The brewery was actually increasing distribution to area taverns for on tap and I was seeing it more and more in bottles in area stores. Another good craft brewery fallen victim to the economics in the world of Cheap Watery Beer Company. (AKA SAB, Interbrew, and AB). Specifically, this is full flavored (esp. the malt) and stronger than most in this style.
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;Thanbks to Dogbrick for providing me with the opportunity to rate this beer. This brew poured a very large head of mostly diminishing finely sized light brown colored bubbles that left behind a hazy carbonated brown colored body and a fair lacing. Thje aroma was a nice malty one with some spiceyness hidden within it. The mouthfeel was smooth bubbly and thin. The flavor was that of malt and spice. It was refined, refreshing and different.
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;A very easy drinking beer that goes down very smooth with a good balance to it. It poured a large sized tan creamy head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The hue was copper and the nose was malty, caramel and sweet. It had a sweet, caramel and a hint of tanginess to the flavor from start to finish . The mouthfeel was very, very smooth, a little tingly, thin textured and light bodied. There was very little lacing with this beer. I would definitely drink this one again if given the opportunity.
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;Beautiful auburn appearance with a caramel nutty aroma. Strong malt flavor with a hint of molasses and lingering sweetness. Slight amount of hops on the tongue. This is a style I enjoy and this is a fine beer.
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;A very good alt. Brewed locally to me, so maybe I am biased, but I could drink this stuff any time. Kind of nutty, maybe smoky, but easy to drink. Worth at least trying if you can find it.
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;Not a bad altbier. Interesting tea-like flavor, some caramel, wood (sourwood, oak, whatever toothpicks are made out of). Slight hop bite at the end. Copper Creek Brewpub's alt is a bit better with a slightly more assertive hopping and a little less sweet, but this is definitely a very easy-drinking beer.
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;Moderately carbonated with tiny bubbles. A perfect reddish light brown, quite clear. Overall a wonderful appearance. Aroma is deeply malt sweet, earthy. Taste is all Alt: A bit smoky, molasses, nuttiness, sweet malt, very little hop bitterness except for a fairly snappy close. Palate is traditionally thin. A fantastic Alt, one I wanted to try, and I owe deep thanks to an RB friend who sent it out of his own accord. Damn I love this place.
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;Dark copper color with a puffy, although fast-fading head. Aroma of sweet and sour malts with some noble hop character. Body is semi-robust and contains a good balance between the sweet, bready, caramel malt and the lightly bitter hops. The finish is smooth and warming with just the faintest hint of milk chocolate. A very good beer. Thanks to Dogbrick!
Blimp City Akron/Macon German Style Alt Bier;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Blimp City Brewery;Incredible aroma of caramel, nuts, cocoa, dark bread, grain, brown malt and a slight dark fruitiness. Medium amber-brown color with a lasting off-white head. Flavor follows aroma closely, with rich caramel sweetness, bready malt, cocoa, nut and cream(?!). Just a hint of herbal, spicy hop lurking around the fringes. Finish is malty, sweet, tangy and grainy. Very smooth palate, medium body. I definitely enjoyed this.

Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);This beers strength is its consistency and lack of hangover after a session. About the only beer that can be drunk warm.
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Not bad, but not good. This beer is a staple in North Island kiwi culture. As far as I'm concerned the north can keep this beer, and us southerners can keep the good beers
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Ahh the mighty Waikato. Reminds me of whitebaiting on a Sunday arvo get a few kilos in the old net. Get home dump the whitebait on the bench grab cold one, beat my wife and pass out. Bloody refreshing.
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Dilute tea pour, clear. Ok bottle, OK label. Sweetish clearwater aroma. A little tanic, maybe woody, crisp, slightly astringent. Medium to slightly light body. Seven Stars, Devonport, Auckland.
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml can into glass. Pours golden brown with a bubbly white head. Light carbonation. Nose of sweet malt and cooked vegetables. Light body, slight zing. Has that weird sherbet thing going on that NZ mainstream beers have. Finish is watery and caramel sweet . Standard Kiwi pub ale. Obviously designed to be drank in large quantities.
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Has to be served super cold. Half a finger white head, crystal clear amber colour: fake due to the original brew like water but caramel or burnt sugar added to give false colour. It is a lager. Hints of cabbage. Some bitterness but certainly no discernible taste of hops. I only bought this beer to support a newly opened local pub and to be frank I would not call this truly a beer. On a super hot summers day when one is thirsty it would be OK, but otherwise in comparison to real biers, proper IPAs this is as fake as it gets. I have seen them brew it, with much of the sugar content sucrose and not malt.
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);It is wet, sometimes has a head and it contains alcohol. I have never found debris or industrial contaminants in Lion Red. That is about all that I can be positive about with this beer.
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle from the discount bin. Deep amber color with decent head. Grainy, stewed vegetable aroma. Slight bitterness then more graininess and stewed vegetables and sulfur in the taste. Blah.....
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle. Pours gold amber. Caramel, sweetcorn, little too much acidity, fair hit of estery stuff. Medium body. Not great.
Lion Red;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle from Beers of Europe. Pours dark yellow with a small white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is malt and grain. Taste is light sweet, grainy, some caramel malt. Nothing interesting at all.

Tree Thirsty Beaver Amber;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tree Brewing;Rating from old records . From bottle (pre-current label) in shaker. A fairly smooth, malt-driven amber. Easy to drink but would’ve welcomed more hops.
Tree Thirsty Beaver Amber;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tree Brewing;"Pours dark amber with a thin white head. Both aroma and flavour are malt, carmel and fruit. Nothing special about this beer;  just kind of plain."
Tree Thirsty Beaver Amber;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tree Brewing;Very mediocre beer at best. Lacking any decent malt profile for an amber. Not much body to speak of either. It looks nice, but that's about the only positive. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Thick dirty lacing. Aromas of citrus hops and sweet, honey malts. Flavours are quite hoppy, with notes of cascade and golding hops. Malts are mainly Munich. Quite sweet with more notes of honey. Some very subtle hints of caramel as well. Good balance of sweetness and bitterness. Medium bodied. Great retention.
Tree Cutthroat Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Tree Brewing;Vancouver 24/7 2018. 47,3 cl can from BC Liquor Store in Valemount. Green can with a fence positioned on top of a landscape with a Lake in British Columbia. The person who designed this Can seems to be quite confused. Pours slightly hazy amber with big white head. Settles as 1 cm thick layer of foam completely obscuring the surface of the beer. Substantial Lacing. Aroma is not especially intense. Sweet caramel, light roast. Some hops peeking in with sour bitter dryness. Light carbonation. Thin, lively and prickly texture. Flavor has fairly strong sweetness. Followed by moderate sourish bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetish with a touch of caramel. Lingers shortly. Solid take on a EPA. A little confusing that they call it a “West Coast Ale”

Pale hop and malts on nose. A touch nutty. Light minty hop. Creamy, light, malt forward ale. Innocuous and boring.

Tree Blonde Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tree Brewing;Poured gold from the can with one finger of head. Slightly sweet beer with no hop presence. Taste is too passive for my liking. Great alternative to macro beers - same idea with decent ingredients and not nasty sticky sweetness from rice or corn.

Wallabys Great White Wheat;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Wallabys Grille & Brewpub;Frighteningly strong wheat ale with very acidic sharp taste. Not good in the least. Straw colored, sharp smelling. Thin. Nasty.
Wallabys Big Red Roo;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Wallabys Grille & Brewpub;Terrible beer. Thin, watery, too strong on the very aggressive hops. Bad shallow and offensive. Avoid like the plague.
Western Reserve American Wheat Beer;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Western Reserve Brewing;Some guy at Rozi's wine shop told me this brewery is no longer. Not much head on this beer. A clear, filtered wheat greets your eye. Tastes largely metallic and slightly sour. Fizzy. Average to sub-par for an American Wheat.
Western Reserve American Wheat Beer;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Western Reserve Brewing;about typical for a wheat beer. hazy, very light, crisp. I'm not a fan of wheat, but this is the one beer from this brewer that i like.
Western Reserve Amber Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Western Reserve Brewing;Old notes. A hazy, unfiltered looking amber color...muddy. Very fruity aroma with subtle hints of orange and light caramel malts. Flavor is the same as the aroma with a medium-full body and a solid, underlying bitterness. A nice pale ale but not distinctive or enough hop flavor.
Western Reserve Amber Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Western Reserve Brewing;These guys are out of business. I got the last single at the store and I think it''s old. Tasted like it anyway. Stale aftertaste.

Western Reserve Nut Brown Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Western Reserve Brewing;I typed this in on a lark. This was my favorite brewery in Cleveland. Lived in Cleveland all my life until I moved to Tucson in 2003 and then to San Francisco in 2006. Still my favorite. Their Nut Brown put Sam Smith and Newcastle to shame. These were some true beer brothers brewing with a passion. My rating is objective. Not subjective. Go back to brewing!

Western Reserve Bockzilla;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Western Reserve Brewing;Thick & chewey & unlike most domestic American beers. Carmel & still hoppy in the end.

Black Box Western Reserve Cloud Nine;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;I have found my new favorite! Enjoyable and mildly complex flavor with a crisp aroma. Citrus accents very present in the nose but not overpowering the rest of the flavors in the taste. Starts smooth and finishes smooth. No pour, drank straight from the bottle so appearance and head cannot be properly accounted for.
Black Box Western Reserve Cloud Nine;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Sample at Smiling Skull as part of Ohio Brew Week. This brew pours a hazed straw color with a thin white head that evaporates quickly to an outer ring. Spotty lacing. Aroma of wheat, spice and fruit. Light-bodied with flavors of banana, cloves and a touch of hops. The finish is wheaty with a citrus aftertaste. Above average overall.
Black Box Western Reserve Cloud Nine;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;On tap during Ohio Brew Week 2013, taster from Smiling Skull. Was under the Black Box label, I believe. Zesty, citrus peel hops. Some thai type spice. Little banana. Clear golden yellow color. Minimal white head. Medium-plus body. Lighter, more crisp carbonation. More dry finish. Good, sweet, lightly tangy taste. Some nice, complex citrus character. Pretty good, enjoyable stuff.
Black Box Western Reserve Cloud Nine;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;My second favorite summer beer topped only by Bell's Oberon. This dreamy belgium white is complex with a strong citrus taste that is incrediably smoothe. This comes with my highest recommendation and I am sure funk will agree with me.
Black Box Western Reserve Cloud Nine;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Orange, tang and hops. This is a good and ballsy brew. It's odd and a bit compromised in its lack of integration of coriander and possibly other spice. It's a bit too blunt and obvious. It's unique and enjoyable however. It finishes with a long bitter.
Black Box Western Reserve Cloud Nine;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Has a tangy bite to it. Fruity and smooth taste. Good American version of a belgian white.
Western Reserve Twist & Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Western Reserve Brewing;BKelley68 mentioned that he had a bottle of this beer in the back when we did a beer run to Rozi’s one day. I was always impressed with Western Reserve Brewing when it was a going concern, and to find an extinct beer that I never had the chance to try was exciting. Very dark beer out of the bottle with a strong nose of bitter coffee, molassas and some smoke. Very smooth beer, which I attribut partially to its age (best before 1-22-00). Nice sweetened roast coffee bitterness. Coffee gound bitterness in the finish. Well balanced. Very solid beer, even after all this time. I wish they still made it, and if you happen to see a bottle, buy it and drink it.
Western Reserve Twist & Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Western Reserve Brewing;Big head. Very smooth. Seems weak for a stout. But still pretty good........
Western Reserve Lake Effect Winter Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Western Reserve Brewing;I have kept a bottle of this beer from the 1997 vintage in my cellar and oped it tonight. It poured a beautiful chestnut-reddish-brown coulour (at least when carefully decanted), had almost no head, and very little carbonation. The nose reminded of spices and rhum. Sweetish with some bitterness on the palate, somewhat wine-like. The bitterness lingers on, the spicyness does as well, both in a pleasant way.
Western Reserve Lake Effect Winter Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Western Reserve Brewing;These guys had stiff competition with GLBC here, but... I typed this in on a lark.

Bricktown Copperhead;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery;Not a giant fan of this amber ale. Malty and musty. Grassy hops and basic caramel sweetness. Tried for the first time with Jess at the brewery in 2007 on our first road trip.

No Bavarian yeast characteristics, no clove notes. Crisp finish though and actually OK."
Bricktown Bison American Wheat;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Wheat Ale;Bricktown Brewery;(Tap) All I can say is thank God for the lemon. I’m pretty sure that is the one reason this beer had a little bit of flavor. Very light, with light malts and a grainy character. This is just as much a pale lager as an American Wheat, in my opinion. Extremely disappointing.
Bricktown Bison American Wheat;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Wheat Ale;Bricktown Brewery;A watered down version of a decent wheat beer, this like all of the other beers by Bricktown Brewery had no aroma and no body. This is one of those wheats that tasted better AFTER the lemon.
Bricktown Bison American Wheat;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Wheat Ale;Bricktown Brewery;Most common beer at the brewery. I don’t know why people but lemons in it, it already tastes like it was made with them. Rampant sour lemon notes and very watery, thin mouthfeel. Not very good, even for an American wheat.

Bricktown Landrun Lager;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bricktown Brewery;On tap at Brewery: Golden hue with a small head and no lacing. Boring! Very weak aroma, when I took a deep inhale, detected some orange, grain, light bread, and bubble gum. Light bodied with almost no taste and metallic finish. A very slight step up from American Macros, very bland. I guess it would work with a BBQ sandwich.
Bricktown Red Brick Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery;Draft - Pale malts with a perfumy hop. Clear gold with a rich white head. Tastes just as it smells. Not sure how this is a red, but it does taste better than the others they brew.

Bricktown Red Brick Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery;I don’t think this is nearly as bad as its ratings. Its balance is a bit off.

Bricktown Red Brick Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery;Tap at brewpub: Red amber color with the cloudy unfiltered look. It has a woody aroma, a little tangy and a little bourbon perhaps. The flavor is sweet and malty. It needs more hops to balance it out.

Lucky Labrador Stumptown Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;660ml 5.7% ABV bottle from Coppers, Newcastle. 660ml bottle. This is a very dark brown, hazy beer with a massive head of rocky tan foam. It has a roasted malt and chocolate flavour with coffee and nutty notes on the smooth finish. Pretty good.
Lucky Labrador Stumptown Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;"My first Lucky Labrador beer, gaining my sympathy for the label alone since I love both animals and porters, but what a disappointment when I opened the bomber: beer spouted out of the bottle neck, so I quickly had to grab my tasting glass in order to catch as much of it as possible - and frankly, it is the first time I experience violent gushing from an American porter... Needless to say, the head was towering high, coarse and very irregularly shaped, inflating in a few minutes to a frothy, rocky, light beige layer of foam, leaving thick patches of lacing. The beer itself had a very dark but translucent burgundy colour with ruby hue, lightly hazy in appearance - and while I was observing this, a ’tube’ of foam of a few inches long was still creeping out of the bottle and every time I tried to pour more beer into my glass, I had to cope with an enormous amount of head formation. Aroma of overripe figs, unsugared apple sauce, blackberries, quite a lot of ’haemoglobin’ iron, caramel, FFF (freshly fermented farmland), coffee grounds, soggy or even somewhat mouldy brown bread, old dusty milk chocolate bars, dried nettles, fermenting grass, liquorish, brown sugar, green banana, autumn leaves, cappuccino mix, ginger powder, clove-like phenols. Deep but unmistakable sourishness of blackberries or fermenting fruit mingled with fig and pear sweetness opens the palate, with a softish to medium carbonation, minerals here and there; supple, caramelly and very nutty malt bittersweetness (more bitter than sweet) ensues, rather light, thinnish and dryish with a metallic ’zing’ to it and with the fruity esters and some phenols on top; a tad of coffee grounds-like roasted bitterness appears in the end, aided by a dash of herbal, earthy hops providing a more ’vivid’, spicy bitterness, interfering too much with the malts. Ends dry, toasted and nutty with the herbal, rather dull but bittering hops continuing, juicy, but as expected, off-balance and with misplaced spicy phenols retronasally; the finishing drought is reinforced by the sourish undertone accompanying the palate from beginning to end, and clearly resulting from onsetting infection, which I also hold responsible for the extreme gushing. I was expecting a much cleaner beer considering its ’geozythological’ background, but what I got, was something much more reminiscent of a well-intended but technically flawed ’new Belgian micro brewery’ attempt at porter or even Belgian dubbel, too estery, but most of all, clearly infected. Though the basic flavour profile is acceptable for the style it pretends to be (plain brown porter), the infection clearly decreased the quality enormously - with points off for the unexpected strong gushing as a result. This does not motivate me to purchase more from this brewery, I’m afraid."

Cloudy medium amber color, ivory head that sinks quickly to a thin cover, short strips of lace. Taste is malt followed closely by medium carbonation and noticeable neutral hops.

Boozy and caramel up front with a little burn in the throat. Very carbonated that brings complex flavors to the palate. Some sour and bitterness balances the initial sweetness. Some funk with dark fruit . Long bitter finish. This is intense and perhaps too complex for my palate.

Pours a clear dark brown color with reddish hues and a well-formed off-white head. Aroma is sweet caramel dark fruits, and mild hop notes. Flavor is very malty and fruity, and probably the sweetest beer I had at Bosco’s. Sugar plum and raisin, caramel and toffee, with some hop bitterness on the finish. Medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation. A nice beer overall, but not one of my favorites from Bosco’s.
Boscos Olde Fool;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);On tap at Memphis. I had this one when I first went to Boscos and was less than impressed. Recipe change or something has really happened. A deep brown ale with a tan head that reminds me so much of the best Fuller’s 1845 I ever had. Big hop aroma, with a bit of smoke, and an obvious load of caramel which translates into a big chewy beer. The alcohol is well integrated, and it is too easy to love and too hard to stop at one.
Boscos Olde Fool;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Pours red amber with a foamy beige head that fades eventually. Aroma is sweet and not much else. Cherry cough syrup taste. The bitter roast finish is not pleasant in this one.

Boscos Bock;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);"On tap, Nashville brewpub. Ruby brown in the glass with a soapy, ephemeral-looking head that diminishes to a thickish dusting. Strongly malty with roasty and semi-sweet chocolate flavors in the finish. Finishes semi-dry. I’m semi-enthused by the beer. On the one hand, it has a diffident body and malt push that is impressive. On the other, the malts get mealy right after the swallow, and there’s a sense that this is (a) off somehow, and (b) not a bock. I see that whoever enterred the beer put is as a dunkler bock; the dunkle elements really come through, but I don’t know if they are all that successful. Not a poorly made beer by any means, just not my personal taste."
Boscos Victory Lager;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Very little head. A very common lager. There were no remarkable attributes. The lager was thin yet had a smooth finish with a proper balance of hops. This would not rate as one of the top Victory products that I have enjoyed.
Boscos Oktoberfest;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Draft at the Squared location in Memphis after passing my systems test.

I enjoyed that it was a little more balanced than many other Oktoberfests. Granted, I usually don’t love the style, but I really enjoyed this one, and I was surprised to see the overall score sitting at 38. It is definitely better than that!

Anacortes Oktoberfest;Anacortes, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Pint @ Rockfish. Super flavorful for an oktoberfest (marzen?) Reminds me of the barleywine. Malt and hops well-balanced otherwise would be too sweet.

Anacortes Oktoberfest;Anacortes, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Draught pint at Redbones on 10/24/07 Not a strong appearance for an Oktoberfest and I hesitate to give it even a 3....Very hazy for the style, with a small, fleeting off-white head and a ruddy-chestnut color. No lacing. The nose is immediately peppered with hops, though they arent of the high alpha variety, fortunately. Bradiness comes on somewhat strong, but instead of growing sweet and melanoidin-like, it continues to dry out and gets roasty. Lots of minerals and some doughiness/blandness on the end. Medium strength of aroma, with no flaws. Lightly to moderately bitter hops harry the palate up front, though there is little to sink in to, other than a basic pale malt sweetness followed by strong, roasty notes. Way too heavy on these notes which really shouldnt be present at all in the style. Way too forceful in the malt flavors, though not the actual sweetness. No flaws, but just not what I’d call an oktoberfest, which should be very drinkable, as this isn’t. No alcohol perceived. Watery, somewhat slick and uneventful texture, with medium carbonation.

Anacortes Noel Lager;Anacortes, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Well, this is my 300th rating, and not a beer worthy of the title I'm afraid. The Anacortes site claims this is a lager, but it tasted more like an ale for sure. Very thin caramel malt with just a touch of hops, giving it a slightly metallic mouthfeel. Very bland, very watery, and a very average beer that I'm not very anxious to try again.

Rockyard Redhawk Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Rockyard Brewing Company;Pours deep red, very carbonated. Nose of old wood, plum, bread. Taste is kind of like chewing on a stick, as the nose suggests. Not very good.
Rockyard Redhawk Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Rockyard Brewing Company;A Scottish ale that tastes like a common red. Hops are more pronounced than the malt. Was thinking Odell's 90 and got Killian's. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Rockyard Redhawk Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Rockyard Brewing Company;I had wanted this to be a much better beer, but was very underwhelmed. When it arrived in the 20oz glass, the colour looked spot-on. There was a distinct lack of head, with a small ring of off-white bubble rimming the glass. I might have chalked this up to glassware cleaning practices, but then I tried the beer. There was virtually nothing for the nose to find, and surprisingly little for the tongue as well. It was very light in the body, not the ’medium body’ as in the description, and not at all balanced to me. The beer leaned heavily towards the bitter side of the spectrum, but not in the good, hoppy IPA way. I’m wondering if there are water chemistry issues that are not taken into account with recipe formulation?
Rockyard Redhawk Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Rockyard Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle - I bought this because it was a buck fiddy - also, because I am apparently a dumbass that doesn’t learn from his mistakes - if I weren’t, I would have realized that I haven’t really cared for any Rockyard products I’ve had - if I weren’t, I would have saved myself from this charred, ashy, sour and overall soil/dirt tasting train wreck of a Scottish ale - but I am, so...
Rockyard Redhawk Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Rockyard Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to Aaron. Pours reddish brown. Nose/taste of caramel, toasted malt, nuts and baked bread. Touch of hop bitterness. Medium body. Finishes clean with touch of burnt caramel malt on back of palate.
Jaxons Silver Star Light;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Light honey aroma. Clear golden in color, poured with no head. Light honey-bread flavor...actually pretty flavorful for a light lager.
Jaxons Silver Star Light;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;[Tap] Pours a light yellow color with a fizzy white foam head. Nose of corn syrup, grass and some grain. Taste is heavy on corn with a sweet, buttery finish. High carbonation and light in body. Akin to pale lagers from most brewpubs nationwide.
Jaxons Silver Star Light;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Sample @ Jaxons airway location. Like most swill beers corn and medium bitter beer like miller lite. Yellow body with white head.
Jaxons Silver Star Light;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Tap @ brewpub: Clear yellow color with no head. Grainy taste that’s in most pale lagers. Pretty basic.
Jaxons Silver Star Light;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Pale yellow body with a minimal white head. Sweet popcorn butter and corn syrup smell and flavor. Hops come through like a whisper but fail to help out. Thin body, naturally. Clean, but corny and pointless.
Jaxons Silver Star Light;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Draught at Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co., El Paso, Texas. Clear golden beer with a white head. Weak aroma, slight malty. Brewing mash and corn in the flavor, tastes undone. Just as bad as most macro lagers.....!
Jaxons Silver Star Light;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;"tap at brewpub: well, all brewpubs have to have their ""drunk"" beer and this is the one for those bud/miller/coors people. this brew is more a sam adams light than miller lite. still, the most boring of the batch."
Rockyard Bullseye Brown Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Rockyard Brewing Company;Had this beer at GABF on 10/2/1999. Aroma is a mild malt scent. Color is a nice brown with light carbonation and a thin head. Taste is a rich nutty malt flavor with a nice bitter end. This is a very tasty Brown.
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. Pours dark brown, with a medium, foamy, tan head. The nose is molasses, burnt toast, pine, and some mustiness. Sweet up front, with an unpleasant bitterness and off flavors in the finish. Light to medium body, syrupy, and clingy. This is a weak and watery stout. The aroma has some promise, but the flavor is off-putting.
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;Pours hazy black with little head. A malty aroma with some coffee. A full-bodied coffee liqueur taste. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;Pour on tap at the brewery, dark brownish black pour with slightly tan head, aroma brought notes of dark chocolate, caramel, some roasted malt into some slight yeast, touch of coffee in there as well. Taste is simple, some roast, cocoa, and dark fruit into a bit of dark sugars, hints of spice, finishing slightly bitter.
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;Great chocolate flavor, a little coffee and Carmel notes, Great color, solid stout flavor but not too heavy
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;Light black pour under a thin beige head that leaves too fast. Aroma has some dark roasty cocoa tones with a sort of leafy bitterness and a little earthy twang to it. Flavor has a smooth earthy oat tone with a bitter twangy cocoa tone and a slight metallic taste. Just kinda generic and forgettable. Dry coffee finish.
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;"on tap from brewery during late summer trip to COS. going from old notes one of the lower rated stouts ever - wasn’t a drain pour or nasty but nothing positive about it - thin; skip this"
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from Tipsy’s into my Funkwerks glass. Black with a small tan head that dissipates to nothing. The aroma is caramel, milk chocolate, roasted malts, light bitter hops, rye bread and a touch of spices. Similar flavor with vanilla and earth. Medium sweetness and light bitterness. Average body with a creamy feel and roasted finish.
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;Sampler at the brewpub. Pours a thin, poorly retained off white head, over a possibly clear, brown (SRM 30) body.....nose is chocolate, coffee, cocoa.....taste is chocolate, coffee, cocoa, sweet toffee/caramel, finishing with a mild roasted malt hop bitterness.....mouth feel medium, slightly sticky, with a creamy oat mouth feel. Overall a very nice Stout with the malt back bone very complex and thorough. Given the changes in rating they must have significantly modified the recipe. BJCP 7/3/14/4/7
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;12oz Bottle. Poured clear dark brown w/ Large frothy tan head mostly lasting. Aroma is faint sweet sugars, chocolate syrup, molasses, maple syrup and honey. Flavor left me wondering where the bite of the snake was, it is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Taste is reminds me of pancakes with syrup. Light body, thin watery texture, soft carbonation. Not complex and not what I’m looking for in a stout, have this one for breakfast with some scrambled eggs & bacon on the side.
Rockyard Lightning Strike Stout;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rockyard Brewing Company;Probably the thinnest looking stout I have ever seen. Let’s in light like a church window-looks like coca-cola. Nose is actually pretty good with dark roasted malts and coffee. Thick head that fades quickly, no lacing. Flavor follows taste but has an off unclean finish. The best thing about this beer is that it isn’t actually nasty like the last Rockyard I had. Where is the nitro in the description? That would help the palate a lot. Weak.
Jaxons Chihuahua Brown;El Paso, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Bredy aroma. Brown in color with hint of off-white head. Roasty flavor, leaning towards stout. A great, straight forward brown ale.
Jaxons Chihuahua Brown;El Paso, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Medium brown with a thin head. Sweet malta-like aroma. The body is thin, and kind of nutty on the palate. Pretty nondescript.
Jaxons Chihuahua Brown;El Paso, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Draft in sampler set @ Remcon location. Is copper brown, deep with even lacing. Very dry brown bread aroma. Flavors have a surprising amount of mocha. Nice. Thin and on the sweet side.

Very mild aroma, sort of a mixture of roasted malt and nuts with a hint of sweetness. Has a very mild sweetness with a mixture of caramel and malt. Quite tasty.

Aroma of dark caramel, a roasted strong malt, and nuts. Hits the mouth with a smooth medium body, malt is tasty to say the least, middle holds up fine with nuts in the background, finish has a nice little chocolate note. Best brown that I have had in awhile.

Dry and dusty aroma of grains and cocoa. Roasted malts dominate the taste, with burnt caramel and a light coffee roast as well. Sweet hazelnut and fleeting vanilla notes finish it off. Medium-light palate. A decent brew!
Jaxons Chihuahua Brown;El Paso, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;At the Mesa brewpub. Dark brown with a white head. Nose is a nice roasty, malty aroma. Taste is just burnt maltiness with no other pleasing flavors. Very plain. Very thin palate that fades quickly. Not even a good homebrew.
Jaxons Chihuahua Brown;El Paso, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Sample @ Jaxons airway location. Mild sweet aroma. Light brown body with off white head. Thin body texture and had a sweet candy flavor. Easy on the palate wish beer would of had more body texture to it.
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Bready, toasted malt in both aroma and taste. Poured amber in color with white head. Pretty spot on amber.
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;On tap at the Airway location. Pours a hazy orange brown with a thin white head. Aroma of nice caramel malt, fruits, mild bitterness. Flavor of sweet fruits/malt up front with some spicy hops in the finish. Pretty good amber (sounds like this might be prone to some bad batches, but this wasn’t one of them). Nice and drinkable too. 7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;The aroma is nuts and butter. The body is thin, the taste is foul and finishes with lots of butter. There is no way they should be serving this.
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Draft @ Remcon Circle location. Dark amber, and the lace is even. Aroma is huge diacetyl overpowering! Buttery dough. Slick and oily. The butter does not carry over to flavors as much but is very slick palate and under hopped but nice malt character so manages to be drinkable, at least in small quantity. If wasn’t so buttery would be better.
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a light tan head and copper color. Aroma is roasty medium malt-bready. Taste is sweet roasty medium malt-caramel/bready, secondary spice/fruty hops bite.
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Draft happy hour mega pint at the Airway brewpub. Dark amber if not brown with a nice sticky head. The aroma is toasty. Quite drinkable, this is a solid flavorful brew, rich an mildly thick with caramel malts, yet easily chuggable. These kinds of beers are always underrated yet hard to make. (#3881, 4/9/2010)
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;20oz, draft. Color was a somewhat deep red for an amber. light aroma. taste was unexceptional but good.
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Sample @ Jaxons airway location. Good medium sweet fruity aroma and flavor. For an amber ale good blended beer. Refreshes the palate on a hot day. Amber body with off white head. Would of had a full pint if not for a long drive home ahead of the wife and I.
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Tap @ brewpub:.Clear light amber with a little off-white head. There is a sweet brown sugar aroma. But the problem is that is way too sweer for an amber ale.
Jaxons Cactus Jack Amber Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;The Cactus Jack is light amber, tending even more toward red, with a quickly dissipating white head. There’s an almost caramely sweetness, a little spice, and only slight hoppiness. It’s a lot lighter than the Chihuahua Brown Ale, but still not a bad little beer. The batch at the Airway location was way better than the one at Remcon.
Jaxons Old Paleface Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;At the Mesa brewpub. Bright copper and very clear. Nice mellow hoppy nose. Flavors of mild hops, very bitter and clean. Light body, sharp and tart. Not bad for the style.
Jaxons Old Paleface Ale;El Paso, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;tap at mesa st brewpub-served in an english pint. Nice copper appearace with nice carbonation. aroma was malt/hops/sugar. NICE! flavor was very balanced-malts and hops fighting to see who will win and it ended in a tie. nice APA.
Jaxons Panchos Porter;El Paso, Texas, United States;Porter;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;[Tap] Pours clear and dark brown in color. Virtually no head. A light coffee and mocha aroma. Taste is lighter than expected given the color. A weak roasted malt body. Some grain and lingering astringency. Definitely not the best beer I had that night.
Jaxons Panchos Porter;El Paso, Texas, United States;Porter;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Excuse me bartender, I asked for the porter. This beer has a clear amber-brown body with a filmy off-white head. Lighter than any porter I’ve ever had. The aroma and flavor are of caramel with a minor chocolate element. Has a spicy/earthy hop character. Not a bad beer, but WAY off style. Now can someone please explain to me why that jackass across the bar just squeezed a lime into his IPA?
Jaxons Panchos Porter;El Paso, Texas, United States;Porter;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Pours a deep brown hue with weak carbonation and little head retention. no lacing and looks thin. grainy, musty, slight chocolate aroma that wasnt that good. Lots of roasty flavors with a touch of diacytl that was not detracting, but present. Slight coffee twang, but not very present due to little roast malt. flimsy palate and burnt finish. This was a unique porter, but not in a good way.
Jaxons Panchos Porter;El Paso, Texas, United States;Porter;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Flat when I got it too, it travelled across Texas in a growler and was in a refrigerator for a couple of weeks, so I bumped it up a little to compensate. Actually quite drinkable despite the condition. Sweet, well-balanced, pretty nice. I'll be sure to try one fresh if in El Pase anytime soon.
Jaxons Panchos Porter;El Paso, Texas, United States;Porter;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;This beer was a little flat when I got it....color of coca cola....it had a great flavor regardless of its lack of freshness....if you add a little bit of crispness it would have been a very well done porter.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;I had this a while back as I think they might be closed. Average stout with roasted malt and a somewhat light body. Good but not bold.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;on nitro-pours a tight light brown head with heavy lacing and black with red color. Aroma is dark malt-roasty/cocoa, some earthy. Taste is sweet dark malt-roasty/cocoa/molasses, secondary earthy hops, dusty finish.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Nitro-tap- Served a vertual opaque black color with a nice full head that fades slowly to good lacing. Has a roasted coffe and milk chocolate aroma. Seems to have a roasted coffee flavor with some chocolate and malt mixed in. Has a mild bitterness and a dry finish. Not quite a full bodied brew. Creamy smooth but missing something to give it that wow factor. Not bad for a couple, but doesn’t pack the punch you wold expect from a stout.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Draft in a gigantic happy hour pint-plus at the Airway brewpub. Solid stout. A tad bit chalky. Roasty. Coffee. Not a classic, but a straight away good drinker.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;[Tap] Pours an opaque black color. A thin tan head is visible, but this beer wasn’t nitro when I went. Roasted dark malts and coffee in the nose. Lots of bitter coffee grounds in the taste. Flavoring included dark malts and dark chocolate as well. The beer was a bit thin and unnecessarily alcoholic in the finish.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;20oz, draft. nice stout. deep black, very smooth with a strong chocolate taste. pretty standard stuff, nothing overwhelming.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Sample @ Jaxons airway location. Dry coco aroma. Black body with tan head. Good creamy chocolate flavored stout with dry coco aftertaste left on the palate. Good house stout.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Tap @ brewpub: dark, dark brown with a light brown head. The aroma is mainly coffee accompanied by a coffee taste and lots of roasted nuts. The feel is quite thin almost porterish.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;The Black Jack is a typical motor oil-looking brewpub stout with very low carbonation and a lasting, creamy tan head. It’s not quite as bitter or hoppy as most other stouts, but has a strong milk chocolate taste. I think the clean finish could be perceived as weakness, but the Black Jack is tasty, even if a little thin.
Jaxons Black Jack Stout;El Paso, Texas, United States;Stout;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewpub. Listed as 9.5%. A dark brown color with very smooth mouthfeel. Slightly sweet flavor balance. Pushed by nitrogen, with a nice malty character and clean finish.
Twisted Pine American Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;Pours a soft and hazy light copper amber with one finger of soft khaki tan head. Nose is meh, malt dominant with a light sweetness and hints of toasty grain. Flavor is a bit rough on the edges with a lightly toasty note and slick metallic hops.
Twisted Pine American Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;What a disappointing mixed 12 pack. Another barely marginal beer. Fruity, chalky, light earthy hops, touch roast.
Twisted Pine American Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;Clear dark amber pour with a thin, soapy beige head. Aroma is toast, nutty notes, over ripe tree fruit, a little toffee and spicy hops. Flavor is roasted nut skins, caramel, spicy and grassy hops, and some planty and bitter citrus hops to the finish. Light body with a syrupy, slightly astringent feel and medium, sharpish carbonation. Not bad overall.
Twisted Pine American Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;Not bad but neither too flavoury. Quite thin and decent to drink. Enjoyable with a movie it is.

Sticky rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt, hops and fruit. Light-bodied with flavors of roast malt, earthy hops and fruit. The finish is sweet with a caramel malt aftertaste. Average overall.
Twisted Pine American Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;Bottle poured a clear light amber w/ a medium creamy beige head slowly diminishing to a thin cap w/ some lacing. Medium malty aroma. Initial flavor is light sweet w/ a light bitter finish of short duration. Tastes are toast, cereal, and brown sugar. Light bodied, watery texture, and soft carbonation.
Twisted Pine American Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;Aroma is caramel malts and mild earthiness. The flavor is caramel malts, earthiness bordering on dirty and a tangy finish.
Twisted Pine American Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;Bottle. Pours a mostly clear amber color with a smallish white head. Nose is a little toasty with a bit of bread in there. Taste is quite malty with the toasting elements coming through. Not a huge fan of this.

Twisted Pine American Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;Bottle. Orange amber pour with a smaller head. Dusty earthy nose. There’s actually a little hop profile on the taste - not bad. Palate is so-so.
Lovejoys Dennis Hopper IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Aroma 7. Appearance 3. Taste 6. Palate 3. Overall 13. Very fruity aroma. Same taste with bitterness at the end. Short aftertaste.
Lovejoys Dennis Hopper IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Not the nicest beer, can looks fun though Taste wise I’m not too keen on this trendy fruity style I’d probably give it another go ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Lovejoys Dennis Hopper IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Can from beer52 mail order club. Lovely fruity aroma, followed by a deep hoppy flavour. Very nice ipa, would buy again
Lovejoys Dennis Hopper IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Not sure why the rating for this is quite so low. It’s not particularly exciting, especially up against the vast range of interesting IPAs out there, but certainly nothing offensive.
Lovejoys Dennis Hopper IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Bottle from Beer52. Lovely beer. Refreshing, full flavoured and lots of lip smacking bitterness. Disappeared quickly.
Lovejoys Dennis Hopper IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;I was shocked that this was actually a pretty good beer. Pale copper. Treacly white head. Lovely nose. Amarillos and flat fruity hops. Slight malt profile. Very strawy malt. Flavors are lovely as well but not as good as the nose. Endless amarillo bitterness. Watery edges and cracker like malt. Good enough
Lovejoys Dennis Hopper IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Spice in the aroma, some hoppiness. Chocolate maltiness and a somewhat rotten woodiness in the flavor. VERY bad aftertaste.
Lovejoys Old Vixen;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Had on tap at Lovejoy’s in Ausitn - blew me away condsidering the other offerings I had had from here. Has a delectable brandy-like aroma with some winey accents. Flavor has many things going on here, bourbon, chocolate, dates, all blended together nicely. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Worth buying a second snifter of, which I did.
Lovejoys Old Vixen;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Interesting. I only got a shot of this at the Brewcrafter’s Festival 2004...all they had left. The label on the table said it was somewhere between 12 and 13.5%. That means that I was indoubtedly going to get wasted on this...even if it was a half cup. I like Lovejoys a lot. I could never, ever drink a whole pint of this. Malt tastes vanillay. Body is thin and VERY alcoholic. Hops, almost nonexistant. Not the best Barleywine, more like taking a shot of malt whiskey. G-rat
Lovejoys Old Vixen;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Hard to believe I could get into this with sun burning down on me. It actually allowed a momentary reprieve as I rolled it gently over my tongue. Nice mingling of bitterness interacting with the rich malty flavors. Will be heading for more and possibilities of a rerate for additional notes.
Lovejoys Old Vixen;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Berries, tropical flavors, pine, low medium effervescence, light resins, finish is mild cocoa. Despite the wild collage, it really comes together. Best in show at the Texas Craft Brewers Fest.
Lovejoys Old Vixen;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Menacing red appearance, complex aroma: I got all of whiskey, hickory, maple syrup, smoke, yeast. The flavor doesn't disappoint, and it has an emphasis on the whiskey. The bartender told me that they age it in Jack Daniel's barrels for 8 months. The mouthfeel was a tad bit weak but not enough for a demerit. Very nice. Gets a bit woody as it warms up.
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Draught served too cold and drank too fast. Mild nose, light sweetness with some hop character. Orange-brown with little head. Well-balanced but unimpressive flavor, sweet with a slightly dry bitter finish. On the thin side, not really enough of a body to make up for the lack of flavor.
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;This is a texan treat!! This brew has a unique bitterness, quite delicous! Minimal head here, when you drink this you can sense the wort flavour...a refreshingly different beer! :::: Re-rate 1/2 a year later....Sunrise Orange..little head..slight honeycomb-off toffee smell..caramel bitterness, and the bitterness coats the mouth nicely, good! rated 3.6 ...scores changed in response.
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Aroma is a nice caramel, but the pleasantries end there. The flavor is rotten tomatoes, stale whiskey, and flat Coke. This is wort, not beer. The picture for the beer shows a dog, which I am assuming is the beer’s namesake. Put the poor fella down- he’s suffering something awful, fellas.
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Poured amber with a thin off white head...aroma is well balanced...taste is somewhat sweet with a nice bitter finish...
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Tap. Poured slighly murky and golden with a short head that didn’t last. Exciting aromas of hops and doughnuts. Slid over my tongue like a cilantro jell-o shot. Finished quick and slighly bitter.
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Murky amber/orange with not much head and a little lacing. Not much aroma, maybe a little fruit from the yeast and some malt. It has a balanced malty flavor, but a little thin in the body. Watery but clean finish. A little age and some carbonation would do wonders for this beer.
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Pretty average I will say. Had side by side with a pint of IPA. Not bad, but rather lacking. Just ever so slightly watery. This noted. I don't think it would be too great an effort to make this into a fair session ale if the time was taken.
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;RE-RATE: Reddish-orange, average head. Decent aroma, some pleasant hops, slight mint. A little bland but the crisp hops are nice. Slight spicy-vanillla taste. A little more punch and this could be a decent ESB. We might have had a bad batch the first time around. ORIGINAL RATING 5/15/02: 3-4-4-3-7 How do the people at LJ's make all of their beers have absolutely no smell? Quite bland, a little sweet and slightly hoppy finish that I couldn't notice again after the first sip.
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;The first sip almost has taste, then it's pure water after that. ..........
Lovejoys Sparkys Special Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;As sad as it is to say, I could not tell the difference between this and the pale ale. Nothing distinctive or special about this beer at all. It was like rotten ginger ale.

Lovejoys Samsons Best Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Clear gold pour. Aroma was light floral and citrus. Moderate bitter, touch of sweetness. Yeasty, kind of muddled taste. Some bitterness in the finish. Just not exciting.

Lovejoys Samsons Best Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Cask at Lovejoys Austin. Clear gold, fluffy thin head, and great lacing. Nose is lemon hay malts, mild hops. Mild malts in the taste, mild hops in the finish with slight bitterness. Not very distinctive in any direction, but easy drinking beer if you’re not too picky. Good session.
Lovejoys Samsons Best Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Cask draught glass at the joint- served a fine turbid dull orange color, one and half finger white head that laced awesomely. Aroma of very light malt and pine. Hits the mouth with a firm medium body, malt is very noticeable, some hops transversed with very light pine in the middle, finish is a little dry but lasting. There ya go!
Lovejoys Samsons Best Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Cask poured, and awful. Easily one of the worst beers I’ve had. Smell was next to nothing. Taste was minimal, perhaps a hint of watered down hops, and incredibly bland. Very thin, and along with another of their beers, this tasted of spoiled milk. Never gotten a rotten dairy taste in a beer before, so I don’t know what this means... I wouldn’t waste your time with this.
Lovejoys Samsons Best Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Cask-poured cloudy amber...no discernable aroma...taste is pland and somewhat imbalanced...not very good...
Lovejoys Samsons Best Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Cask - Slightly murky orange color. Lite flavor and mouthfeel... unpleasently bland. No hops are noticed. Plastic dull bland palate with a really pale bland flavor.
Lovejoys Samsons Best Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;"Had on tap at Lovejoy’s in Austin, Tx. The tap handle said, ""Son of Samson’s American Pale Ale"", but I’m sure it was the same thing. Murky orange appearance with a thin light white head. Neutral aroma (probably due to smoke in the bar), so I’ll give a five for not being skunky! Odd, artificial flavor, reminds me of Nestea Powdered Iced Tea - the kind your Mom used to make before real Iced Tea became the thing. Slight citrus notes, but is ""off"" somehow. Mouthfeel is very thin and powdery as if made from concentrate. Let’s hope their other ""house"" beers are of higher quality, becuase I will be back - I’m a sucker!"
Lovejoys Samsons Best Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Thie brew is usualy what I get if I go to Lovejoys. I love this place. BRew is always on cask. Pours a lovely copper color with a nice casky looking head. Spongy and dense. Nose: Notes of alcohol mainly. Not all that hoppy althogh they are definitely in there. Smells watery (like all of their brews) Really not all that special in the nose. In the mouth...its alright. Nice and smooth not too watery though certaionly could use some more body. Notes of ruffles potato chips, yeast, and a slight hoppiness that dies off into metallic shavings. Its ok not their porter but good G-rat
Lovejoys Old Horizontal;Austin, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - English;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;An interesting one to say the least. Swampy pour, no head. Wheres the carbonation. Not flat but not really carbonated either. Aromas are a little sticky but mostly offputting and herbal from the hops. A slight cheesey edge from the ale yeast. Flavors are a wreck. Pruney sweetness and a harsh bitter attack afterwards. Ehh
Lovejoys Old Horizontal;Austin, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - English;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Tap. Carmellish looking. Thick barleywine taste with slight amounts of citrus. Decent.
Lovejoys Old Horizontal;Austin, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - English;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;"""Mysterious""? There was not much mystery to this beer IMO, sweet roasty hops, kinda thin on the tongue with a slightly slimey mouthfeel. I had this at the Texas Craft Brewers festival with Chad and Joe. Joe was slutting ratebeer.com at a booth as Chad and I sat back and enjoyed our beer nearby. Then, Fly showed up and we made fun of him."

Lovejoys Atlas Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Served on tap like a luscious white head riding a black-hole of temptation. Mellow toffe and toast greet the nose.

Lovejoys Atlas Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Head and lacing are there. Deep malt, dark and the right touch of chocolate without being coffee bitter. The best I tried there.
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Poured opaque black with no head...mild roasty coffee aroma...watery and thin...a hint of chocolate and some coffee, but this was another disappointment...
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Tap. Poured like midnight. Smells wonderful with hints of Nyquil and chicory coffee. The head was slight and brief. First taste was a bit disappointing but as it warmed it began to shine. It slaked my afternoon thirst and left me with whispers of a promising night.
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Had on tap at the bar in Austin. Dark ruby red pour, light mocha colored head. Has a slight, odd acidic taste that I think is kind of a Lovejoy house taste. Some slight chocolate notes redeem it a little bit and the mouthfeel is slightly thick and creamy, but it is still not the most pleasant Porter I have had the experience of drinking. Great place - Lovejoy’s - just does not brew very good beer.
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;This is one of my favorite bars in Austin. Cool people, crazy art, cheap homebrews. Not the greatest porter in the world but very drinkable. I could definitely do about 6 of these in a night and be happy. Zero head, no lacing...slightly dissapointing the first time I got this but I kind of like it now. Looks like black swampwater. Not very thick in fact looks like water with black food coloring. Not very impressive. Smells awesome. Cascade maybe. Very piney and round. Tastes excellent. The wateriness blanches out the sootiness of the malt, which I think is interesting and admirable. Very thirst quenching...not something I would usually say about a Porter. Get it if they have it. G-rat
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Nothing in the way of head or lacing. Sweet, but no strong flavors of any type. Atmosphere was kinda cool.
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Perhaps some workhas been done on this one. Or after having five pints prior I was lubricated enough that I was an easy target. I doubt it. I usually get much tougher on beers the longer the night. Certainly not the greatest porter I have ever had, but a nice roast flavor with enough character in the mouth feel and balance to give it some class.
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Very watery for a porter, not much body, just a little bit of roasted flavor.
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Unfortunately this was the best this brewery had to offer. It did have some flavor of roastedness. It was thin otherwise and left me disappointed.
Lovejoys AJ Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;This was the best brew that I had out of three, which ain't saying a lot. Standard porter medium bodied, weakish stout, slight chocolate/coffee taste, nothing special at all.
Lovejoys Bolivar Blond;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;"It seems like Lovejoy's is the place to go in Austin if you want to take out anger on bad beers on this site. I am honored to be the first person to be rating the beer that COMPLETELY re-defines the word ""watery"". I think that even a 15-year old girl could drink this stuff and wriggle her eyebrows in surprise that someone gave her Evian and food coloring and told her that it was beer. Good God, I could chug it all day and feel nothing. It belongs on this site about as much as Zima does."
Lovejoys Get Off My Ewe;Austin, Texas, United States;Scottish Ale;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Very dark Scottish ale. A bit flat without much hugely exciting, but it's still good. And I give it bonus points for a funny name.
Lovejoys Get Off My Ewe;Austin, Texas, United States;Scottish Ale;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;This looks plain and amber with a weak head, but I gave it a 4 for appearance anyway because of the cool tap handle (a scottish guy about to nail a sheep). Slight hops in the nose, not too bad smell. Although the taste is a bit flat and could be considerably more carbonated, I found the maltiness well-balanced and refreshing. This brew is one of their better efforts.

Redfish Gastons Swollen Delta Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Bomber. Big ole’ rocky head, something you’d expect on a belgian. Aroma is light cocoa, cream, and hops. Taste has some chocolate, but is incredibly fruity, I’m thinking grapefruit and cherries. Finish balances out, gets roasty and bitter. Good stuff.
Redfish Gastons Swollen Delta Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;I’ve had this one in the fridge for a few months now. What the heck - when you look at the label, it’s kind of confusing - I started to think it was from New Orleans, but it’s from Boulder, CO. We had a hard time pouring this - if you pour 2 inches of beer, you’ll get 6 inches of brown/tan head. Once it settles down, you get good lacing and the color is deep black with hints of red.. Sweet aroma. Taste was a perfect desert brew - sweet with a nice amount of coffee roastyness.
Redfish Gastons Swollen Delta Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;"Appearance: deep, dark color, almost solid black, if not for the lighter, reddish sides and bottom, with a huge, booming, bubbly, cocoa-tan head. Aroma: soft and creamy, hints of coffee, anise, chocolate, dry and a little bitter, gritty and roasty, but nice. Taste: great mouthfeel, tremendous texture, palate-coating, but not too heavy, and exquisitely drinkable. This perfectly capture the ""Extra Stout"" category, and is smooth and eminently drinkable. Hops are here, just enough, and malt is in unfailing supply. Remarkably smooth and drinkable, without losing it’s edge. Fully-flavored, richly roasted, and with a hint of fruitiness, just a little. Sure they didn’t smuggle this over from Dublin? Definitely a keeper in my book, an ""Extra Stout"" that really nails it!"
Redfish Gastons Swollen Delta Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Haha, just as I thought... same brewmaster as the Oskar Blues thing... read my rating of THAT stout... I just cleaned my mouth out and now I'm opening this one. Smells like a slightly sweet coffee and creame mixture, with some hickory smoke (think good BBQ) and some tobacco. Ok palate... soft but empty, with mild flavors of oats and smoke. Too thin.

An old fireplace smoked character comes through in the flavour along with coffee and low sweetness medium bitter roasted malt. There's something else there I can't quite identify - flinty earthy and even metallic? Not unpleasant slightly acrid bitter finish
Redfish Wildfire Smoked Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Very dark brown with amber edges and an off-white head. Subtle hint of campfire smoke or, more to the point, a wildfire, in the nose. Smoke is more prominent in the flavor and marries well with some additional malts. No sourness to speak of, but I prefer my porters nice and roasty like this one. My favorite beer sampled at Redfish.
Redfish Wildfire Smoked Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Roasty and coffee-like. Notably lacking in smoky taste.

Redfish Ragtime ESB;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;"ecrvich should've re-rated this one when he was drinking with me; I didn't think it was too bad (but then again, I may be biased toward hoppy beers). While I did think it had a few flaws (mostly malt-based) and seemed a little watery in the middle, I really enjoyed the hop flavors. Sweet, citrusy, flowery, and gentle. Bitter hops in the finish provided a nice dryness. Very easy-drinking."

Twisted Pine Cream Style Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout;Twisted Pine Brewing;From Apr 2007 This one pours from 22oz bottle almost a pitch black with an ample head of foam that shrinks to a fine layer with some lacing. The smell is of sweet malt with some hop nose. The taste has some roastiness to it and some semi sweet chocolate notes up front that smooths out and ends up a bit on the bitter side in the finish. A pretty noncomplex stout that is easy drinking but lacks real character...at least for me. Bottom line: Nothing really bad about this brew but there's not a whole lot going on. I'm glad I tried it but it's just not interesting enough to warrant another try.
Twisted Pine Cream Style Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout;Twisted Pine Brewing;"More a rich creamy golden ale with coffee than a stout.

Mash House Hefeweizen;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Draft, Raleigh (formerly known as Hi-5). Unlike their IPA and some of their darker beers, this one had absolutey no distinctiveness to it. By the numbers appearance and slightly dry aroma. Body was thinnish and the taste was an excess of wheat with some late addition hops and a mildly peppery finish. But while that may sound like it’s sniffing distinctiveness, it was really just estery as fuck and mostly watery.
Mash House Hefeweizen;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Pint at Tribeca Tavern. Ok aroma. Sweet, banana, clove. Hazy orange gold color, ok head, little to no lace. Sweet, spice, flavor. Medium body, smooth creamy mouthfeel, dry spiced finish. Better than I was expecting, easy to drink, nice bite of clove.
Mash House Hefeweizen;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Served from the tap with a cloudy lemon yellow color, but no head because of an overly-generous pour. The aroma is predominantly a dry, fruity sweetness. The flavor is not too bold but is likewise surprisingly pleasant, with dominant flavors of bananas, with additional notes of clove, yeast, and a hint of lemon. The mouthfeel is silky, smooth, and quite enjoyable. Overall, although not powerfully flavorful, this selection is tasty and drinkable.
Mash House Hefeweizen;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Very nice traditional wheat look. It is a very hazy yellow. It has a good almost citrus smell. A little bitter for a wheat.

Mash House Stout;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Stout;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Draft, Raleigh. Better than the porter to me, a nicely dry session stout that goes well with the cow and bison slung here. Handsome dark pour with a fluffy tan head. It still could use a slightly more emboldened body, but the mouthfeel is full and a nice combination of creamy and chalky. Good balance of smooth chocolate and dry roasted malts with an understated hop presence.
Mash House Stout;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Stout;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Tribeca Tavern in Cary. Pours a very black color with red highlights and a nice foamy tan head. This stout has clearly evident chocolate, coffee, and licorice aromas. The mouthfeel is very creamy. Taste is lots of chocolate, coffee, licorice and oats with a slightly dry finish. Not a bad brew for a $3 tap special. Tasty.
Mash House Stout;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Stout;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Serving: Draft at the Twisted Fork in Raleigh. It pours pretty much pitch black with a creamy, tan head. Nice lacing left behind. The nose is very muted with slight roasted malt notes coming through. The taste is a bit weak and watery with over roasted malt, husk, and an odd dry finish. Not as much flavor as it should have. A light to medium body leading to a dry, roasty finish. It seems to be served on nitro which reallys seems to have blunted all aspects of this brew. Not good in a case where there probably wasn’t much to begin with. Skip this one.

Mash House Brown Porter;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Draft, Raleigh. Kind of a weird redundancy in the name. I found this to be a competent and fairly typical American porter, with a slight over-emphasis on roasted malts and a too-thin body to substantiate those bold flavors, along with the chocolate base. Decent enough but nothing I’d necessarily have again.

Mash House Irish Red;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Very sweet. Maybe too sweet. Lots of caramel, no hops, some more sugary malt flavors over power this one. They didn’t have a season due to the cost of hops, I’m wondering if they took out all hops in here because I tasted none. Lots of apple flavor.
Waterloo Claras Clara;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;"On tap at the Brewery. Always a pleasure to have had when the ""others"" were all drank up. I was saddened to see the building demolished on my last trip to Austin."
Waterloo Claras Clara;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;That the beer so near most lame was actually quite nice and extremely drinkable is a tribute to the first Texas Brewpub. If I could get another glass of it I would raise a toast to Billy Forrester.
Waterloo Claras Clara;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Waterloo Brewing Company;One of the best micro ales I've had. Very crisp and dry. ...............
Waterloo Eds Best Bitter;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Waterloo Brewing Company;Another great alternative at the Waterloo. Great example of an ESB with a great blend of the hops, malts and English yeasts in the flavor.
Waterloo Eds Best Bitter;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Waterloo Brewing Company;The working man’s bitter. Not my favorite there by far, but who’s going to add One Ton Stout and who here would know what I was talking about. Plenty of character, but even so if you just ask the bartender to add a quarter pint of the porter you’ll be in heaven. Which I suppose is the only place to find it anyway.
Waterloo Eds Best Bitter;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Waterloo Brewing Company;After great experiences with the O.Henry's and Clara's, Eds is somewhat of a letdown. Not bad but the bitter isn't that bitter. Kind of flat and a funk of vinegar. Overall not bad, but not up to usual Waterloo standards.
Waterloo O.Henrys Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Waterloo Brewing Company;Man I miss the Waterloo so much. The great thing about it was that I gladly switched beers with the seasons. O Henry was a wonderful cool weather beer - roasty, full, slightly licorice in the mouth. And just plain wonderful!
Waterloo O.Henrys Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Waterloo Brewing Company;Solid porter that was just way too easy to drink. Still, at that time I wasn’t a huge porter fan, so I would piss off my friends by having concoctions made with the bitter and IPA - little did they know how good they were.
Waterloo O.Henrys Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Waterloo Brewing Company;This beer was off the hook. So thick and dark you could survive on this for months at a time. Too bad this brewpub was ran out of town to make way for a lame ass Fox and Hound corporate bar.
Waterloo Hefe-Weizen;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Waterloo Brewing Company;A big yeasty, leaning towards the heavy side of a Hefeweizen. Based on the batch, sometimes lots of banana, sometimes lots of clove. Always lots of flavor.
Waterloo Hefe-Weizen;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Waterloo Brewing Company;Never realized the long lamented and dearly beloved Waterloo had any entries here.

Phantom Canyon Cascade Amber Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Phantom Canyon Brewing;Pretty standard amber. Very well balanced.

Phantom Canyon Cascade Amber Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Phantom Canyon Brewing;Tap, orange pour, white head, nose and taste are barnyard, funky, citrus, pretty decent I guess
Phantom Canyon Cascade Amber Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Phantom Canyon Brewing;Ported from one of my early BA reviews. Appearance: It’s, well, amber. Fairly clear and on the reddish side if you look at it facing a light source. A ring of bubbles around the glass, but otherwise no head. Smell: Sweet, almost like a kind of caramel candy. There’s a tiny bit of hops bitterness in the background when you really take a whiff, but malt dominates for sure. Taste: Semi-sweet, very much makes you think of something in the 50-60L crystal malt range. The malt flavor really dominates, with the hops subtly adding a slight bitterness and filling out the back end. Mouthfeel: If you close your eyes, ignore the flavor, and just think about texture, the first thing to come to mind is milk. Not quite as thick as cream, but fuller than a standard ale. Drinkability: Reasonable. I can certainly drink one of these, I could probably drink two, but the flavor is complex enough that I might need a break. Oddly enough, I feel like my break could be heavier as easily as it could be lighter.
Phantom Canyon Cascade Amber Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Phantom Canyon Brewing;"Clear red amber with sticky lacing.

Phantom Canyon Cascade Amber Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Phantom Canyon Brewing;This is a really good smooth amber with a fair amount of hops to please me.

Phantom Canyon Cascade Amber Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Phantom Canyon Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Poured a deep amber-brown color with a thin off-white head that left some light lacing. Sweet, toasty aroma with soft hints of caramel paired with some lightly piny, earthy hops. Brash, toasty entry dominates the flavor for the most part with some caramel trying to peak through before the moderately bitter, earthy hops take hold and linger into the finish. Moderate carbonation and average mouth feel. Overall, this beer is probably decent, I just really am not a fan of the abrasive toasted grain flavors found in this beer.

Phantom Canyon Phantom IPA;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;Phantom Canyon Brewing;Rated based on notes taken 21 Apr 2012 -- Took a trip up to the taproom from Pueblo. Pretty solid IPA. Could use a little more aroma and flavor hops, but so could a lot of commercial IPAs.
Phantom Canyon Phantom IPA;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;Phantom Canyon Brewing;Ported from BA. On cask at Phantom Canyon. Happy hour $2.50/pint! Appearance: A rusty copper full of haze. Nice creamy head that laced beautifully. Smell: Very floral, very hoppy. It wasn’t very cold, which really let the aromas spread like a perfume. spicy hops and caramel notes were noticeable while leaning back in my chair. Taste: The first thing to hit me was the lack of carbonation. It wasn’t a surprise, but not having the bubbles on the tip of my tongue makes everything else much clearer. A semi-sweet ginger kind of taste accompanies bready malts. Less hop taste than the smell led me to expect. It comes in after a bit though, the floral hops tastes kind of washing through your mouth. Mouthfeel: It feels thick to me, probably because of the low carbonation. Oily but still smooth, and not too much of an alcohol presence. Drinkability: Certainly easy to drink, and as I mentioned in the beginning, the happy hour prices are unbeatable as craft beers go.

Phantom Canyon Phantom IPA;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;Phantom Canyon Brewing;I think this is the best brew in the Phantom Canyon lineup.

Phantom Canyon Phantom IPA;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;Phantom Canyon Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Poured a clear copper color with a moderate off-white head that faded to a layer and left some spotty lacing. Moderate floral hoppy aroma with some light hints of pine and citrus paired with some faint caramel maltiness. Smooth, lightly sweet entry with some soft caramel paired with a moderate citrus fruitiness that transitions into a lightly bitter floral hoppiness that lingered into the finish along with soft undertones of pine. Soft carbonation and moderate mouth feel. Overall, it’s a decent beer, but it really seems more like a decent pale ale than an actual IPA.

Squatters Full Suspension Pale Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Bikes and beer go together like... what's an appropriately hipster cliche pairing? Avocados and toast? Yeah, let's go with that. Full Suspension is a copper-colored Pale Ale. It has an easy balance, a mellow body, and a low ABV. It has all of the components for ideal session drinking. Caramel flavors are strong. Hop flavors are light with a zesty orange peel character. Overall, it's quite pleasant. However, as my handle suggests, I am obsessed with hops. I like to have my hops at levels that most would consider to be idiotic, and this brew plays it smart and safe with them. In all, though, this is nice offering from the beer and bike mecca that is Utah.

Uinta Cutthroat Pale Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Uinta Brewing Company;First new you-intah in a bottle for a while. Nice bottle shape, pours great, no glugging.

Rock Art Vermont Maple Wheat Ale;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Rock Art Brewery;Bomber. Nose dark and syrupy, spicy forest hops with red malt, though the pour is a deep golden that only edges over into amber. Fizzes itself out, though, no head but consistent firm carbonation. There’s a really nice subtle berry character in the nose, as well, with wheat, slight alcohol, wood. Taste is dry and spicy, light bitterness with soothing wheat and bread that last all the way through. Getting some great secondary flavors from the syrup addition, though it does make the modest alcohol run a bit hot. Hops are earthy-spicy rather than citric and complement the mild wood well, sticky medium body a bit hard and unwelcoming. An interesting thing to try once, and I really don’t dislike it at all, but I think I’d prefer it mixed with another liquid.

There are some notes of dried fruits. The palate is a thin, fizzy and the finish short. They need up the intensity on this one. There is not enough substance here, even for a traditionally mild style.

Medium-bodied; Strong pungent raisins and nutmeg in the taste with malt and yeast rounding out the flavours. Aftertaste shows a bit more promise than most browns - this has some sugars and isn’t overly nutty.

Nice smoke. Taste : Roasted malt and bacon. Light caramel and light butterscotch. Finish sweet roasted malt and smoke. Overall : Nice smoke beer. More on the ""bacon"" side of the smoke spectrum than on the ""ham"" side. Nice smoke profile, nice roasted malt. I think it would have been better without the butterscotch notes."
Vermont Pub Smoked Porter;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Porter - Smoked;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Tap at Brewpub. Pours a nice very dark near black with a thin lasting head. Aroma is good smoked wood- maybe hickory or maple, earthy, nutty chocolate, toast, light burnt notes, some campfire. Flavor is toast, chocolate malts, nuts, wood, earth, mostly clean smoke, meaty, and as it warms there is a hint of fruitiness like raspberry. Pretty good.
Vermont Pub Smoked Porter;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Porter - Smoked;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Black pour. Sweet smoky hickory smell. Flavor is roasty, with smoke in the finish, and maybe a hint of tart dark fruit. Watery mouthfeel.
Vermont Pub Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;On tap at brewpub in Burlington, Vermont. Pours slightly translucent ruby with no head or lacing. Aroma: caramelized brown sugar, toffee, hazelnuts, pepper, malt vinegar. Flavor: all the above, ramped up. Mouthfeel: full-bodied, rich, somewhat syrupy.
Vermont Pub Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;A very one note beer. It does that one note modestly well but I like a bit more nuance even in a sweeter style like Scotch Ale. The beer is sweet and rich and smoky. Mostly caramel or toffee and light smoke. No fruitiness or anything fun like that. It really sticks to you.
Vermont Pub Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a ruddy dark burnt orange brown color with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dies off. No lacing. The aroma starts off with a sweet caramel to toffee malt. Light roast. Some toast. Some peat. Subtle smoke. The flavor rides nicely between the sweetness and the smoke. Subtle earthy dryness levels into the aftertaste and slides into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable smooth semi-sticky smokey clinginess on my tongue. Overall, pretty good scotch ale or is this supposed to be a Scottish ale, that smoke and peatiness, well, makes me wonder.
Vermont Pub Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Deep brown pour, medium off-white head. No aroma, but delicious sweet toffee malt flavor. Very full body!
Vermont Pub Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Enjoyed at the brewpub. Pours a dark copper-brown colour. Plastic nose with light malt. No burning mouthfeel, just a mild warming. Slightly bitter taste with a little more fruit notes than the chemical feel. Not really well-balanced and less sweet than most wee heavy brews I have had. Not really enjoying the weird feel. Does get a little better with time, but still.
Phantom Canyon Old Man Winter Barleywine;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phantom Canyon Brewing;(2008) I had this brew only once and it’s been a few years, but from what I remember, this brew was very tasty with a nice aroma. They only serve this beer in the winter season, and it is worth the wait. I have a friend who literally does wait all year for this brew to come out. I recommend this one to barleywine fans.
Phantom Canyon Old Man Winter Barleywine;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phantom Canyon Brewing;red gold color with the same off white head as the other beers. Sweet aroma with faint hops. Sweet but not cloying. Faint caramel malt and a hint of hops.

Phantom Canyon Old Man Winter Barleywine;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phantom Canyon Brewing;[Colorado Road Trip – 2006] A nice deep brown color with no head. This was there 2005 barley wine. This had a huge flavor and was complex and nice to drink. This had a great orange spice that also lingers in the aroma. Good Stuff!!!
Phantom Canyon Old Man Winter Barleywine;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phantom Canyon Brewing;Draught at brewery. Pours mahagony with a medium creamy light tan head, lasting with spotty lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel and maple malt (cookie, meal), yeast (dough), floral hops and alcohol with some light chocolate.

Phantom Canyon Old Man Winter Barleywine;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phantom Canyon Brewing;A very fine beer for socializing, a very poor beer for drinking, the Phantom Canyon barley wine tastes like it was meant to be had in the brewpub of its birth. The upstairs alcove above the restaurant is a fairly classy place to go on a Friday night out in Colorado Springs, with a low key atmosphere and an emphasis on relaxing drinking, as opposed to the typical downtown nightclub body gyrating. This calm little beer is a deep, saturnine brown with a steadfast but flat head on the top. Served in a tulip glass, I picked out a satisfying blend of aromas consisting of molasses, brown sugar and some malts parts. The taste was a little strange, starting with a semi-sweet sprinkle, and then curving back in texture towards a Barleywine hops bitterness. A good studious beer, but not something I would enjoy outside the appropriate confines of a studious environment. One might say that it’s the beer’s astringency and general lack of complexity that traps it inside the calm drinker’s desire for a sipping beer.
Phantom Canyon Old Man Winter Barleywine;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phantom Canyon Brewing;"Dark brown and inviting. Nose has a fresh, molasses-like sweetness; doesn't seem to come through as much in the flavor. Slightly chewy, watery, and syrupy all at the same time. Low carbonation level. Only a slight bitterness up front, some more with time in the finish. Not entirely bad, but doesn't seem to have a whole lot of personality."
Phantom Canyon Old Man Winter Barleywine;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phantom Canyon Brewing;Draught. Body is dark orange-brown. Aroma is heavily hoppy (grapefruit, resin, pine), lightly yeasty (dough). Flavor is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Finish is moderately acidic, heavily bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Good example of what unbalanced means.
Atlanta Beer Garten Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Atlanta Beer Garten Brewery;Light auburn coloring, with a small off white head. Decent enough on the palate, balanced maltiness with not much of a hop presence outside of the nose. Just a sweet bready maltiness throughout.

Atlanta Beer Garten Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Atlanta Beer Garten Brewery;An average beer on the world scale, but probably the best one at the BeerGarten. It is a traditional Alt, but nothing stands out. Points for brewing to style though.
Atlanta Beer Garten Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Atlanta Beer Garten Brewery;Can't give this one very high marks. Was almost difficult to swallow. Was told by the waiter that this was a brown ale, almost like Newcastle....not!
Affligem Tripel;Opwijk, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);330ml glass bottle from Carrefour, Lavapies, Madrid. Cost €1.86 with a best before date of 21/08/2021. Served having been out of refrigeration for 30 minutes into a goblet. The beer pours a rich burnt orange colour. Cloudy with lots of visible carbonation. A big three finger head, airy with lots of big bubbles. Slow to dissipate. The aroma is a little limited when compared to the upper echelons of the style. Banana, spice, coriander, yeast, sugar. Everything is present but not in the volumes I expected. The taste is somewhat redeeming for the aroma. That nice tripel balance exists, with a touch of bitterness. The coriander is at the forefront. Yeast, sugar, white grapes and some alcohol. Tasty. Forgettable in the mouth. A light aftertaste of hop and yeast. A good beer with some shortcomings. Great taste but nothing remember in the mouth or on the nose. If Westmalle and Karmeliet are Champions League level beers. This is Europa League.
Affligem Tripel;Opwijk, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Bottle at vaudeville brasserie in Ghent. Clear amber. Tiny head. Caramel and bread aroma. Sweet. Very little like what’s expected from a tripel. Medium bodied and pretty smooth.
Affligem Tripel;Opwijk, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Pours a clear amber with high carbonation, good lacing and a thin head after the initial burst of activity. Aroma is Affligem Blonde on steroids. Floral, herbal, green apple, caramel, coriander and marmalade. Taste is very sweet with a little bitterness in a boozy long finish. Definitely a sipper. Powerful stuff.
Affligem Tripel;Opwijk, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Keg at taphuys. Pours clear golden, nose is caramel, nutty, raisin, stewed fruit, taste is sweet, fruity, caramel, vanilla. 3.5
Affligem Tripel;Opwijk, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Quick caveat: This 750 ml bottle was dated 03-06-2013 and stored in a dark basement for the past six years, so I'm not writing about a fresh-from-the-brewery beer. That said, the cork gave a nice pop and the carbonation was still good despite the years. The nose was apple cider, followed by yeast and plums. Tasted a smooth sweetness with hardly a hop in view. Really a delight.
Affligem Tripel;Opwijk, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);The beer has got a deep golden color with a steady head and smooth body. Aroma of Belgian yeast and flowers. Taste of roasted barley, Belgian yeast, bread, cookies, flowers. Smooth finish.

Pours hazy chestnut with a thick, long-lasting fluffy beige head, heavy lacing and persistent fast-rising carbonation. Light yeasty raisin, spice and caramel aromas. In the mouth, thick frothy texture throughout, some sweetness, alcohol presence, slight dryness, medium bitterness - relatively high for the style, flavours of caramel, boiled raisins and cereal before a long finish. Quite bitter for a Dubbel but that keeps it fresh and drinkable.
Affligem Dubbel - Double;Opwijk, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Drinking one at the North Sea Jazz in Rotterdam. The beer has a dark amber tone with a fast dissipating head. Smell of cocoa and a rather watery taste for a dubbel. Banana aftertaste. I'm disappointed.

Affligem Noël (Christmas Ale);Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);1/12/19. 750mL bottle from B$. B$ is an old friend of mine who randomly asked if I wanted some old beers he never drank. This is a 2013 bottle and boy was I surprised to see I had never rated this! So fun to have my first rate of this (I guess) be a 2013. Deep amber pour with a frothy khaki head that fades. Rich deep aroma, dark fruits, toffee, candi sugar, Belgian esters, Mrs. Owl swears tons of coconut. Age has diminished the spices which is okay by me. Rich flavor, enters sweet, fig newtons, raisins, candi sugar, toffee, caramel, but it’s balanced by a bit of bitterness, spice, phenolics, biscuit and toast. This has aged well. Super random rating for me!
Affligem Noël (Christmas Ale);Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Clear light brown with thick white head - frothy creamy. Good pleasant aroma. Not particularly spicy as expected for a Christmas beer - but quite drinkable.

Aroma: rich smells of dark dried fruits, light spices, and fruit cake. Flavor: follows the aroma. Very well balanced and harmonious mix of flavors including dates and raisins. Slightly sweet but with a lightly bitter finish. Feel: full body with rather lively carbonation.

Atlanta Beer Garten Helgas HefeWeizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Atlanta Beer Garten Brewery;Quite a disappointment. Aroma virtually nonexistent, barely the cloudy appearance, no head, no lacing, little flavor (maybe the little flavor was from the lemon?). The Beergarten can and does do MUCH better brews.

Vervifontaine Villers Animation Ambre;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;This thing hissed at me when I cracked open the cap. It then proceeded to foam up a bit for not being touched while I let it sit. Once I finally poured it, it had a darker amber color with not too much head. Aroma was somewhat unusual, more of a grassy smell indeed, in tangent to the floral sweet smell typical of a belgian. Flavor was mostly carmelish with a slight hop aftertaste. Could have been better, but could have been a lot worse. I didnt seem to encounter any poor bottling abnormalities, like the others, except for the little that was already stated.
Vervifontaine Villers Animation Ambre;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;Scum on the bottle cap and this was not very tightly sealed at the cap. Alright and that was about it
Vervifontaine Villers Animation Ambre;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;Scum in the neck and on the cap. It fizzed incessantly for ten minutes or so. Even with one glass poured and at less than 40°F it continued to flow out the neck like lava. Some nice grassy aromas as well as carmel hues. There were some very mild rancid flavors. The body was heavier than medium and slightly slick.
Vervifontaine Villers Animation Blonde;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;Unknown vintage. Pours mudy, amberblonde. Small white head.

Vervifontaine Villers Animation Blonde;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;Unfortunately, this brewery has disapeared and all the beers retired. This particular beer had been sitting on the shelf for years, with a label specifically for the US market. Its yeast had mellow Initial barnyard odour that after a half hour and room temperature was a funky walnut saison. Metallic in finish, and alcohol there. Seems like it was conditioned for at least 3 years. Very drinkable and nice bubbly appearance.
Vervifontaine Villers Animation Blonde;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;The smell of this is somewhat sweet, yet still has the a slightly metalic smell to it. Flavor is, however, more than generous in its overall drinkability. It isnt complex like other are, but tends to be a 'safer' belgian.
Vervifontaine Villers Animation Blonde;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;I just couldn't get too excited about this one - Maybe it was the crusty filth under the cap or the weird looking stuff left in the bottle. (I notice that others had similar bottles) That had to influence my taste buds somewhat - the others at the table got a lot more out of it. Thick malts were on the bland side, some bready notes and a bit of citrus lemon. Finish actually had some hops, but they were too metallic for me.
Vervifontaine Villers Animation Blonde;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;it's lemony fresh... a cloudy golden beer with lovely little bubbles that dance on the top of the liquid. nice aroma which is followed by a citrus malt, a little bitterness creeps up on you towards the end with a nice aftertaste.
Vervifontaine Villers Animation Blonde;Jalhay-Vervifontaine, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Vervifontaine;25.4 oz. bottle Cute packaging helps justify the steep price, as does the explosive bouquet of lemons, and, well lemons! Which generally overwhelms you as you stick your nose into the glass... Rather nice cloudy blondness in the glass, a sudsy, fine-grained head. Assertive citrus flavors and fragrances are everywhere, distracting from the mild, lightly sour, underlying bitterness that appears somewhere after the swallow. Blond. Very blond (it may help if you like that kind of thing).

Hilltop Rocket Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hilltop Brewing Company;"I couldn't see any hint of red in this beer but it was definatly a classic ale with a STRONG hoppiness followed by an ""in your face"" bitter ending."
Hilltop Rocket Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hilltop Brewing Company;Thus far this is their most impressive brew. Reddish copper color with little-to-no head. Think APA with an average, familiar Cascade nose. Mild malt backbone with above average piney hop flavor and a dry, hoppy finish. Not exactly bitter in the finish, but most definitely crisp. A very pleasant brew.
Hilltop Aviator IPA;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;IPA;Hilltop Brewing Company;"Proofread, you idiot! Sorry ladies and gentlemen. ORIGINAL: This is a local brew made in house at a small brewpub in Virginia Beach, VA. It is a very hoppy IPA with no real cirtus overtones you typically get from Cascades hops. The hop aroma, flavor and bitterness (I estimate it at 60+ IBUs) overpower the maltiness, which is one reason I love IPA""s. A good beer overall, but not great. RE-RATE: They had this on the hamdpump last night. Nice and smooth with a decent off-white head on an amber colored beer. Not quite as hoppy as I remembered. Moderate floral aroma with no malt presence in the nose. Certainly not 60 IBUs worth of potent bitterness as I wrote in the original rating. Fairly typical American Style IPA with floral hop aromas and flavors completely overpowering the malt. I""m not as impressed with it on the 2nd go-round, although I did enjoy the qualities (creamier head, fuller body, 10 degrees F or so warmer) imparted by the handpump. Very drinkable, but not as good as my original rating suggested."

Hilltop Sunset Stout;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Stout;Hilltop Brewing Company;Pours nearly pitch black with a browned hue. The nose is sweetened coffee with some malt notes.

Hilltop Sunset Stout;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Stout;Hilltop Brewing Company;"I feel a little bad giving this beer it''s first rating and having it be a bad one.

Flavor was ""unfinished"". lacking something that I cannot seem to put a finger on. It almost feels chewy in your mouth, and they served it too cold."
Hilltop Beach Brown Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Hilltop Brewing Company;At Virginia Beer Festival. Brown color. Very malty aroma, with a very malty flavor. Nice nutty flavor, with some coffee in the background.
Hilltop Beach Brown Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Hilltop Brewing Company;Cask. Pours medium brown. Very mild roast aroma. Flavor is a very mild maltiness. This is way to mild.
Hilltop Beach Brown Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Hilltop Brewing Company;Nice color, a dark amber, good brown ale taste but not very original nothing that knocked my socks off.
Hilltop Beach Brown Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Hilltop Brewing Company;Dark brown, little head. Slight cola aroma. Taste is a touch of coffee. Not bad, just unbelievably generic.
Hilltop Beach Brown Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Hilltop Brewing Company;Brown with a slightly reddened edge. Lightly roasted malt nose with weaker hops. More of the same on the tongue. Seemingly like a less skunky Newcastle Brown. Finished fine but left soemthing lacking in the body.
Hilltop Beach Brown Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Hilltop Brewing Company;No scent but good head and color. Subtle but evident nutty-wood flavors. Good example of style.
Hilltop Beach Brown Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Hilltop Brewing Company;"The brewpub is noe calling this simply ""nut brown ale."" I think this is a fairly new brew for them and they have not quite mastered it yet. Much darker than any brown alt that I have ever tried, and the aroma is abrupt and too hoppy IMO. Flavor is unbalanced wich might be because this batch was just tapped today, hop comes on quickly and as VA Homebrewer has mentioned thre is not enough malt base to match up. It is a good start and hopefully they will continue to work on the recipe."
Hilltop Beach Brown Ale;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Hilltop Brewing Company;Cola colored brew looks more like a porter or stout with little to no head and decent carbonation. Nose is a nice meld of citric/piney hops with roasted and chocolate malt. Body is a little thin and this beer could use a little more malt. Slight hop undertones tucked beneath a roasted malt flavor initially. Subsides into a mellow, lightly malty middle and a clean, moderately bitter finish. The relative lack of a malt backbone really hurts this beer, which is otherwise quite pleasant.
Hilltop Oktoberfest;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hilltop Brewing Company;"Draft at Hilltop. Copperish red with no head. Nose is malty and lightly hopped with light spiciness. Decent aroma. Taste is not as rich as the aroma would let on. Mild spice and malt with a fainter hop profile. Light caramel; it’s almost watery. Thin bodied with more malts and light spice during the finish. Average beer."
Hilltop Oktoberfest;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hilltop Brewing Company;"RE-RATE 10-13-03: Hmm, quite a difference between the re-rate and the original on this one. This year's is full bodied, malty, somewhat roasted, possesses a stronger than expected (not overdone) hop flavor and is very quaffable. Mild toasted nut flavors and aromas too. Caramel color with a nice, pillowy off-white head. Not sure how strictly it adheres to style, but it was darn enjoyable! As one buddy exclaimed - ""I don't know, it just tastes like autumn to me."" ORIGINAL 9-30-01: A very average Fest beer. Some malty aroma and flavor, but lacking in complexity and a hearty mouthfeel. Very clean and somewhat sweet. Copper color with minimal head"

Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Nothing special about this one, I actually thought it could have easily been replaced by a Budweiser. Blame it on the other beer I was trying at the tavern but this was least favorite out of the 5 they gave me.
Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);A big ole glass of Meh! Pours light yellow without a lot of aroma. Slightly oily mouthfeel. Not a lot of taste. Can I stop writing now?
Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);This was the best on tap at the time, unique early notes of spices, and finishes fine. A little thin in flavor but that was atrend for all
Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Poured a pale golden color that was a bit cloudy with some decent white head. The wheat addition ends up overpowering this beer and drowns out any hop profile that may be there. Gives a bit of spicy aroma and has a decent body.
Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Clear golden color, perhaps just the tiniest bit cloudy, but very light. A good wheat beer taste but a bit on the thin/weak side. There are better ones out there, this one is good but not great.
Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);This was brought to the beach in a growler. The color was light and the flavor was thin. It just wasn’t the beach of the beach. The Marzhon lager was far superior. The growler is an excellent way to enjoy beer. There is some lemon flavor. I am just not a big fan of wheat beers. The beach was super!!!!
Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);"Barking Frog is a domestic version of a Kolsh styled beer, and its a good one. Coming in a little high in abv at 5.5%, and a bit bolder in flavor than real kolsch, this beer pours to a slightly hazy, pale blonde color, with a nice bubbly white head that faded, and a moderate, to soft amount of carbonation. The nose was very delicate with some subtle jammy/fruity estery aromas, a touch of pale malt aroma, and just a hint of sulfur. The palate was soft, with some nice subtle pale malt flavors paired with some jammy estery fruit flavors. Barking Frog ale finishes with more delicate pale malt and estery fruit up front, and ends with a pleasing, slightly grassy hop bitterness. This was a well done domestic version of Kolsh, a delicate, fruity ale that is a specialty beer only found in and around Koln(Cologne) Germany. A little ""big"" for the style, but a tasty, drinkable beer. This is perfect beer to sit and relax with over some good conversation"
Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Lawnmower beer! Well-balanced with hints of butterscotch, citrus fruit and straw in the aroma and flavor. Light, refreshing and fizzy. Too watery, though. Not much to it.
Sweetwater Tavern Barking Frog Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);"Cask. Translucent gold. Zero head. Nose a bit sour, not much there. Horrid palate, desperately needs carbonation. Bit of spice, a little banana, but not a whole lot going on. If ever a beer stood up and screamed ""DO NOT SERVE ME AS A CASK BEER"" this is it."

Honestly it has a weird taste to it, can’t figure out what it is. Dry flavor. Taste linkers on the palate which for this beer isn’t good. Not much hops bitterness for something labeled as a ""session IPA."" What I mostly taste I believe is malt, but it’s not sweet."
Sweetwater Tavern Gold Rush Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;IPA;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Slight cloud in appearance while orange in color. Attractive floral nose.

Sweetwater Tavern Gold Rush Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;IPA;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Draft at Merrifield location. Not sure how the pour looked as it was brought to my table, but it still retained a small white head when it arrived at the table. Body was medium-dark yellow.

Sweetwater Tavern Gold Rush Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;IPA;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);A pretty good IPA, has a nice hoppy bite. The hops aren’t so much flowery as they are piney and citrusy. The hops are painted on a solid malt canvas. I like this beer a lot and will probably buy more growlers of it.
Sweetwater Tavern Gold Rush Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;IPA;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Draft @ Merrifield. Chill hazed golden straw colored body with a white head. Nose of sharp pine cone hops, lemon zest and dry cracker pils malt. Flavor is sharply bitter but not pungent or dank at all, more like a sharp ESB with C-note hops. Medium body, very fresh, but with some malt-extract-like twang on the back. But otherwise fairly good and easy to drink, if a little simple overall.

Sweetwater Tavern Jackalope Canyon Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Reviewed from a recent trip to the Sterling Sweetwater. The body was a hazy yellow as you would expect from a wheat beer with a slight layer of white foam covering it. Aroma was a bit yeasty with bananas and a bit of caramel malt. The flavor starts of a bit doughy with a touch of lemon to it before a bit of caramel sweetness is had. A fairly clean crisp taste that ends with a bit of a sweet wheaty after taste. Mouthfeel was medium to light with pretty good drinkability.

STLCL pours a nice copper color with a smallish head. The aroma has a solid lager base that is neither metallic nor full of mineral smells. There is a light fruit sweetness as well. The extremely cold beer has a surprising amount of hops and skirts on the idea of an IPL (India Pale Lager :) The body is medium-to-heavy and a little gritty. The finish has a nice peppery quality.
Sweetwater Tavern Last Chance Lager;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);A middle of the road lager. Kinda dull really.

Sweetwater Tavern Crazy Jackass Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Placed this under the Roggenbier category, as that’s where this is listed for the Sweetwater Tavern - Centreville location. Tasted more like a Rye Beer / Hefeweizen blend, but I’ll stick with consistency here. A: Poured a somewhat-cloudy copper with a nice white head and a good amount of lacing as it went down. S: Definitely spicy rye character alongside some pretty characteristic German yeastiness--definite notes of banana alongside a little bit of clove. T: Rye spice and loads of banana flavor. Some sweet malt in the background. M: Fairly dry with a medium body. Good carbonation. D: Excellent drinkability. Good all-around complexity with a nice smoothness coming from the yeast. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 03-04-2010

Appearance: Almost black with ruby highlights and a creamy, off-white head. Pretty good head retention and nice lacing left behind. Aroma: Light nose with notes of roasted malt and light caramel.

Pours to slightly hazy, deep golden color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a good carbonation.

The palate is firm, with lots of good, crisp, pale and grainy malt flavor, on a smooth, clean, body. This beer finishes with more good, crisp, pale malt flavor up front, then ends with some good herbal hop bittereness, that balances and drys the beer out. Well done domestic example of maibock. At 7.7% abv it is a the kind of beer that could sneak up on you in hurry. Works well with a number of dishes on Sweetwater’s menu, and a nice beer to sip and relax with a the bar.

Sweetwater Tavern Happy Trails Christmas Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Aroma of M&Ms, peanut butter, and pencil shavings, likely from the horrid rim job to which the poor glass was subjected. Aside from said rim job, the beer is a relatively clear amber, with random particulate from the garbage clinging from the rim occasionally falling into the beer and sinking to their demise at the bottom, no head but a slurry of flotsam, again originating from the disaster on the rim. Pumpkin? Traces of spices. Someone tell me they didn’t try to just dress up the fall’s unsold pumpkin beer in wintry clothes. Medium body, easy carbonation. Not infected.

Sweetwater Tavern Happy Trails Christmas Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Holy crap this was bad....and that’s saying something because I’m a huge fan of Sweetwater’s beers. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too sweet this year. I think this year’s version is a completely different beer than last year because I drank two growlers of the previous one but couldn’t even finish half a beer of the ’07 version. Aroma is very sweet, taste is the same, but too sweet in a cough-syrup way. Tasted like cherry cough syrup mixed with some lemon and spices. Not good - bring on the Imperial Stout already!
Sweetwater Tavern Happy Trails Christmas Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Tap at Merrifield location. Absolutely intriguing beer to say the least. When the beer is served the pint glass is covered in a candy/cookie layer. Aroma is full of spice notes and a detectable amount of bubble gum. Flavor is sweet, and not just due to the crumble on the rim of the glass. The beer does have a nice malt and hop balance, and just the right amount of carbonation. I’d say that this beer is better as a desert, and I couldn’t see myself getting more than one of these at a time, but I certainly wouldn’t mind having this one again before it’s gone.
Sweetwater Tavern Happy Trails Christmas Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Draught at Centreville. Pint glass rimmed with some sort of cookie/candy crumble. Medium amber body and fading sudsy white head. Wild potpourri aroma with mulling spice impressions, a solid note of cardomom, and chocolate and mint notes. Flavor has toasty crystal malts and notable spice character. My interpretation is that this is basically a spiced amber ale. I wish Sweetwater Tavern would balance the obvious commercial interests with a little more craft.

Sweetwater Tavern Chipotle Porter;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Porter;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);first things first. This is not a Porter. I can see through it. This more akin to a brown ale. Some slightly malty notes on the nose. Pours amber that you can see through with very little head that dissipates quickly. A bit of the chipotle can be tasted on the finish. Not bad but it’s no porter.
Sweetwater Tavern Chipotle Porter;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Porter;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Tap - pours a dark red with a finger of head. Not getting a lot of aroma, a little malt maybe? Taste is overpowered by the bit of the chipotle. It learns bitter, but my taste buds are now ruined. Palate is creamy. Overall if they tame the gimmicky chipotle it might not be half bad.

Appearance: Deep brown color with a small, smooth, off-white head. Aroma: Light nose with notes of coffee, caramel, and a touch of smoke. Flavor: Roasty bitterness, a bit of smoke, and not much else.

Sweetwater Tavern Road Kill Barleywine Style Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Turns out someone had already paid for this at the bar for me, which is good, because I wouldn’t have enjoyed paying for this. Has the proper cranberry-brown look, with a lemony yellow head that lasts for a very long time. Smells of severely burnt sugars, dates, cherries, and banana esters. Taste is uneven, off-balanced for a barleywine. Doesn’t seem refined. Flavors all over the palate, don’t line up. Suffers from an out of place pine hops. Aftertaste is pure sappy sweet pinecone and pine needles. The alcohol is way too high for a beer with this many flaws.

Smells a bit starchy, not unlike boiled white rice. Definitely a bit floral in there as well. Rich, tingly attack, lots of corduroy-soft body. Light, crisp, and drinkable for having such an assertively-bodied attack. Grassy and somewhat floral mid-palate. Clean finish. Awesome."

Light amber body with a near headless top. Nose is very citrus and grassy. Increadibly flavourful and bitter. States ""more malt"" but this is pleasently over-hopped.

Elysian Cyclops Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);"12oz bottle, 2011 vintage, from Roasthouse in Frederick, MD. Labeled 9.9%. Shared with Caterwaul and Andrew K. Clear orange red color, with lots of chunks of yeast inside. Andrew got the last pour, with a big ol’ gross chunk of yeast. ""It’s ok... I’ll drink around it,"" he says. His glass looks very gross-looking. Minimal off-white head, couple dots of lace. Big caramel sweet malty aroma in the nose. Big sweet taste, light alcohol warmth and and sweetness in the finish. Spicy taste. Some notes of oxidization. Caramel, toasty malts in the flavor. Syrupy sweet. Hop notes are almost completely gone, nothing really good from the hops left here, just bitterness. Maybe a hint of citrus. Bigger body. Smooth, kind of slick, lighter carbonation. Slick finish. I’m finding that I’m typically not a fan of aged barley wines at all. It’s OK now, but I would have much preferred to try this fresh. Bartender was very eager to sell it to me, though. He seemed genuinely excited. Andrew K. says he thinks it smells kind of like sour cream, I get some of that. Glad my friends were here to help me with this, I would not have been able to finish it on my own. Just not my style. ""Not bad, but no Bigfoot,"" my friends say."

Nothing all that special about this one.
Ice Harbor Columbia Kölsch Brand Ale;Kennewick, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Ice Harbor Brewing Company;Generally only consumed by non-beer drinkers. Ice Harbor characteristically serves a full bodied beer, the Kolsch is bland and boring. Generally I recommend the Lighthouse Lager over the Kolsch to someone who isn’t a beer nut, as the Lager at least has some of the body and hoppy-ness that characterizes most IH beers.
Ice Harbor Columbia Kölsch Brand Ale;Kennewick, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Ice Harbor Brewing Company;"Bottle, thanks to Rachel for bringing this back to Alberta for me. Pours clear yellow, with a 1.5-finger white head on it, medium persistence, but gradually it reduces to a ring. Lacing is average to slightly above. Nose is sweet malt and yeast, faintly ""sourdoughy"", which suggests the Kolsch-influence, perhaps? Flavours are clean and bright, no sign of adjunct here, the ""gunsmoke"" finish I normally associate with Kolsch was notably absent at fridge temperature, but gradually emerge as the beer opened up and warmed. Not my favorite Kolsch, needs to be somewhat more assertive, but noticeably different from the Pale Lager crowd. Decent, if unremarkable."
Ice Harbor Columbia Kölsch Brand Ale;Kennewick, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Ice Harbor Brewing Company;My second Ice Harbor beer I had the Columbia Kolsch Ale was a major let down after my first beer with this brewery.

Ice Harbor Columbia Kölsch Brand Ale;Kennewick, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Ice Harbor Brewing Company;Not a style I’m really into, but this was more enjoyable then the average Kolsch you find in the US since it had some extra hopping going on. Rather than being bland and balanced this had a more assertive citrus hop presence of the soft bready malts. None of that grape yeast flavor garbage going on, not just something brewed to appease the macro crowd, pretty solid.

Ice Harbor Runaway Red Ale;Kennewick, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ice Harbor Brewing Company;Bottle. Brought back from Washington for me by my friend Rachel. Thanks Rachel! Pours a mildly hazy copper-red colour. Thin white head is surprisingly persistent, considering how little there was to start with. Like the Harvest Pale, this also laces amazingly well. Sharp-looking beer. Nose is big sweet malt, with the spicy hop notes playing a definite second fiddle here. Clean North American Yeast, light red-fruit from the malt, along with that non-distinct caramelly Crystal-malt aroma, hops are present, though indistinct, but not stale. Flavours are hoppier than I was expecting from the nose, I had anticipated an over-sweet, under-hopped Red, but this was not the case, nice spicy noble hop flavours underpin a sweet, but restrained malt character. A worthy thirst-quencher, though I was disappointed by the aroma.
Ice Harbor Runaway Red Ale;Kennewick, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ice Harbor Brewing Company;For a Red Ale I was expecting a light hoppiness and a bolder favor of malt to match the beautiful color of a red ale, but for a second time i was let down by Ice Harbor.

Flying Horse Royal Lager Beer;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;"650ml bottle at the Taj Mahal, Prescott, AZ.

Rattlesnake Mountain Oatmeal Stout;Richland, Washington, United States;Stout;Rattlesnake Mountain Brewing Company;"Portlandrunk and I shared the same pitcher, so you may have to take this with a grain of salt...but there was most definitely a serious vinegar thing going on here. Vinegar, molasses, and diesel - very thin and a terrible, terrible combonation. Let's not jump to conclusions though, this may be good most of the time, but for now all I could think of was the ""Rattlesnake"" bite - venomy."

Thin but determined white rim of mousse with decent legs. Grass and hay and cookie dough on the nose. Caramel and a bit of malt sugar on the mid-palate, along with repeats of the nose notes.

Twin Rivers Belgian Saison;Monroe, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Twin Rivers Brewing/Adam's Northwest Bistro;Luminous, highly carbonated bronzed body with a dense, frothy head. Highly herbal lemon verbena nose, perhaps with some oregano and other herbs. The body is similar, a thorough lemon verbena presence rounded out by oregano and Italian-leaning herbs. Sparkly body.

Twin Rivers Cream Stout;Monroe, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Twin Rivers Brewing/Adam's Northwest Bistro;Draft at the restaurant. Nitro. Pours opaque black with scantest of white heads. Very little nose and what’s there is primarily coffee. Body’s pretty shot from the nitro. A little bit of coffee and roast on the mid-palate and kind of a dribble of harshy resin on the finish. Too bad about the nitro but something tells me this probably wasn’t too awfully much in the first place.
Scuttlebutt Gale Force IPA;Everett, Washington, United States;IPA;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Hard to say with this one. It's better than the average IPA for sure, but sort of on the weaker side.....somewhat lacking malt and strength. On the other hand, it's really smooth, tastes great, and has some good bitter hop to it. Has the flavor of a good 6-7% West Coast IPA, even though it's closer to 5%. Could be the hoppiest 5% IPA that I've had. A little bit more malt here would make this in the top tier. Same price as Torpedo ($6.99-7.99/six-pack), so I may be alternating between the two for a while.

Scuttlebutt Gale Force IPA;Everett, Washington, United States;IPA;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;12 oz bottle pours cloudy goldenrod amber with a pillowy off-white head. Aroma is of biscuit, hay, orange juice. Taste is sweet, pith, pine. Extremely astringent finish seems pretty one dimensional. Creamy and anemic. I think this needs some serious food pairing to make it palatable.

Scuttlebutt Amber Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Scuttlebutt Amber Ale 5.1% An opaque amber-brown with a dense light beige head that lingers. It has a really nice toffee biscuit malt aroma with some peppery spicy hop notes. Medium bodied and surprisingly dry and fruity. The taste starts off malty sweet but then gets lots of raisins and stone fruits before finishing crisp and dry. A good beer to pair with lunch.

Loaded with honey, grains, and some definite toastiness, this beer is very typical as far as bocks go. The one definitive merit this beer has is in the drinkability department, although I’m not sure this is the biggest selling point a beer might have - especially a bock, which is usually a style filled with flavors of all kinds.

Great Dane Landmark Lite;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap in Madison, WI Circling back around to a couple of drafts that I've often passed over, I asked for a flight of Great Dane's four standby regulars. As expected none of them were spectacular. This light fallback might be a passable gateway for anyone who would otherwise drink a macro but could otherwise be skipped in favor of the seasonal taps. AROMA / APPEARANCE Lemon, wheat, and very cool citrus fade quickly from a mellow start to a memory. The light pale body looks unremarkable and plain enough that it fades into the background. FLAVOR / PALATE A delicate blend of citrus and mild hops cool the air with a blend of honey, almonds, and hay. The white wine finish fades to a mild tickling sensation. There are far worse pale lagers out there but this does not feel like one worth revisiting again.

Great Dane Old Glory American Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap in Fitchburg, WI The final entry in the evening flight contained the last of the Dane's regular taps. A fairly proficient pale ale, this particular pour follows the template of the rest.

Point Pale Ale (1996-2003);Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stevens Point Brewery;Mediocre beer from a mediocre brewery. Nothing particularly bad about this beer.

Point Pale Ale (1996-2003);Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stevens Point Brewery;Poured into an english pint glass. Appearance is a hazy copper with a frothy, creme head of foam that dissipates at a normal rate and leaves thick lacing. Aroma is like a musty grapefruit that has been rubbed with hops. The smell isn’t overbearing, just pleasantly present. Taste is less than stellar, faint hop presence with a grapefruit peel taste in the forefront that fades to a yeasty backbone. Earthy with a touch of fruitiness. I would say this one is okay at best.

Thanks to oetiii for keeping this one buried in his fridge for almost five years. Pours a clear pale golden brew with a fast dissolving white head that dissipates clean due to its long age. Aroma of light waffle batter with a hint of maple syrup and a touch of corn. Taste is light to medium bodied, with flavors of golden grain malt, a hint of maple syrup and brown sugar, and some citrus zest.

Point Maple Wheat;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Had this beer on 10/7/1999. Aroma is is very faint and there is no maple to it. Color is a bright gold with good carbonation and head. Starts with a light body that goes down bubbly. Finish is a light malt flavor that is backed but a faint maple taste. Its an ok brew but a bit too light all the way around.
Point Maple Wheat;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Bottle. Pale yellow. I don’t like wheat beers. I don’t like really sweet beers. You can guess how this will turn out. Aroma of moldy bread and pancakes. The first assault is from the sweet maple sugary taste, followed by the nasty wheat funk. You may like wheat, I don’t. Not the worst beer but a beer that is too sweet, heavy and bland and watery (I don’t know how you achieve that), and funky can’t get my admiration.
Point Maple Wheat;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;What a throw-back... pours cloudy golden yellow... typical pointski aroma with a light maple presence. Stronger maple in taste.

Point Maple Wheat;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;So I was up in the Steven's point area, and found out a friend I know up there had one of these in his fridge (mind you, this guy still has a pull tab Old Milwaukee unopened hiding in the back of his fridge). I was in heven, as it is one of the ONLY point beers I haven't rated. The bad thing is it hasn't been made for about a year, so it tasted somewhat old (somewhat being an understatement), but at least I was able to rate it. YEA!
Point Maple Wheat;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Light in body but the maple was sickeningly sweet...........................
Point Maple Wheat;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Gee, I think this stuff is pretty good. The maple flavoring is subtle but adds a nice touch to this otherwise average beer. I'm not big on flavored beers but this one tastes quite decent to me.

Aroma is grassy hops a hint of citrus, straw, sweet grain, and some light fruit notes. Flavor is light grainy malts, cereal, a little grass, and some fermenting grain.

Point Light;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Not a good light beer had a few because it was all that was left after the party
Point Light;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Bottle. Pointless light yellow color, pointless sweet malt aromas (maybe a touch of apple juice concentrate in the nose). Flavor is watery and… well… pointless. A little bit of a malt/grass/lemonade flavor, but wow! This isn’t offensive, but neither is tap water.
Point Light;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;"12oz bottle. Poured a light and slightly hazy straw color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas were almost no-existent; grains. Tastes of grains with some malty sweetness. Thin and watery."

Tyranena Stone Tepee Pale Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tyranena Brewing;Interesting sourness in a pale ale, but still plenty of hops. Taste is somewhat harmed by its mad effervescence.
Tyranena Stone Tepee Pale Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tyranena Brewing;Rated on 6-02-2010 - This bottled beer pours a medium sized fizzy white head with a short retention, transparent yellow body, fizzy carbonation, and spotty amounts of lacing. The aroma is malty, grassy, pine, and grapefruit hops. The taste is lightly bitter, malty and pine hops. The palate is tingly and thin. This beer is light-medium bodied. Overall, this beer is easy to drink, but lacks any WOW factor. This is a beer that I probably will not seek out again.
Tyranena Stone Tepee Pale Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tyranena Brewing;From a bottle. Medium golden color with a fairly thin white head. Fairly minimal carbonation. Bread, yeast, and a bit of fruit (I want to say almost tangerine) dominate the aroma. No real hop aromas to speak of. Has a bit more of a zing to it than I expected with a bit more earthiness and cloves coming through, followed by a nice dry, just slightly bitter finish that quickly has you reaching for your glass again. If you want to step away from hugely hopped beers this is a solid, classic pale ale.

The taste is a medium bitter and light sweet. The beer is dry and thin with a buzzy foam carbonation. The medium body contains roasted notes with light caramel and wood notes and a resin flavor that strengthens at the finish. The aftertaste is burnt with some citrus rind and/or wax notes that linger.

Tyranena Ancient Aztalan Brown Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at brewery. A light brown beer with a nice off-white head that holds up. No real aroma. Flavor of some faint malt that is overpowered by a odd chili flavor that I assume is from the hops. Really detracts from what otherwise seems to be a well made beer.

Not amazing, but a good beer that’s worth trying, especially on a cold day. I sampled this pint on draught at the Map Room in Chicago, Illinois on 14-November-2015 for US$5,00 for sixteen ounces."

Tyranena Fighting Finches Mai Bock;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Tyranena Brewing;"12oz bottle, courtesy of a trade from a while ago (Monger? SkyView? Ughsmash?). No clue. Thanks, though! Pours a bright, medium orange color; off-white head with decent lacing. A strong dose of sugar and red fruits in the aroma; sweet without being syrupy. Pleasant acidity and citrus at the front of the mouth; medium mouthfeel; maple syrup and candy sugar maltiness at the core, if slightly one-dimensional; this beer really succeeds from its liveliness in the mouth: carbonation and drinkability are excellent. Medium, tea-like malt and candy sugar finish."

Tyranena Fargo Brothers Hefeweizen;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Tyranena Brewing;"So, I normally would not order a Hefeweizen, but I watched many people get one while sitting at the brewery. I usually don’t like the ""fake"" banana taste I get from them. Anyway, Ordered one and was very happy with it. Came in a tall glass with about 3 inches of head, which is how it was supposed to be poured. Did have that banana aroma, but almost none in the taste. Nice wheat spice flavor. Very tasty. body was what seemed to me to be a much paler straw than most Hefes, still a pretty beer. Nice on a hot spring day."
Tyranena Fargo Brothers Hefeweizen;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Tyranena Brewing;Backlog rating on 8-04-2012. This draft beer at 800 Degrees Three Fires (Fort Wayne, IN) The appearance of this beer is a small white head that is mostly lasting, cloudy straw body, very little carbonation observed, and spotty amounts of lacing. The aroma is clove, wheat malt and banana. The flavor is clove sweet, wheat malt, and banana. The mouthfeel is light carbonation and bubbly. This beer is medium bodied.

Plenty of banana on the nose. A little bready and wheat taste and a lot of the typical hefe characteristics. Banana and cloves come to mind. Relatively easy to drink and a good fit for a summer day.

Tyranena Shantytown Doppelbock;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Tyranena Brewing;Thanks to Skyview.

Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pours orangish amber. Thick head with a thickish mouthfeel. Mild flavor, mostly of caramel and grass though there is a strangely sour character to this.
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;I’m stunned by the high ratings of this goop. Dark orange pour with bubble bath foam that never dies but doesn’t look too good. Very spicy nose, almost smells like a 1970’s aftershave lotion. Flavors of wood, spice, and mens cologne. This slop is really bizarre, and really, REALLY bad. I couldn’t finish the bottle. Blech!!
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Another Viking beer that turns to all foam when it hits the glassAroma of this mess isn’t bad Munich malt and some spicey hop,but for some reason ,this thing wants to foam like raging bubble bath,some decent malt grain flavoring,once you wait for foam to settle,but even straight from the bottle you get this over charged mess. This is about the third bottle from Viking purchased at this store that this has happened. Viking has some issues
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;coppery amber color with a white head. initial aroma of buttery caramel followed by a solvent-like aroma which kinda reminds me of fresh watermelon rinds. the flavor is more of the same... toss in some chocolate, grain and some burnt plastic notes. the solvent flavor dissipates as it sits but never disappears. on the plus side, the medium body is creamy and very soft... but not sudsy? this is weird and flawed. needs a re-rate.3/3/3/4/5/1.8
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Clear amber with a thin white head. Aroma of Munich malt, caramel and mild skunk. Taste of toasted Munich malt and a touch of caramel. Pretty bland stuff.
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Light golden pour. Had a biscuity aroma. Light sourness in the flavor with some light sweetness. Low hop character.
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12oz shorty bottle. Murky, dark orange-brown color. Mild sweet aroma. The taste is all malt, very sweet. with a minimal soapy hop balance. Low carbonation, rather dull mouthfeel. The medium dark malt and lager tastes are interesting enough, and the interplay between them makes for a pretty decent beer, but it just the mouthfeel is a little too subdued. I’m sure this is much better on tap fresh.
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pours a deep amber color with a very smallish head. Aroma is very sweet with caramel and sugary bubblegum. Flavor is really more of the same. Very thick mouthfeel, medium carbonation. This would have been a drain pour but my wife opted to finish it. I doubt I will try any more Viking beers.
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;This beer pours a rich amber color with very little head and its appearance was not very reassuring as it did not promise me a very pleasant beer experience in my near future. Quite syrupy looking. Aroma was caramel and copper. Flavor is so carmel-y as to be cereal-y with some other off notes I could not quite identify. Mouthfeel is tremendously (too) thick. Struck me as being quite like a bock I wouldn’t like. I would not recommend this beer, which I bought at Three Cellars in Franklin, WI.
Viking Brewing Vienna Woods;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottled. A hazy amber beer with a lazing light tan head. The aroma is sweet malty combined with fruity notes. The flavor is sweet combined with an acidity and primary notes of over ripe fruits.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. As soon as I cracked the cap open, the foam started overflowing. Poured it into a glass and the foam party continued. Foamy pale yellow color, slightly hazy. Bittering hops and pilsener yeast are at the forefront. Has the typical Viking soft water roundness. Pretty straight forward pilsener, nothing too amazing, but not bad at all.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle care of Arg0: Gold color, light head and lacing. Nose of light malt and grassy hops, vegetal. The flavor is hoppy, nice citrusy floral malts but thin and musty. Eh.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Picked up a four-pack at Cellar’s Wine & Spirits in Roseville, MN. Pours a semi-hazy orange amber brew with a thick, lumpy white head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of multi-grain malt, orange zest, and something reminding me of Tang Orange powder. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with a citrusy orange flavor that hides the multi-grain malt. Finish is slightly acidic, mild bitterness with an orange peel aftertaste.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;(12oz bottle) Lightly hazed straw body with small off-white head. Aroma is mild, medium sweet, cereal, some orange. Taste is medium sweet, orange, some herbal. Light-medium body, some duskiness. Seems a bit low in bitterness for the style.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Poured a clear golden color. Head was white and bubbly with good retention and some lacing. Smells and tastes of skunky European hops and husky grain with a strange adhesive note (kind of like tape?). Flavor is similar and also uninspiring. Dry and a bit acidic on the tongue. Metallic note at the end detracts somewhat.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12oz bottle, no date. Pours a hazy golden with a one and a half finger off-white head. Aroma of new plastic, grassy hops, and a bit of grain. Flavor has the addition of an off sour tang and little to no bitterness--the plastic wasn’t there, but the grassy hops were light and not very apparent. Light body with little carbonation. And this one sucked--hopefully the other two Viking brews are better than this.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Cloudy orange, nice dense head. toasty, buttery aroma, and the butter smell is particularly pleasent. Grainy, rye-ish flavor and some more butter, but not as much as the smell would indicate. Finishes with a mellow piney hop bite. Some fruit flavors emerge as it warms. Thansk to JK for the trade.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Semi-translucent and buffed gold in color with a creamy, grayish tan head retaining like a thin sponge, leaving sticky, retracting lace. Clean, cottony and velvety aroma. Some banana sourdough crust cuts in as the aromatic secondary, along with linen sheets, broadcloth and gardenia fields to show promise. Lemony biscuits melt away the flavor, as if their doughy innards were pulled out prematurely. Carbonation’s severely lacking and there’s a wild mushroom mustiness to it as well. Acidic keel is kept honest by the toasty corn behind it, but the bitterness levels can’t even come close to hitting the style’s standard. Lick the inside of a cream corn can and you’ll find yourself at the finish. When paired with the moldy, stale croissants, there’s no way this one can stop dovetailing straight to hell.
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12oz bottlePours slightly hazy straw gold with medium white head that quickly dissipates. Grassy, hoppy and surprisingly fruity nose for a Saaz-only-hopped beer. Flavor is straight-forward pilsner: Clean, medium bitter, moderately hop-spicy, hint of fruitiness (though not as much as the nose suggests) and a touch of malt sweetness to rein it in. Flavor unfortunately a bit weak. Lively, tingly mouthfeel. Not great, not bad, could have scored a few tenths higher with more aroma and flavor intensity. But at least it’s a Viking beer with carbonation and no infection. Maybe they’re back on the right track?
Viking Brewing Sylvan Springs Bohemian Pilsner;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Valkyrie Brewing Company;slightly more hazy, and paler than the blonde northern pilsner. somewhat cardboardy with light notes of diacetyl, which i don’t think are unpleasant. flavor is nice and Saazy! flowery and spicy and not too shabby...the bitter finish lasts a couple seconds...again, not bad.
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Not a very good pilsner, it’s surprisingly malty with a hint of citrus that sticks to the back of your throat. Would not recommend.
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;orange gold shade of yellow with a few bubbles for a head. smells really grainy... watered down wort... and it has some strange stuff going on... orange, florals, honey, straw, cooked caramel cream and soured butter. odd, but the whole nose is rather muted. there is a faint pils note in the flavor but it is a stretch... floral again, honey, iced tea and a very mild bitterness on the finish. some vanilla &#40or perhaps the butter again&#41 shows up in the aftertaste. medium bodied. almost sudsy carbonation... almost. crisp but not satisfying...5/3/5/3/11/2.7
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pour is a cloudy yellow with almost no head. Aroma is a barley there pale malt. Flavor is also some pale malts but hops are no where in the picture. Reminds me of a eastern euro lager. Nothing really good about this one as everything is just too bland.
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;"I am not sure exactly what makes a pilsner ""Northern"" but if it s cidery aroma than they nailed it. Flavor losses the cider notes and has a flat flavored (not carbonation, which could actually be stronger) pilsner flavor, stale white bread with some mineral at the end. Some faint, non-citric lemon as well in there. Not sure how old this bottle is but it was kept in the fridge of the store where I purchased it. 12oz bottle, Selin’s Grove anniversary goblet."
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Effervescent amber with a smallish white head that nonetheless leaves abundant lace. Faint aroma. Flavor is grassy hops and a lightly sweet oatmealy wort. Slight cider edge. Medium body, smooth palate.
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Light to medium golden pour. Light hop aroma with a little bit of fruit and hops in the finish. Smooth.
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12oz shorty bottle. Murky orange brown color...not really blonde. Sweet malty aroma. Light and watery, easy drinking. Faint citrus flavor and wheat/rye taste gives it a balanced crispness. Very minimal hop presence. Nothing great, but a decent session beer.
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Cloudy dark yellow with a thin white head that laces nicely. Aroma of toasted malt, grain and a mild touch of skunk. Taste of mild lemon, malt, light hops. Drinkable quaff with a nice toasted hop finish.
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle. Light copper and cloudy. No head. Slight malt aroma. Flavor is very weak. It was also flat. Don’t know why it’s called a pilsner.
Viking Brewing Blonde;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pours an orangeish blonde colour with a thin weak head. Aroma is pleasent- pears and green apples. Taste is refreshing, clean and fruity. A tastey summertime brew I’d say.
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;22oz bottle(2009): pours a transparent deep golden with a thin stringy-lacing white head. Has a sweet floral honey nose with a touch of pale malt. Starts with light effervescence and honey sweetness with some light bitterness drying out toward the finish. Has good floral honey character but could use some more sweetness and body.
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Another cellar dweller that’s sat in the back of my fridge forever. Straw yellow with a thin white head that’s gone. Aroma of malt, oak, varnish and honey. Taste of malt, varnish, tannins, off-flavors, apples and mild honey. Yeah, I let this one sit too long.
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;22 oz 15th Anniversary bomber. Pours a clear effervescent champagne-like gold. It is crystal clear, i wonder if the only malt here was honey. The head is non existent , it looks super fizzy. It smells like straight up mead. Tons of honey, oxidized apple, sharp alcohol, and some light vinegar. It tastes very meady too. It has a huge honey and apple prescence, a bit of apple juice tang, alcohol, and tons of sugar. Im not getting any hops here. The mouthfeel is slightly cloying, really carbonated, and ultra ultra dry. This beer is over the top, it is a sipper, I dk how anyone could possibly finish a whole bomber of this alone, whew heavy duty. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 05-03-2010 01:34:30
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of furley from TBS. Very strange brew. Tastes like a white wine made out of corn. Slight bitterness up front, very sweet with a corn-honey taste in the middle, with literally no aftertaste. Not much carbonation after it sits for a minute or two, and no head on the pour. I wouldn’t buy it, but it’s not bad for a test drive.
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Poured into some challises it produced a extremely short lived white head that disappeared to nothing. The brew was a clear golden yellow with small bubbles of carbonation coming up quite regularly. It reminded me a little of a sparkling cider. The aromas were quite nice I got some sweet fruits (apples, pears) and honey. The flavor was nice and fruity as well with a splash of honey sweetness. it was light and bubbly on the tongue it really was refreshing to drink. I split the bomber but I could have easily finished it myself. I would have one of these in the fridge at all time if the brewery was closer
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pours a golden hue with no head. Aroma is light honey, fusol alchohol, light white grapes and some light charcoal. Harsh. Taste is...man...is this stuff 80 proof? Alcohol, light honey, touch of floral hops and some harsh chemical taste. Blech.
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Thanks for sharing, bro! Pours a crisp golden color with almost no head. Aroma is honey, green apple, and intense alcohol. Taste is not as alcohol-powered as it smells. Taste is slightly try, with some champagne characteristics and light honey and green apple, with a mellowed alcohol burn. Not as bad as it smells.
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;new bottle straight from the brewery... crystal clear golden straw colored with a short lived white head. initial blast of aged sherry wine... followed by a barrage of weird stuff i don’t normally associate with mead... green wood, orange peels, flowers, sour honey, dried aromatics/spices/eucalyptus/herbs and the topper... wet beaten up abalone mushrooms &#40ammonia&#41. the flavor is the same jumbled up mess as the aroma... along with lemony iced tea, a dry herbaceous finish and some bubblegum in the aftertaste. the whole thing is odd but not unpleasant... kinda like a mystery which needs to be solved. the body is medium to thin. after the prickly carbonation dies down the palate feels thin but really easy to put away. idk what to make of this. so... friggin... weird... 6/3/5/3/12/2.9
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Strong honey wine aroma. More wine like that beer. Light citrus aroma with a semi dry finish. Good.
Viking Brewing Honey Moon;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Valkyrie Brewing Company;"If only someone would make a dry sprarkling mead like a few buds have made. But - this poured a nice slight head that stayed and a bit of lace. Pleasant pale amber with a slight haze. Aroma is distinctly honey. Flavor is juicy pears with apple and green grapes,not so big in the honey. Way sweet though. Too sweet. In fact sweetness dominates. It’s not bad, but I just wish someone would do a dry sparking mead. ""nuff said."
Valkyrie Big Swede;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Thick black syrupy pour with a thin tan film of a head.

Valkyrie Big Swede;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle. Poured deep, deep garnet, with little head -- gorgeous! Aroma is milder than the taste, which is very rich and sugary. A raspberry molasses flavor with a little spice, but mostly sweet. Might be too thick and sweet, but it is an imperial stout and very decadent!
Valkyrie Big Swede;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Deep brown pour. Nose is a mess of brown sugar, molasses, candy, faint roast malt and mild soy. Flavor is much of the same - sugary molasses and brown sugar with some roast malt. Somewhat thin.
Valkyrie Big Swede;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Poured from 12oz bottle, pours black with a thin light brown head, the aroma is way sweet, tons of sugar and caramel and molasses, overkill almost, the flavor is much of the same, really sweet and rich with lots of molasses and some dark fruit, a little bit of spice too, thinner mouthfeel, really meh to me.
Valkyrie Big Swede;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Terrible, terrible beer. Tart and tangy, waaaay overspiced. Horrible beer that reminds me of a first-time homebrew.
Valkyrie Big Swede;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle - Big and dark with a thin tan head. Nose is burnt sugar, boozy warmth, molasses, and a weird dark malt/plastic mix. Taste is big and sweet, with brown sugar and molasses, bitter dark malt, a bit of roast, and some coffee grounds on the finish. Mouth coating in a weird filmy way, and lots of sugary sweetness throughout. Thick and slick, with minimal carbonation. Would have liked this beer 4 years ago, but not now. Gross.
Valkyrie Big Swede;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Valkyrie Brewing Company;This pours a dark brown/black color with very little head. The aroma is sweet with molasses, toffee, and caramel. The taste is heavy and sweet with coffee flavors. It starts thick and creamy and ends with a chalky, malt after taste.

Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;golden yellow with a few bubbles for a head and sporadic spots of foam. &#40no head yet there are little clingers?&#41 tart honey and green apple aroma similar to the honey moon barleywine... add in some lemon, grain and florals to make up the smell and taste. initially there is a weird industrial smell. but, that blows off and the second pour is far better. sharp texture and mouth feel from prickly carbonation is not unpleasant... kinda fun. 5/3/5/3/11/2.7
Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Tasted on draught: Pours a clear bright golden colour with little head. Aroma is of honey, flowers and peach. Taste is refreshing and clean, vibrant fruits- hint of lemon and pear. Honey again on the palate, not overdone, but not underdone (is that a word?) as well. At the Old Fashioned in Madison, apparently a brew that one of the bartenders helped make at the brewery in Dallas.
Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle. The beer pours to a hazy shiny bronze body with tons of champagne carbonation and a lasting creamy soapy white head. The flavor is sweet clover honey and toasted pale/specialty malt base. Honeysuckle. Better than I’d expect it to be. Some floral hops. The aroma is a sweetened corn malt and floral honey. The palate is malty and moderately carbonated. Sweet, lightly astringent, and decent.
Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Poured a slightly hazy medium orange color. Head was two fingers high and white with good retention. The aroma was strange. The malt, hops, and honey combined to create an adhesive-tape-like smell. You never want to smell adhesive tape in your glass. Somewhat tart on the tongue up front with carbonation on the higher end of the spectrum. Sour fruit flavors predominated in the middle, but there was a pleasant graham cracker and honey aftertaste.
Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pale amber color, slightly hazy. Massive foamy head. Sweet honey aroma. Flavor is mild hops, grainy malts and a hint of honey sweetness. Light bodied and fizzy. Very mild and inoffensive. Decent summer refresher.

Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;heavy carmel nose with faint honey character. Dark honey gold color. Highly carbonated finish. Honey and caramel, dry, with a variety of grain flavors.
Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to Skyview! The slow gusher poured medium orange with lots of sediment floating around in there.. nice cap of white head on top. Aroma was of sweet floral, honey, and grassy notes with underpinnings of caramel and some more honey. Flavor had quite nice usage of honey at the core paired with English toffee.. floral and grassy bitterness rolled outward, leaving grasses and honey at the finish. Lighter-bodied on the palate and a touch grainy.. felt pretty good. This exceeded expectations.
Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Picked up a four pack at The Coffee Grounds in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Pours a clear dark amber brew with a thick and lumpy off-white head that leaves behind an excellent lacing. Aroma of sweet roasted caramel malt, clover honey, with a touch of citrus zest. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with a honey toffee and citrus flavor. Finish is slightly sweet, with a toffe and grassy hop bitterness in the aftertaste. The finish taste has more toffee than the citrus flavor.
Viking Brewing Honey Pale Ale;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle. Clear amber body with a huge fluffy white head. Dulled orange rind and oatmeal cookie in the light aroma. Dissapointing flavor. There’s honey, orange sweetness, and sugar cookie up front but the flavor is marred by an strong papery astringency in the finish.
Viking Brewing J.S. Bock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;28-Jul-10 (12-oz bottle) Cellared a bit longer than it should, the beer pours orange-amber in color with a small, off-white head that settles to a wide ring, leaving no lace. Low-intensity aromas of pale malt and bread are followed on the palate by flavors of bready, slightly toasty malt, red apples, and a trace of grassy, tea-like hops far in the background. Light-medium in body, light-medium in carbonation, and somewhat dry in the finish. Pretty simple, straight forward, and easy to drink, but it’s aged better than expected.
Viking Brewing J.S. Bock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Good malty aroma. Sweet malt flavor with notes of caramel and light dark fruit. Low hops. Well blended.
Viking Brewing J.S. Bock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle. Pale orange color, strange lingering sediment that just floats around in the beer. Minimal head. Flavor is far away malt, just a tinge of hop bitterness. Medium smooth bodied. Once again, like every other Viking, the flavor is alright but it’s under-carbonated. Otherwise OK.

Viking Brewing J.S. Bock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pretty good stuff. Fairly thick and goes down smooooth. Certainly a carmel aspect there that is quite nice. Would drink this again
Viking Brewing J.S. Bock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Poured a medium and slightly hazy amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of grains, caramel, bready and lightly buttery. Tastes of butterscotch candy, caramel, and grainy.
Viking Brewing J.S. Bock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Clear gold/amber, small white head. Stale, old grains, doughy biscuits, a bit of vomit. Medium body, just smoother than balanced. Needs improvement.
Viking Brewing J.S. Bock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Poured a clear orange color. Head was two fingers high and off white with good retention and lacing. Smelled of sweet corn and malty caramel. Strangely enough, I also got an occasional whiff of strawberry yogurt. Slightly sweet and medium bodied with a soft mouth feel. Pleasant malty caramel flavor with the lightest hint of alcohol and a buttery note. Unusual aroma, but pretty tasty. It improved as I drained the glass.
Viking Brewing J.S. Bock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pours like honey, a deep amber with a fuly diminishing off-white head. The nose contains caramel malt, stale grains, raw doughy bread, mold, undefined fruit. Flavor is pretty bad, caramel, brown sugar, dough and light spice lingering. Fruit notes are unidentifiable. Finishes stale, moldy, caramel lingering with light pepper trailing. Mouthfeel is so boring it doesn’t warrant further description.
Viking Brewing Golden Meadow;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valkyrie Brewing Company;clouded grapefruit juice appearance with a white head. plastic synthetic aroma. sweet taste that is grape like with a yeasty note in the finish. lemon taste comes in and dominates nicely with a sour bit that mixes well.

Viking Brewing Golden Meadow;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Gold color with a very thin head. Kind of a dry honey aroma. Very bland taste with some slight malts being its only salvation. A wheat? I think not. Decent enough drink, sure.
Viking Brewing Golden Meadow;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Golden it is, clear at the bottom, hazy all throughout, smallish ring of whitish foam.Aroma: not nice..overly sweet, spoiled...orange rinds, banana peels, left rotting in the sun...not good at all. Taste: bluh, blah, blech. Flat, lifeless, lightly fruity, lackluster in extremis. Same off flavors scented in the aroma return to haunt the flavor, it’s a shadow of a shell of a taste. Thin, wet cardboard, rimmed with lemon and banana, tepid at best, bordering on offensive at times. Really didn’t want to say these things, but have no choice, it’s a huge mistake. Don’t know how they can taste this stuff and still give it the go ahead. Avoid, one and all, ...Viking makes good beers, but this ain’t one of them!
Viking Brewing Golden Meadow;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Banana some spice and not much else. Medium palate with a lot of sparkle. Dried banana, spice but pretty one dimensional with a medium short finish. Eh?
Viking Brewing Golden Meadow;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valkyrie Brewing Company;sweet, corny aroma. clear, piss yellow. definitely isn't a hefe weizen. very sweet, sour... tastes like pears a bit. not bad, not great. i'm drinking this fast... not worth savoring. i need a quick buzz right now.
Viking Brewing Golden Meadow;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valkyrie Brewing Company;"Dull, clear light yellow, miniscule white head, some strings and spots of lace stick. Smell is down right unpleasant, not anywhere near what a hefe should be. Some funky yeast of musky wood and nearly the same barnyard punch Cantillon lambics have, just toned down. Sorry, but save the funky stuff for the funky lambics and not anything else. Smells like a chemisty experiment gone horribly wrong. Taste ain't much better but doesn't carry over much of the stronger characteristics from the smell but yet he yeast is dominant throughout and all over the place and just plain wrong. Nothing fits, nothing balances, its a pure mess. The wheat that is in there is way in the back and barley traceable. Its bizarrely sweet and twingy, strangely vinous and sour. I cannot begin to discribe my cringing as I try to continue sipping this beer, but it just ain't happening. If drinking this blind you wouldn't have a clue what this beer is trying to accomplish besides being bad. It might pass as a lambic, but as a hefe it plain stinks! How can Viking make two fine brews such as Big Swede and Whole Stein even consider that this is at the same respective level of craft? Nasty yuk junk. I was told this was a new batch that had come in; if so...huh? Bad bottle or not, never again. Never!"

Viking Brewing Fiddlers Finest;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Flat light orange-ruby body, head dissipating into mere memory in under 30 seconds. Aroma is cardboard, flavor is soapy, mouthfeel is flat with approximately 6 small CO2 bubbles per large gulp. Reminiscent of crappy expired Spitfire cask swill a London pub was trying hard to give away five years ago.
Viking Brewing Fiddlers Finest;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Lack of sufficient carbonation is really a downfall here. Tastes like soap and vinegar got into it or something. Aroma and finish differ in no respect. Look is rather lackluster copper-ruby color. This brewery puts out plenty of fine, sometimes avant-garde brews. My personal tendency would be to ignore this one, though its overall rating is obviously otherwise. In all fairness I will sample some other representatives of this style to see if it will lead to a revision of this rating.
Viking Brewing Fiddlers Finest;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Amber to copper color with a smaller light beige head. Light caramel aromas with a touch of celery. Mild toasted malt flavors. touch of bitterness. Quite boring.
Viking Brewing Fiddlers Finest;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Brick Red Coloring. Good Head. Some Hops Aroma. Purchased in Bottle with Badgerben. Mild Hops. Not Overpowering.. Decent Brew.
Viking Brewing Fiddlers Finest;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Copper color with a medium head. Hops and caramel on the nose. Definitely tasted of Saaz hops. On the drier side than I’ve typically had for a Helles. This is available in bottles now.
Viking Brewing Fiddlers Finest;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Softly clear light caramel amber brown color, thin but solidly built white head that fades off quickly, some spotty glaring lace sticks. Aroma is a uncouth medley of slight sweetness, slight grains, a bit vinous, some fresh celery tops, and hard mineral water. Taste is a bit plain, some nudges of slight sweetness and malty grainyness. Has a strange mineral-like taste with tannin-like effects overall. Feel is a bit flat and watery with some tinny and dulled acidic tones. A disappointing lifeless bomber by Viking, why oh why did this go out?
Viking Brewing Fiddlers Finest;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valkyrie Brewing Company;MABR-Nice light color small head that faded quite fast. the aroma was malty with a slight hop presence.With the taste being malty semi-sweet with a little hops present inthe taste and after taste with malt be the dominant flavor.Pretty decent brew.
Viking Brewing Fiddlers Finest;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Similar in character to the vienna woods, without some of the caramel sweetness. The sourness is a little more prevalent here, and not quite as enjoyable. Still not bad though.
J.T. Whitneys Krystal Weiss;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Clear golden color with a modest white head. Wheat, citrus and light sour dough aromas. Flavors dominated by esters and phenols. Some banana, some citrus and light fruit. Not as clean as a kristal should be, IMO. Seems to border on a kristal berliner.
J.T. Whitneys Krystal Weiss;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear gold color. Head was thin and white. No lace was left behind. The aroma was of banana, cereal grain, honey, and citrus. Lightly acidic on the tongue with tart apple, lemon, and banana flavors. There was also a bit of vinegar, unfortunately.
J.T. Whitneys Krystal Weiss;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;"On tap at brewpub I stopped here on whim just to get dinner. When I say this on the taplist I knew it was worth trying, even if turned out to be a disappointment. After all how many times do you run across a Kristallweizen made by a brewer in Wisconsin with ties to Germany? Aroma / Appearance - I should knock off a point for coming with a lemon wedge but that was my fault for not having the foresight to ask them to leave it off. Fresh banana blended with Pedro’s orange degreaser. It was not strong though; imagine running it through a coffee filter to supress the strength. A hint of wheat was evident after some concentration. The body was ga transparent golden yellow with no cloudiness. This is likely due to the filtering which you ddon’t get with a good hefe. Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel was satisfying but not exceptionally thick even for a wheat beer. A slight sourness permeated the orange and banana notes. Everything was offset by the taste of slightly stale white bread. It was very easy to drink; I had no problems finishing it off. I wouldn’t say it was an amazing beer but I could drink this if it were the only non-macro option at a party."
J.T. Whitneys Krystal Weiss;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Clear pale gold. Aroma of hay, lemons and croissants with melted lemon-butter. High carbonation up front. Tingly lemons. Bright, leaving much to be desired. Paling malts and little to no sweetening. Not very enjoyable. Damn filtered beer.
J.T. Whitneys Krystal Weiss;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Served with a lemon, drat. Removed quickly, but it may have had its affect. Aroma is fruity, with some citrus and some wheat twang. Pale yellow in appearance with a very thin white head that fades. Flavor is fruity with a tiny little hint of grassy hops in the finish. Very light and easy to drink, hence the good palate rating. These are supposed to be this way right?
J.T. Whitneys Pre-Prohibition Style Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Sample @ Brewery. Glod body color with white head. Barley grain aroma flavor along with bitterness. Phohibition maybe for this one rather ordinary.
J.T. Whitneys Pre-Prohibition Style Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;"On tap at the brewery This was a pretty bland beer. If this is what was available in this country prior to Prohibition, I might not have been such a big fan of beer. On the plus side, it is better to have bad beers so you enjoy the good ones more. Don’t rush out to try this one unless you are a completist or a ticker. Aroma / Appearance - Hints of corn, barley, wheat, grain and cherries mingled with a scent resembling Honeycomb cereal. I’m not sure that beer should smell this way; my expectations were not too high to begin with but it is not a good way to start. The body was a transparent lemon color with active carbonation. Flavor / Palate - Every sip was the same bland experience. Hints of grain, corn, malt, barley and a weak hoppiness slid right over my tongue and down my throat without leaving a trace. It felt stale and flat with nothing going on except for a pathetic bitterness. The only positive to this beer is that it has so little taste it goes down easily - just hope the carbonation doesn’t come back up later."
J.T. Whitneys Pre-Prohibition Style Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;"Clearly the best brew of the 8 I had in the sampler. Based upon the experiences of my former Minnesota RB bretheren, badgerben and robertsreality, I’m guessing the recipe has been tweaked. It’s also possible that the bartender switched this sample with one for the APA on the sampler tray as this beer was APAish and fits more closely with the positive ratings for that brew. Nice hop in the nose; fruity. Wonderful bouquet. Hazy, dark gold. Slight off-white head that lasts! Excellent lace. This is the quintessential ale; hazy body, soft, fruity profile. A little harsh in the aftertaste, but very nicely done."
J.T. Whitneys Pre-Prohibition Style Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Wisconsin Beer #300. Hazy yellow color with no head. Slightly bitter and grainy aroma. Definitely hops in the taste with a strong vegetable character to it. Qutie dry too. Happy 300 to me!

J.T. Whitneys Goldenshine;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Weak malty aroma. Clear light gold, thin white head, no lace. Generic malt with just a bit of noble hops. Unclean biscuity finish on the first couple sips, goes away later. Sour twang. Watery mouthfeel.
J.T. Whitneys Goldenshine;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear gold color with a thin white head. Not much of a nose other than a hint of apple and a whiff of less than noble hops. Light bodied and delicately sweet with mild bitterness. I tasted some cereal grain mixed with hay and a bit of noble hop. So so at best, but an improvement over the kolsch I sampled just before it.
J.T. Whitneys Goldenshine;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;This brew pours a clear golden colour with a little white head.

J.T. Whitneys Goldenshine;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;"Clear gold with a small ring of a head. Very ""macro-ish"" for a micro. Flavor was faint but had some malt and adjuncts. Mild hop effects and bitterness. No life in the mouth."
J.T. Whitneys Goldenshine;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Western Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden blonde brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves behind some spotty lacing and white ring. Aroma of light golden grain malt, a touch of corn character, grassy hops and a touch of pear. Taste is light bodied, plenty of carbonation with flavors of golden grain malt, grassy hops and some light biscuit. Finish is semi-dry, crisp and then no aftertaste. A light summer lawnmower beer at best.
J.T. Whitneys Goldenshine;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;JT Whitneys has nice micro brew pub with nice view of the brewing area and reastaurant and bar. The brew is affordable and have a nice variety of brew types but the brew is mediocre or less for a micro brewering reatuarant, with the exception of very good barley wine smoked porter, old ale, and gran cru. The food is a bit pricey but good. If this place good up the quality of the brew it could be a red hot destination-- if places like Flossmoor Station can have very good beer than JT Whitney should be able to too.

J.T. Whitneys Mad Badger Barley Wine;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;this beer is a deep brown with an inch or so of tan head. Okay, let it warm up a bit and then... Ahhh. Nice aroma of dark caramel, stone fruit, and a touch of alcohol. Flavorful beer here, with lots of molasses, thick sweet caramel, fig, and licorice into the finish. A noticeable but not powerful hop presence provides good balance, and adds a good lingering bitterness in the finish. There’s a slight alcohol flavor early that becomes more pronounced in the finish and aftertaste. Full bodied, softly but amply carbonatied. Good head retention, not much lacing.

J.T. Whitneys Mad Badger Barley Wine;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a clear deep garnet with a short cap of beige head... receded to a small island after a minute or so. Nose was of strong dark fruits (vinous and cherry notes) with a definite alcohol presence that took charge as this warmed. Same fruit medley in the flavor department, with a lot of sticky darker malts including chocolate. Very sweet. Alcohol was bright and almost became unbearable toward the end of the drink. Medium-bodied. Balance was off... too sweet and too boozy.

Excellent barleywine that I will have to try again in a full serving.
J.T. Whitneys India Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;One of the many pints of beer i had at JT’s while waiting for my computer to get fixed: poured a dull cloudy orange colour with a medium sized off white head. Aroma was ok, firm with hop notes and pine- but hops were sort of funny, not sure what kind they used. Taste was citrusy, chewy and definately nice and hoppy. All around a very citrusy powerful IPA
J.T. Whitneys India Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;"I had this on the first or second day the batch was being served at the brewpub, so it was very fresh. Aroma is strongly floral and piney. Pours a murky amber, scant head. Flavor is strongly coniferous and citrusy, becoming sharply bitter on the mid-palate. Amidst it all, some worty vanilla elements manage to peek through. Palate is just plain tongue-peeling, but in a good way; cheeks are tingling for a long while after the glass is empty."
J.T. Whitneys India Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;J.T.

Subtle hop bouquet with some cardboard, standardized pils malt and cedar groves for aroma. Creamy and bitter. I like where this is going. Well balanced and medium bodied.

Pours a semi-clear dark brown brew with a thin and fast dissipating tan head that dissolves almost clean. Aroma of toasted dark malts, some coffee, a touch of chocolate and some lactose.

J.T. Whitneys State Street Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Translucent chocolate rose with an etched tan wrung and the thinnest tan ice sheaf known to man. Mocha espresso torte is in full aromatic array while fudgie brownies fill in any café dessert gaps left to be fed. Chunks of fudge lead into minutes of aromatic delight, but it sadly ends there. Thin substance slips in. Sure, there’s some coffee, but it skimps on proper proportions. Carbonation hides because it’s ashamed of the lack of character. Gummy, dirty Folgers and medium-roasted soot. The bitterness is in the finish, thought it’s presence in the flavor is perfectly neglected. Apple butter crisscrossed with coffee grinds on edible sandpaper becomes the only tangible summary worthy of scribing as a disappointment. Loose, light and skimpy, Misted chocolate tortes can only be stretched so far. A shining example of why I approach brewpub stouts with great trepidation.

Probably not but still it’s fun to speculate...anyway, this poured a solid, oily medium gold with just a bit of head...tart fruity nose, a hint of banana but mostly sour cherries and apples...tart throughout with the acidic qualities dominating the decent light pale malts...the movement here is from juicy-fruity tartness to bone-dry tartness and a bit of stony bitterness at the finish...very full-bodied, strongly but not over-carbonated.

De Koninck Cuvée;Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);"Strong version of the classic De Koninck on 75 cl bottles. Warm amber colour under a yellowish white, thin head; malty and estery aroma, with the unmistakable De Koninck yeast presence, caramelly and bready malts, spiciness, toasted bread, orange peel. Soft fruity taste, sweet but not cloying, some citrus, sweet maltiness and spicy yeastiness, again very De Koninck but richer and more vinous, smooth and somewhat resinous mouthfeel, yeasty and grassy hoppy finish with a hint of warming alcohol. I liked this when it was fresh (I think it was back in 2002 or 2003), too bad it was discontinued years ago to be replaced by their Triple d’Anvers."

De Koninck Cuvée;Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);10/10/12. 11.2oz bottle, 2004 vintage, from Walt... wtf, Walt? He sent me this entirely randomly as a thanks for sending him beer that he paid for! What a dude! Hazy, yeasty, dark amber, ruby pour with a very small ring of khaki head and no lacing. Yeast, burnt caramel, oxidation, and what reminds me of a shot of whiskey or something in the aroma. Sweet caramel entry with plenty of yeast character followed by more oxidation and a lingering aspect of burnt nuts and burnt popcorn - not in the buttery sense, but the actual burnt popcorn sense. Interesting. Glad to try it!

Irlbacher Alt Irlbacher Spezial Dunkel;Irlbach, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schlossbrauerei Irlbach (Arcobräu Moos);This beer is a good Dunkel if you like your dark beer not to be too malty and more like the eastern Tmavy type beers. Almost a brown Helle my friend said when drinking this. So true - but not without strength and a decent aftertaste.

Taste also sweet and malty. Quite simple, and directly related to the beer ingredients. Finish is where it gets interesting, first some husks, then liquorice, then seared-pork hops. Goes down rather well, covers 5.8 more than adequately, though sweetness hints to strength. Rerate: 500ml bottle (Alust Tirgus, Riga) (6:4:6:4:13=3.3) Pruney aroma. Extremely husky and walnutty taste and finish. Bran too. Papery from the bitter hops. Nice drunkable dunkel.

Jever Pilsener;Jever, Lower Saxony, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever (Radeberger Gruppe);"""Jever"" is very similar beer with ""Carlsberg Pilsner"".. The taste and the malty aftertaste is almost the same.. Small difference exist here between these two famous beers. Also remind me the ""Asahi Super dry"" beer little bit.. Anyway this beer is very refreshing and also little slightly light.. Has very hoppy flavour and some extra malty dry bitterness in the aftetaste that is the best thing about these beers. Overall one very refreshing beer to drink. For the style is very good but personal i prefer little more the ""Carlsberg"" over this one.."
Jever Pilsener;Jever, Lower Saxony, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever (Radeberger Gruppe);330ml bottle. Clear, yellow-ish golden colour with average, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Grainy and strawy malty, relatively intense hoppy aroma, hints of grass, a touch of wet straw. Taste is bitter hoppy, slightly grassy, strawy, minimally sweet malty. Oily texture, smooth and soft palate. Very clean, quite bitter - probably the best Pilsener of all nation-wide operating brands.

Jever Light;Jever, Lower Saxony, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever (Radeberger Gruppe);In my opinion, this product with reduced (but still physiologically significant) ABV has very little extra to offer compared with Jever's true n/a pilsener (Jever Fun). So why bother? I would either a) just drink Fun, or b) drink one glass of Fun and one of standard (4.9%) Jever Pilsener (for roughly the same alcohol intake as a glass of Light).
Jever Light;Jever, Lower Saxony, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever (Radeberger Gruppe);Sampled from 0.5 l bottle from local 'toom', best before April 2019. Clear, pale golden with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, white head. Slightly sweetish, gently grassy-spicy aroma of grains and some straw. Just a little sweet, moderately bitter, gently grassy-spicy taste of grains and some straw, followed by a short, medium bitter, slightly grassy-spicy, rather dry and a little metallic finish. Thin to medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Quite good for a light beer, still not really a pleasure.
Jever Light;Jever, Lower Saxony, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever (Radeberger Gruppe);Pours gold from the bottle. The foamy white head soon fades.

New England Raspberry Wheat;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New England Brewing Co.;"Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. 10/01/01: One of their specialty beers. My fiance (now wife ;-) ) likes this one a lot. It has a nice sweet raspberry syrup taste to it, but I don’t see the attraction."
New England Raspberry Wheat;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New England Brewing Co.;Pretty damn good. One of the best flavored wheats I''ve tried. Unfortunately, the bottle I had was a bit old, and the beer was past it''s peak. Still, it was lightly fruity and dry, with a mild hop crispness in the finish and a nice cloudy pale gold color. Dense white head with a lot of nose. Very good, if you can still find a bottle.....and it''s not too expired.
New England Raspberry Wheat;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New England Brewing Co.;"Awesome summer brew. Light and crisp with a nice subtle fruit flavor. Very quaffable in the hot months. Not ""fruity"" at all."

Dubuque Star Big Muddy Red;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubuque Brewing;In the bottle at the 2004 Crescent Moon Vintage Beer Tasting. Yuck! I’m not sure what this was supposed to be, but after 10-15 years in the bottle, it ain’t that now! Pretty bad at this point. This one did not age well. Weak and watery by my estimation and I suspect that was about the flavor when it was fresh.
Dubuque Star Big Muddy Red;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubuque Brewing;I was surprised. This has a malt taste almost like a weak bock. Is it really an ale? Other than that, though, it's a bit too American-grainy for my taste.

Rolinck Westfälisch Alt;Steinfurt, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Privatbrauerei A. Rolinck (Krombacher);Has a dark-brown color, filtered, with a light brown, fluffy head. Smells of caramel, earthen toffee and a hint of sweet wild honey. Its body is sweet and almost too light, which becomes apparent during the middle part, in which a watery dullness is on par with the otherwise taste defining malts. It remains refreshing though. Tastes of dried wood, caramel malts, a hint of milk chocolate and a pungent tartness. Then, the beer gets overly thin and watery with an accompanying sweetness, which gets more powerful during the finish, without nothing else going on Defined completely by sweet malts, this got nothing to do with an Alt for me. At best, this is an easy to read Dunkel, appearing a little too simple as for its superlight mouthfeel and missing hop appearance.

Belhaven St Andrews Ale (Bottle);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Belhaven (Greene King);Pours deep red gold with thick head and good lacing.Smells little yeast. Taste is malty and very sweet with a sour finish (like a dull sour)
Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);From old tasting notes. Hazy yellow gold color. Bubbly white head. Light citrusy malt aroma. Assertive malt/hop flavor. Notes of sweet grain and floral hops. Good balance throughout. Earthy notes make this lager very ale-like.
Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);bottle brought back from UK. Mainly toffee and earthy /floral hops in the nose. Body is crisp but light, flavor mild and pretty much matches the nose. OK.
Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);Bottle. Amber with a decent, off-white, head. Malty lager, with plenty of cereal grains, some tired hops and sweetish finish. I wouldn’t rush to drink this again.
Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);Tap at Bruuveri, Helsinki. Originally rated 09102011. Colour is clear golden with small white head. Aromas and flavours: Grain, sweetness and malts.
Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);The Sampler, Brooklyn tap: Pours golden with very little head. Aroma is a tiny bit of toffee, grass, sweet malts. Taste is slightly sweet with a soda consistency. Easy drinking lager, but lacks complexity or a truly nice clean flavor.
Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);Refreshing lager with floral notes and a sweet finish. Not hoppy and light yet crisp.
Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);Draft. Color - bright yellow, golden, transparent. White cap, fine-grained, high, but left after 1-2 minutes. On glass walls settled well. Carbonation - for normal eye - bubbles play. Fragrance - pustovat - no hops, no fruits, no flowers. The smell is refreshing hops somewhere very far away. Gas - in moderation. Taste - nice malty, dense, long-lasting. Bitterness blowing, not flower, gives the sky. Smoky flavor. Aftertaste leaves in dry hop bitterness. Not bad for a lager, but not to my taste.
Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);draught. golden clear. golden caramel malts, very scottish-ale like with butterscotch nuttyness. smooth light body. taste-wise caramel again, some grassy hops. -- bb/wp8

Belhaven Scottish Lager;Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Belhaven (Greene King);"Draft to taster. Looks decent; a transparent gold with white lacing. Smells doughy, skunky, and a little hoppy. Tastes like it smells with a bit of malt too. Average (at best) on the palate. Not my cup of beer."
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Cask @ Clockwork Beer Co. Hazy golden yellow colour, good foamy head. Sour vegetable resin aroma. Sour citrus biscuit flavour. Sour citrus fruit aftertaste. Not a nice beer.
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Cask @ 3 Judges. Dark golden colour, off-white head. Aroma of horse dung, fruity hops and malts. Flavour of horse dung, garden peas, vegetables and malts. A bit odd.
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);A heavy on the stomach brew, had trouble finishing it, may have been a bad bottle, Malty, nowhere close to an IPA why call it one?
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Bottle 13/08/2002 Amber coloured with some alcohol and a wheat flavour. Slightly dry malt finish.
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Cask Conditioned at The Galloway Hotel, Newton Stewart, Scotland. Pale golden colour with hadl any head. Not a great pint, thin sourish, malty flavour rather than a hoppy IPA. Very disappointing.
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Does anyone else find it odd that the Wallace ale is an IPA instead of a scots? Nevertheless, it was a pretty good one, though not great.
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);...........................................................................
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Deep amber with a touch of cloudiness. Smallish tight bubled light cream colored head. Aroma of sweet caramel and hop blankets. Perhaps a touch watery in the body. Very well balanced with both a pale malt flavor and a mild citrus backdrop. Finish is quite quick and unassuming. A nice light drinking (almost session like) IPA.
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);I like this better than most of the other raters. It may not conform completely to the IPA style, but it is a very well-balanced brew that is a real pleasure to drink. A new favorite!
Maclay Wallace IPA;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);the initial taste was nice and hoppy but quickly faded. Not bad as a pale ale but a good IPA should be more robust and persistently hoppy.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;pretty average all round. Golden appearance, with light head. Slightly fruity aroma notes, citrus and pear. flavour is a little dissapointing, banana, and apple present with a slight woodyness.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;Sweetish aroma, normal lager appearance with short-lived head. Flavour is like dusty cardboard with a short, dry finish. Agimmick beer that is darned ordinary.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;rather nice lager, got it just to try it and was surprised at the quality, nothing mind-blowing just better than expected.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;Expecting something terrible I was slightly surprised. Head retention was quite good and the beer a clear gold. Slightly light-struck aroma and not much else. Slight sweetness but overall quite drinkable. Ten times better than VB but nothing too exciting.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;5/4: I personally found it rather boring. Clear yellow with small white head. Sweet flavour with slightly astringent hop-like taste too. Not much aroma, bit of woody hops. Thin palate, slightly crisp.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;Rolled the Philly Blunt and toked like George Burns on the Late Show as I sipped on one of these. It tasted great to me but I was quite well zooted: Powerade in the opening, hints of Bubble-O Bill in the finish. Nice crisp filter job too if you give a shit. Groovy man.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;Pretty boring characterless lager, average body, coarse short lived head. I couldn't really discern any flavour to speak of, not very crisp either, despite commercial description.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;It isn't as bad as i thought it might be, but it still isn't that good, light brown in colour, fizzy, a bit sugary and tasted a bit damp.
Burkes Hemp Premium Ale;Northgate, Queensland, Australia;Flavored - Other;Burkes Brewing Company;Quite a reasonable, hoppy lager, crisp and refreshing. Will try again soon.

Coopers Original Pale Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Coopers Brewery;Like that cousin who has just lost 5kg, I find this enticing even though I know it will get me in trouble. Well worth the jail sentence and the loss of all your relatives.
Coopers Original Pale Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Coopers Brewery;Like the red, but thinner, more bitter, more champagne-like. Better than the red.
Coopers Original Pale Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Coopers Brewery;I first drank this when I was in Adelaide in 2003, loved it so much I brought the t shirt. Had it a number of times since it's been imported to the UK. Still always enjoy it, a really easy drinking pale ale.
Coopers Original Pale Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Coopers Brewery;getrunken 2012 in einem australischen Kellerresturant in der Wiener Innenstadt Fast hätte ich gedacht, dass ich das Coopers Sparkling Ale erwischt hatte, da es extrem sprudelig war. Geschmackli erinnerte es an manch leichtes Strandbier, wobei es aber einen leicht süßlichen Abgang hatte. Kein schlechtes Bier, aber den Aufwand nicht wert.
Coopers Original Pale Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Coopers Brewery;Hazy golden color with white head, grainy, malty aroma with hints of biscuits, taste is grassy, malty and hoppy, medium bitter, medium body and carbonation.
Coopers Original Pale Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Coopers Brewery;Moderately low to no noble hop aroma. Deep gold to light amber in color. Clean. Little to no caramelization. Moderate hop bitterness. no harshness.
Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;Bottle from Yamaya. Rich dark malt nose, fruity, apples, spicy hops, grapes. Dark brown with a lacy low head. Spicy, almost Belgian yeastiness. Chocolate, caramel, stewed fruits. Almost tastes aged. British hops flavor. Nice full body for such a low abv. Enjoyable and better than expected.
Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;Dark brown colour almost black, good carbonation. Notes of malty chocolate but not overpowering. Refreshing taste, somewhere between their stout and a Kraft Schwarzbier. Enjoyable and very session-able. It is a great beer.
Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;First up is Coopers Dark Ale 4.5% A cola brown with a fizzy tan head that vanished fast. The aroma is malty caramel but also sweet corn syrup cola like. The taste is better with toasty molasses notes and a strange floral thing in the finish (hops). It tastes better than it smells but this is a bargain basement beer... ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;330ml bottle from Jason's Food Hall, Kuala Lumpur. Poured a clear medium brown colour with a fizzy, mostly lasting light tan head. The aroma is caramel malt, nutty, light woody hop. The flavour is light sweet, with a light, watery, mineral, earthy, woody hop bitter palate and a lingering bitter finish. Medium to light bodied with average to lively carbonation. Way too light and watery for the style and too much carbonation too.
Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;Pour from bottle, very little head, liquid rather lively. Smell coffee, the body is light, and taste a little bit bitter sweet.
Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;On tap at Six Tanks Brew Co, Darwin. Pours dark brown w/light tan head and mild aroma of roast malt. Tasty malt profile-choc & a bit nutty-plus enough bitterness to balance most of the sweetness.
Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;Appearance: murky brown. Medium tan head Aroma: nutty, caramel Palate: medium mouthfeel and carbonation Taste: nutty, caramel. A little sweet. Good lingering aftertaste
Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;Tap @ Burrawang Pub. Dark brown. Chocolate, caramel and hazelnuts. Decent body for a brown ale. Slight sweetness. Went well with a porky country terrine and the Sunday roast pork.

Coopers Dark Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Brown Ale;Coopers Brewery;375ml bottle from Tasty Life, Xiamen. Pours dark brown with an off white head. Aroma of malt and toffee with hazelnuts. Sweetish taste, a hint of chocolate. Bitter finish. Better than I thought it was going to be.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;OLD NOTES OCT 9, 2003 I was quite suprised when I found one of these. I had personally never heard of it until I found it in the liquor store. Reminded me of many European style lagers. Quite a good smooth flavour, but doesn’t have the typical Coopers charm. Not bad by any means, but Coopers have many other fine beers to choose from.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;one of the better beer in Australia...good taste and suited for drinking on a week day. neutral but enjoyable.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Not so good tasting beer, drunk on bottle in Belgium, but know him also from oversees.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;A richer, more full bodied beer than the lager. More of a sweet finish with a nice bready aroma. A healthy dose of yeast in the bottle was not settled so I got a good bit of it in my glass, adding to the yeasty bite. Very small head with no real staying power and low carbonation overall. Good hopping for the malt level.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;"The word ""premium"" is bandied about too freely in the Australian beer market. It’s often a clue that what’s in the bottle is aimed at the sort of drinker who equates price with quality. (Take a bow anyone who regularly shells out for Boags Premium or Crown Lager.) Be nice to think Coopers was above this but they’re in expansion mode and I guess every dollar counts. It poured an amber colour with a thin, disappearing head. The nose is light and malty, which translates to the flavour. However, there are also some unpleasant chalky notes there. All the more disappointing because this brewer makes some of Australia’s best ales. (Bottle)"
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Amber in colouring with a thin small head. Malty, grainy, roasted-type of aroma. A bit disappointed as I expected a bit more of a bite from this Ale - but it is still easy to drink and worth a try. Still not bad.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;As a massive coopers fan i wasnt overly impressed by this. Not much character to help you remember it by. doesnt have the natural earthy feel of the pale or the dark but still finds it way down.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Bottled, in sunny Sydney. Honey, amber coloured beer. With a thin, course white head. Sweet malt aroma that is translated completely through to the flavour. Moderate bitter structure that only become apparent after the sweet malts have disappeared.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;on of the lesser quality beers of the coopers range, I think it's one of the products thought up by their marketers not their brewers.
Coopers Premium Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;the good thing with coopers is that whatever they try tomake you know they aren't going to totally stuff it up. this has a weird freshly-buttered toast aroma and drifts off into a sea of competence
Coopers Vintage Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Coopers Brewery;Thuis uit een flesje, de 2017 versie. Troebel bruine kleur, weinig lichtbruin schuim. Caramel in het aroma, ook in de smaak. De smaak neigt naar een hoog abv, veel meer dan de 7,5. Ook licht bitter in de nasmaak. Gemengde indrukken.
Coopers Vintage Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Coopers Brewery;Tastes lightly liquorice-like and malty. But it is two years old, and tastes a little oxidized. But underneath, I think there is a good beer hiding if younger and clear. belgian beer factory online
Coopers Vintage Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Coopers Brewery;Hazy light brown with white head. Smell is dark fruit cake, brown sugar. Taste is candied nuts, candied cherries, strong hoppiness, high fg sweetness and bitterness, caramel-coffee. Body is good, seems wheaty. Good and slightly exceeded expectations.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;OLD NOTES JAN 25, 2004 Nothing too out of the ordinary on the aroma. Malt and a few faint hop aromas. Pours clean golden with a foamy head. The flavour itself reminded me more of a dark beer. Roasted malt body with a few light fruit flavours. Not too bad overall, but simple not that typical Coopers charm i’ve come to expect.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Probably the worst bottle-conditioned beer I’ve ever had. Pours out a decent dark yellow/golden colour. Sweet fruity nose, the flavour has some vague weak hoppiness and inidistinct fruitiness. Decent malt biscuit flavour as well.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;One of the most mediocre ales in the otherwise formidable Coopers line-up. There’s nothing especially bad about it but it has none of the character of the brewer’s best ales. It poured a golden lager colour with a small disappearing head. Distinctive nose with bubble gum, fruit and malt characters. Thin-to-medium body with a light, quenching palate. A session ale but short on character. (Bottle)
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Golden Amber colouring with a small foamy head. Floral, honey aroma. Dry, thin with a hint of roasted malt, floral and honey in the taste.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;POR, honey, light flowery hop and slight estery aromas. medium light golden colour with small smooth head. light dry honeyed malt flavour with light floral hop and slightly estery flavours. thin and drying with light to medium bitterness. A light sessional ale, pretty average.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;This beer did not do anything for me at all. Some old musty flavors and aromas. The taste is crisp, but bland with just a hint of hops and honey. Watery malt flavors are predominant. Unsatisfying.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;God I hated this, if I had of known it had Pride of Ringwood in it I would have laughed and walked away. This can be found in the same fridges as the other macro garbage in Australia and yep sure enough it's pasturised as well not one bit of yeast. Aroma was vomitous. Appearance was pissy yellow. Flavour is just the same as other Aussie macro lagers ie no noticeable malt, no fruit and no real hop character. Was ok on the palate not being too carbonated and having some mouthfeel. Overall the Pride of Ringwood resinous bittering didn't stick to my toungue as badly as other Aussie lager rubbish but this still got poured down the drain. Still had some months on the expirey date.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Clear, unlike a regular coopers, a little bit rich but not too much. Very fruity, apricot and a few nectarines, full enough and flavoursome. Very simple but this beer is fantastic, everything that i like in a beer. Good work Thomas! Cheers.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;The problem with this is that it is not the great bottle conditioned ale that some other stablemates are. Therefore the perception is that it just isn't a Coopers. Silly I know, but the problem here is that the beer falls down in the flavour and character stakes. The mention of POR as a positive always leaves me cold as this hop just doesn't do anything but provide some bitterness. Clearly thsi beer will put hair on your chest, as evidenced by the beard on the lable that looks like it extends to Tom's pubes.
Thomas Coopers Finest Export;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Bottled, Sydney. The second beer I had after stepping off the plane (Tooheys Old, mothers milk, was first). Golden amber with a shinny white head. Soft malts, caramel and vanilla. Easy drinking but not memorable. Most Coopers beers distinguish and differentiate themselves, this doesn’t, quite.
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Used to be available as Coopers Premium Light All Malt 375 ml bottle, now repackaged as Coopers Premium Light Fine Filtered 355 ml, which seems less malt based. More commercial blonde type labelling. An ok light beer and less thin than others of low alcohol type. Short crisp finish. Refreshing when served cold on a hot day.
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Poured a light honey gold colour with a very thin head. Moderate fine carbonation. Aroma of malt and trace of hops. Taste of sweet malt and very slight trace of hops (but not too bitter). Thin body. I’m not usually a fan of light beers but this one is OK.
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Gold colouring with a short lasting small head. Hint of a hoppy aroma. Watery, bland with a tinny bitter flavour. No thanks.
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;This beer has a light yellow body - hue with a bitter initial flavor and a water body.
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Don't bother, you compromise your eminent standing in Aussie brewing. No malt, body. hop presence etc.
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;"Slight aroma of malt & some initial bitterness which quickly evaporates leaving no taste. ""Full-flavoured"" my arse."
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Medium gold clear under a smallish short lasting white head. Very faint stale hops aroma.Thin watery body with a hint of biscuity grainy malt and chemical bitter flavours. Very ordinary stuff.
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;I thought with the caliber of coopers they could of done better with this brew. Slightly lacking a bit of flavour, but to it's defence what light has lot's of flavour.
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Not a big fan of light beer but, this really was bad........................
Coopers Light Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;One of the best light beers... but who likes light beer?....................
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;I love Coopers beers but this one is crap. Have bought a carton and struggling to find the will to get through one sixpack. Leaves a very cloying taste in the mouth, is not in the least refreshing. And I find leaves me with a headache after 3 beers and I've not had a headache for ages. Sorry Coopers I will never be buying this beer again.
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;Bottle enjoyed during a holiday in Australia. Backlog rating from bottle collection and historic scoring. Source not recorded. Tasting notes not kept, just rating.
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;Tried this beer long time ago back in final year of high school back in 1997. Had an allergy to wine so tried Cooper’s DB known to be good for allergy sufferers and diabetics. It had enough of an impression on me that I can rate it but perhaps not describe it fully. Bought a six pack, couldn’t finish more than two, and couldn’t GIVE away the remaining three to pissed teenagers once a bottle did the rounds for tasting.s Remember it being very watery and very dry, with a horrible stale beer aroma. But at least I didn’t get that allergic reaction!
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;OLD NOTES FEB 17, 2004 Never had a diet beer before!? Light sweet aroma of malt that almost seems to be missing something. Pours light golden, not much head to speak of. Has the wierd sodary body I get with all of these less well known Coopers beer. Watery, and easy. A bit more interesting than their draught, and maybe a bit better for ya, but nothing special.
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;Clear filtered orange gold, with lots of bubbles flying to the top of the glass propping a rather lacklustre head. Aroma is all malt, although I somehow got some sweet berry fruits on tasting. The flavour is rather neutral, probably as intended, making it an easy quaffer but uninteresting. Average palate, with not a lot to argue with the mouth as it hasn’t got much of a body. As far as pale lagers go it’s in with the mix, but that’s nothing to be proud of.
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;"Another example of ""found this single bottle in the cooler"" beers (always makes me a little wary). Anyway, turns out to be fairly unremarkable pale lager. It is quite dry, which I kind of liked."
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;Bottled. Pale golden. no head. Ricey sake aroma. Dry with loads of adjuncty rice flavour and some bread. Light bodied, but not thin. Low bitterness. Save for the bready malt flavour there is not much reason to chose this over, say, VB.
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;Pours a chill-filtered clear gold with a hello-goodbye 1cm head. Bit of pineapple in a generally fruity aroma. Oddly, this has less aroma than their light beer. Thin in the body and as dry as a bushfire in the finish. Lots of fruit upfront but little in the way of a finish. Heavily carbonated. Better than I expected but I can’t think of a reason to choose this over the Sparkling Ale or Pale Ale.
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;Wow, no head. Highly effervescent. Hint of flat cardboardy malt. Quite a strong honey in the intial flavour. Boring palate with some carbonic acid finish. meh.
Coopers Dry Beer;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coopers Brewery;Yellow colouring with a small disappearing head. Very dry, bland and lacks a bite, but has a hint of sweetness and is clean and crisp. I’ll pass on this one in the future though.
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Golden coloured beer with effectively nil head on top but perfect clarity and a good trail of sparkle. Caramel-malt like aroma with very little else to commend its aroma. The flavour is likewise sweet golden caramel and burnt toast. Some spritzy carbonation makes this a good light option but very little else to write home about.
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;375ml bottle into glass. Nose is faint sweet malt. Golden amber with lasting one finger head. Watery spritzy mouthfeel. Finish is short & clean with a little metallic hop bitterness. Not bad for a virtually no alcohol beer.
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Bottle, 2Pac Day 2015. Orange with a white head that lasts OK in the Crown Lager flute pulled out of the back of the cupboard specially for the occasion. Not much aroma, but pleasant enough - a slight whiff of herbal hops, some grain if you squint. Watery. First sip is beery enough - not very sweet at all with a harsh grainy note, some bitterness. A few swigs in and the nothingness of the palate begins to tell and all you’re left with is the rather harsh finish. It is pretty fucken fucked, but for what it is it’s not fucken bad.
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Been kicking around the fridge for awhile and finally got around to it. Quite sweet and mainly malt is what I got from this. On the nose it reminded me of Metaxo (?) malt.
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;"Experienced Australian drinker of 30 years standing with COLD 375ml bottle, NOT CANS. Never take cans. Judging this beer strictly as an ""Ultra-Light"" beer, so I don’t expect it to beat my favourite Leffe of Belgium. Pours a golden yellow with thin whitish head that disperses fairly quickly - about 2 minutes. Surprising malty flavour which I found quite enjoyable on the sweet side with hints of bitterness. Flavour sticks for a while on the thin side. Carbonation shows very little fizzing, but becomes apparent on tongue. Aroma requires one to dip the nose in it to sense anything, so you need a long nose! Easy to burp, so great if the mother-in-law is sitting next to you. If you’re fighting your alcoholic demons, this is the stuff to drink. BUT, everyone is different, so just try a six-pack, and don’t forget, it must be COLD. Overall, a pleasant surprise, and will buy again."
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;It’s not alcoholic and does a decent job of looking like beer but I’d probably just rather drink water.
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;"Poured yellowish wee colour with loose white head that diminished to slight suds. Aroma faint and of sour light grain with a touch of tropical fruit. Sour watery taste initially, moving to watery dryness. Palate thin and watery, moderate length to a dry unpleasant finish. But overall, I have to give it some points for the low alcohol content; the reason you bought this right?"
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;Great no alcohol beer for 1$/beer Carlsberg smarts ensures great quality Very fruity
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;375ml bottle from Woolworths. Pours bright amber and very clear with a sudsy white head. Doesn’t look too ad for a low alcohol brew. Strong wet grain aroma that s repugnant and offensive and a real turnoff. Flavour is much the same and tastes like you are sucking wet straw through a dirty sock.
Coopers Birell Premium;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Coopers Brewery;bottle. If you have to drink a no alcohol beer, than this would be your drink, but other than that it’s beer flavoured water
Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Very old review from notes. Haven’t seen this in years; assume it’s retired. Nice dark red pour with a little bit of off white head. Lots of malt and some hops in the nose; maybe some dark fruit. Much more body and taste than other Molson offerings I’ve tried. Would love to have this again to see how my initial impression would hold up over time."
Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);aroma some hops, malt, color, slight reddish hue, taste, smooth, some hop some malt, overall, I rated this beer high because thats the impression it left on me a the time, I cant find this beer anymore rating was from 1997
Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Remeber when they cam out with this. This isnt retired yet? amber malty version of Molson Golden. Wasnt good then & not good now I imagine
Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz bottle. Poured a light reddish brown color with a mini white head. This pretty much tastes like a regular molson with slightly more malt flavor. Still doesnt make it good.
Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Had this beer on 11/12/1998. Medium body that goes down harsh. Finish just sucks. BAD BAD beer.

Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Draught. Almost non-existant white head. Clear amber/reddish body. Fruity aroma. Flavor expected to be more bitter than was actually the case.
Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A jug of this was 14.75 so I assumed it would be okay, but I was sorely wrong. I was actually expecting a red ale, but was served a somewhat less disgusting version of the original Molson. The beer wasn’t red at all, but in the black light over the table it looked phosphourescent so I suppose it wasn’t necessarily the beer’s fault. Almost no body, just watered-down to all hell. Low flavor and not enjoyable.
Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Nice ruddy brown color good head. Somewhat thin tasting and a little whimpy on the texture as well. Oh well. A decent beer.
Molson Red Jack;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Overall, not a bad beer. Pretty good for a Macro. ........................

Boags XXX Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pour into a ten ounce for overall enjoyment. A fruity aroma reminiscient of sileage on a cold winters morning yet coupled with the sweet smell of a ripe greengage plum hanging from the tree in late february. To observe is the pale yellow, reminiscient of buttermilk but clearer than translucent. The head does diminish but offers a hoppy zing in the 10 sips you should enjoy it in. To taste the nectar, one should reminisce on the quench felt after exiting the ocean on a sunny afternoon. Remember the gullet cleansing quelch of any malt after levelling a backyard in mid Summer. Recall the first time you enjoyed beer. Best served cold.
Boags XXX Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375ml bottle at Prickly Cactus, Launceston. Nose of plastic malt. Golden amber beer with fluffy white head which stays and laces well. The odd stray bubble shows itself. Medium body, bit of zing. Finish is vegetal and malty with a touch of tin. Different to other Aussie macros but not necessarily better.
Boags XXX Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Hazy yellow color. Foamy white head. Sweetish malt aroma. Metallic sour hop flavor. Highly carbonated. Light bitter hop finish. Brief aftertaste.
Boags XXX Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"BB 05/10/17. Poured a clear amber with 5mm of bright white open foam head that diminished slowly to a thin collar and blotchy cap. Carbonation low, average and coarse. Aroma of moderately strong malt; no obvious hops. Taste is malty and slightly sweet; no real bitterness. Light body. Crisp, clean and smooth with a slightly sweet short finish. Normal macro-lager."
Boags XXX Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Gold colour. Medium head that falls out. Clean, pale malts, maybe a little bit of fruitiness, pretty simple pale macro lager. Touch of hoppy dryness late.
Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Picked this up at some little cornerstore bottleshop when we stopped for gas on our way to Freycinet National Park in Tasmania.

Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500 ml can - Clear pale straw/gold. Frothy white head.

Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pale yellow/gold with a large frothy white head.

Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Cold filtered says it all absolute crap saying that though i have had a couple of nice classic bitters when they are ice cold on a hot day but u know its not good when they make it in 500ml cans
Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Canned. Fizzy golden, airy head. Light citric aroma. Fruity with lots of pineapple in a fizzy body. Low bitterness. Industrial standard lager.
Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Cold filter should refer truefully to taste, aroma and sensory filter, because all this beer does is get you drunk. Decent of them to save us time with a 500mL ’Tube’. Typical of mass media beers, flavourless crap!!!
Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Cold filtered. Say no more. Actually i will also say that this beer is watery, skunky and weird on the palate. Gee can beer really get much worse?
Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"I could already tell this beer would be interesting when I saw you could buy them in 500ml 'tubes'. I agree with nasullivan 'cold filtering' means destroying the beer, I am yet to see an example of a beer that it aids, it does make it more accessible to mainstream consumers, because it tastes more like water.

Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"I think the term 'cold filtering' means 'take the flavour away.'

Boags Classic Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Better than Carlton Cold but not as good as Tooheys Extra Dry. If you're looking for a cold filtered beer you could do worse but it's nothing to write home about.
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);OLD NOTES DEC 6, 2003 Had this on tap a few months back, nothing to memorable, but i’ve been meaning to try it out of the bottle ever since. So hear it goes. Quite a strong yeasty smell. A fair bit of alcohol on the nose. Pours a deep golden with a small lacy head that hangs around. A bread kind of flavour to it. A bit of a metallic bitterness with it. Drinkable and decent, but not really my style of beer.
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. I’m just updating my records. An enjoyable beer. my favourite of their Pale lager range.
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);...bottle. Dark golden yellow, with a very thin white head. Lots of hops and malt on the nose. Bitter than most flavor, thin body, easy drinking. Finishes dry with a lingering malt flavor, not bad.
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Dark gold pour,head good back to lace,aroma hoppy.Flavour bitter and a bit metallic.Finish is watery flavour,slight bitter and vegetable,fair.
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Golden amber in colour with a long-lasting frothy white head, good lacing. Thin to medium bodied with medium to high carbonation; Moderate bitterness; Not much flavour other than a little maltiness. Nice dry finish. An average pale lager."
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Amber with an off white head which lasted fairly well although left little if any lacing. Highly carbonated. A light sweat malt flavour with a mild bitterness. Goes down OK but nothing to write home about. Similar to most other Australian pale lagers.
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Big fluffy head, light orange colour body, hoppyish aroma (could be skunky!) a very mild an plain flavour, nothing special but certainly not bad, a ’bbq beer’
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Bottle -- Pours a light amber with a small, white frothy head. A bit of retention and a whole lot of lacing. Lots of bubbles. Aroma has much more going on than your average Oz lager with some caramel, malt and hops. Watery mouthfeel. The flavour is more one dimensional than the aroma with some sweetness up front and a vaguely (ever so vaguely) bitter aftertaste. Why it’s got that word ""Bitter"" in its name is a bit of a mystery. Not bad, with more going for it than most Oz lagers."
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375ml. Bottle. Pours a bubbly amber with a bubbly white head. Smells of pears with a trace of cabbage. Flavors are more pear and some green apple. Stale bread. Off-putting sweetness. Mouthfeel is way too fizzy. There is a little bitterness in the finish but it is offset by the offensive fruity-sweetness of it. Tastes like watered down cider. Weird flavor for a beer.
Boags Strongarm Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"A very respectable low cost beer. None of the sweet cloying nature of the once good ""premium"", but a satisfying salty solid beer without much in the way of chemicals. Boags best performer in my view, punching well above its weight."
Boags Premium Lager;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375ml bottle from Beers of Europe. Pours clear gold with a tall white head. Aroma is grain, light hoppiness. Taste is light to medium sweet, grainy malt. Pretty hood, bit too sweet. A shame they added cane sugar.
Boags Premium Lager;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);33cl bottle at Zia Pina Pizzeria, Sydney on 21-Aug-2019.

Boags Premium Lager;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);The cream of the crop when it comes to Australian macro lagers. Hands down the most flavoursome one, that tastes of more than just stock feed flavoured water. That being said it is a mellow grainy taste with a mild/moderate hoppy bitterness. By no means the best beer in the world but in its class it is a standout.
Boags Premium Lager;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);And another beer bites the dust .... used to love this beer summer time they changed the recipe thye fkd it up may as well just drink hahn super dry tastes all the same . You say you had to drop the ABV to be competitive good luck with that ...
Boags Premium Lager;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);One of the best lagers in Australia, it's certainly a big step up from the other mass market Australian lagers but still nothing special. It's got a nice golden colour and a good head, and it's refreshing and easy to drink. A good session beer if nothing else

Boags Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Best by 03/04/19. Pours a clear gold with an inch of foam after things settle down. Leaves some lacing. Smells of grain, sweet malt, light bitterness. I'm not picking up the usual...corn. Taste is grainy but not corny, sweet malt mixed with a bit of bitterness. It's not overly flavourful but what's there agrees with me. Usual mouthfeel for the style. Definitely a cut above the other Aussie Lagers I've tried recently.

Boags Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A good honest beer for it’s style. Reasonable malt, pours a nice color. Pleasant enough on the nose. One of the best mainstream draughts around and a credit to the Tassie brewers. I’ll list it as one of my favorites and rate it ahead of others such as Carlton draught. Good in the bottle but just a pity there’s not a lot of it around on tap on the mainland. A pretty good drop for sure.
Boags Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Not really that much to say. A well balanced pale lager with moderate malty character.
Boags Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Deep golden. Bubbly head. Sweetish and a touch of biscuity malts. Clean, simple malty taste with relatively low bitterness.
Boags Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);4.7%ABV. Pale lager. Tapped out a light amber blonde. 6°SRM. Nose has some light beery very slightly yeasty aromas. Very pleasing. Easy to see why this is the most popular beer in Tassie. Nice laager type nose with clean sweet malt and grain aromas. No ester-like funk in the nose. Its somehow sweeter and cleaner and with less character at the same time. Clearly well-provisioned, just a function of which yeast is doing what to the malty sugars. Mouthfeel is carbonated. Sudsy. Palate is sweet malt. Barley bread with some nice toffee notes. Not too complex, but a very straightforward honest taste experience, much like the people of western Tasmania. No need for elaborate pretentions. Bitter sweet finish with slightly more hop character than expected in a straight lager. Clean finish, very pleasing. Goes on the list for being an honest straight up well-provisioned commercial brew. Goes on Favorites List!
Banff White Horn Pilsner;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Banff Brewery;341mL bottle poured light straw color with small white head which dissipated quickly.

Boags Light Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375ml bottle from Thirsty Camel 131214. Clear amber with crown of white foam. Grain and straw aroma is ordinary. Okay for a mass produced pale lager.
Boags Light Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Yeah, after buying this one I remembered that when Aussies call a beer ""light"" they REALLY mean it (in Canada our light beers are still 4%!). I actually like Boag’s Draught, but this is a faint shadow of itself. No surprises here."
Boags Light Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Fullest flavoured light I have ever tasted, rgeardless of what you yuppies reckon. The stuff is actually made by splitting a batch of draught in tow, driving the alchohol off one half, then mixing it back together, keeping much of its flavour. Not in the same league as the premo lights of any type, but way ahead of any other aussie well-priced light beer.
Boags Light Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Thank god they have stopped making this stuff. It was why so many people hated light beer. Watery crap I agree with Jahills it smells and tastes like a mouldy old fart. cheers
Boags Light Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I think they’ve stopped producing this stuff and probably a good thing too. Pubs in northern Tassie are preferring Bopags Premium Light on tap than this filth. It won’t be missed. RERATE: They’ve started producing this again, but under the name of Boags Draught Light as compared to Boags Light Draught (confused?). Now comes in exactly the samne looking stubby or can as Boags Draught except for the word Light in the middle. Actually tastes OK and very similar to the full strength version. Tried it in Tassie the other day (Feb 7 2006). Not sure if it’s available on the mainland.
Boags Light Draught;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Smells light a mouldy old fart, doesnt taste much better. Only drank it coz it was a leftover in the fridge. Tastes stale, flat and nothing like a good beer. Get Cascade Premium light instead any day of the week.

James Squire Jack of Spades Porter;Sydney, Australia;Porter;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours dark. Rich malty and hints of coffee and chocolate . Stronger than expected.

Clear bright medium-dark golden amber color, off-white head that drops to a thick rim, swirls of lace. Taste is semi-sweet malt, strong carbonation, and light hops. Slightly more tasty than all of the ""local"" lagers found in that area. I'd choose this over a lot of similar brews."

Banks Twist Shandy;Christchurch, Barbados;Radler / Shandy;Banks Barbados Brewery;"One of the best shandys I've ever had. In fact, it was my first Shandy I ever tried. I was 14 or 15 and on holiday in Barbados. Convinced my parents to let me try it and it was amazing. No shandy can beat this Banks Twist Shandy. Banks is the best Caribbean beer so of course Banks Twist will be great ;) It is quite lemonade- foward so if you prefer a more beer flavour then this shandy will probably be too sweet for you. But if you're like me and like it tasting 50/50, do try it next time you're in the Caribbean! I really don't understand why so many people are leaving half bad reviews. If you don't like sweet drinks then don't buy a Shandy.. Just buy a beer or something else! Saying it's 'too sweet' is ridiculous considering it's HALF LEMONADE, just like any other Shandy!"

Intensely sweet 7Up/sherbet lemon-like flavour before the sherbet kicks in; nothing beery detectable whatsoever. Would seriously hit the spot on Sandy Lane or Accra Beach of a sunny afternoon.

North Rock Whale of a Wheat;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;North Rock Brewing Co.;Cask@Frog and Onion, Dockyards, Bermuda.

Light malty flavor with a wheat finish. Trace of hops as well. Very refreshing brew with a good taste.
North Rock Island Pilsner;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;North Rock Brewing Co.;Astringently hopped? I don't think so. This is as good as a beer with no aroma and no flavor can be.
North Rock Old Colony Bitter;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Rock Brewing Co.;Honeymoon three years ago, but the bitter was quite even and just what I expected from an English bitter.

North Rock Old Colony Bitter;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Rock Brewing Co.;"Old colony is just bitter enough to please without overpowering the palate with that ""too bitter"" finish. It looks great, tastes great and goes great with everything on the menu"
North Rock West India Pale Ale;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;IPA;North Rock Brewing Co.;"This beer was a big disappointment. Trace hop aroma. Light amber body, nice head. Taste was lightly malty with some hops in the finish; way to few for an IPA. Tasted more like an American Pale Ale to me. Either that or I can no longer appreciate normal IPA's after having Stone Ruination."

Malty nose that contains some earthy elements. Light-bodied and sweet and skews to the malty side, but does contain touches of hops and fruit. However it is pretty one-dimensional overall. Average at best.
North Rock Somers Amber Ale;Smiths Parish, Bermuda;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;North Rock Brewing Co.;This was a good amber ale. Nice pillowy head--all the North Rock brews had this type of head--atop a light amber body with yellow highlights. Rich malt aroma with plenty of hop presence as well. Taste was of full-bodied malts well balanced by the hops.

The finish is somewhat bitter coffee and sweet chocolate. Pretty nice overall.

Deep brown in color with a pillowy head of microscopic bubbles. Rich malty aroma with a trace of hops. Fairly complex malt flavor with a good, hoppy finish. Great brew. Too bad I couldn't buy it in bottles and bring it home from the Island.

Kaiser Gold (Brazil);Jacareí (SP), Brazil;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;FEMSA Cerveja Brasil;"355ml bottle at Inhotim near Belo Horizonte (recommended as a day trip).

Kaiser Chopp Escuro;Jacareí (SP), Brazil;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA Cerveja Brasil;I had this years ago, 'escuro' meaning dark, 'chopp' meaning on tap. I even remember the place, Carlito's. They served Kaiser beer. Had many Chopps. Of course since I had this probably 5 years ago, it is hard to rate aside from my vague impression now. I remember *then* enjoying it, as it was one of the few dark beers I had in Brazil.
Alley Kat Amber Brown Ale;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Appearance: Pours a ruby colored body with a thick & fluffy off-white head. Smell: Nuts, malt, some caramel but not sweet. Creamy with slight hint of fruit but this is all on the low spectrum of aroma. It’s very but it’s brief. Taste: Starts out malty with a discreet caramel presence. Ends at first with a low bitterness. There’s a metallic feel to it, subtle, like licking the shell of a nut. As it warms, it has a weird spoiled finish to it. I almost downgraded the score to a 2.5 but it’s really only at the end and doesn’t terribly affect the taste though it is weird. Mouthfeel: Carbonation is a bit high but otherwise the smooth feel on the palate is pleasant though more of a low body than medium as the label states.
Alley Kat Amber Brown Ale;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Good head. Nice carmell and vanilla notes. Good Brown Ale. Very easy to drink on any day especially from draught.

Alley Kat Aprikat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Valemount 17/7 2018. 34,1 cl bottle from The Wine Merchant, Jasper. Simple orange label where I can get an understanding that this beer have a thing for apricot. Pours clear golden yellow with medium-sized white head. Settles as thin remnants of foam. No Lacing. Aroma is heavy with apricot essence. Sweet and cloying and artificial. It is so dominant that it overcomes any other odors. Light carbonation. Slightly thick texture. Flavor is heavy sweet. No discernible bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet. Lingering for a unpleasantly long time. A heavy handed effort by dumping a serious dose of apricot essence into a beer that result in what is closer to a way too sweet Dessert Wine than a beer. But fair enough: The name of this beer was a fair warning.
Alley Kat Aprikat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Pint on keg at Calgary Airport. Pours clear golden amber with a white head. Aroma: peaches, apricots, honey, a little wheat. Taste: moderate sweet, sweet malts, apricot juice, grassy, light tart. Light to medium body, soft carb, soft dry finish. Tastes a little artifical and more like juice than beer. Different for sure
Alley Kat Aprikat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;So I quite liked this, mainly because this smells and tastes more like dried apricots than freh ones, and I prefer dried apricots.

Alley Kat Full Moon Pale Ale;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Appearance: Pours a gorgeous orange body with a decent white head floating on top. Lots of lacing left on the sides. Smell: A good piney hop aroma with some solid malt. More on the dry side. Taste: At first i thought it was a little off but as it warms it does get better. More malt-driven that hops though the flavor of the hops (grapefruit) are quite present with a present but not overdone bitterness. Mouthfeel: Dry and a tiny bit metallic. As it warms it gets smoother but feels a little bit thin and light. Carbonation is spot on but something about the mouthfeel keeps it at average.

Electrifyingly pleasant aroma that consists of alcohol, caramel malt, dried berries, dates, and of course red wine. An expectedly robust texture with a vast depth and smooth cream like tactility. And finally to suit the intensive aroma and body, the taste contains alcohol, red wine, dried fruit with berries and grapes in particular, as well as caramel, vanilla, and perhaps cinnamon. Wonderfully vigorous.
Alley Kat Olde Deuteronomy Barley Wine;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottle. Deep reddish brown pour with a small, light tan head, some lacing. Aroma is caramel, honey, raisin, a little bready, hides the ABV nicely. Taste is a little more boozy, brown sugar, caramel, subtle dark fruits, a little bready as well, finishes with some nice bitterness to balance. A pretty flavourful and balanced barleywine.
Alley Kat Olde Deuteronomy Barley Wine;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Alley Kat Brewing Company;341ml 2016 bottle. Rich toffee, raisins and dried fruit. Boozy heat and sweet.
Alley Kat Olde Deuteronomy Barley Wine;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Sampled at Mechazilla’s epic insanity tasting session. 2011 vintage. Rich toffee, raisin and dried fruit, quite estery, can feel the alcohol heat too on the sweetish finish. A tad boozy maybe but still an impressive 5 year aged barley wine.
Alley Kat Olde Deuteronomy Barley Wine;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottle shared at Mechazilla event. Thanks Tim! 2011 vintage I believe. Caramel, aged musty notes with some apricot and oak. Soft and full-bodied with brown sugar, and a quality like a heavier campari as it warm, light vanilla. A great sipper.

Nethergate Old Growler (Bottle);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Porter;Nethergate Brewery;500ml bottle in 2011. Very dark brown with a beige head. Aroma of dark malt, fennel, fudge and cocoa. Decent body. Caramel, dark fruit, prunes and cake in the flavour.
Nethergate Old Growler (Bottle);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Porter;Nethergate Brewery;"Dark as a moonless night this beer is top league. It has power and taste a plenty; it is easy to see how it won the accolades and subsequent following. It’s bouquet is exquisitely rich quickly followed by a taste that wants for nothing."
Nethergate Old Growler (Bottle);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Porter;Nethergate Brewery;I like this beer....mainly for the flavor....but the rest is just about average. Good representation of the English style porter though. On the thinner side....darker brown appearance. Blend of flavors...mostly chocolate malt, some coffee/toffee, with that European yeast that I find in these porters. Also noticing some light fruity notes. A little pricey for the final result, but an interesting brew to sample.
Nethergate Old Growler (Bottle);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Porter;Nethergate Brewery;Pours dark brown, almost perfectly black, topped with medium beige head. Gentle biscuity nose with some chocolate. Gently sweet upfront, quite chocolatey with medium bitterness. Medium full body. Silky. Decent porter. Quite drinkable.

Clear, mahogany colour with ruby glimmer and small to average, thick, creamy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, off-white to beige head. Dark malty and fruity hoppy aroma, notes of cherry and plum, some chocolate, a roasty touch.

Nethergate Old Growler (Bottle);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Porter;Nethergate Brewery;Originally rated on 8/12/08. O.G. poured a dark black body, miniscule carbonation led to a tiny head. I didnt rate this beer very high because the aroma and flavor were rather strange. Almost like burnt black licorice, thats the closest thing to compare it with. It wasnt bad or offensive, just different. It was a little creamy and smooth, easy to drink. It was a decent brew, one i would probably try again to see if i could figure it out better.
Nethergate Old Growler (Bottle);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Porter;Nethergate Brewery;Malty, toffee aroma. Black colour with ok head. Nice caramel flavour up front with roasted nut and chocolate. Slightly bitter finish. Heavy body with medium carbonation.

Alley Kat Scona Gold;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Cream Ale;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Subtle, tasty cream ale. There aren't a lot of beers worth drinking twice in Alberta but this is one.
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;Bottle: Hazy brown-amber with a small tan head. Very fruity aroma....pear, peach..... Taste is slightly tart and sweet, fruits and citrus, caramel malt. Very lively......pretty good.
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;Bottle. Orange, peach, sugar, toffee malt, and grass aroma. Slightly hazy amber with moderate head. Mild sweet tart citrus/peach, toffee malt, mild sour citric acid, and mildly bitter hay flavor. Nice body. Very fruity. Interesting.
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;I kinda liked this one, rather interesting. My one complaint is that it was exceptionally foamy upon pouring, which took a long time to disapate. Aroma of apricots, citrus,coriander, and a slight peach presence. Body was a murky amber- tan with a monster head that eventually faded, not much lace left behind. Flavor was interesting with citrus hints and an almost spicy/earthy flavor being the most noticeable. Overall a pretty good beer that is worth a try. Originally rated on 10/15/08.
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;Amber, cloudy color with a relatively thick white head. Aroma is a little sweet and musty. Flavor is a bit sweet, notes of honey dominate the finish for me. Mild hops up front and pleasant bitterness. Biggest issue is the finish is a little off, slightly watery with a little funk. Not bad, just misses the mark a little. Wife: 3.6
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;"Pours clear, coppery amber with a thick but effervescent pale buff head. Fruity aroma is not strong or promising, but give it a fair shake. Malt comes forth in the flavor, which is bolder than the aroma; more than a hint of hops peeks through as the ale rolls across the palate. Mouthfeel has average body and fizz. If nothing remarkable, still refreshing on a torrid August day."
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;What the hell! They bamboozled me into buying an esb! Busted this out and took a sip I was all huh.... This tastes like an esb but it’s supposed to be a pale ale. No! It’s an esb! I hate esb! Aroma is Belgian like. Herbaceous. Looks just like an esb. Darker. Nice head. Amber brown. Tastes like an esb. Not as bad as others. Skunky but not terrible. Nops lingers but not terrible. Lemon note on the back of the throat. Palate is smooth. A little stale tasting like how the esb do. Overall this is a pretty enjoyable esb. Not my favorite style but I think it will surpass drain pour.
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;.5L bottle. Pours with a medium amber body and a rather weak head. Minimal lacing. Aroma: sweet caramel, baked bread and faint spicing. An unusual ESB, it is quite fruity and there’s some light coriander spicing that mixes nicely with the load of caramel malts. Lightly sweet this would probably benefit from a stronger hop load.
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;bottle @ Vino Bellissimo / Lima OH --- Clear medium amber with a heavy creamy tan head, small streaks of lace. Taste is malt with spices that turn bitter in the palate, cruising from there to an unchanging finish. Not a very appealing example of a malty, spicy, hoppy brew.
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;bottle. hazy amber with small head. has an odd flavor that reminds me a bit of overbrewed iced tea. slightly sweet and fruity at first, but then finishes bitter with a hint of sourness. light carbonation. unique, but not good.
Nethergate Augustinian Ale (US Version);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;Augustinian Ale has an extremely thick, spongy, off-white head, a good amount of lacing left on the glass, and a hazy, super-fizzy, orange appearance, with roiling specks and relatively large brown chunks throughout. When the bottom contents are swished and poured in, a brown, dirty cloud descends into the glass. The aroma is harsh and of turned citrus. There is also pungent sour bread in the smell. Taste is of red clay, iron, sweet citrus, cellar mold, bread crust, tea, and tap water. Mouthfeel is chewy and dirty, and Augustinian Ale finishes semi-dry and rough. RJT
Alley Kat Redneck Beer;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alley Kat Brewing Company;341mL bottle poured golden color with moderate head and traces of lacing. Aroma is very light grassy. Taste is lightly sweet with a light hop finish. Slightly better than average beer.
Alley Kat Redneck Beer;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Got to love the label, being from the Southwest. decent hop and malt presence. Clean and crisp, not a great beer, but drinkable.
Nethergate Golden Gate;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;"September 11, 2018 - at The Sheaf (Southwark) - on handpull cask. As ""Redcar Golden Ale"" - but clearly brewed by Nethergate so I doubt it's a separate entry thus it goes in here. Amberish-gold pour with minimal head. Sweet and biscuity light aroma, hint of nutmeg or some sweet spice, a decent overlay of dry, minerally grassy bitterness keeps the sweetness in check. Nice balance to the taste - semi-sweet grain, low alcohol and enough grassy/floral bitterness to keep it on the right track; very old school and clean. Light body and carbonation, quick finish, a little zap of grassy bitterness then a quick fade off the palate. Refreshing, like chewing on fresh hay on a summer's day."

Nethergate Golden Gate;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys London as Nethergate Golden Gate , 4.5%. Pours more of a pale orange amber than gold, pretty clear, still with a minimal off white head. Aroma is fruited bread, apple and hot crossed bun. Mostly the latter. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is crumpet and white bread, touches of apple flesh but mostly bready. Crispbread finish with a soft lightly floral bitterness. It's quite a good beer overall. It won't impress you but it's a nicely judged and flavourful golden bitter. (6-4-6-4-13=3.3)

Nethergate Golden Gate;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask at the Ealing beer fest. Aroma is pritty minimal, but floural honey is key. Taste is all about the honey pale malts and flourla bittering hop. The definition of a golden/blonde ale.
Nethergate Golden Gate;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Ealing Beer Festival. Amber with no head. Sweet fruit, tobacco and wheat. Rather dull but the nice fruity finish with a hint of wheat just about sorts it.
Nethergate Golden Gate;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask handpull at Charles Dickens, London. Deep copper, thin beige head. Yeasty aroma.

Nethergate IPA;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask at the 9 Gallon, Warrington on Saturday 28th March 2015 All told this is a very ordinary, traditional and somewhat boring bitter, lacks a hoppy, crispy bite, bit biscuity and malty as opposed to hop driven, fine.

Alley Kat Razzykat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;341mL bottle poured reddish-golden with small head and little lacing. Aroma is sweet malts and raspberries. Taste is sweet malt balanced nicely with the tartness of the raspberries. Nice carbonation and light body make this beer very easy to drink.
Alley Kat Razzykat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"Somehow, this stuff is quite drinkable! Pours out a golden orange brew that is a bit cloudy and is topped off by an ok white cap. My bottle has a bunch of large chunks sitting on the bottom - and those chunks have virtually zero substance in my mouth... how odd. The aroma comes across decent enough but nothing here jumps out to make you say ""wow"": candy raspberries that still have enough tartness to keep the sweetness down, mild malts and light wheatiness (is that a word?), The taste comes across tart and totally void of hops which is great, raspberry flavour wanders between real fruit and candy, mild, well balanced malts and a hint of wheat. I’d say that this is just on the thin side but can’t really because what do you really expect? Good tartness, no lagging thick sweetness, finishes strong on aftertaste but that only lasts for a short bit. A pretty good product from Alley Kat."
Alley Kat Razzykat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"""Beer appears to be a dirty straw yellow to brown and way more chunks floating in then there should be I mean it looks like a handful of tapioca was thrown in. a sour powdery raspberry aroma with hints of flowers is coming up from the glass. Very dry taste with sour raspberry, wheaty malts and a extreme clean finish. Beer never gets to sweet or fake tasting. Ok beer to drink nothing to special."""
Alley Kat Razzykat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottle: Poured a light pink/red color ale with good size foamy head with good retention and no lacing. Loads of protein flake are also discernable,which makes this somewhat gross to drink. Aroma of lightly sour raspberries with no fake syrup is quite enjoyable. Taste is also sominated by some lightly sweet and sour raspberry with some malt also noticeable. A bit gross to look at but more enjoyable then I had anticipated.
Alley Kat Razzykat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"Draught at Hop In Brew Pub, Calgary Cloudy blond color; creamy head. It has a creamy aroma and flavor, with delicate raspberries, light residual sweetness and no acidity, and the bitterness is correctly low. I don’t fancy fruit beers, but I have to say this one is well brewed."
Alley Kat Razzykat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Last year, at a small festival, the Alley Kat spokesperson said this beer was being retired. I guess they weren’t prepared to let it go just yet! Bright clear burnt orange colour, decent short-lived head. Raspberry candy aroma dominates, but there is a sweet malt under there too. Unfortunately this came across as more raspberry candy synthetic flavour for me (I think I’m sensitive to this particular ester, because it really turns me off once I’m cued into it), however there is a bit of a perfumey element that at least made it interesting. There is some nice malt as well, making this drinkable in the end.
Alley Kat Razzykat;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Alley Kat Brewing Company;341ml brown bottle (fresh, Summer ’08 seasonal) Orangey gold colour, very light haze. Full white head, some lace. Strong sweet, candyish raspberry nose, though not unpleasant. Flavour has wheaty dry base malt udnerneath some sweet raspberry notes, faint tartness. Finish is quite dry. effervescent, light bodied, ok summer thirst quencher.
Alley Kat St. Paddys Red Ale;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Alley Kat Brewing Company;341mL bottle poured pale amber color with moderate white head and thin lacing. Aroma is of caramel malt and some floral hops. Tastes lightly sweet malt with light hop bitterness in the finish. A lighter body than expected and light carbonation were responsible for the lower score. I had higher expectations for this one and was slightly disappointed.
Alley Kat St. Paddys Red Ale;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Alley Kat Brewing Company;i dont know what the big thing is.......this tasted like shit, get a real beer, this tasted like black jelly beens,.......fuck it, its gross
Alley Kat St. Paddys Red Ale;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Alley Kat Brewing Company;good beer, malts and hops well balanced, but still a little light for me. Only had on draught, was the first of Alley's beers I tasted according to my notes.
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Originally reviewed Mar. 5, 2007: mmmmm. smells like grandma. uh. yeah. hahahahaa. poured with good fizz, but no head that stuck around. looks very pale with specks of floating bits throughout. of course, smells and tastes like apple pie. very interesting to say the least. has a pop-like feel. mmmm.
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;341mL bottle poured hazy amber color with big white fluffy head which settled quickly to a fine thin lacing. Aromas of various Christmas spices similar to apple pie. Taste is a blend of spices and sweet maltiness with a very mild hop finish. Overall, a nicley done beer for the Christmas season, it’s just too bad they had to retire this one.
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottle shared courtesy of Josh. Poured a lighter yellow color with a smaller sized white head. ***Gusher Alert*** Some smaller floaters. Aromas of apples, cinnamon, and all ins of other spices. X-Mas candles. Tastes of the same spices and apple fruitiness. Fizzy body.
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;***review from Dec, 2006*** Liquid homemade apple pie. Looks like really watered down peach juice that is somewhat hazy - up to a light you can see lots of suspeneded stuff. Super quick fizz-up, then, poof - gone - with midium sized bubbles. Smelt just like fresh, hot apple pie. Lots of cinnamon with some strong spices in the background and a coating of honey. Taste is pie, honey, yeast and the above spices. Kind of has a pop-like feel to it and a dry yeast and sourness with some lingering spice.
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"Very pale hazy yellow, big sticky bubbles cling to the sides of the glass but real head was really produced, the beer actually reminds me of pop the way it fizzes. Smells like home made apple pie, cinnamon, apple, faint hints of malt also show up, very interesting and unique aroma I think I like it but could get sick of it. Man this is liquid apple pie; some one took a pie through it in a blender with a malty beer to make the blended pie easer to pour and through it in a bottle. Tons of cinnamon and apple comprise 99% of the flavor and a touch of honey, very clean taste no real lingering after taste to speak of. Strange brew, enjoyable and unique but if I drank more then one a mount I think I would get sick of it."
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;(355ml bottle) Sampled at Ciderwinder 5 in Victoria. Cloudy, gold. Nose of Apple Fritter Quaker Oats instant oatmeal. Very satisfying meld of spices amongst the honey finish. So very nicely done. Cheers!
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Rated the 2007 braggot. Pale, cloudy. No head. Big cinnamon aroma with nutmeg. Wow - kind of spritzy but otherwise some very cool flavours. You have an intense upfront spiciness. Then sweet, sugary malts, plus a great mead character that kicks in late with honey and alcohol. This really brings it all to the table.
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Tasty, but sweet. Cloudy peach colour with the aroma and taste of this fruit bread I used to eat toasted with butter ages ago so this clouds my judgment somewhat. It does have a warming feel to it and may taste better warm.
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"Brian Westcott from Alley Kat said ""This is the first time we’ve brewed a ""braggot"" (mead with a little beer in it, as we don’t have the license to produce mead, which is technically a wine I guess). SO, I don’t know how the heck people are going to rate it compared to previous years, since its been different every time its been brewed... not that it really matters, as long as people enjoy it."" This years version is 5.5% . The colour was a big surprise. I was expecting copper and got a thin grapefruit. Almost no head. Aroma of honey, apple pie and strong cinammon. Tastes like a thin cider with too much cinammon. Slightly bitter finish. I might try a couple of ounces mulled."
Alley Kat Weihnachtskatze;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Dave at Willow Park in Calgary is a genius and managed to get this in for the holidays. Now I’m not sure what the previous raters had, but this beer is absolutely nothing like a dunkel. It is pale golden yellow in colour and very hazy, almost like a witbier in appearance. I know the description says it is toffe coloured, but they must have changed this beer considerably since that description was written. To quote Dave, it smells like a glass of Apple Jacks-- fruity and VERY cinnamony. Feels almost champagne-like on the palate, with abundant fine carbonation and some yeasty-doughy character, but then the sweet fruit and rich Christmas spices take over. A really nice holiday beverage to be sure, but extremely sweet. I appreciate the craftsmanship as well as the festive feel of this beer, but in the end it is just too sweet for me.
Alley Kat Smoked Porter;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Porter - Smoked;Alley Kat Brewing Company;A dark coloured brew with great aroma of wood and caramel. Taste is very so-so and thin-watery mouthfeel. Like carbonated water, smoke flavoured. Maybe there is a bit of coffee and chocolate malt
Alley Kat Smoked Porter;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Porter - Smoked;Alley Kat Brewing Company;500mL swingtop bottle poured dark brown with sparse beige head and very light lacing. Aroma is smoke and wood with a hint of cherry. Taste is smoky sweet at first with a light hoppy finish and more smoke. Light carbonation and lighter body detract from the score.
Alley Kat Smoked Porter;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Porter - Smoked;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Deep dark colour. Lovely aroma--lovely smoke flavour--strong, but not overwhelming. No sourness--different batch than the 2005, with much better balance.
Alley Kat Smoked Porter;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Porter - Smoked;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottled. Pours a deep tan head that lingers. Deep dark rich mahogany color pushing limits of style. Big smoky cherry blasts you in the face like sticking your head in a smoker. This does mask the malts a bit much. However, in the flavour the sweet caramel maltiness comes through and it ends dry from both the smoke and the dark malts. Cherry dominates the smoke profile. No sourness here, maybe it did not travel well. Excellent campfire beer or on a cool winters evening.
Alley Kat Smoked Porter;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Porter - Smoked;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Brown, opaque w/ frothy grey-brown foam. Sweet, burnt caramelized sugar aroma w/ light notes of smoke & instant coffee. Medium feel. Sweet, caramelized sugar flavour w/ some mildly tart acidic notes & a hint of burnt wood in the finish.
Alley Kat Smoked Porter;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Porter - Smoked;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Dark brown, tan head. Strong aromas of campfire and coffee. Smoke character predominates, but there are dark malts present too. Fairly light in the body, woody finish. Delicious!
Alley Kat Smoked Porter;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Porter - Smoked;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Sample at DougShoemaker’s 2005 December gathering - bottle courtesy of presario via mr_kimchee. Dark brown cola-like appearance. Aroma is quite smoky, and very appealing - definately the highlight of this beer. Body is thin and lifeless. Flavour holds the expected smokiness, but also has a sourness that might have been intentional, but it really turned me off. Too bad, I was really looking forward to this one.

Alley Kat Smoked Porter;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Porter - Smoked;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottle at ’December at DougShoemaker’s 2005’ -- courtesy of mr_kimchee. Pours a clear dark brown with a spare light-brown head. Interesting smoky aroma, quite unique for a Porter -- really nice.

Swans Riley's Scotch Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Swans Brewpub;August 17th, 2012 - Aha! Here’s the beer from Swan’s Hotel that makes the whole taster flight worth it. If you look at a history of my beer samples, you’ll see the whole line - up until this moment - has been a collection of disappointments. But the Scotch Ale is the savior, kilted and wielding the grand claymore of flavor. As scotch ales tend to do, it tastes very much like a scotch ale, and tilts towards the sweeter side of the flavor spectrum, with a wonderfully rich bread savoriness and a a satisfyingly sweet layer of molasses. The alcohol lends this ale a heavy booziness too, which gives a one-two punch with the low attenuation and sweetness with this brew. Whereas most of Swan’s stuff has been flimsy and stale, the Scotch Ale is vibrant and thick with flavor - a nice change of pace, and at last, a reason to visit an otherwise quaint pub setting.

Opaque black, brown color with a big, thick, frothy brown head. Aroma of roasted malt, Navy beans and bitter hops. Sweet roasted malt flavor. Midtaste has toffee, salty notes. Finish is slightly dry and brief. Lightly carbonated and full bodied with good balance. Rather unique for a stout. Creamy, as the label says."
Watneys Cream Stout;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Bottle (Old Notes-Brewed by Stag Brewery-London)-Pours black with a decent sized head. Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste of the same with creaminess. This medium bodied brew is a bit light in body but still darn tasty.
Watneys Cream Stout;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);A rating from many, many years ago. I thought this was sort of weak for an English stout. Still very drinkable, however.
Watneys Cream Stout;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);I don’t normally enter beers I’ve had but didn’t take notes on, but I got an old bottle of this in a trade (which had majorly turned) and between that and the fact that I drank about a zillion of these when I first got the stout bug I feel confident I’m not doing the beer a disservice. It’s very similar to many of the tropical stouts and I’m sure they used sugars to give it the molasses and raisin flavors it possessed. It had a very low roast/burnt profile and was much more geared toward sweetness like Belco Stout. It did have some nice drawn out raisin and prune notes ala Anchor Porter, but again with little roast to rein it in.
Watneys Cream Stout;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Great creamy smooth with a nice weight and color, good follow up, no bitteness
Watneys Cream Stout;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Whatever happened to this? The site says it’s retired, which must be why I haven’t seen it in some years. This was the first stout I drank back in the early 1990s. It was good, with a fairly creamy body and moderately smooth taste. It had a little bit of a burnt toasty flavour, but not too much. It was drinkable but overall not among the greater stouts out there to my memory. My score may be a little off for what I would give this now, but this is about how it fits in with Guinness, Newcastle, and Sierra Nevada, which I was drinking at the same time before really expanding my horizons.
Watneys Cream Stout;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Very toasty malt but short of actually burnt, somewhat creamy, sadly underhopped and just some odd aftertaste I can’t place. Perhaps partly grainy alcohol. Not bad but somehow a bit off somewhere. Starts off far better than it finishes.

Watneys Cream Stout;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);tap and bottle: i used to love this stuff in the early '90s but dont think its available anymore because of macro buying out the other dudes or something like that. many times i had it, there was that sweet alcohol taste either it was hight in ABV or old beer. probably old because nobody was brave enough to drink it back in the day. rest in peace my watney red barrel and cream stout...
Watneys Cream Stout;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Looked good, aroma consisted of roasted malt and semi-sweet choclate. Taste was sweet, almost too sweet covering both the taste of alcohol and roasted malt. The bottle spent about 1.5 years in my aunt's fridge.
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);A fine English ale ahead of the curve of European imports. It had good flavor and was very enjoyable.
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);My first introduction to English draft bitters was Watneys at the British Lion Pub at the New York World’s Fair in 1964. I thought it was terrific- low carbonation, caramel notes, about 4% abv. A great beer for starters.
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);I thought it was good. But I was young & dumb and probably high at the time.
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);In the early 70s, I used to drink this on tap at an English style pub & restaurant in suburban Chicago called the Come Back Inn. I remember it being pretty good at the time, very early in my import then craft beer journey. So long ago, but I recall it tasting and looking very much like the Bass Ale now brewed by AB/Inbev in Baldwinsville, NY. Obviously, Bass Ale brewed in England is the superior product, but the watered down AB version is much like what Watney's Red Barrel tasted like.
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);I signed up just to rate this beer. I remember a strong caramel flavor. I used to chill it in the fridge and as I sipped the flavor would slowly change as it warmed. I really liked this beer but my tastes are very different than others. NOW, the mind blower - I have an unopened bottle in my fridge right now! It is over 14 years old. Piss water you may say BUT I had a second bottle that I opened two years ago and although the flavor had changed a bit, it was still close to the original and very drinkable! I did meet a guy who brewed his own and had a brew that was almost spot on to Watney’s but he’s passed on now. I would love to know if someone has a recipe or has found a substitute to the original. On a stack of bibles, this is the honest truth
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);I used to think this was the worst beer ever made, but later in life I discovered John Smiths smooth, even worse.
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);I used to enjoy Watney’s Red Barrel at a bar in Port Washington, NY where my college rock band used to play between 1966 and 1968. This bar was frequented by international types (I can remember one Scottish lass and her Swedish friend). Watney’s draft was the most popular beer in the place. Nowadays, I’m much older and enjoy microbrews and imports with deeper flavors. I’ve often looked for Watney’s but never found it. Now I know why: production ended!
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);330ml bottle tried many years ago (circa 1995) with brewer listed on bottle as Watney Combe Reid and Company poured a pale amber color with a small white head that revealed a small amount of lace. Aroma was caramel with some light hops. Taste was a caramel malty sweetness with a moderate hoppy bitterness. Was a decent amber ale but nothing special.
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);"Back in the day - late 70’s - I would pick up some of this this as my standard sunday afternoon ""take the edge off drink. I’m surprised at the commerical description - I remember it fondly and considered it a treat to be consumed only in moderation - which is why I seldom consumed more that a couple of the two liter bottles at a sitting. But, back in the day we didn’t have as much to pick from..."
Watneys Red Barrel;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);I have to recall to review. About 1978, I used to buy this is in 2 liter plastic bottles, and the beer was so drinkable. I think I polished one off in a sitting once.

Aroma: Dark sweet malts, coffee, a bit of grain, chocolate, slight cough syrup, pepper. Appearance: Transparent dark red/brown with an off-white mocha head that didn’t last long. Taste: Sour? Kinda sour but it’s really like a weak porter with the roasted malts and low hop bitterness. The shitty thing is it’s kinda dry for what it is and has a cigrit aftertaste. Slight dark chocolate/weak coffee flavours. Palate: Mouthfeel is quite thin. Balance is kinda shit with the sour thing going on. CO2 is good. I don’t know, all I taste is malt and water which is kinda boring. Overall: This is alright, but nothing special for sure.

Nelson Old Brewery Pale Ale;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);Tried many years ago in an odd sized bottle which I believe was around 610ml. Pours amber in color with an adequate white head that leaves some thin spotty lacing. The aroma on this one is quite fantastic with a lovely bouquet of fresh flowery hops and some citrus. Taste is also hop dominant with a citrusy hop bitterness with some grass and a light caramel malty sweetness. This brew was likely much better than the newer offering.
Nelson Old Brewery Pale Ale;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);341mL bottle, pours a hazy orange with a small white head. Aroma of grassy / floral hops and some sweet malts. Flavour of sweet corn malts and grassy hops - tastes more like an American-style pale ale. Pretty standard affair.

Nelson Old Brewery Pale Ale;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);355 mL can. Rusty orange with a very slowly dissipating off-white head. Smell is nutty-malty-herbal. Pretty good. The flavour doesn’t quite match up. The hops are nice, but the malt profile is thin and uninteresting. Light body. Could be something with some tinkering.

Nelson Old Brewery Pale Ale;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);***review from Aug 2, 2008*** Old Brewery Pale Ale is a really good blend of Canadian brewing and an English Pale Ale - I can see both in this quite obviously. So, not an English PA, more of a hybrid that is good in my books. a light amber brew that is slightly hazy, pours out an ok sized tan head that is less than creamy in texture, leaves a respectable amount of random lacing. Bready, biscuity malts, maybe a hint of caramel too, the hops are muted a bit but some sweetness is found in the citrus. Seems slightly on the watery side but this is not a distraction. Just as the malts are forming an impression, the hops (which are not strong what so ever) step all over it. As this warms the malts hold on longer with biscuit and caramel but at the same time the hops gain a more defined flavor of citrus, leafy, very weak pine. Malt beginning, hop middle, malt finish. Light medium bodied, good standard PA after taste of lengthy bitterness. I really want to put this up against some average EPA’s because I want to see how much of the style this beer has really retained. Very enjoyable, one of the only western Canadian versions of this style that do it justice.
Nelson Old Brewery Pale Ale;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);Awesome aroma. Full, deep and rich hops that truly make clear the use of whole leaf hops in this one. Lush forest moss and evening sweet grass everywhere. Hands down one of the best noses I have come across. The forest moss follows directly into the mouth and though the hops fade a bit, they remain prominent. A little more malted barley mid-palate to accompany the bitterness would have really put this one among the elite. A little bit too soft in the mouth. Finish is dry but shows hints of brown sugar and surely closes the book on a delicious hops adventure.
Nelson Paddywhack IPA;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);355ml can. Caramel and lemon citrus aroma. Pours a cloudy brown colour with mid-sized off-white head. Fairly sharp citrus bitter flavour with some solid balancing malt notes. Medium body. Long bitter finish.

Nelson Paddywhack IPA;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);Aroma: citrus, tropical fruit, pine, caramel malt. Taste: medium low sweet, moderate bitter. Palate: medium to full body, moderate carbonation, medium bitter finish. Similar to their session IPA, except with more NW-style hops and more emphatic presence. Decent.
Nelson Paddywhack IPA;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);A sleeper, for me at least. Nelson Brewing’s been around since 1991 and I hadn’t had anything of theirs for a long time. Last summer I found a few bottles of Paddywhack IPA in a friend’s cabin fridge and was blown away. A great Pacific Northwest style IPA, right in the sweet spot between wimpy IPA’s in name only, and the monstrous high-alcohol super-hopped mega-IPA’s so many breweries have been putting out the past few years. Those are showy, gaudy freak shows (albeit often yummy) compared to solid class and balance of this Paddywhack IPA. Which is not to say it’s mild -- you get that wonderful full blast of aromatic, citrusy Pacific Northwest hops which marks this style, grounded by a just-right mouth bitteness and comparatively light malty body. It’s similar to Central City’s phenomenal Red Racer India Pale Ale, not just in style (they’re both classic expressions of the Pacific Northwest IPA) but also in quality. Yes, I said it! This is an unduly overlooked long-standing gem of the BC craft brewing scene which deserves to be rediscovered.
Nelson Paddywhack IPA;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);Pours clear golden amber with a thick fluffy off white head. Good lacing. Aroma is sweet and citrusy.

Mad Anthony Ol' Woody Pale Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Average Pale Ale at best. What else is there to say. Cannot be compared to any of the greats in the craft movement. ----Hophaze out
Mad Anthony Ol' Woody Pale Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Taster on tap at the brewpub. Clear orange color. Good thin off-white head. Dots and ropes of lace. Medium body. Smooth, sort of soft lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Caramel malt, and a moderately hoppy finish. Light spicy. Light piney / citrusy hop. Balanced flavor profile, but nothing too exciting. Hint of metallic. Moderate bitter taste, light sweet. Solid pale ale, pretty good. I liked it better than the IPA.
Mad Anthony Ol' Woody Pale Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Sampled at DLD 2013. It poured a clear amber color with a white head. The aroma was of medium hoppiness and citrus. It had a light to medium body. The taste was similar with a well balanced medium flavor with a small bitter finish.
Mad Anthony Ol' Woody Pale Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;12 oz. bottle Courtesy of Queenholly. My English pint is displaying a lightly hazy amber color. Nice retention down the glass. Nose is indeed lightly woody with pine notes. Tastes of Earthy, pine hops, caramel malts with hints of toffee. Bitterness is light having the light pine showing up in the finish. It’s a respectable Pale Ale.
Mad Anthony Ol' Woody Pale Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;12 ounce bottle The last part of a mixed six pack, this was picked up out of curiosity. The result is a decent local on par with most regional only breweries. That said I am in no hurry to try more Mad Anthony unless there is a good sale going on. Aroma / Appearance - The carbonated amber base supports an ivory head that floats like chunks of icing. Orange glaze, resin, and a wheat base are hardly aggressive. Instead it smells like a woody cabin at the beginning of the camping season. Flavor / Palate - Resin, almonds, and grassy hops impress a bit. Overall this is pretty average for an American pale. If it were my local I wouldn’t be totally upset. However I am not going to buying more any time soon.
Mad Anthony Ol' Woody Pale Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Bottle courtesy of queenholly. Thanks! Pours a fairly hazy amber color with a thin tan head. Decent head retention. Aroma of woody, earthy hops with caramel malts and a bit of apple. The taste is herbal, woody hops, some citrus, caramel malts and a dry finish. Medium bodied, slight lingering bitterness. Decent APA.

Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Draft. Nutty caramel malt aroma. Deep chestnut with a large off-white head. Nutty caramel malt flavor. Body on the light side of medium, moderate carbonation.
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;<b>Draft:</b> Pours a dark brown with no head...aroma is toasted malts, nutty, some oats and a bit of and English-style hoppiness. Somewhat silky mouth feel...medium bodied. Flavor is toasted malts, bread dough and nuts with a pleasant, subtle hop finish. Nice brown ale.
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;"draft - For this year’s brown ale, the bartender confirmed that it’s the Big Daddy Brown, and it certainly tastes different than last year’s ""brown ale"" that everyone insisted was a different beer. The difference is that this one is good. It’s not so thin/watery. It’s medium bodied with a very good caramel malt and nut flavor. It pours dark brown with a thin head that leaves a bit of lace and all those malts give it a pleasant caramel aroma. It’s a good example of the style and a good session beer."
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Pours brownish-amber with very little head. Aroma is of light roasted malt. Flavor is reminescent of smoked coffee and malt. Thin body however for a true brown.
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This is a true brown, mostly clear with a decent just barely tan head. The head forms reasonably well but eventually fades completely. The aroma has a big burst of almost-coffee, chocolate and a bit of toasted pecans. The nuttiness switches from a supporting player in the aroma to the dominant taste in a flavor that just doesn’t live up to the promise of the aroma.
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Tap. Some nutty and slight chocolate flavors are present. A very drinkable, smooth beer. Kind of thin though.
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Deep amber out of the bottle with only an oil slick for a head and a malty nose with hints of roasty nuttiness. Sweet roast coffee flavor. Almost white sugar sweetness. Very few hops tasted in here. Very light in body. Not unpleasant.
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Blah. I'm not impressed. At an event like the Great Taste of the Midwest, this is one of the beers you pour out in order to preserve brain cells. I'd finish it under other circumstances, tho.
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Medium brown. Didn't detect much of a nose around here. Some interesting roasted malts. Fine ale.
Mad Anthony Big Daddy Brown;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Smooth and nutty without the graininess that I detected in their other beers. Slightly drier and bitter as it warms. Decent brewpub fare from another Hoosier brewer.
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;This is one of my favorite beers. I find it very drinkable with medium bite and a very smooth creamy aftertaste with hints of a slight copper taste common to many Canadian beers. The draft version is far ’Superior’ than the bottled/canned offerings. Nothing like getting a ’large’ at Time Out in the Soo. (a large is a 32 oz mug) To sum up, while this beer is a bit nostalgic for me and my past visits to the Soo, I really enjoy the light refreshing nature of this brew and the very smooth and creamy aftertaste. I can’t understand why the negative reviews. Try it on tap before you pass judgement.
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;The taste of pepper comes to mind when I tried this. Not bad, not a big deal, its alright. probably will have again, out of nostalgia.
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Pale gold, white head. Average looking lager beer. Sweet malty aroma , some fruity lager notes . Fruity like beer , total lack of hops . Hmm . Medium body , softer finish . Alcohol is showing up later on.
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;"When Doran’s owned the ""soo"" brewery they produced a northern tavern grog labeled ""Doran’s lager"". Other offerings from the old brewery were Doran’s ’55’ and silver spray lager. The recipe for this superior lager seems to have the same peculiar hopping and malt mix that made Doran’s lager a staple of the northern lakeshore taverns in the 60s and 70s, but the process must have changed because this beer is not crystal clear. This rendition by Northen brewery is called “superior” lager: Pours a murky pale gold color, slight hints of hops and a sour yeasty smell to the nose, starts crisp, mouth feel has a light- body heavy on the hops with some undecernable flavors (corn? rice?) and a finish punctuated by yeast….which isn’t filtered very well.....the haze could be protiens as this was served very cold. A local drink for the deck of the laker or salmon boats that cruise south Superior and the 3-brand-taverns proliferating the superior Canuck shore....and little else. 2 0r 3 is enough! I drink this stuff when I go north to the salmon or moose camp…… for a nostalgia thing...gives you a sense of where you are, it’s a northern Ontario tradition.. I bought some down south here and it hasn’t the same impact as when you’re chugging one staring at superior’s craggy shoreline from a trolling salmon boat.. On the patio in an urban T’ranna pub it seems out of place…………and rightfully so…..this is a logger’s lager. Just recently had this beer on tap at the Lakeside hotel in Wawa northern Ontario. (say hi to Woody for me if you drop in) I revised my ratings accordingly. This beer was made at Northern’s other plant that kegs draft and it was a good draft beer. I don’t care for it bottled and never in a can. I do recommend the draft version to anyone visiting Northern Ontario who wants to truely experience the ""local flavor""."
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Finally I got around to this beer.... Clear golden yellow. Not much carbonation...White head with slight creaminess. Lasts for some time. Sweet caramel aroma. Smell of candies at your grandma's. Malty sweet better then your average though nothing special.
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Its Northwestern Ontario''s microbrew for those unfortunate enough to find themselves in the Sault or Thundetr Bay. Not bad but you can tell they don''t get out much...
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Well, I'm back from my trip to NorthEastern Ontario and I found this beer on my travels. I had it sitting in a lawn chair watching a beautiful sunset over Lake Superior, after which the beer is named, not because it is superior to other American Standards. Sugary, dry, slight hoppy finish. And Josh, I managed a 24 of this stuff and I may even have brought you a surprise.
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Not as bad as Josh said: maybe he had a skunky batch. But definitely a boring lager and nothing superior about it. Brewed in Sudbury as far as I know and not the Sault. Anyway your standard macrobrewed swill - light on malt flavour (ie. light in body) and light in hop character.
Northern Breweries Superior Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Awful. Odd fruity taste hints at too high a fermentation temperature. There are some hop flavours, but they mix so poorly with the esters that it actually makes the beer worse. Malt flavours are lacking, body is almost syrupy (for a lager) and the finish is tough to choke back. If you can finish a six-pack, you're a better man than me.
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;"I used to drink this in local bars on draught in one of my own gestures to support local business in my town. My rating here is based on timing and there being a fresh batch on tap that delivered its true and best aspects. It had a nice malt-hops aroma and more character than the other macros that were on tap besides it being good value for my hard-earned beer money. Gold body with a nice white head that laced the sides of the pitcher and glass. A likeable pale ale with a light malt taste, an overtone of bread crust, and a bready finish but there was something about it that had a most terrible propensity for the hang-over. At one time a new owner took over and improved on the product -as if the pipes were cleaned up at the brewery, giving the final product an overall better taste and a cleaner finish besides the morning after the night before seeming to be less traumatic. I was saddened to see that the new investor lost his shirt and had to close shop due to there not being enough local support. It was as if the local beer drinkers had a collective vendetta against this ""foreigner"" who came in and tried to make something better out of something the locals should have been proud of. Many locals called it Northern Stale and I partially agree: if you didn’t order it in good timing and/or if the bar you were visiting was eager to sell off a bad or stale keg, you, the beer drinker were guaranteed a disappointment, and that disappointment got more prevalent the further you were away from where it was made when you ordered Northern on draught. One thing I know about that beer: the draught keg version did not travel well. It was here in Sudbury where the travel distance was shortest between the brewery and the bar that I had my best experiences with this beer on draught. You know what? I miss it."
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;found some notes of this beer i had way back in the winter of 2004. Had it on draught in my hometown of Sturgeon Falls. Nothing fancy, it’s wattery, and pretty weak. Slight malt in the aroma anf flavour, no hops to speak about. meh. typical northern ontario swill.
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;"Draught. At my hotel bar, Sudbury. Guess it’s not retired on draught - they poured a few of these, it can’t be that old! Poured clear slightly bubbly gold with a decent creamy white lasting draught head. Mild aroma of straw, mild hops, slightly corny malt (sweet) and a little banana; got a little vegetal as it warmed. Taste was minerally, mild grains and hops, a little sweet but not to the degree promised in the bouquet, an interesting hint of not-fresh apple cores; finished quickly and a touch metallic/bitter after a few gulps. Mouthfeel minerally and carbonated, decent enough body - a fairly acceptabled non-macro Canadian ... well, it’s called an ale, it seemed more like a lager."
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;I bought it more out homesickness then anything, not a bad ale at all, more points out of nostalgia. Better then most macro ales. I rather enjoyed it, bitterness could be a little more, but good enough.
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;This beer used to be on tap from North Bay to Port Arthur all through the 70s when Doran’s made it. Northern ale was the beer they sucked back at the Timmin’s Maple Leaf tavern watching “Stompin’ Tom” come off the floor . This stuffs been around since before the 60s and a couple of generations of Northerners relate to this beer. Since the brewey was taken over and they took their water from different sources, this beer has undergone some periodic changes. What is being offered now is the best they can do with the recipes they have but the process is wanting. This is NOT the Northern that wrested the North Country taverns from Labatts and Molson’s. This stuff pours a pale gold with lots of carbonation. Little suggestion of hop or grain smell.......what I got wafted up with a lot of carbonation and veggies. Light head that leaves quickly. A great tart, crisp start this fades as the palate is filled with a heavy grain-vegetable taste (for a light ale) and a finish that has a lingering sweet-malt taste….not what I like in a light ale. But still better than most Canadian macro ales aimed at the mass market.
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;Of course it isn''t the best in the world but it is a decent choice over many other brews. It had an aroma that wasn''t anything special it looked like beer and the head was nice and fluffy, plus it didn''t disappear quickly. While it wont make you howl at the moon it is a decent beer. I didn''t mind its flavor
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;Not a bad ale if stuck in a mineshaft but if offered an alternative you know what to do.
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;Standard canadian/american lager. Order this one by the pitcher once you're drunk.
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;Quite a malty scent, golden, fluffy head. Medicinal taste, good bitterness though. Unpleasant.
Northern Breweries Northern Ale;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northern Breweries;Macrobrewed example of Canadian Ale. Not awful but not noteworthy..........
Northern Breweries Northern Extra Light;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;From old tasting notes. Medium honey gold color. Big creamy white head. Faint tart hop aroma. Light sour flavor with some hop bitterness. Light dry finish.
Northern Breweries Northern Extra Light;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Originally rated September 2005. On the label, four medals represent the gold winnings this brew won in the 80’s. Pours a pale yellow, but not as pale as Busch beers. Some golden colour is also found. Decent white head that dissapears quickly, and some lace is there in small patchy quantity. Good aroma of grain malt. Watery mouthfeel, very lightly bodied. The taste is quite light too, with some corn, malt and a touch of hop. Not bad on the first one, but gets disgusting after having 3-4 of them.
Northern Breweries Northern Extra Light;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Mixed with a half an inch of lime cordial it makes a great shandy. Not necessarily a favorite drunk straight, but that’s not how I drink it.
Northern Breweries Northern Extra Light;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Bottle from the Beer Store. Pours a very pale yellow body with a thick and short lived white head. Lots of carbonation. Aromas are faint. Some hops, some malt. TIny skunk. Taste is watery as all hell......with some hops. Very light bodied, watery finish. Just what you’d expect from an extra light beer I suppose.
Northern Breweries Northern Extra Light;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;I have consumed tap water that was darker than this. Smells like water but with a hint of hop. Some sourish grainy notes, but okay maltiness for the size of beer. There are a few bready and hoppy notes, but it tastes half-finished. Not awful, but needs work.
Northern Breweries Northern Extra Light;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Wow, even lighter than Labat Select. Almost transparent. Small white head. Hard to find any aroma, some faint fruity aroma. Thin body, popcorn aftertaste, then mineral water finish. Extra light indeed.
Northern Breweries Northern Extra Light;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Oh yes I get to be the first to rate this beer. I found it at a place in Brantford called the Warehouse. Yes I found this in a bar... strange. Light pale yellow wolf piss no head after 30 seconds. Carbonated. No aroma to talk about. Tasted like grass. Cheap filth. and I ask myself why...
Northern Breweries 55 Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;"Not great, but for a ""Canadian Light Lager,"" meh, I’d drink one in a canoe. Light, grassy, but mostly hay in the aroma. Watery and easily drinkable. I’m not sure where I got this beer... it seems to have materialized out of nowhere on my trip to MN..."
Northern Breweries 55 Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;"Finally got around to tasting this again on a trip west I stopped at the riverfront tavern in Sault St. Marie...last time I had it Dorans ran the brewery. It was aparently named and brewed to commemorate the centennial of the sault locks in 1955....it still retains a hint of the character of the brews of those days that were sold by the tray full in ""soo"" locks River street taverns and Algoma mining town taverns. This is a rough neck lager meant to be swilled by the pitcher full to be sure. Weak straw color but nice malt and grassy hop smells..small white head that laces quickly. Starts crisp and tart builds to a medium malty hop balanced body then the finish is smooth with a lingering malty sweetness....nothing fancy here just a standard Canadian commercial lager the way they were brewed in the 50s and 60s."
Northern Breweries 55 Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;"All things considered, it's a good beer. The ""upper crust micro brewery people"" (no slam intended)probably should avoid this one since it's suited for the average joe not the bottle sniffing, swish and spit out snooty beer taster. Come on people it's beer, enjoy it!!!"
Northern Breweries Thunder Bay Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;From old tasting notes. Pale yellow gold color. Creamy white head. Tart, grainy malt aroma. Light, dry malt flavor hints at citrus and fruit.bclean, crisp and non-descript.
Northern Breweries Thunder Bay Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Bottle. Golden yellow in colour, thin dissipating off-white coloured head, oily looking in the glass. The aroma was of grains, slightly sweet, crisp, sharp, small sourness. The flavour was grainy, some cereal and a bit sour (think sweaty socks). Light watery mouthfeel, light body, light carbonation. Finishes quick with some cardboard.
Northern Breweries Thunder Bay Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Thanks goes out to Joey Capps for hooking me up with this one! Much appreciated Joe! Body is golden in colour, with a medium sized white head. Aroma is straw, some mild malty aromas, cardboard. Taste is papery, sweet corn, buttery. Not too good! Thanks Joe!
Northern Breweries Thunder Bay Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Pale yellow w/ white foam. Grassy, cooked corn aroma. Light watery feel. Sweet, cooked corn flavour w/ a harsh, acrid bitterness & some fusel oil notes.
Northern Breweries Thunder Bay Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;One of the few craft beers worse than a macro Labatt or Molson, and should be avoided. Strong carbonation, watery beer. Unfinishable. Pale yellow with quick disapearing fizzy head.. Thanks Joey Capps.
Northern Breweries Thunder Bay Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Aroma of citric fruit with stale like malt. This pale lager is thin bodied. The presence of harsh alcohol is not helping. Carbonated ,Off - taste . Well below average.
Northern Breweries Thunder Bay Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Pale yellow pour, not much head. Slightly citrusy aroma. Standard pale lager grassy taste. Not offensive, but still bad. C’mon Thunder Bay, you can do better!
Northern Breweries Thunder Bay Lager;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Northern Breweries;Pale straw color, white head. Very mild aroma, if anything a little grass.

Northern Breweries Edelbrau;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Northern Breweries;Originally rated November 2004. This is beer I discovered a while back because it would look pretty low-budget and white-trash, so my buddy and I thought it would be funny to try. It caught us off guard. Since then, I have been a fan. Poured a golden-yellow colour with a small head. Leaves a bit of lacing in spots. The nose is hoppy. The mouth is of sweet malts, mild hops, with hints of apples (which is what I really like about this brew). The mouthfeel is smooth and kind of dry. One of my favorite plain-old lager. Note: Too bad it is not being made anymore.
Northern Breweries Edelbrau;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Northern Breweries;Pale yellow color, white head. Mild malt, light citrus. Light grass as well. Lighter bodied. Just pretty boring.
Northern Breweries Edelbrau;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Northern Breweries;"Thanks to Greg for this one. Lemon, very light malt, doughy. A little lemon, very meh. ""Its hard to get your lips around the fat top"" - IPFreely"
Northern Breweries Edelbrau;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Northern Breweries;Bottle courtesy of GregClow. Pours a clear light yellow with an average size white head. Mild aroma of very sweet malt. Flavour of sweet malt, honey, citrus and hops. Thin body. Nothing great but there’s nothing bad about it either, it’s better than many macro beers. Decent.
Northern Breweries Edelbrau;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Northern Breweries;Bottle (6-pack) from The Beer Store. This beer was supposedly retired a few months ago when Northern launched a new branding strategy, so either this is an old bottle, or the reports of the beer’s death are greatly exaggerated. Pours a light, clear golden colour with a small head. Aroma is mild but sweet/malty, with some honey and lemon notes that follow through into the flavour. Mild, grassy hops in the finish. Not a great beer, but it seems quite fresh, which leads me to believe that it’s still being brewed, as I can’t imagine it would stay in this shape for long.
Northern Breweries Edelbrau;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Northern Breweries;"Bottle (341ml). Courtesy of GregClow. Pours like pale ginger ale with a quick-retiring bright white head. What aroma there is might best be described as ""mystery sweet"" - something not right there, but not offensive either - hint of fresh-cut hay too. Taste reminds me of a honey-lemon cough drop I used to buy - not offensive, but not really beer-like either. Moutfeel of watered-down table syrup. In fact that’s sort of what it reminds me of - that and my old buddy Larry’s home ""brew."""
Northern Breweries Edelbrau;Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Northern Breweries;Bottle, thanks Greg. Odd aroma - what is that? It is like honey Neo Citron - weird. Quite grassy as well. Light yellow, small white head. Surprisingly medium mouthfeel - syrupy. Cloying sweet taste masks any other flavour that might be present. Lingering sweetness. There are some faint hops in here as well. Terribly unbalanced but at least it was an attempt at flavour I guess.
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Soft malts. Deep dark brown with a small white head. Soft caramel and some date. Not bad, but not a Dark Mild at 5%.
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Aroma is basic malts, honey and adjunct. Run of the mill flavors. Bleh not the best.
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Poured from 355mL can. Clear medium brown with quickly dissipating light beige head. Grain malt with mild caramel notes. Flavour finishes quick and mild. Really not much else to say...
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Amber coloured with no head. Aroma of caramel. Taste is also caramel and nothing more. To be honest a bit disappointed.
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;355 ml can from Co-Op Liquor, served in a Great Western tall concave glass. Wait, this isn’t a British import, but brewed by Pacific Western in Prince George, BC?! I’ve been totally hornswoggled! Should’ve known by the price. Anyway... Pours a reddish-cola shade with no visible carbonation and a quickly shrinking head, leaving almost no lace. The nose holds a lot of damp earthiness, wet woody hops, some bready, toasted malt and grain, and slight sweet caramel, while on the tongue there’s just soft and vaguely sweet toastiness and toffee, with a gently bitterish back end, and an unidentifiable essence in the sweetness that’s rather dirty, nauseating, and off-putting. Slight amount of body and a silky texture, with a clean, brief finish. Disappointingly subpar due to that ugly flavor note and its distracting aromas. I could see it being much better with some tweaking, but for now, I wouldn’t bother with this mild.
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Since I discovered this beer it is all I drink at home. It has a unique malt caramel flavour. Not for everyone of course, but I LOVE this beer!
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;This was poured into a stemmed pilsener. The appearance was a translucent mild brown to red color. Light carbonation was seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a rapidly dissipating one finger white foamy head. Barely any lacing touched the glass. The smell had a sweet rich nutty to speckled caramel glossing over top of some light chocolate. The taste followed the nose. A rich nutty aftertaste led to a sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly sweet sessionable feel rolling over my mouth. Overall, I saw this was a good English Dark Mild Ale I would have again. I had another and it went well with the seafood fettucine I had.
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Clear medium copper, foamy off white head disappears instantly. Faint caramel malt aroma. Tastes like watery North American industrial swill infused with caramel. Softly carbed, light bodied, no hopped. Thin insipid finish. LF (Lagerboy Friendly)
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Draught at Funky Winkerbeans, Vancouver. Pours a deep ruby-amber with an average size frothy diminishing off-white head. Very mild aroma of metal, malt, a bit of fruit, some light sugary sweetness and vague nuts. Watery flavour of caramel malt, nuts, light sweetness and food coloring. Light to average bodied. Not good, just drinkable. -- Rated via Beer Buddy.
Pacific Western Canterbury Dark Mild;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Bottle@BC Ferries, Inside Passage, Canada. Brown beer with a reddish tinge, and a fizzy head and body. The aroma is malty and mildly roasted, and the flavour is malty with some roasted'ness bitterness. Overall a plain malty and roasted beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Pacific Pilsner;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Weak head and yellow body. Soft cabbage and cardboard aroma like they are not even trying and failing badly. Flavour is this cloying caramel thing with a metallic finish. Lots of stuff seriously wrong with this brew, not good at all.
Pacific Pilsner;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;On tap at a dive. Light golden, dissipating head. Nose is lots of sweet grain, grassy. Flavour starts sweet but ends dryer, malt is a bit rough but it’s not off, making it better than most of the style I’ve had recently. Not that bad.
Pacific Pilsner;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;A commercial aimed pilsner that is still very drinkable. Great on a hot summers day but not going to set the world on fire. Lacks hop aromas and subsequent bitterness that is a trait of a good Pils. Price for 24 pack is ertainly an attraction at the over priced BC Liquor stores - man they have some archaic liquor laws in BC,Canada!
Pacific Pilsner;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Clear golden yellow, feeble foamy white head fades. Standard sweet lager malt aroma. Typical sweet bready grainy lager malt taste, no bitterness. Average carbonation, light bodied, low hopped. Inoffensive, clean and refreshing. Better than most CDN industrial swill. LF (Lagerboy Friendly)
Pacific Pilsner;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Our of can... Taste very watery and unfortunatelly a little bit fishy... The pilsner typicall bitter taste is missing....

Colour: Medum-light yellow with minimal head. Nose: Basic yeast and wheat. Small vanilla trace. Taste: Medium-light sweet, light bitter, light sour. A buttery elemant that is actually nice. Very smooth. Still run-of-the-mill though.
Pacific Pilsner;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Pours a clear yellow color with no aroma, maybe a slight corn smell. Taste is light and practically tasteless, its like drinking colored water.
Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Pours golden yellow with some haze. Sweet aroma with a hint of hop. Thin head, thin body with some tongue-tickling effervescence. Flavor is understated, sweet and grainy with crisp metallic finish. One of those beers that is best served ice cold and is easy to drink without thinking.
Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;A lightly hazed gold lager with a thin white head. A sweet corn aroma with perfumey notes and cardboard. In mouth, a lihtly sweet maple malt, very thin and watery. Boring. Trade from Capflu.
Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Hazy lemon yellow, soapy head that quickly collapses and disappears. Faintly stinky dishrag aroma. Sweet grainy palate, slightly metallic, faintly alcoholic. Not UNdrinkable, but not one I would chose out of the bizmillion cheap pale lagers available.
Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"(Can) Purchased at the BC Liquor Store at Fort Street, Victoria. ""Japan Import Quality"". This beer pours a thin, white frothy head with a light golden body. Nose of mild corn malt and soda water. Flavours of water corn malt with some dry peppery undertones makes this beer not overly offensive. Its exactly what it states it is - nothing more or less. Bland might be a good word for it."
Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Creamed corn and cabbage in the sweet aroma along with some herbal notes. Clear golden body is topped by a decent, fine bubbled, white head that recedes to a partial cover with some light lacing. Sweet flavour with some light bitterness and a dishwater like aftertaste that is wholly unappealing. Light body with very aggressive, pointy, sharp carbonation. Unable to stomach more than a few sips of this one. Can sampled in the Maple Leaf Lounge at Vancouver Airport.
Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Can. Pale golden yellow with a good sized white head that diminishes. Very grainy aroma. Flavour is mild and muted. Oddly sweet before a drying bitterness pokes through. Corn-fruity sweetness is very macro. Flavour devoles as it warms, brining out less pleasant qualities. Average palate. Meh.
Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;355 ml can. Golden colour with a mostly diminishing frothy and creamy white head. Grainy, corn, and light floral aroma. I’m seeing a pattern with these Pacific Western beers... Grainy flavour, otherwise light bodied, watery, and lifeless.
Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Swillfest ’05. Straw coloured, thin-white head. Grassy aroma, a bit fruit in the middle. Slight leathery character on top of the pale malt. Fairly drinkable.

Pacific Dry;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Swillfest ’05Straw colour. The aroma is a bit grassy, with plenty of old shoe and cider. Bland flavour punctuated with more old shoe. Fruity, with higher alcohols. Based on those notes, you’d think this was the nastiest beer on planet Earth, but it’s actually not that offensive. Not good either, though.

Pacific Western Genuine Draft;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Can. Thanks mmmIPA for this one. Clear golden with an average white cap. No aroma to speak of other than a metallic twang. Very bland grainy palate. What more can you say about another crap clone of a pale lager?
Pacific Western Genuine Draft;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;12 oz. can in trade from douglas88- thank you. Served in pint glass- poured transparent very thin yellow, a 2 inch head formed but slowly bubbled away, aroma of hard water, corn, and wet denim jeans. Hits the mouth with a thin body, malt has to be corn all the way, finish glides away and makes my mouth dry. Wow, an MGD clone, and a poorly made one I may add... why would you even what to waste water for cloning it?
Pacific Western Genuine Draft;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"12oz can acquired in trade with douglas88 (thanks!).

Pacific Western Genuine Draft;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;I found this ’gem’ in the State Store in SLC. Can. Pours a light gold with a thin white head. The aroma is moslty corn and a nasty malt. The taste is corn, metal, unknown liquid found spilled on a restroom floor, grass and straw and well...it went quick. My first B.C. beer, no way but up to go.
Pacific Western Genuine Draft;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;355ml can. Pours yellow.

Aroma is light cereal grains and light grassy hops with a slight hint of citrus. Taste is light malty sweetness with a hint of lemon ending with a light grassy hop bitterness followed up with some metallic notes. Light body with soft carbonation. Exceptional organic lager ... I think not ... ordinary ... Yes.

Pacific Western Natureland Organic Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;330ml green bottle. Gold colour. Faint white head, some lacing. Sweet malt nose with tiny hint of grass. Flavour starts with some sweet malts, moves into a metallic and grassy hop flavour rather quickly, grassy and haylike finish with minimal bitterness. Thin bodied, medium carbonation. Not that bad for a pale lager, but really not that interesting either.
Pacific Western Natureland Organic Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"Gold. There was a white head before I blinked. A lot going on in the aroma; grain, vegetable, biscuit and a touch of skunkiness although the green bottle was in a sealed box. Flavour takes all the fumbled promise of the aroma and assembles it into something worse. Flavour is jumbled, rough, harsh, sweet and unpleasant."
Pacific Western Natureland Organic Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Bottle from Yamaya in Kyoto. Cheap. Cereal aroma. Bit of skunk too. Not too nice. Slightly darkened gold color, nice head. Sweet, metallic cereal flavor. Grainy and muddled. Lagging carbonation and mouthfeel. Not horrible, but useless.

Light clear gold with a small white head. Aroma of skunk, grain, and icing sugar - ick! Flavour is very metallic and harsh, extremely unpleasant. Thin body, watery finish. It’s beers like this (and the Amber) that give organic beers a bad name.

Not bad for a pale lager, beats the hell out of Bud!!"
Pacific Western PWB 360 Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"Can given out by CapFlu as a bonus at his GCBF after-tasting. Started out with a moderate white head which even the strong carbonation cannot maintain. Gold. Light grassy aroma with some funk. Hey, I can drink it. Chilled but not as cold as the ""Surfs Up"" ripoff penguin on the can. Starts sweet but the finish turns with a bitter metallic grass flavour."
Pacific Western PWB 360 Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Canned thanks to CapFlu! Poured clear bright golden with a tall initial cap of white head that settled to a dusting after a couple minutes. The aroma picked up sweet and soft honey and corn with mild doses of floral, lemon, and grassy hoppage.. soft overall and quite pleasant. The flavor had corn and honey again at the core with very mild grassy bitterness.. left some sweetness on the short finish. Light-bodied and grainy on the palate.. the sweetness becomes somewhat astringent as this warms up. Overall a simple, non-offensive, and refreshing offering.
Pacific Western PWB 360 Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Gold thick white head. Aroma is malty, corn, and water, extremely faint hops. Taste is watery, not skunky, light maltiness, some sweetness.
Pacific Western PWB 360 Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Golden colour with nice sparkle and thin head. Grainy, cidery aroma. Fresh grain character - clean, lightly malty with hints of grassy hop. Slight acetaldehyde late but not obtrusive. It actually benefits the beer by adding an element of nuance to it. Still, it’s a bit thin at the back, hindering what is otherwise one of the best macrolagers around. Can courtesy of CapFlu.
Pacific Western PWB 360 Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;(Can) Mmmmm..... Mmmmmm.... Purchased a 6-packeroo of this beer for $8.25 plus deposit. What did I expect? What I got - a straw nosed and grainy flavoured beer. Not bad, actually, I’d say that its pretty good once its up to room temperature. Initially it had the tinny and corn malt flavours but it gets better as it warms. I’ve got the second can in a double-boiler on the stove-top and looking forward to my next serving at 100*C.
Pacific Western PWB 360 Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Pale yellow, corn aroma, flavor is.....saltine crackers? Astringent grainy smell, perhaps some....oh, hell, there’s a fucking penguin on the can. It was cheap, I’m sorry, I’ll never do it again. Forgive me!
Pacific Western PWB 360 Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Can. Very pale yellow, fairly decent white head lingers a bit. Aroma of grain and a lot of fusel (?) alcohol. Watery flavor and palate. Thin borderline astringent grain, trace macro sweetness lacks attribution indicators. Flavourless and dull.

And as Crit said, completely devoid of character.
Pacific Western PWB 360 Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Basically a mainstream light bland lager with no character whatsoever.......
Pacific Western Traditional Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;355 ml. can a friend left in my fridge. Straw yellow appearance- not much of a head- leaves no lacing. Aroma is malt with some hints of grain. Taste: water, hops, cereal grains, tin-metal, malt, sour notes, caramel, toast. Not very bitter- evident sweetness on the palate, pretty carbonated. Horrible imbalance in terms of malt sweetness to hop bitterness ratio: all malt, no hop bitterness. This reminds me of a poorly made malt liquor. Dry notes on the palate as well. All around poor lager.
Pacific Western Traditional Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;341ml bottle pours a pale straw color with a small white head that leaves no lacing behind. Aroma is cereal grains and faint hops. Taste is light malty sweetness with mild hop bitterness and a metallic aftertaste. Just another typical macro lager.

Colour: mid-yellow. medium white thick head. Nose: Tinny, typical plain yeast, cotton candy, touch mint. Taste: Medium-high sweet, light bitter, light sour. Sugary. Exactly as it states: smooth, crisp, easy drinking...but by no means high quality craftsmanship.
Pacific Western Traditional Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;This is surprisingly drinkable for the pricepoint. Smooh without any nasty aftertaste, just a hint at some grain being prezent and some hops and clear water.

Pacific Western Traditional Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"Can.

Pacific Western Traditional Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Can. A yellow lager with a thick froathy white head. Aroma of grain, grass, and corn adjunct. In mouth, a lightly biscuitty malt with mineral notes, light bitterness. Not as bad as described below, not great either. From Caflu, the dude in da west, November 2006.
Pacific Western Traditional Lager;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;On tap in Vernon. A neat raspberry flavour mixed with mild graininess is what I took away from this one. Much better than I expected it would be.
Pacific Western Traditional Light;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Light Industrial Swill flavored water... bleh. Something to drink on a stinky hot day if nothing else is available.
Pacific Western Traditional Light;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Pours a dull yellow with a remarkably viscous head. Aroma and flavour reminded me of Coopers Blonde homebrew kit malt extract. An iota of hop bitterness in the finish. I will go out on a limb and say that this was fine to drink at the beach...for what it is and out of a snazzy clear plastic cup of course.
Pacific Western Traditional Light;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Can. Yellow body, with a small white head that fades quickly.

Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;355ml can pours a pale copper color with a small white head that left very little lacing on the glass. Aroma is cereal grains and mild hops. Taste is grainy malt sweetness with some mild grassy hop bitterness. Light bodied with little carbonation. Just not too much good to report here.
Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;I haven’t seen one of these in ages. I used to drink this all the time, its a good strong cheap beer. And i use the term ’good’ loosely. I bought so much of this beer i thought i was the only one keeping them in business cuz no one else even heard of it. My local store doesnt sell this anymore...cant imagine why, and seeing this picture makes my eyes all misty. Oh the times me and Ironhorse had.
Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"Second can from my BC chunderfest beers. This one pretends to be a strong euro lager. Has darker copper clear color and the same over filtered clarity...heading is weak and vanishes quickly not even leaving a trace of a ring. The aroma or more precisely ""odor"" on this is really offensive: vegetal, sweet, caramel and fusil alcohol. Tastes naot as bad as it smells but it is thing sweet with caramel or whatever adjunct they used to pump up the ABV hardly any malt or hop decernment just enough sourish balance to keep it from being sickeningly sweet. Rough stuff for those who ride the iron horse all the way to the detox ward."
Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Plenty of corn in the sweet and lightly metallic aroma. Clear, deep golden body is topped by a decent sized, large bubbled, white head that recedes rapidly to partial cover. Sweetness in the flavour with some creamed corn, unmarred by any hop character with only enough bitterness to keep from becoming cloying. DMS strengthens as it warms. Light body with somewhat watery texture and prickly if short-lived carbonation. Tulip glass. Fridge temperature. Can (BCLS at 8th/Cambie, Oct-06).
Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;(Can) Watch out - you buy one of these at the BC Liquor Store and they charge you for a 6-pack!!! Actually, I went back the following week with my bill and the BCLS happily agreed to re-imburse me the cost of the additional 5-cans. Pours a copper body beneath a thin, foamy white head. Nose is so Sleemans: tinny with a roasty caramel malt. The flavour is pretty poor... tonic, metallic, with a caramel maltedness and a thin, watery texture. Blah!
Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Copper-bronze colour. The aroma is, to my dismay, of canned peas. My mother loves canned peas but I personally despise them. Either way, they are hardly an appropriate aroma to find in a beer. The palate, thankfully, is clean. It is light of course, vaguely malty, with a watery finish and a tiny hint of alcohol burn. A low, prickly carbonation makes this reasonably smooth for a macrobrew.
Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Pale golden colour, thin dissipating white head. Metallic aroma with a suggestion of malt and loads of yeast. Flavour is horrible and metallic. Don’t bother.
Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Corn nose. Golden, no head, big bubbles. Thin and boring. Crappy standard lager.
Pacific Western Ironhorse;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"Pours like any other beer but smells of alcohol and yeast. Taste is alcohal with slight hops. Not very pleasant but the finish is not bad. ""All Aboard""."

Pacific Western TNT;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"Aroma is pretty poor; pure adjunct, sulphur and not much else.

Pacific Western TNT;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Originally reviewed Jan. 11, 2007: poured out of the can, it left a decent whitish head. quickly diminished to a skiff with spotty carbonation spots. colour is a light gold. smells like.... dust. smelling the empty can reflects the supposed alcohol content. tastes like liquid dust might. left tongue feeling fuzzy. some straw taste? just gunna chug this a$$ beer to get the pain over with. ugh.
Pacific Western TNT;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;355ml can pours a pale golden color with a small white head and no lacing.

Pacific Western TNT;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Can, thanks to hobbersr for the share. Pours a surprisingly handsome copper into my Corsendonk tulip glass, medium-thick, quite persistent off-white head, lacing is quite gorgeous. Best looking pale lager? Best looking pale lager. Nose is... Markedly less impressive. Damp cardboard and crystal malt, something along the lines of a ghetto honey brown, some bready notes, would I be entirely wrong for calling it brioche? I am beginning to suspect that either this isn’t entirely terrible OR the glass is showing the best possible side of this beer. Oh Dear GOd ThisTastes Like Shit!!!!!!!!! Oh sweet Christ it almost BURNS!!! No bitterness, a garbagey sweetness that reminds you of that sweet dumpster smell. God DAMN!! Why can’t I give negative points for flavour?!??! Jesus! Handsome and appalling.
Pacific Western TNT;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Pours Clear amber with a thin white head. Smells putrid.

Pacific Western TNT;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;The appearance flattered only to have the taste deceive. Nice looking beer, with a rich copper body beneath not much of a head. Not much aroma, either. Flavour with just flat out lacking, maybe caramel overlaying some come and malt. It actually tasted better than expected, but I wasn’t expecting much. Indeed the beer for a high school bush party &#40the kind I never got invited to&#41. A cheap swill from a brewery that specializes in same.
Pacific Western TNT;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;I absolutely despise this beer. At 6% they didn’t try at all to hide the alcohol content with more flavours and an advanced palate. Aroma of skunky grains and malts. Taste is disgusting. I do not reccomend this beer to anyone.
Pacific Western TNT;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Can. 6%. Bright amber colour. Disgusting in every other category. Might as well put rubbing alcohol, tabasco and bud light together and stir.
R & B Red Devil Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Modest brown-copper body with a bit of foam. Very soft caramel aroma. Flavour is mellow caramel with soft brown sugar hints, sweet finish, neither here nor there and simply okay.

Clingy and sticky lacing. Nose has grains, slight toast, caramel and light fruitiness. Taste has light toasted malts, caramel, faint fruitiness, light hops. Finishes dry and grainy.

Aromas of pale malts and citrusy hops. Taste is light malty sweetness with a moderate hop bitterness. A decent attempt at this style but nothing really stands out.

R & B Red Devil Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Deep amber pour, BIg sweet caramel malt nose, very little hops. Flavor was full bodied, and again quite big on the sweet caramel malts. Touches of english hops in the finish, but nothing much else.
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Easy to drink but not a lot to this. Don't get the dark cream ale vibe as well - I guess that's why it's listed as a mild? Pours dark brown with ok head and lacing. Fairly clean finish like like you prerinsed the plates in your dishwasher. Tap at brewery.
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Draft - Dark malts and a touch of toast. Deep mahogany with a decent white head. Dark residing and some toast with a light bitter finish. If the ABV were lower this would be better.
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Pours clear medium amber with one finger of off-white head diminishing rapidly to a tenacious cap, patchy lacing. (3/5) Nose is caramel, bready yeast, nutty, faint chocolate, smoke, and vinegar. (4/10) Taste is moderate sweet, mild bitter, light tart and smoke. (4/10) Light to medium bodied, lively to moderate carbonation, mildly bitter tart and smokey finish. (3/5) What are the odds of me getting two broken BC beers, from two different brewers, and two different sources, in one day? When I say “broken”, I mean in terms of hitting the style, not necessarily in terms of drinkability. As drinkability goes, it’s not bad - a very lightly smokey sour, almost like a gose, or a mild sour brown. As a “cream ale”. it’s an utter disaster. Dunno how to rate this - I’d rather have it than a macro lager, but not by much. (9/20)
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);A thin, tan head disappears quickly. It’s a dark, caramel brown. It has a slightly malty nose and provided a surprisingly robust initial sip, but it doesn’t last long with you. There’s a biscuit-like maltiness to the flavour. It’s not bad, but there’s nothing exceptional about it. The alcohol content on the bottle I had was 4.8%.
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);bottle. Poured reddish-brown with a thin tan head. Malt aroma, rye bread.

Small thin head that disappeared quickly. Sweet malt aroma, with nut, and caramel. Same flavour, but quickly turns almost sour. Medium mouthfeel, but seemed very flat. Hardly any bitterness, but that sourness is hard to swallow.
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Well sweet baby Jesus, if this beer just ain’t broken. Honestly, just imagine -- you get your beer stuffed into a 6 pack sampler that’s catapulted to Ontario & of all the beers in the box yours is the worst. How bad is it? Read the reviews below. This beer is 28 Days Later infected, the pour dumps toxic dark with no head. The smell is vinegar & the taste is awful. This beer is bad & judging by the reviews here its chronic. Someone owes me a beer. Drain pour. Avoid (give to your brother or father in law etc).
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);When I drank this, I didn’t think it was a Mild. More of an amber ale. Brownish red with an beige lacy head. Smells of caramel with soft toffee, floral hops, and some chocolate raisin notes. Medium thin light body. Light taste of alcohol with a soft earthiness, roast, caramel and some metallic notes. Light for a mild. A bit boring
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Part of the BC Craft Brewers Guild Natural Selections 6 pack (2014). Pours a hazy copper colour with red highlights. The head is creamy, beige, lasts long and lacing is creamy, thick as well. Aromas of nutty malts, raisins, caramel, dates, spicy yeast and sugars. The taste is much milder, watered-down. Very light roasted malts with some sourness in the middle (light infection ?). Not sure about hitting the style. Seems more like a fruity rousse.
R & B Raven Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Pours dark brown with a moderate pillowy beige head. Aroma is chocolate malt with earthy malts. Taste is a blend of earthy malt, almost a molasses. Profile is a little all over the place.
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Draught @ the source. Pours a clear golden colour with an ever tiny white head. Nose is light and sweet bread and yeast notes. Flavour is hints of bubblegum, Belgian character, finishing lightly bitter and semi dry.
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Bomber. Unclear yellow, loose fading white foam. Aroma is grainy, wheaty, vegetal. Taste is limp and vegetal, thin wheatish malt, some citrus and faint wit spices, just a shitty beer, drainpour. Soft carbonation, light bodied, lightly hopped. Hard to believe any version of this foul concoction won anything ever. NFA (Not For Anyone)
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Draft - Light sweet yeasty and wheat notes. Nuclear gold with a small white head. Loght wheat and a touch of yeasty sweetness.
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);"I like it. It's light & refreshing. Now my favs are typically strong Belgian ales. I love Hefeweizen's too & this is much lighter. This beer is what Molson's Old Style Pilsner should be. You put this beer in that can & you've got a bonafide heavyweight. You'd have ""pretty boy"" Floyd Mayweather in a can. An undefeated champ, taking on all comers. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);On tap. Pours a hazy gold with light head. Aromas of wheat, lemon and coriander. Flavors of coriander, apples, and earth with sharp wheat notes.
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Okay wheat style look and smell, but needs more head and a stronger profile on the nose. Highly drinkable but not memorable - lacking complexity, it went down well in a bar but didn’t linger on the tongue. Medium finish. Just okay.
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Not the most inspiring beer out there. Light and easy to drink (only 4.2%). It actually tastes slightly like a commercial beer... a bit of a chemical taste to it. Light golden color... for the price, I don’t think I’ll be buying another one of these.
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);650ml bottle pours a slightly hazy golden color with a finger of white head which leaves only a few specks of lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild citrus and cereal grains. Taste is light malty sweetness with a mild grassy and citrusy hop bitterness. Light bodied with modest carbonation. Overall, a very mild and easy drinking wheat ale that is refreshing, but not near the best for the style.
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);"Draught at Hamilton Street Grill, Vancouver Hazy pale blond color. Mild, breadish aroma. Sweetish and smooth mouthfeel in the front, drier and lightly nutty in the end; low bitterness. Bland and boring."
R & B Sun God Wheat Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);"Colour: slightly cloudy dark yellow with just the tiniest touch of orange. Low head. Nose: Wheaty blast, followed by currents of peach, vanilla, bitter citrus fruit, and a charge of heavy apple late. Taste: Light sweet, light bitter, medium sour. No sense straying from the nose; again a wheaty blast that this time stays around the entire palate and hangs on for a dying moment after all is said and done. Fighting for a say is some distant banana and paprika. This one sure is what it says it is."

Spinnakers Doc Hadfields Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Totally clear pale yellow hue, seriously limited white head. Mostly fresh smelling, hoppy beer that is very light, if not quite appearing under 4%, but feels like a very good summer concept that is unfortunately touched with light turnipy DMS off notes tat disturb the otherwise serious grapefruity, sweaty hops (Columbus?). Lean mouth presence, hoppy, softly carbonated and easy drinking. Despite its wateriness, it shows a lot of confidence in its hop display, mostly bright, grapefruity and almost grapey. Fruity session ale.
Spinnakers Doc Hadfields Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Lightly clouded orangey amber hue. Rich yeasty, fruity aroma. Yeasty, berry fruit flavor, fairly sweet, mild hop bitterness in the finish.

Lovely, banana bubblegum and choc aroma. Very choccy malts in mouth, creamy lemon/choc smokey finish. Bit of charcoal, creamy dunkel, lots of choc, bit of bitter choc on end.

Pours a reddish-deep copper body beneath a frothy, thin oyster head. Fig, malt nose with some wet wheat, banana peel and raspberry seed. Tast front, somewhat honeydew rind?

Spinnakers Dunkle Weizenbrau;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spinnakers Brewpub;A weird one. Not German in style. In fact, it kind of reminds me of a dark mild.
Spinnakers Fog Fighter;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Spinnakers Brewpub;Bottle, purchased from the brewery 3 months ago. Pours a hazy medium amber with a low almond head that retains poorly. Aroma is caramel and phenols. Flavours of caramel and unripened berries. Palate is tart, bordering on sour. Awkward, as I don’t think this was meant to be a sour ale but it leans heavily in that direction.
Spinnakers Fog Fighter;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Spinnakers Brewpub;"Hazy orange color; small head. Light, sweetish malt aroma, caramel, light vegetables and band-aid. Light malt flavor, incredibly light body for this gravity, very light cabbage and sourness. Failure."
Spinnakers Fog Fighter;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Spinnakers Brewpub;From Firefly. Poured a clear medium-to-dark gold, and no damned head! Aroma was faint, spices were barely detectable. Flavour was better, nice and tart, with a similar finish. Lots of sediment at theend - a bonus! An adequate beer, but too costly for what it was.
Spinnakers Fog Fighter;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Spinnakers Brewpub;22oz bomber from Brewery Creek in Vancouver. Pours an off gold, slightly hazy, with thin head and little retention. Aroma is certainly Belgian-esque but not in a huge way. Notes are muted and slightly weak. Taste is some candied apple, spice and thin hops. Finish lingers but mainly due to the alcohol content more than the lasting palate. Far from complex. It’s one of these generic, passable Belgian attempts that falls short when compared to a better beer of the style.
Spinnakers Fog Fighter;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Spinnakers Brewpub;Poured hazy, golden from bottle. Lots of hops at first on the tongue then a slower finish, but in a good way. Lots of yeast floating with an overall balanced character. Very good with a nice bite. I was quite impressed.
Spinnakers Fog Fighter;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Spinnakers Brewpub;Bottle: Poured a deep golden color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of sweet malt is dominating with no other characteristic easily discernible. Taste is also dominated by some sweet malt with notes of light fruity ester. Body is quite full with a somewhat oily texture and some medium carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Not bad overall just lacking some character.
Spinnakers Fog Fighter;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Spinnakers Brewpub;66cl bottle. Pours copper with almost no head and appeared fairly lifeless. Nose of malts and the distinctive Belgian yeastiness. Tasty but not the best of this style.

Raj Indian Beer;Ramachandrapuram, Andhra Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Artos Breweries Ltd.;Nothing special at all about this very basic pale lager. Colour, head, and aroma are all forgettable, as is the taste. Indistinguishable from any other Indian beer I’ve tried.

Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;(Pulled from a cask at the brewpub) Imperial stouts are meant to be robust, this was more of a very dark brown porter (albeit with a very mild hint of liquorice). Pretty good though, everything was well balanced. I wouldn’t want this to become a regular drink of mine, though.
Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;Good amount of chocolate and sweetness on the nose. Some roast, nutty notes, earthy hops. Pours almost black with a tan head. The flavor starts with roast, moves through chocolate sweetness, earthy nutty notes, more roast, a little bitterness. Bitter/sweet finish. Moderate carbonation, maybe a little light in the body for the style.
Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;Opaque enough that it was difficult to see a candle through. The best beer I’ve had in Victoria so far.
Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;"Bottle. Pours a deep brown/black with small tan head. Aroma of dark roast, faint vegitable, hints of apple and chocolate. Flavor is much the same, fairly dry. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy body, watery, with medium carbonation. Overall, is just ""OK""."
Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;On tap at the brewpub. We were a little divided on it--I liked it, but MB didn’t so much. A smooth beer with lots of roasted malt. An alcoholic finish.
Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;On tap at the Alibi Room, pours dark brown with a reddish hue and a small tan head. Aroma of sweetened liquid chocolate, maple syrup and caramel. Flavour is less inviting - roasted malt, coffee and sweet chocolate, but with an acidic and thin palate. Decent, but not one of the better examples of the style.
Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;4 ounce sample at the brewpub Taproom at 4 samples for $5.00CAD. Very good 4 ounce sample at the brewpub Taproom at 4 samples for $5.00CAD. Very good!
Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;Bottle bought from brewpub in March 2011. Opened June 18 2011. This bottle was kept in cellar conditions along with the rest of my bottles. Pours black with a filmy head. Aromas of sweet something and some dark malts. Taste was sour like vomit. This bottle was either very old or part of a bad batch. The number above the barcode is 967612, maybe the batch code? The date punch on the side of the label is 01/5. Too bad. I wouldn’t rate this except it was purchases at the brewery and consumed within a reasonable amount of time.
Spinnakers Tsarist Imperial Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Spinnakers Brewpub;Handpump. Light coffee aroma. Opaque black, brown craem.

Re-rate from tap: Black, low head Chocolate, roast aroma Sweet, bitter chocolate, good aromatic and bitter hop balance Smooth medium full body Very pleasant
Spinnakers Mount Tolmie Dark;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Spinnakers Brewpub;The aroma is soft laminated floorboard from 1893 - you know the kind, the old schoolhouse wood varnish that poisoned kids for generations. Well here it is in all its glory. Has a brown body with no head. Flavour is a very mild malt, soft chewy dark bread notes. Mouthfeel is full enough. This is not a bad attempt at a mild ale though not a great one. By the way I just love how this beer gets rated every 10 years...
Spinnakers Mount Tolmie Dark;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Spinnakers Brewpub;(Cask) One time re-release in celebration of the brewpub’s 25th Anniversary.

Spinnakers Mitchells ESB;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Spinnakers Brewpub;Pint on cask at brewpub. This beer lacks the Maris Otter malt that an ESB should have. Overly bitter with an ashy, burnt astringency. Pours a hazy copper with nice lacing and an off white head. Aroma is faint. Light sweet malts. Disappointing.

Spinnakers Oatmeal Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Spinnakers Brewpub;(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub on June 17, 2009, for $5.95. Pours a lastinhg frothy beige head atop an opaque body. Nose of sour cherries, wood, and cocoa. Flavour is oddly sour in the finish - front is roasted malts and mild bitter coffee. Some slight hop tongue with a chocolaty mid-palate. Okay. Seems very thin for an oatmeal stout, but then again many of Spinnakers taste thin. 5/3/5/3/11
Spinnakers Oatmeal Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Spinnakers Brewpub;Pitch black, with a large fluffy brown head that is fast fading. Chocolate aroma, faint coffe.

Spinnakers Highland Scottish Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Spinnakers Brewpub;(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub on August 11, 2006. Pours a near headless brown body. Nose is mildly roasty while the flavour is only mild. I am not a terribly big fan of Scottish Ales (for that<!-- i -->see Rastacouere<!-- /i -->) but I recognize that this recipe is far less intense and less malted than most any Scottish Ale I know of?
Spinnakers Highland Scottish Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Spinnakers Brewpub;Red brown, creamy lacing head. Herbal, licorice and roasted aroma. Fruity malt body, herbal, slightly green notes. Good body. Sugary and leafy aftertaste.
Spinnakers Highland Scottish Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Spinnakers Brewpub;A very, very, very good beer, and brewpup/restaurant if you happen to visit Victoria, B.C. This was my favorite after a 5-course beer tasting and dinner.
Spinnakers Best Bitter;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Spinnakers Brewpub;Real Ale Aromahop nose. Amber color with lace clinging to the glas. A almost perfect composition, a smooth mix of flavors with hop finish of tingling bitternes and aroma hops when you exhale.
Spinnakers Original Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Clear orange liquid, flat, no head. Soft cinnamon and apple pie filling aroma. Flavour is watery malts with a soft cinnamon spice peeking through. Incredibly watery, flat, no carbonation. This is either from a dead keg or just really, really bad.
Spinnakers Original Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Can - Touch of orange and some bread. Cloudy gold and small white head. Dirty yeasty notes with some peel and sourness. Not good.
Spinnakers Original Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;On tap at Spinnakers, pours a cloudy yellow golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out biscuity malt and not much hop content. Flavour is along the same lines, with wet biscuity malt and only a touch of hops to back. A dry, malty pale. Meh.

Easy beer but pleasant and thirstquenching."
Spinnakers IPA;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Draft - Doughy and yeast. Clear gold with a small white head. Doughy, light bitterness and a long finish.
Spinnakers IPA;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;on draft at brewery, decent IPA. A big mix of the cheaper hops leads to a muddled balance to the malts from the base. Its ok, fresh and balanced, just forgettable.
Spinnakers IPA;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;"Draft to taster Consummation: I’ll call this a ’relaxed’ IPA. Not quite full flavoured, but at 7.1%, not a session. Adjunct: Lemon, spruce aroma; light yellowish amber"
Spinnakers IPA;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Okay copper-orangeish body with modestly decent head but it does not stick around for too long. Aroma is crisp cardboard like a rather crappy lager. Flavour is intense smokiness with a hint of malt on the back end. Like charcoal there. No hops to indicate it’s an IPA, and this fails completely in that regard. Not impressed. Rather blah. Rather bad.
Spinnakers IPA;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;On tap @ Spinnakers. Clear orange pour with a white head. A lot of sweet fruity esters. Tons of peach and apple...meh. Slight citrus zest and some bready malt. Kind of toasty and grassy. Flavor has a lot of sweet malt and fruit character. Some sugar, peach, and candy apple.

Spinnakers IPA;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;On tap @Spinnakers. Surprised at the mildness in the aroma... Heavily hopped nevertheless, but not in the typically overpowering Pacific Northwest sense. British-leaning, though you still get some of the C-hop pine and citrus in the background. Medium bitterness throughout. Well balanced, rounded palate.
Spinnakers IPA;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Nice sublet aromas with settled and balanced flavours with a nice medium level of bitterness. Rather light on the carbonation.

Spinnakers IPA;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Orange color, deep and rich rusty orange. Very light texture overall, very fresh, though. Semi-bitter taste with a dry finish. Not a hop monster by any means, and it almost resembles an English Pale Ale: some nutty, caramely chewy malt flavors. Good stuff.
Spinnakers Weizenbrau;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Spinnakers Brewpub;Looks like a wit without the head. Citric and yeasty flavors. Lightbodied/watery. Appears to me as a weird cross between a wit and a hefeweizen - without including any of the good parts from either style.
Spinnakers Weizenbrau;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Spinnakers Brewpub;Great.Cloudy,no bite,very pleasent,drank it on my wedding night.light colour,the flavour is hard to describe,best I can do is vanilla icecream/fresh wheat,just great.
Löwenbräu Dark;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);I truly miss the great combination of malt and caramel in the Lowenbrau Dark beer. Used to really enjoy this beer in the late 70s and early 80s down in Las Cruces, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. Is there any way to get a case of this fine beer in New Mexico (or in the U.S.) today?
Löwenbräu Dark;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);From old tasting notes. Brewed by Miller in Milwaukee. Clear reddish brown color. Small bubble carbonation leads to a nice frothy beige head. Delicious chocolate roasted malt nose. Roasted malt flavor is semisweet and light. Hoppy middle and finish. Medium full bodied and flavorful. Lacks the complexity and maltiness of the German version.
Löwenbräu Dark;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);Didn’t take tasting notes. Just wrote down the score so I’m typing just enough words.

Löwenbräu Dark;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);Rating applies to 1960-1968 production, which included some corn. Current production is regrettably a wholly different experience, but at the time it was truly the best beer on tap on the Continent!
Löwenbräu Dark;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);Ok. This rating is for the old Miller Lowerbrau dark. I really miss that beer. It was one of my favorite beers from my school days. I know some people didn’t like it because it had corn in it, but it actually was a great tasting beer. What I remember about it was it had the best aftertaste of any beer of the day and it actually got better the more one would drink. I know it will never happen but I wish there was some way of trying it one more time.
Löwenbräu Dark;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);alcohol, floral, cereal, Not one of my favorites though I have not had it in recent years

Steamworks Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);330ml dark bottle, appears to be filtered - no residue, from Beerwulf. Beer brewed in Germany at Steamworks Europe. Pale ale with enough crystal malt to add malty/toffee flavours without drying out the beer. Nice.

A bit of bread and chocolate in the nose, add a little coffee in the flavour, back to coffee in the finish, very very soft palate, thin (esp. for an oatmeal stout), and highly muted.

Wild Rose IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Wild Rose Brewery;"355 ml can from Sobeys Liquor, served in a nonic pint. Pours a shade of orangey-amber with faint carbonation and a pearly head that leaves lace patches as it dissipates. Nose is fairly fresh, mild-to-moderately strong citrus and piney hops with a dash of floral, and a lightly caramel malt sidebar; on the tongue, there’s the same tasty hop complex and toasty bread-like malt backbone with caramel hints. Thin, slick, and mildly bitter in the finish. Not challenging, just a plain good IPA."
Wild Rose IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Wild Rose Brewery;Nice foamy head and okay yellowish body with modest carbonation. Yes, there are sweet hops on the nose, probably only one kind, very everpresent which is great but not entirely complex. Flavour is a bitter mix of hoppiness with a very faint hint of malt. Dry finish. Good mix and crisp, very drinkable.

Wild Rose Velvet Fog;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;Bottle from their sampler pack purchased in Yellowknife - you’re welcome. Good bright yellow witbier-style body with slight fog and plenty of carbonation but minimal head. Very soft aroma of weak lager and lemon, none of the enticing wit notes I was hoping for. Flavour is mostly a boring lager with wit notes. Slight caramel hints. I wouldn’t identify this as a true witbier and it’s certainly lacking in complexity. Indeed, I was hoping for much more.

Wild Rose Wred Wheat;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;Draft at the brewery. The body is Clear red with a medium off white head. The aroma is sweet and the flavour has distinct anis and licorice. Good but weird combination for a wheat beer.

First swig was very watery with light malty flavours. Finish was lightly hoppy with very light malt flavours lingering. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wild Rose Wred Wheat;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;Nearly opaque ruby hue with a forthwith dissipating white head. Unimpressive aroma with a vastly undetectable combination of malt and perhaps caramel? Mid bodied and rather smooth. Atrociously bland flavour with notes of caramel and biscuits that are once again, hardly detectable. Terribly underwhelming despite the promising appearance.
Wild Rose Wred Wheat;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;Good red-copper body with little head. Musty caramel aroma like you are sucking on a wortherson’s under your grandpa’s smoking jacket. Weak cherry wheat flavour with a slightly sweet but watery finish. Not much to remember here.

Wild Rose Wred Wheat;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;A bottle of this made it’s way to me recently and sadly.......it was not a beer that I enjoyed. Very bland all round is probably the best I can say about it. A weak orange-gold pour with a thin white head that is trying to say ’get me into a good beer’. The aroma is wheat, and some citrusy hops. The taste is very grainy with a weak hop finish.

Arkells 2B;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Arkell's Brewery;I hadn’t tasted this beer for some years and if my memory isn’t playing tricks, it’s gotten a bit sweeter. Mid-amber and I guess the word ’balanced’ suits it. Best drunk in a sunlit pub garden where it would be at it’s refreshing best. Not so desirable on a chilly March evening but it’s not a bad beer and a typical example of the old South West of England ’boy’s bitter’. Reasonably priced too.
Arkells 2B;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Arkell's Brewery;"Cask at the Duke of Edinburgh, Woodside, Berkshire. Hazy amber with a thin white head; simple malty aroma; thin and malty taste with some sweet jammy fruit; and a dry, dusty, biscuity finish. There’s nothing wrong with this, but it’s very basic."

Arkells Summer Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Arkell's Brewery;(Cask handpump at The Wellington, Birmingham). Perfectly clear, still, amber in appearance, with a short head.

Beowulf Heroes;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Beowulf Brewing;Bottle from Stirchley Wines and Spirits, Birmingham. Mine was 5.5% too! Poured a slightly cloudy light amber with a long-lasting thin white head and some lacing. The aroma is malty and the flavour medium bitter, with some malt and lingering bitterness on the palate and into the after taste. I’m happy to drink it, but it is a little bland. It needs more flavours.
Beowulf Heroes;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Beowulf Brewing;My bottle conditioned version had 5.5%ABV, not the 4.7% as stated on here and BA. Anyway the 500ml brown bottle had a best before date of Oct 2011 and was taken late July 2011. The beer is mid-amber with an off-white head of small bubbles. Pale and Crystal malts only, so darker than I thought would be the case. Sadly the beer wasn’t very good, it had a dry almost metalic aftertaste and no foretaste either: a big let down from start to finish. This really was a ’nothing beer’. I found hints of malts and hops, but not enough to comment on.
Beowulf Heroes;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Beowulf Brewing;"(Bottled) Gigantic foamy head that screams ""micro brewed"" and puts the finger to your pissy swill you like to drink afterwork...above glowing bronze..im an entrepreneur ..im back from the dead nose is caramel,butterscotch , esters..on the palate its got waves of bitter hops ...some fruity notes..sweet toffee malt and a nice easy unity."

Beowulf Noble Bitter;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beowulf Brewing;Hand pulled at the Old Joint Stock, Birmingham. This is confusing - Lea has rightly entered this as a Bitter, cos that’s what they call it, but it’s an archetypal Golden/Blond: where does one become the other?? Anyway... this is another of Beowulf’s Golden beers, all with sharing a number of characteristics: dry hops, sticky mouthfeel, some fruit and floral notes. This is one of the better examples - pretty clean and crisp, with nice dryness on the finish, and good balance. Refreshing and flavoursome.
Beowulf Noble Bitter;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beowulf Brewing;Golden with a small white head. Aromas are grain and lemon. Flavours are dry and hoppy with citrus notes. There are some floral hops on the finish. A nice dry hoppy bitter.
Beowulf Wiglaf;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Cask pint in The Cock Hotel, Wellington Shropshire on 24th Feb 2017. Clean amber pour, white head with lacing. Do not know if the recipe has changed, but this was caramel heavy in both the aroma and taste, toffee esters in the nose too. Not as sweet as the aroma indicated but still very malty and semi-sweet in nature. Hops try to balance out the malty molasses, but do not quite make it. My sweet tooth loved it.

Beowulf Swordsman;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beowulf Brewing;Hand-pulled half-pint in The Cock Hotel, Wellington, Shropshire on 22 June 2013. Full on gold body with a good solid white head, firm lacing on the glass as the beer level fell. Floral hop nose with a mild biscuit malt hint. Drier in the mouth than the aroma indicated, some bittering towards the end and certainly more hoppy than malty in flavour. Another fine beer from Beowulf.

Beowulf Swordsman;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beowulf Brewing;"Cask, Coventry 2010. Well, it wouldn’t be a BF without some Beowulf. Filmy gold with a thin bubbly head. Green apple acidity and greenery in the aroma, presumably hop-derived. Lean and thick as usual; biting hop with oily nut balance; some bark and twigs, butter even. A bit pedestrian for Beowulf, but full of understated character. I like it."

Finely sieved roast, spiced apple, Battenburg- discreetly boozy with a suck of Minstrel. There’s also a hay-like, sherbety, Sheppish hop streak. Very sheppish.

Brakspear O Be Joyful;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);[on draught in The Rising Sun, Reading] Rich, very earthy, a hint of fruit but an unpleasant bitter metallic aftertaste. I’ve never been a fan of Brakspear beers, despite having spent many of my beer-drinking years in their catchment area.

Coach House Gunpowder Strong Mild;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Mild Ale;Coach House Brewing Co.;From cask @ The Diamond, Londonderry. Hmm.. Just had this yesterday, and this along with all the others I’ve had, just suddenly disappeared from my notes. Means I have to drink MORE beers.. Don’t you just hate it when that happens! Anyhow, it does initially look like a nitro infused one this. It’s pretty deep and dark, bronze black I’d call it and on the top a both creamy and dense beige head that lacing elegantly down the sides of the glass. It smells nice. A good chocolate milky thing going on, there’s a little bit of roastiness. Sweet marzipan chocolate and some tones of coffee. Nice stuff. Tastes quite good also. More of that milk chocolate thing found in the aroma. It’s dark malty and also a little fruity. Mild smooth casky texture with a little bit of prickling bubbles. Quite lightdrinkable actually and somewhat good even! 07.06.2016 AND 06.06.2016

My bottle says it’s an IPA not an “English Ale” – and that is what it tastes like. Untappd seems to think the two beers are the same so an placing my review here.

Dangerously drinkable – doesn’t taste like 6.5% !

Durham White Bishop;Bowburn, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Durham Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), GBBF, August 2005. Yet another golden ale. Actually pale straw colour rather than golden.

Durham Black Velvet;Bowburn, Durham, England;Porter;Durham Brewery;Z pompy, One Eyed Rat, Ripon. Kolor ciemnobrunatny, klarowne. Piana niska, kremowa, szybko opada do zera i nie oblepia szkla. W aromacie bardzo intensywne melanoidyny, dalej ciemne slody, kawa, palonosc, lekkie ziola. W smaku to samo co w aromacie, do tego za wysoka, i przez to troche nieprzyjemna kwasnosc, dalej wyrazny popiol i lekkie suszone sliwki i morele. Ogolnie smak jest w porzadku, ale ta niepotrzebnie podwyzszona kwasnosc zaniza ocene. W odczuciu gladkie, nisko wysycone, mocno wytrawne, niestety wchodzace juz mocno w wodnistosc. Goryczka niska, ziolowo-lodygowa, lekko sciagajaca.

Durham Black Velvet;Bowburn, Durham, England;Porter;Durham Brewery;First tasted this in The Three Judges, Glasgow in December 1998. Cask, handpump dispense. Dull black in colour with a thin tan head. Roast grain aroma, strong in intensity. Oily mouthfeel and poor lacing. Dark malts give a sweet maltloaf base with rich caramel, mocha and liquorice notes. Dry hop prickle evident in the short aftertaste. Finish is quite dry with liquorice and barley grain noted. An old traditional porter full of flavour and a great session ale. Well recommended.

Gearys London Porter;Portland, Maine, United States;Porter;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;Was expecting this to be better than it was, based on my other samples from Geary's.

Elgoods Wenceslas;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Elgoods Brewery;Cask Reindeer. Couldn?t taste the alcohol in this heavyweight Christmas contender, but could certainly feel it. Dark mahogany brown but no head. Dark fruit cake throughout. Nice, but perhaps too punchy for the end result as it felt more like an old ale rather than a barley wine.
Elgoods Wenceslas;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Elgoods Brewery;Gravicask (Cambridge Winter Ale Festival 2011) (6:3:6:3:12=3.0) Fruity hop aroma, but with a little acidity. Mid to dull orange. Slightly winey taste. Alcohol can’t be tasted, but can be felt. There’s a little acitity to the aftertaste too. Presume this isn’t at its best.
Elgoods Wenceslas;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Elgoods Brewery;Cask, gravity at St Neots BF ’09 (’Booze on the Ouse’). Odd to find this Christmas beer at the end of March. Bright amber with a sweet, fruity rather alcoholic aroma. Sweet taste, pungently alcoholic, with a strong, sharp bitter finish.

Elgoods Wenceslas;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Elgoods Brewery;Cask (gravity), Cambridge Beer Festival, May 2005. You may think May is an unusual time to be drinking a Christmas ale and you’d be right. But this isn’t your average Christmas beer - its been aged in cask since then. And it shows. There is bags of plenty of dried fruit and Christmas pudding. But there’s a woody edge which becomes much more pronounced on the palate. Tastes rather musty and dried out, with a vinous edge. There are vestiges of a warming richness but it’s has ebbed away with age. So it comes over more like an old ale than a barley wine. Interesting but I don’t really think the ageing has done it any favours. I’d like to try it fresh to get a comparison.

Freedom Pilsener Lager;80 Parsons Green Lane, Fulham, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Freedom;330ml bottle from Shropshire. Vintage 1997. This is the original Alaister Hook brewed Freedom. The one that made him famous. Freedom wasn’t, as it claims, the first British dedicated lager microbrewery, that was the Packhorse Brewery in Ashford, Hook’s previous brewery - but it was the first successful one. In addition to the Fulham brewery, Freedom had two brewpub outlets - though quality control at those places was never good and the brand suffered for a while until the original brewery owner took over production in his Brothers brewery in Staffordshire. For a lager over 10 years old this is quite good. Clean, crisp and dry, with a grapefruit quality. Very drinkable today. Some soft lactic acid gives it a refreshing edge. Nice one.

Gale's GB (Cask);Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Pale brown. Gale's beers often have a reputation for malty sweetness, even in the bitters, but this one despite having some malt, is much fresher than the Gales norm. A little sweetness at the start, quite fruity, but hops dominate here. Dry finish. Although the Gales website suggest this beer is designed to be served through a sprinkler, with a big head, the CAMRA tasting notes suggest otherwise. The version I tried was handpumped, but not through a sprinkler. Quite well balanced and very drinkable, but nothing exceptional. The Speaker, London SW1, July 2003
Gale's GB (Cask);Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;A yellow beer with no head and no aroma. The flavor is slightly sweet and slightly bitter which leaves a very good balanced beer. A nice bitter.

Raisins - sweet dark fruits, some flowery hops in the flavor. Soft palate. Like drinking slightly hoppied Finnish homebrew kalja.
Gale's Winter Brew;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Porter;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask at the Brewery Tap, Brentford. Dark brown with orange tints and only a slight head. Chocolate, dried plums, dry hops and a hint of tartness on the nose, a little roasty malt on the palate, turning peachy with a bit of cloves, and then dark chocolate coming out in the dry finish. The body is a little shorter than one might expect, yet it’s still rather satisfying.
Gale's Winter Brew;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Porter;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask@Pigs Ear BF 06. Sweet and light, lightly sticky. Shows some light caramel sort of flavours and has a touch of earthy hops in the finish. A little bit dull and the flavour is quite short.
Gale's Winter Brew;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Porter;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Casked. Dark murky ruby/brown colour, with a beige mediumsized head, which vanishes quite fast. Aroma has lots of dark fruit and chocolate in it. Also some acidic sourness sticking in the background. Flavourwise it’s sour fruity with some caramel and chocolate added. A very pleasant thing.
Gale's Winter Brew;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Porter;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask handpull at White Horse, Parson’s Green. Brown/red colour with disappearing beige head. Some yeastiness. Bit of good hoppy bite on end. Bit of yeast. Bit of gingery spice.
Gale's Winter Brew;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Porter;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);"Cask B.C.""H.""; ruby brown, clear beer. A bit fruity (dark fruit, plums) touch of chocolate, ending on a very slight sourish impression in the background. Soft-sweet at first, but again finish is soft sourish, vaguely fruity. Fruitcream-filled pralines, with most of the filling taken out? Settles on more bitterness, however. Rather well-bodied, for such a low ABV beer. It’s not bad, nowhere, but somehow, I can’t get wild over it. Could do with some more malt punch."
Gale's Winter Brew;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Porter;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask at Old Bank, Turku, Jan ’07. Clear, dark ruby color, with a bubbly off-white head. Sourish grassy and slightly chocolaty aroma, with a faint hint of skunkiness. Sourish, fruity flavor of plum and cola, with a hint of chocolate. Sweetish sour aftertaste. No suggestion of roasted malt, strangely enough. Very light carbonation, dry mouthfeel, medium body. A bit bland, but OK real ale. But seriously, is this supposed to be a porter? Apart from the vague chocolatiness, I find absolutely nothing porterlike in this one.
Gale's Butser Bitter;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Drunk Multiple times in Old House at Home Romsey and Wykeham Arms Winchester before brewing was discontinued on it in 2008. This beer pours a mid brown with a small white head. Weet-a-Bix aroma which follows through into the body. Pleasantly malty with a back up bitterness. I always preferred this beer to Gales HSB and indeed Fullers Chiswick too.
Gale's Butser Bitter;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Pint at the Kick Off. Poured a nice dark ruby with brownish highlights. Small beige cap. The aroma is quite nice, very Brit hop-forward with some mild cherry fruit esters and chrystal malts. Flavour starts out with some nice hop flavour as well as accompanying bitterness, transitioning into a pleasant mild malty sweetness. Watery palate that makes this one go down way too quick. Carbonation is medium but high for Bitter standards. Some sort of weird salty aspect immerges as it warms. All in all an enjoyable pint, deserving of a slightly higher over-all score. It’s nothing that bad, just very pedestrian.
Gale's Butser Bitter;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Handpulled cask at a few Gales tied houses over the years. Chestnut with a white head.

Gale's Butser Bitter;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Hand pump at The Ship, near Portsmouth. Thats not very helpfull, really - every pub round there is called The Ship if its not The Nelson or The Victory... Looks nice, clear amber, small head. Very sweet, like other Gales beers (ESB etc), malty, some hop dryness in the finish. A good light bodied summer afternoon beer.

Gale's Easter Frolics;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Hand pulled at the British Oak, Stirchley, Birmingham. Very similar in looks and falvouring to the Bristol IPA, which was also sampled in the same venue today. If anything, the flavours are even more muted and lacking than that other beer, which is worrying. Bland.
Gale's Easter Frolics;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;CASK: Pale amber color, low lathery head. Weak malt body with a broad hop bitter across the mouth. Quick profile and thin - almost watery. OK, but not so thrilling overall.

Gale's Easter Frolics;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;[cask at Cockney Pub] An orange beer with no head. The aroma is very faint with fruity notes. The flavor is flat and metallic like some cask beers. But the flavor also contains fruit and a good hops, that gives it a slight bitterness. It has a very fine balance. And is very fresh and mild which makes it easy drinkable - I'd call it a session beer.

Gale's Christmas Ale;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Gales;Bottle - 275mL (9.3 ounce) corked. 2001 Vintage. Muddy copper pour with no head, save the spotty brown bubble along the edge of the tulip glass. Strong fig and raisin notes in the aroma, light plum and soft spice with faded caramel and malt notes. Taste is strong soy sauce, figs, unripe plums, raisins, caramel and light spice. Body is light with no carbonation. Finishes with more strong raisin, plum and figs, light spice, soy sauce notes, caramel, dark bread and soft malt. WAY past it’s prime but still drinkable.

Dark molasses. Raisins. Potent alcohol lingers. Carbonation mostly flat. Very smooth, but enough of a bite at the end to know that it has not turned. Nicely mellow now but is likely to turn soon.
Gale's Christmas Ale;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Gales;I got my hands on this rare gem while working in the beer dept. at The Party Source. It was all alone on the very top of a storage rack and no one knew where it came from and how long it had been there. So I saved it for about another five years and finally decided to try it this past Christmas, unaware of how well it had aged (or soured for that matter.) Poured into a trappist style glass producing a small ring of foam. Tons of UFOs (unidentified floating objects,) which was probably old, stale yeast. The color was brownish tan almost tobacco-like russet. Aroma was fruity and vinegary, like a very tannic red wine. The body was thin and flat, and the flavor was of immediate sourness, evolving into a medicinal fruitiness. Gales has been one of my favorite English breweries and I only wish that i had tried more from them. Drank this under the Christmas tree with my love. Made it about halfway through the glass before we decided that time and the elements had not been friendly to this beer, which reluctantly became a sink pour...
Gale's Christmas Ale;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Gales;Bottle. Pours a cloudy light brown. Cork smelled of yeast but that didn’t follow through into the beer. Caramel notes and some spices in the aroma. Taste has some caramel-ey coffee notes with a slightly fruity flavor. Quite complex, but good.

Gale's Christmas Ale;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Gales;2001 vintage. I enjoyed this at Delilah’s 12th annual Winter Beer Tasting in Chicago, IL. From what I remember this was partially sour with an interesting malt/spice profile. Was rather average, especially for the vintage.
Gale's Christmas Ale;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Gales;2001 Vintage A: pours a cloudy, murky tawny color. No head at all. S: light coconut esters. Some apples and dates. Slightly strong alcohol notes. Some light sour aromas as well. T: wow. Never had it fresh, but I can notice that a ton of flavors have passed away. Major malt notes, mostly caramel, plums and apples, some clove. Very wine-like. I do pull some grapes/raisins out of this. Very sour notes. M: no carbonation left, so its flat. Some alcohol notes/vibes. Very smooth with the age of this. Think it was a aged a little too long.
Gale's Christmas Ale;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Gales;I drank this one fresh when it was still delicious. Amber pour. Strong nose of candied sugar, malt, toffee and caramel molasses. Taste is similar. Strong body. Rated 4/11/03
Gale's Christmas Ale;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Gales;"Bottle is different than almost every other beer I’ve seen. 9.3 fl.oz and 8.5%ABV...Opening now. Up need a wine opener...ok now opening. Cork was completely dry and now looking for a date on the bottle. I don’t see on. Sour Aroma hiding a slight malt smell. Can’t find any hops. White big bubble head. Beer is a cloudy yellow amber. Definitely unfiltered. Sour fruity taste, not sure if it is supposed to be this sour. No hops at all. Nope I can’t keep going. Looking back at the bottle it says, "" A spiced ale specially brewed to be enjoyed this Christmas..."" Well I guess they meant it for the year they brewed it. Some beers are ment to be aged and some are ready to drink right away...this is the latter I hope or else it is just a bad beer to begin with..."
Gale's Christmas Ale;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Gales;BOTTLE: 2002 vintage, brown pour. Aroma is sour cherry, taste is raisin, caramel, sour fruit. Not particularly good.

Nutty and slightly astringent nose. Toffee, caramel. Taste is bittersweet with a sweetness from the malt balanced by a bitter tang from the hop. Some sulphur in the aftertaste. Probably much better as a light mild. Hops seem out of place somehow.
McMullen AK (Cask);Hertford, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McMullen;Cask at the Woolpack - I believe that this is a pale mild and it certainly has a level of sweetness that you would associate with the type. No real hops, just quite an overpowering sweetness that I didn’t enjoy. Creamy mouthfeel, but I think that was due to the tap.

McMullen Country Bitter;Hertford, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McMullen;Cask in a pub - Some bitter hops, smooth malt and a very slight fruityness to what is actually quite a sweet beer. There was a creamy mouthfeel, but I think that was due to the sparkler on the tap. It’s completely inoffensive standard bitter, but has no real interest or flavour for that matter
McMullen Country Bitter;Hertford, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McMullen;Handpull cask at the George IV, Sawbridgeworth. Ruddy golden with a light creamy head. Sulphur is noticeable in the aroma but there’s also praline, butter rum, orange peel. Taste is standard malty bittersweet with light clove and buttered toast notes.

McMullen Special Reserve Anniversary Porter;Hertford, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;McMullen;With the hefty price tag on the McMullen beers (approx $10.00/six) I am not all that impressed. This porter seems to be a bit on the lighter side lacking a real intense flavor. Not anywhere as flavorful as Sam Smith's or Anchor Porter. Also seemed to be a bit overcarbonated. Nothing great.

Harveys Armada Ale (Cask);Lewes, East Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Harveys Brewery;Cask at the Garland, Redhill. Ruddy tan/brown, clear and almost flat.

Taste is bittersweet, the bittering hop leads but there’s a roast chestnut and doughy sweetness lingering just behind and coming to prominence in the finish. Vegetal notes in the aftertaste, and the body is oily, so points off there. Flawed but solid enough.
Harveys Bloomsbury Brown (formerly Nut Brown Ale);Lewes, East Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Harveys Brewery;"A bottle rebranded (I think?) as ""Dark Mild.""

Full body but close to flat, some berry esters throughout though mild, and a sort of musky orange peel I notice with volume, blended with sludgy-yeasty notes.

Light raspberry and cranberry aromas twinned with a little banana yeast and cereals. Quite sweet with pale maltiness and touches of the fruit found in the aroma. I’m too scared of the loose yeast to be able to drink this anything other than highly tentatively. It’s really not worth the money or time this one. Might have to dump it.
Iceni Celtic Queen;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Iceni Brewery;Bottle conditioned, 500ml. Clouded gold no head. After a fruitless evening of beer searching, decided to open this one, which was a bit unfortunate.

Iceni Four Grains;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Iceni Brewery;"(Cask) Pale-amber, clear; 2cm white head. Nose of sewage, some hops, but AWFUL! Very bitter - not really hoppy, rather a bit metallic. Caramel retronasal. Thinnish, light . A beer with such a smell is bound to be condemned. Too bad - but if you presume brewing German Weisse, and manage NONE of the characteristics right!"

Fruit mingled with hop in the nose at low levels with an underlying yeastiness. Yeastiness is obtrusive, coating the mouth and dominating the flavour and lingering into the finish. A hop bitterness does develop finally, but yeast is still apparent.

Iceni Roisin Dubh;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Iceni Brewery;Nose straight barnyard with a surprising Bretty sharpness, a nod to Orval or Guldenberg, and an occasional whiff of pig shit. I’m not joking. I’ve never smelt an English beer like this. Spiky and acidic. No nonsense punchy citric hopping, sulphur and late, late malted milk sweetness. Mahogany murk with a creamy collar of fine suds. A daring, unusual beer impossible to categorise.

Iceni Roisin Dubh;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Iceni Brewery;Cask Conditioned at The Dun Cow, Horley, Oxon. Red brown beer with little head. Roisin Dubh means 'dark rose' in our ancient tongue, and the Dun Cow specialises in serving old style recipes. The beer has a similar character to a belgian red though not quite the full blodied sourness. There is an acidic tongue to it and a fruity malt. It looks as though Iceni are trying to deliver a pre hop beer and it certainly is interesting.

A light gold coloured beer with a tightish white head and some spongy lacing. The aroma is a bit creamy.

Aroma of light toasted and caramel malts with a touch of piney hops. Taste follows, with a nuttiness to the malt and the hops way behind. It's a little thin and uninspiring, and honestly, who drinks amber ales anymore.

Caramel malt aroma with notes of bready malt and light spicy hops. Pours amber colored with a thin off white head with good retention and excellent lacing.

Steamworks Lizard Head Red;Durango, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);Amber color, fairly generic... grainy, light malt, faint citrus hops.

Steamworks Lizard Head Red;Durango, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);This is an attractive, malty ale that is fresh and lager like. I was expecting a bit more hop action. On draft at the brewpub.

Steamworks Backside Stout;Durango, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);A very basic sweet stout with an emphasis on the stout, not the sweet. Looked for a bit more smoothness and sugar, but this beer unfortunately has neither.
Steamworks Backside Stout;Durango, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);On tap at Steamworks. Seems more dry stout-y. Very grainy. A bit astringent.
Steamworks Pittmans Premium Ale;Durango, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);Not a bad golden ale. Has a nice amount of citrusy hop character. Light and crisp. Tried for the first time back in 2011 at the brewery and only now transferring the rating.
Steamworks Pittmans Premium Ale;Durango, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);on tap-pours a (dish bubbles) white head and yellow color. Aroma is citrus grapefruit-hops. Taste is citrus, secondary grain. OK carbonation.
Steamworks Pittmans Premium Ale;Durango, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);"Light golden and clear. Light-bodied with a lively carbonation. Sweetish malts complemented nicely by a mild bitterness. Well balanced. Rather ""light"" in every sense of the term, but not too bad. One of the better light-tasting beers I've had."
Steamworks Pittmans Premium Ale;Durango, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);Tap - I really liked it. It has a sort of sweet, caramelly taste that is not cloying. It doesn't really taste like most other Colorado brews, and gets points for originality.
Steamworks 3rd Eye Enlightened Pale Ale (Third Eye);Durango, Colorado, United States;IPA;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);Pours a clear golden orange on tap with bubbly white head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of nice earthy and citrus hop notes over a solid malt backbone. Taste has the malt up front, biscuit and a touch of caramel, with citrus and floral hop notes behind. A decent pale ale, that leans towards the IPA front.
Steamworks 3rd Eye Enlightened Pale Ale (Third Eye);Durango, Colorado, United States;IPA;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);"From Aug 2007 Purchased as part of a mixed 6Pack at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins Pours from 12oz bottle(best by Sept 2007) a clear medium gold and it has a small but solid head of foam that shrinks to some spotting in the middle and a ring around the edge of my glass. The smell is hoppy with grapefruit and pine. The taste is pretty darned smooth. The hop character doesn't go overboard but I get some good pine and floral hoppiness and the sweet malt that isn't so far in the background does a nice job when it comes to balance. The more I sip on it, the more balanced the flavours become and that's just fine by me. It's got a good mouthfeel to it and the finish ends up with that pine but I wouldn't describe it as being very bitter. I think this one would be a good one to go to when one isn't in the ""hop head"" mode. Nice stuff."
Steamworks 3rd Eye Enlightened Pale Ale (Third Eye);Durango, Colorado, United States;IPA;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);"Bottle. Copper in colour. Hoppy; grassy and mildly earthy hops.

""Another soild brew from steamworks, I am starting to like this brewer. 3rd eye poured a nice copper body with a thin off white cap. Nice friuty/ floral aroma was the highlight of this beer.

Steamworks Steam Engine Lager;Durango, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);From Jul 2007 Purchased at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins as part of a mixed 6 Pack. It pours from 12oz can a very nice clear deep amber with a very large head of billowy foam that shrinks slowly leaving a fine broken layer. The smell is very floral and borders on chemical-like. Not a good nose in my book. The taste on first sip has some caramel malt that is semi sweet and. there's something odd here....after the swallow, I smack my mouth and I get a really foul taste. Tastes like..umm...ashes??? Yucky yuck. I've taken about 3 mothfulls and that's gonna do it for me. The rest is going down the drain. :^( As a side note, the can has these numbers on it: 6 04 04 A 1 B A. If this was canned in 2004 asw the numbers may suggest than...it's sad that this one was still in circulation but I have to say, I've been to Wilbur's many times and this last visit was the first occasion that I saw this beer. Anywho, I can't recommend this one from the experience I'm having...
Steamworks Steam Engine Lager;Durango, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steamworks Brewing Company (US);Clear deep Amber hue under a bubbly rocky ivory head. Very faint aroma of Amber biscuit. Smooth and crisp flavor that’s very minimalistic. Slight doughy biscuit and Amber malt but offers a smooth body and super gentle sweetness. Not complex flavor but very clean.

Hops are playing a role but not lead. Bitterness at the end is heavy and the finish is dry. They report 86 IBUs... I think not!

Palmers Tally Ho! (Cask);Bridport, Dorset, England;Old Ale;Palmers;Superb example of a vastly underrated ale style - strong mild/old ale. Fortunately free of any unnecessary 'modern' hop notes which do this type of beer no favours at all (micro brewers in thrall to US styles please note!). Satisfyingly rounded malty sweetness, perfect in the winter before a blazing fire, or as the last beer of a session at any time of year. So thanks to Palmers for making it available on draught al year round.
Palmers Tally Ho! (Cask);Bridport, Dorset, England;Old Ale;Palmers;Cask at Prince of Wales, Farnborough. 21/06/16. Vague earthy aroma. Dark and deep looking but not much to the beige head. Smooth with a slight bitter edge to the dark chocolate taste. A nice old school pint.

Mouthfeel is full with long lasting aftertaste. Malt and bitterness remain for a few minutes. A good beer that sets itself apart from boring strong ales. This must be a direct descendent of Old Burton ales. Special.

Not much sweetness on the initial taste but lots of bitterness. Flavours of burnt malt, nut and some red fruit. Finishes dry, but rich and satisfying with a nice hint of warming alcohol. Reminds me of a Belgian dubbel in some ways. A great example of a winter/old ale, a style that seems to be dying by degrees in the UK.

Palmers Tally Ho! (Cask);Bridport, Dorset, England;Old Ale;Palmers;(Cask @ RopeMakers , Bridport , Dorest) .This beer is by far Palmers best in their otherwise turgid and mundane low-boost offerings !. It helps that I dig the Old ale style and that maybe the other beers they brew sucking ass makes this shine more than it otherwise would do. Old Pecuiler was one of my first beer loves when I was twenty , I seldom drink it now but any chance to drink an old style ale I’m intrigued . A burnt purple colour that looks bruised and blackcurrant shaded .. The nose is a bit subtle, chalk , , fresh yeasty cask accent suggesting living organism that reminds you its a living beer , caramel , licorice but its a surprisingly mild smelling . If the nose is shy the flavour aint ...A powerful deep rich character is in-ya-face ...A roast bitterness interacting with a tart raisin fruit texture that twists the palate in the name of complexity . It finishes dry with burnt licorice , smooth and creamy . A complex , interesting , flavoursome ale !

Pilgrim Crusader;Reigate, Surrey, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pilgrim Brewery;Cask Conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Yellow golden beer with no head. This was a cold flat smelly experience, poor quality hops with few redeeming features.
Pilgrim Crusader;Reigate, Surrey, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pilgrim Brewery;Terrible aroma and taste--to my mind, a combination of asphalt paving fumes and a poultry barn (seriously). The body holds up well (despite having no head and a light consistency)--but overall this is too much to stomach. (on tap, Rising Sun, Epsom)
Pilgrim Springbock;Reigate, Surrey, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pilgrim Brewery;"Some banana and pineapple tones, but the whole thing vanishes so quickly leaving just a vaque fruity tang in the mouth that you wonder why they bothered, apart from the Safeway sponsored challenge. This did win an award in 2000, and now claims to be ""The 'Champagne' Beer"", although Pomagne would be closer to the mark."
Pilgrim Pudding;Reigate, Surrey, England;Old Ale;Pilgrim Brewery;Cask Fresh @ The Claret - a Freehouse, near Croyden. A good, traditional Winter Warmer - a dark, sweet, plummy beer with a bitter licorice finish. Full bodied without being syrupy. A flavoursome and comforting brew with only a hint of the alcohol strength in the taste. Licorice aroma. Very pleasant and decently made. I love Winter Warmers!
Pilgrim Pudding;Reigate, Surrey, England;Old Ale;Pilgrim Brewery;"Slight gushing to towering orangey head, collapsing; deep brown, slight reddish shine. Very vinous, rich woody nose - blind I'd say Flemish Oud Bruin immediately; lactic acid is no doubt there - but also milk powder and a bit of milk chocolate. The idea of Oud bruin disappears not entirely in the taste, but is diminished with a very bitter beginning, extremely woody/tanninelike in character. Lactic-sour too, lots of fruit, esters and just again a bit of sweet chocolate. Medium bodied, acids make it seem thinner. Lactic sourness keeps hanging around quite long. This is certainly not a bad try - rather the opposite. but a real Flemish Oud Bruin would have more depth, more complexity, I'm sure. I'm still amazed to find Surrey instead of Flanders on the label. What it is not at all, is liquid Christmas pudding. And then Silk rates it, and finds no sourness. So yours truly goes looking and discovers his bottle had to be drunk before 8/98... Shame on me, the beer had been aged, and NOT prematurely!"

Skinners Cornish Knocker Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Bottle from Morrisons. Very lively when opened, foamed out the top, and even poured delicately it frothed into a big 5cm head. Once it settled a bit a lovely cloudy orangey golden colour revealed itself. Aroma was a bit wheatey. Thinner taste and less than I was expecting. Rattery unlike other bottles golden ales. Gas seemed to vanish, felt uncarbonated, perhaps the frothy head robbed it. Unusual beer, maybe the bottle i had had been mistreated. Will get another and reinvestigate sometime.

Skinners Lights Out;Truro, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Skinners Brewery;Dark golden colour, initially this beer purs a goos head, but it doesn't last. Strong hoppy aroma, with floral hints. The body is too thin, just a bit malty, while the aftertaste is very fresh and hoppy. An average beer which lacks of character.

Skinners St. Piran's Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Currently drinking this ale after visiting Cornwall. Have to say I’m not too impressed. Find it has too much of a tangey taste to it and an inordinate amount of froth.
Skinners St. Piran's Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;500ml Bottle. ... of froth!! Ive always found the carbonation in Skinners beers to be a bit inconsistant - this is the first time Ive tried St Pirans - and no matter how slowly I poured I got a glass of bubbles! When eventually it settled down, it left a light brown body, cloudy with reddish tints and a thick lasting off white head. The aroma is very fruity, lemon, rhubarb (I hate rhubarb), plums (I hate plums), sweet and something that I can’t quite put my finger on but it isn’t good! Taste is lemony and washing up liquid... in fact i had to change glasses to make sure I had rinsed my glass properly. Theres also something floral going on there but as I dont munch flowers often I can’t be more specific. The long last carbonation is harsh on the palate and the lemon bitterness is extremely long lasting. I usually like Skinners beers a lot - this one I’m not going to tough again - EVER!!
Skinners St. Piran's Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Bottled (from Beers Of Europe). Orangeish golden colour, small slightly off-white head. Aroma is fruity, some mild sweet malts, grains and some slight acidic berries (acidic not in a bad way).

Skinners St. Piran's Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;10th April 2010 Hazy gold beer. Light nose of sweet malt and orange. Semi crisp palate.

Skinners St. Piran's Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Bottled at St. Georges Hotel, Perranporth. Pours deep golden with a small creamy white head.

Skinners St. Piran's Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Cask at Bow bar Edinburgh ... amber ... white bubbly head ... bright hop and washing up liquid ... dull tones .. soft fruit... no real depth but innofensive.
Skinners St. Piran's Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Hazy gold slopping headlessly from the bottle. A few bilious tufts of froth. Nose freshly polished table, rhubarb, honey, Pledge, pine and polish. A pleasant departure from all the grapefruit-sodden beers I seem to have been drinking of late. Evergreen, soap and stewed Darjeeling. That’s your lot. Skinner’s beers can really hit the mark closer to source (or in the rural backwaters of Warwickshire, for that matter) but the complete lack of conditioning and off notes here render a decently hopped ale virtually undrinkable. Will try again...
Skinners St. Piran's Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Bottle: Just my kind of hops on the nose. Right there, in your face accompanied by hints of digestive biscuits. Loads of honey and citrus fruits with a finish of something a little more tropical. Oily and smooth with a good dryness to finish you off.

Clear amber in colour with a thick white head. Herbal tea and mown grass in the long aroma. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a fruit base of pink grapefruit, kiwi, gooseberry and lime. Dusty floral hops add a bitter herbal note to the long aftertaste which compliments the malt well. Warm juicy marmalade fruit coats the palate with citric sweetness and a litle alcoholic kick. Great ESB for the winter and well recommended.
Skinners Mazey Ale;Truro, Cornwall, England;Old Ale;Skinners Brewery;Bronze brew with a fruity, treacly taste - very mellow and attractive to drink. The finish is relaxing, malty and has more hints of treacle and honey with the malt. Sweet but you can forgive it. (Cask @ Check Inn, Wroughton)

Springhead Goodrich Castle;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Springhead Brewery;Cask (handpump), Penderels Oak (JDW), Holborn. Bright, pale gold colour. Loose, thin, white head. Can’t say I noticed the Rosemary. Seemed more like a standard pale bitter to me. The aroma is subtle to the point of anonymity. Perhaps a touch of light malt. A bit moist and clammy. Citric and floral notes on the palate backed up by pale, toasty malt. Finishes reasonably dry. Clean, mellow and fresh mouthfeel but maybe a bit low on bite. Some restrained bitterness kicks in late. Pleasant and easy drinking but could benefit from a firmer mouthfeel.
Springhead Goodrich Castle;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Springhead Brewery;Cask at Wetherspoons, Milton Keynes. Gold with a small white head. Odd elastoplast aroma, redolent of the first aid box. Taste is an amalgam of many non beer related flavours: peppermint, cardboard and proprietory cold and flu remedies. Odd beer, rather nasty, which seems an unkind thing to say about a historic medieval recipe. But it’s true. Sorry.
Springhead Goodrich Castle;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Springhead Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - Vat and Fiddle Nottingham. A slightly hazy yellow coloured beer with a white head and lacing. The aroma and taste are full of rosemary. I can see where others would think ginger because there is a strong spicy edge to it, and the beer feels hot. A bit heavy on the flavour. Interesting but a bit OTT.
Springhead Goodrich Castle;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Springhead Brewery;Cask conditioned @ South Western Arms, Soton. Informed by the barman that this was brewed with ginger. Either I was susceptible to the power of suggestion or this did contain ginger as this had quite a pleasant gingery flavour to it, not the full on feiry ginger of ginger beer more a candied ginger. Not quite sweet malt base with some citrus notes leads to a fairly refreshing beer but one I wouldnt want to drink to much of.
Springhead Goodrich Castle;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Springhead Brewery;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. I didn’t get any of the rosemary. All I got was lime. Gold colour with thin white head. Lime flavoured bitter with citrus finish. I really don’t like the lime in it. Tastes as though glass was used for lime coridal before hand. Rest of the beer is ok and the people I was with seemed to like it.

Clear pale copper in colour with a thin white head. Note of dried grass in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a digestive biscuit malt base with a touch of caramel sweetness about it. Strong metallic tang of hop resins gives a jarring astringent bitter aftertaste. Finish is dry with some bitter resins still in play. An ok session bitter.

Springhead Roaring Meg;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Springhead Brewery;"Cask at GBBF 2009. (Backlog / historic rating from old records. NO tasting notes except ""Rather disappointing."") (Backlog)"
Springhead Roaring Meg;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Springhead Brewery;OK, this was my first review last year: -- This was a bit disappointing for flagship brew. The aroma is quite rich, but difficult to place - a bit of resin and skunk. It has a clear orange/amber appearance with no head to speak of. The taste is a little salty, and sweeter than I prefer for an IPA and the palate a bit flat and oily. It is quite bitter, but lacks the freshness of a really decent IPA. I won't be seeking this one out again. -- I've inadvertently just drank another bottle, and enjoyed it quite a bit more. It certainly is quite salty-tasting, but the new bottle did not have the sweetness I complained about. The aftertaste is quite astringent but overall, the beer certainly has character. So it doesn't stand out but it's a decent enough brew...

Too easy.
Timothy Taylor's Golden Best;Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Timothy Taylor's;Draught. Pale golden with an off white head, almost flat. Not much of a distinctive aroma beyond the sweetish malt and slight hops, really unimpressive.

Timothy Taylor's Ram Tam (Cask);Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Timothy Taylor's;Bottle at home from Morrisons. A perfect cellar temperature and a good head with long-lasting lacing. The taste was malt, caramel and some bittering hops, but to me they were in almost perfect balance. I normally despise a caramel taste to beer, but this one worked because of the balance. A great mouthfeel from all the malt and a hell of a lot going on when you consider the low abv. I am a fan of well made low abv beers and this is a good one.

St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;This is clear pinkish purple and headless. It tastes very much like Kool Aid, too sweet and just vaguely fruity w/ the only thing jumping out as vaguely natural being a kind of astringent cranberry quality.
St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;710ml clear twist off bottle. Kool-aid pink/purple pour. Cranberry cocktail kool-aid aroma. Cranberry is most distiguishable, lollipop type sweetness.
St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated on 2/6/08- Great brew for getting chicks drunk at a frat party. Sweet and strong, price is reasonable. Overall it is not bad for flavored malt liquor
St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"I literally got excited when I saw this St Ides product at the liquor store next to the place where my wife and I will be getting our next mattress. I was a little disappointed it wasn’t the flagship St Ides, but this will have to do. The description is perfect. I am the new generation of malt liquor drinkers! I am fast paced, suburban, edgy as shit mother fucker, and I most definitifuckingly drink malt liquor. If you are doubting my sincerity, you are plain wrong. This double deuce made its way into one of my tall kitchen glasses. Smells of currant and dark berries. Sweet and watery and sweet and a little sticky and and sweet and a general fruitiness akin to fruit punch. I will finish this, unlike Steel Reserve fruity nonsense. This here is the really McCoy of fruity malt liquor. As an aside, I did pass up the Steel Reserve Margarita 24 ounce 8% ABV can. Maybe next time. I do love my Beer-grrr-itas!!! This is incredibly easy to drink. I was not expecting that sediment at the bottom of the bottle when I was topping off my glass. WTF? Definitifuckingly ""berry-er"" now."
St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;least favorite of the three I tried. abv showing more than usual. Berry is nice enough but more artificial than the others. in between really bad and ok :)
St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"I can remember drinking this brew years ago; it was very popular at one time.

St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;aroma, berries, fake thought like kool aid color, reddish purple no head taste, sour fruit, and sweet too, really not too bad, but hits the tummy in the end, always upset my stomach overall, cheap and somewhat tasty, but Ill get your stomach injestion.
St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Sampled from a clear bottle this drink poured a red-violet color with a trace soapy white head that faded almost instantly and left no lacing. The aroma was light sweet berries and not much else. The flavor was tangy and lightly tart sweet vague berries. There was an odd cardboard like undertone. Medium finish. Light body. Not bad.
St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;That purpl drank. Purple color, some sediment. Aroma is berries. Taste is berries, better then many of the fruit beers on the site. Cherry Wheat has nothing on St Ides purple.
St. Ides Special Brew - Berry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Has a nice deep red color but that’s the only redeeming quality...smells like cough medicine and tastes of that, sugar, and grain alcohol...revolting stuff, and to think the kiwi-strawberry wasn’t that bad

Breó;Dublin, Ireland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St. James's Gate (Diageo);My abiding memory of this beer is going into a bar in Dublin in the late 90s where there was a promotion on, first Breo free second half price, I was the only person in the place to try it. Probably 10 years ahead of its time, Hazy yellow, fruity aroma and flavour. After all that not a style I particularly like.
Breó;Dublin, Ireland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St. James's Gate (Diageo);This was the Guiness attempt at a belgian type beer. It was readily available on draught in Ireland. From memory it was really good, however it never managed to get a full release anywhere outwith Dublin.
Breó;Dublin, Ireland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St. James's Gate (Diageo);I had this beer in Dublin on holiday in 2000. I remember I liked it. Not the white beer I’m used to (Hoegaarden, Schneider Weisse), but still a nice beer. Refreshing.

Gearys Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;Bit of a ringer for the Snatch-laden pint of twiggy brown Burton I had up the road earlier. Not pale but coppery brown and densely foamed. Nose pure English boiled sweet caramel and aniseed. Full condition ushering more mineral and caramel tones stirred with liquorice and finished with wet dough and vanilla. Hint of cinnamon and Honey Nut Cornflake. Could easily pass as Abbot or Hen or any cask Greene King. Never had a beer like this before from America. Dreadful.

Wells Eagle Smooth;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);This was the only bitter available at Bedford Blues Rugby Club. Served in a plastic glass it had a decent enough head and was a nice colour. I suppose ’smooth’ means tasteless, because I could discern little in the way of aroma or flavour. Certainly there wasn’t any bitterness as the term is generally understood. It wasn’t in any way unpleasant, just dull.

Wells Eagle Smooth;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);At the brewery. Creamy head. The normal Eagle does not have any distinctive flavour. Not even the weak flavour of it is retained in this smooth version. Very boring.

Shipyard Prelude Special Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Strong Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;I can see where they are going with this, but falling a little short of my expectations. Not one of my favorite styles maybe. Tastes like a stronger brown ale. Could use some more hops to balance out the sweetness....but again...this is the style. I prefer their Chamberlain or Old Thumper as far as English Ales go.

Michelob Golden Draft Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);From can to glass. Grainy throughout. I am enjoying this on the last night at my folks house in STL, so maybe this review gets bumped up a notch or two.
Michelob Golden Draft Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Nice, clean-tasting beer. Smooth taste typical of a draft taste. I prefer this over other light beers, but don't prefer light beers typically.
Michelob Golden Draft Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Nothing on the nose. Crystal clear pale yellow color. Grainy corn flavors. Mild bitterness. Would be good ice cold on a 90 degree day. Not sure what the folks in Minnesota have on this brew but they love it.
Michelob Golden Draft Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This is my favorite light beer. I first tasted it on a tour at the brewery in St Louis but they informed me it’s only available in the Great Lakes states. Not sold in St Louis! This was in 2004 and I put in repeated requests to have it sold near me. I bought cases of it whenever I was in a market that sold it. Now... 13 years later it is available in Kansas City. I drink a wide variety of beers most of the time but when I want a light beer with low calories and a crisp flavor, I go for Michelob Golden Light.
Michelob Golden Draft Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12 ounce bottle. Pours a very clear straw golden color with a quickly disappearing white head. The aroma says it all: this is the perfect example of acetaldehyde,in beer which is the precursor to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation. The aroma and flavor here are of cut green apples. I find this quite offensive and actually worse than most other mainstream light lagers, but I used to own a tavern and I sold a lot of it. One time, my beverage chiller got a bit too cold and Michelob Golden Draft Light froze solid while the Beck´s non-alcoholic right next to it was just fine. That tells you just how thin and watered-down this stuff really is.
Michelob Golden Draft Light;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12oz can pours a pale clear straw golden with a large white head. Sweet corn grain malt aroma, cidery. Taste of watery sweet malt and corn.

Cambridge Regatta Golden;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Cambridge Brewing Company;On tap at the source Golden with a near brilliant clarity and solid sheet of bone whites. Smells like a nice kolsch: corn, grain, soft floral character and a nice hint of grass. Taste follows through well with a solid grain bed, some flowers, some nice bitterness to dry it up a bit as the slight sweetness rolls over the tongue. Medium and maybe even a little full for the style with soft carb and a wet finish. A nice beer, wish they’d not call it a golden on their menu, because it doesn’t really fit that categorically IMO.

Cambridge Charles River Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Cambridge Brewing Company;Aroma of dark caramelized malt, with a whiff of booziness. Pours dark brown with tan lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but there's a fortified wine backnote. Palate is medium sweet but the hop bitterness kicks in quickly - a bit like a rabbit-punch.

Cambridge Blackout Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Cambridge Brewing Company;Roasty, fairly bitter, with a little milky sweetness. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth for the most part, similar to a draft Guinness with the same type of head. But, it becomes a little unpleasant and off-putting in the finish, which is strange for a low ABV beer. It’s alright, just not the most well-crafted stout I’ve had, and the unfermentable barley may have done more harm than good.
Cambridge Blackout Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Cambridge Brewing Company;Must say that my palate is shot after the Cerisee Casse, makes it taste like water.... Definitely light body, creamy, roasted malts... Pretty good...

Cambridge Blackout Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Cambridge Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. The color is extremely dark mahogany, virtually black, with faint glints of crimson showing when strongly backlit. A thick and lasting, creamy, tan head leaves nice sheets of lacing behind. Aromas are smooth and roasty, bittersweet chocolate, burnt caramel, roasted barley, and vanilla cream all working together wonderfully. Flavors of bittersweet chocolate and roasty cafe mocha are further heightened by dark, toasty barley and flaked oats. Smooth and silky, the nitro feel lends substantially more body than you’d expect from such a low ABV beer. This doesn’t quite live up to the house porter, but at just 3.8% and as drinkable as they come, it comes damn close and makes for a nice day of football watching.
Cambridge Blackout Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Cambridge Brewing Company;Pours an opaque black with dark mahogany edges and a dense, frothy dark tan head. Lightly sweet and roasted dark malty nose has some chocolate notes. Body is a little thinner than expected with a touch of sweetness and bitter dark chocolate toward a drier, slightly watery finish. An ok dry stout, but needs a little more body.
Cambridge Blackout Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Cambridge Brewing Company;Tap @ CBC – Pitch black, creamy tan head. Creamy roasted coffee and mocha molasses nose with underlying toasted vanilla bean wafts. Soft roasted coffee and cream flavors balance on hints of tobacco and touches of berry. Light bodied and thin, soft carbonation, roasty finish. Needs more body to it, but still tasty none the less..
Cambridge Blackout Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Cambridge Brewing Company;This is one dark beer. I was served in a small sampler glass and it was completely opaque. Wonderfully creamy head with coffee and roasted malt notes. The beer had coffee notes, plenty of deep earthy roast notes, and a hint of chocolate. The mouth feel is great for the first instant and then the beer gives way and ends up as a thin and slightly metallic and not exactly dry. With a better finish this would be a truly great beer. Cheers!
Cambridge Blackout Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Cambridge Brewing Company;On nitro, CBC. Dark as it gets. Slick and full mouthfeel. Watery, metallic aroma. Light creamy roast flavors. Unsatisfying.

Cambridge Red God IPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Cambridge Brewing Company;Treated as an American Strong Ale, this was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a semi-dark red color with a thin white head that dissipated at a nice pace. Messy lacing ran around the glass nicely. The smell started off with some big smooth toffee to caramel sweet malts. Ruddy leafy tobacco flavors come in and dry out the aroma. The flavor copies the smell nicely. Definitely, dry tobacco, toffee and caramel over top of some citrus and piney hops. Dried tobacco/citra aftertaste and smooth dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice smooth sipping quality about it. Overall, this was a good American Strong ale that I think I could come back to.

Cambridge Red God IPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Cambridge Brewing Company;Rated on 7-15-2015 (Bottle) When poured, this beer has a small smooth beige head that mostly diminished, hazy amber body, lively, fast rising carbonation, and spotty amounts of lacing. The aroma is piney hops, caramel malt and fruity. The flavor is moderate bitterness, piney hops, fruity, caramel malt. This beer is medium bodied. This beer is not too hoppy tasting for the style and is a sipping beer. This beer is worth trying and definitely a beer that I would drink again.
Cambridge Red God IPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Cambridge Brewing Company;650 ml bottle purchased at the brewery. Amber like color with some lasting head. Aroma is caramel toffee note, pine and citrus like hops. The body of this beer is thick, sticky and sweet texture. Just a huge amount of caramel, toffee and sugar. The hops are here without question, pine and grapefruit with lasting bitterness after the sip. Honestly this brew feels dated, like in 2005 or 2006 this was a big killer brew, now it just seems like a overly sweet, sticky, massively hopped malt bomb. I’m leaning away from any IPA with a caramel malt base, I prefer a lighter clean grain bill.
Cambridge Red God IPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Cambridge Brewing Company;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of foamy fine to medium sized tan colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a typically carbonated opaque except at the edges dark red brown colored body and a spiderweb lacing. The mild aroma was malty. The sharp mild citrus vinous crisp mouth feel was strongly tingly at the start and mediumly tingly at the finish with a strong hoppy aftertaste. The sharp flavor contained notes of bitter mild citrus vinous crisp hops and malt. Delicious and one I would certainly like to have again.
Cambridge Red God IPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Cambridge Brewing Company;Amber coloured and hazy. Has an off-white head, lasting. Hoppy aroma, fruity, citrus. Flavor starts sweet, toasted, finish bitter.

Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;Poured into a mug, the appearance was a mild dark brown color with a finger’s worth of sly rocky white head. Mess lace. The aroma had a big nutty presence and then a roasty malt with a sly sweet caramel backbone. The flavor leaned sweet and grabbed the malts to run into the aftertaste and then the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. Good ample ABV. Overall, nicely done brown ale that I would have again.
Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;Draught at the Brewpub in Farmington. This is nothing special. Good to stop by if you are in town though.
Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;Brown pour with a small to medium off white to tan head . Great nut brown taste without the bitterness of some .
Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;A copper amber ale with a thin light mocha head. In aroma, nutty roasted malt with light fruity esters. In mouth, a nice roasted malt with light coffee, nutty herbal hops, not bad. On tap at BIA, July 30, 2012.
Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;Strong nutty aroma. Amber color with a medium tan head. Light roasted malt beginning with a sweet flavor in the finish. Another great brown.
Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;In short: A typical creamy and nutty brown ale. Good example of an unexciting style How: Bottle 22oz, improvised HF 1rst anniversary camping tasting The look: Clear bronze body topped by a small beige head In long: Nose is mostly toasted and nutty like I would expect from a good brown ale. Taste is creamy, hazelnuts, a bit of peanut butter, chewy soft bread crust, caramel. Basically this is a standard archetypical brown ale. Not to say it is great (it is a basic brown ale after all, not an exiting style) but there is nothing wrong with this beer and deserves a bit better than its current lousy 3.2 average, and no one dares question my opinions, I said NO ONE, your hear me? NO ONE!!!
Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;22nd May 2010. ChrisOs ’Blue Ridge Mountains Of Virginia’ tasting! Slightly hazy dark amber beer. Light dry palate. Sweet toffee malt some of which is diacetyl. Pretty poor.

Clear medium to dark amber color with a average to large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, fully lasting, off-white to beige head. Aroma is moderate malty, caramel, sweet malt, toffee, butter, sweet coffee notes. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and moderate bitter with a average to long duration, toffee, buttery. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20100522]
Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;bottle at Chris-O ... brown ... butterscotch sweeties ... soft toffee malts ... dull ... little chocolate in linger
Oak Pond Nut Brown Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Pond Brewery;22oz bottle. Beer is perfectly clear and a beautiful deep golden brown. Carbonation is fairly low, just a tickle. Aroma is fruity/toasted grainy, perhaps slightly brackish. There’s a warm toasty flavor, somewhat earthy, that goes great with fried onions/potatoes. I really like this beer, especially with food. Yay beer!
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;Dark copper with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Aroma of orange hard candy. Thin body with nondescript sweet overtones leading to a firm bitterness. Hops are present and accounted for, but dull. Slightly mossy and spicy. Not particularly interesting or good, but also unoffensive in any way. I’m not sure why the reviews are so harsh, even though I wouldn’t buy it again.
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;Draught @ brewpub in Farmington. This is not worth trying. Its a bland macro style pale.
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;I had no clue that this was designed as an Ipa until I was done my tasting , i would have guessed it was a wheat beer, very low gravity. Weak!
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;A golden IPA with a thin off white head. In aroma, a light biscuit malt with grassy floral hops, OK. In mouth, a crisp biscuit malt with bitter British hops, light grapefruits, mineral. On tap at BIA, July 30, 2012.
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;Had this on tap at Boon Island Ales in Wells, Clear, with no head, very citrus aroma mostly lemon, the citrus comes through in the flavor as well and slightly spicy. An unremarkable beer.
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;Light resin hop aroma with mild malts mixed in. Clear orange color with a small white head. Light floral hop throughout, fading slightly in the finish. Solid English style.
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;Much like most of the beer I had from this brewery, this one was weak, underwhelming and unremarkable. I wouldn’t avoid it but I feel like there are almost always better choices.
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;High floral aroma with a spicy finish. Pours a perfect pale amber. Not a true IPA, but a lighter version with a wonderful array of hops. Just a terrific fresh brew available in both 22oz bottle and half-gallon growler.
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;22oz bought from brewery. Pours hazy straw, absolutely fullll of bubbles, head keeps growing. Aroma is slightly spicy, a little grassy &#40or like trub&#41, a hint of lemon. Body is rather thin and flavor isn’t completely pleasant. It’s nice and spicy with lots of hop flavor but the aftertaste is a little like watered down trub. I enjoyed this beer when I tasted it on tap at the brewery but something was lost by putting it in a bottle. It unfortunately did not live up to my expectations of good Maine beer. I hope to try it some other time, maybe it was just a bad bottle.
Oak Pond White Fox Ale;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oak Pond Brewery;My Bottom Line: Peppery and citrusy hops politely spice up the delicate toasted caramel malts until earthy, leafy hop bitterness concludes this levelled Pale Ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam covers the glowing coppery amber. -This is far from an IPA as stated on the label, even an English one for that matter, but it is a very drinkable Pale Ale nonetheless. -The mouthfeel is silky and the effervescence soft. -The recipe itself is nothing special, but it is flawlessly executed and all flavors are amazingly balanced. Bottle.
Belzebuth Extra Forte 13%;Douai, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Grain d'Orge (Brasseurs De Gayant);uiterlijk: Donkergeel/ Oranje bier met een beetje wit schuim. Geur: Alcoholisch, kandij, fruitig. Smaak: Bosvruchtensiroop, Alcohol en peperachtig. Mond: Sterk, plakkerig en zoet met een klein ijzersmaakje. Ik kan mij herinneren dat dit bier een alcoholpercentage had van 15%, maar de 13% van nu voldoet ook om lekker suf te worden. Drinkt wel makkelijk weg.
Belzebuth Extra Forte 13%;Douai, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Grain d'Orge (Brasseurs De Gayant);These stronger ales have a wine-like feel to me, and I am not that into wine...but this had a decent flavor resembling a good Belgian blonde ale. It's hard to mask 13%, although I found this quite drinkable (if you sip it of course). Good thing is it's only 8.4 oz. so not killing yourself trying to finish 12-22 oz. Aroma is strong and fruity, sweet and sour at the same time. Appearance is a clearer malty medium yellow, with some white sediment specs in there which I am guessing is yeast. I actually enjoyed the flavor on this one, and would consider sampling again if ever in France.

Great Lakes Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);I've enjoyed Great Lakes beers for years . Always the finest quality until December 2019 . I bought a 6 pack of GLCA expecting a real treat . I was unpleasantly surprised . The beer tasted like vinegar . Very sour . I contacted GL and they don't care . They were unwilling to offer and restitution or even an explanation of what the problem might have been . A company with NO CUSTOMER SERVICE does not deserve my money .
Great Lakes Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Tasted like a mouthful of potpourri.... dumped it out and opened a copper lager.
Great Lakes Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Sort of a caramel malt background, some hop bitterness at the end. Maybe a hint of spice, but if it's there at all, not particularly discernible. This is a pretty straightforward amber, not very Christmasy.
Great Lakes Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Honey gold. Bitter and slightly medicinal, with notes of honey, ginger, and cinnamon. Thick palate.

Tucher Kristall Weizen;Fürth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Tucher Bräu Fürth (Radeberger Gruppe);500 ml bottle. (Fränky Getränkemarkt) Nuremberg, Germany. Enjoyed on Oct 19, 2019. Clear golden color with a big foamy white head. Sweetness, banana, wheat, yeast, toffee and some mild sourness in the aroma. Proper Weißbier aroma. The flavor is wheat, fruitiness, banana, mild yeast and a hint of sourness. Quite nice actually... although I don’t usually like my Weißbiers filtered.
Tucher Kristall Weizen;Fürth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Tucher Bräu Fürth (Radeberger Gruppe);very nice light weissebier, full flavoured with a good body and nothing off about it. tastes quite similar to a regular hefe. dresden eislowen bottle
Tucher Kristall Weizen;Fürth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Tucher Bräu Fürth (Radeberger Gruppe);Nothing special about the looks or smell, but there is some flavor here. Wheat, banana, mild hop finish. Almost like a saison. Smooth and crisp feel. Wheat beers are hit or miss for me, but this was very enjoyable and would visit again.
Tucher Kristall Weizen;Fürth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Tucher Bräu Fürth (Radeberger Gruppe);01-03-19 // bottle from Getränke Hoffmann Berlin. Clear, crystal-cear golden.

Tucher Kristall Weizen;Fürth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Tucher Bräu Fürth (Radeberger Gruppe);500ml bottle, courtesy of Beer King, drunk at home on a snowy December evening. Pours crystal clear with a thick fluffy head, very heavy lacing and persistent rising carbonation. Gold in colour. Aroma of clove and banana with slight cereal undertones. In the mouth, high carbonation, flavours similar to the aromas, some sweetness, light texture but not watery, no alcohol presence, mild bitterness with no astringency before a short, crisp finish. Overall, better than average for the style and proof that filtering a Weizen doesn't have to ruin it.
Tucher Kristall Weizen;Fürth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Tucher Bräu Fürth (Radeberger Gruppe);Der Hype der Kristallweizen ist um Jahre 2018 bereits abgeflaut, aber dieses Bier gab es 2017 noch. Es ist ein standardmäßiges Kristallweizen, dass sich angenehm trinken lässt.

Obolon Lager;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Obolon;A can from Simplemart down the road. Appearance and aroma very predictable, taste a familiar mix of vaguely vanilla and cardboard. A reassuring bite of bitterness at the finish, albeit fleeting. Drink it cold.
Obolon Lager;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Obolon;Can from Simple Mart on Wuxing. Not as tasty as the Premium. More watered down. Golden colour with a none existent head. Nose is grain and skunked hop. Taste is light grain with a skunky sort of yeasty finish. Not great,, standard Euro affair. Still better than Carlsberg tho, hehe.
Obolon Lager;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Obolon;Found from bottle from euromarket cafe in Asheville, NC. Pours a clear golden. Really decent honey aftertaste and one of better I've had for the style. Would drink again especially in the summer months.

Obolon Lager;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Obolon;Bottle. Typical for eastern European lager: crisp, dry, very clean, but not as flavorful as Lvivske, another Ukrainian beer, or even Pilsner Urquell from the neighboring Czech Republic. Overall flavor is more similar to Heineken.

Castle Lager;Sandton, South Africa;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);Stable yet small head, clean smell (nothing to write home about) and clear with a beautiful gold Lager colour. Taste was disappointing. Very slight malt flavour with grassy undertones that become unpleasant as the beer warms up. In the beers defence, it has a very nice Lager pallet.
Castle Lager;Sandton, South Africa;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);Mein erstes Bier aus Südafrika. Angeblich gibt es dort ja eine lebendige Bierkultur, aber ich habe nur dieses eine Bier zum Bestellen gefunden. Ich finde den Aufwand nicht wirklich wert, da es recht fade ist.

Bear Brew Midnight Stout;Orono, Maine, United States;Stout;Bear Brew Pub;I really like stouts, but this one doesn’t cut it for me. No head, not chewy, and sort of translucent. There are fruity hints in it too, which boggled me as to why they’re there. This doesn’t quite pull off the stout thing. This is one that i’ll probably not have again.
Bear Brew Midnight Stout;Orono, Maine, United States;Stout;Bear Brew Pub;Not abad stout. Good color! A more mild taste than I like for a stout. Above average but not much.
Bear Brew Midnight Stout;Orono, Maine, United States;Stout;Bear Brew Pub;Im not a fan of stouts, but i actually like this one very much. As has been noted this beer is not a real stout but has the color of one. overall a really good beer. to bad its only on tap
Bear Brew Midnight Stout;Orono, Maine, United States;Stout;Bear Brew Pub;I like this beer. Yes, it isn't as stouty as it should be, but it is good nonetheless. I think that it has a fairly fruity flavor. I think it should be called midnight draft though, because it tastes like a fruitier version of guinness.. it has that same smooth flavor. it is definitely not a stout though.
Bear Brew Midnight Stout;Orono, Maine, United States;Stout;Bear Brew Pub;A stout with a lasting palate and lasting impressions. This stout lacks chewiness, one component I like in stouts, but nevertheless, a great beer to try if you are ever in Orono, Maine.
Bear Brew Midnight Stout;Orono, Maine, United States;Stout;Bear Brew Pub;Available only on tap, this is a very good beer, but I feel a somewhat lackluster attempt at a stout. Its not creamy enough, and its way too hoppy. I like hops, but not so much in a stout. Excellent flavor, but its not stout.
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I think its worse then the original... but it does have more alcohol in it which is a plus. More alcohol = get drunk faster = drink less of this crappy artificial lime flavored corona but worse beer.
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Easy to drink, not the best but its different. Good for a thurst buster during a hot summer day.
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"The ""extra"" in Tequiza Extra stands for ""extra crappy"". It tastes as if they turned up the crap knob on the regular Tequiza to 11, then soaked their nutsacks in the brew before bottling. There’s a reason you can’t find this around...IT SUCKS ASS."
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Interesting that is appears what they managed to do is to take a really bad tasting beer (regular Tequiza) and make it stronger. Making something that tastes bad stronger only makes it worse. This is awful.
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);No date on this rating, had to be 3 years ago. I admit I like tequiza regular on a nice summer day, so easy to drink. This one just wasnt for me. The flavors mesh pretty well with the artificial sweetness in the original, this one they are not balanced. Guess thats why this one faded...
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Ok his stuff is great it is so easy to drink i know it i not very complex thick or ull of flavor or evn a beer by most standards but it is fun
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Its Just as good as regular tequiza.... it still has the tequila in it. I love the tequila in it..... At the pines the bar tender knows I want this. (tap.)
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I'm sitting here thinking what did they actually give me that is extra from the original.Hmmm,nothing.The color is straw with a sweet aroma of mild malt and something that i just can't describe.The flavor was just as bad as the regular with maybe a little bit more flavor but not much.It's just not good and i can see how this might be popular in a yuppie bar or a just turned 21 place but it has no real place in the beer world for folks that actually have a pallate for brew.Blah,Try it once but i recommend not going beyond that.
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);so was the thinking that tequiza is soo good in the first place. we need to make some more money. so let''s make a different kind. bad..bad..bad..
Tequiza Extra;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Twice as strong, twice as bad or more. Who devises this crap?..............
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;"""Had a mini Indian beer taste-off between Blue Himalayan and Taj Mahal. Not expecting greatness from either commercially produced lager, but here I go anyway. Look-same light straw color while pouring. TM is typical macro lager. Can’t even say that for BH...slightly hazy...slightly. Even pouring down the middle produces little or no head. Aroma-both typical macro lager aroma, with a slight extra unpleasantness to the BH. Feel-BH is flat, and as the aroma and taste are not good either, the mouthfeel is horrible too. TM isn’t good, but has better carbonation and isn’t as repulsive. flavor-BH rivals the worst of the American macros...no way in hell i’m finishing this. TM is closer to average but still don’t want to finish. overall, Blue Himalayan is foul pee water, while Taj Mahal is somewhere between horrible and respectable, although a little closer to the former. No more Indian beer for me. I’ll be dumping 18 of the 22 oz of BH, and probably won’t quite finish the TM either."""
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;Bottle from bevmo. Pale clear piss yellow, small white head. Cheap grain, sweetness, and musty. Drinkable I geuss, but I wouldn’t want to try it again.
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;Pale yellow. Flavor and aromas are all malt. Refreshing but not all so great.
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;650 ml, 05, pale yellow color, slight foamy head, nose is faint sweetness, flavor is mild fruit hops with a good finish, easy drinker
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;Aroma: I couldn’t get anything from this beer in terms of aroma at first, so I let it warm a bit. Still nothing. A very light lemon scent, and a demi-sec champagne or riesling character. Weak. Appearance: Boring, crystal clear yellow-orange. White, fleeting head. Lame. Flavor: Better than the smell, but still needs help. Definitely white wine-esque, well-balanced sweetness but terribly bland. There is a bit of dryness, but this beer is not hoppy in the least. At least it wasn’t skunky. Better than most macros, I’d say. Palate: Light, smooth, and inoffensive. Overall: Meh. I ordered this at an Indian restaurant, and I was really hoping for something bolder and more hoppy to match the food. Surprisingly, the beer held its own against my meal, and the spicy chicken I ordered helped bring out its citric sweetness. Still, there are better choices for spicy food, especially for how expensive this was.
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;Lots of funk, buttery, not the same beer as I remembered. Quite untasty. Perhaps this one was old, but it definitely wasn’t good First rating 3.3 A light malty blue. This is pretty nice. LIght with a light maltiness up front and a tiny hop bite in the finish.
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;Clear yellow, moderate head that dissipates fairly quickly. Aroma is grain, bread, not much else. Light bodied, sweet bread flavor. Moderate to high carbonation. Not much else to say.
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;This is a fairly mild lager with a very nice balance of mild spicy hops and malt. It is very drinkable, goes down easily with very little aftertaste. I really like it, but the masochistic dark ale crowd (NBS) won’t because it doesn’t corrode mucus membranes.
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;650 mL brown bottle. The aroma is unusual. Musty, floral hop? Peppery hop? Standard gold color with a white head that filmed quickly. Thin to medium in body with mild, approaching creamy, carbonation. The flavor is outstanding. The mouth tingles with pepper or spice. Not hot, but a non-bitter hop, I’m surmising. It’s got enough floral to satisfy a light ale drinker. Spicy, peppery hop can be found in English lagers, so mayhap this represents a lingering tradition from colonial days. Sikkim has only been part of India since about 1975. Whatever, it’s not the typical lager drain pour. Hoisting this one to the Empire.
Himalayan Blue Premium Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuksom Breweries;650 ml bottle from Taste of India. Clear pale yellow with a fizzy white head, malty aroma and taste, and a clean crisp finish.

Carnegie Stark Porter;Falkenberg, Sweden;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Sverige;500ml bottle, drunk in 2016, but purchased from Beers of Europe close to a decade earlier. Aroma of dark chocolate, dates, figs, prunes, light coffee and caramel. Dark malt, toffee, fruit cake and maltloaf flavours. Good body.
Carnegie Stark Porter;Falkenberg, Sweden;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Sverige;Bottle at Fortnight Wine Bar in Providence RI. Dark dark brown-black, glints of deep amber, light-brown fine head that fades to a thin film slowly - looks nice. Aroma is chocolate, bread crust, some cherry, bit of caramel, more bread. Delicious balance of dark and caramelized malt! bit of grassy hops to balance. Body is medium-light weight, syrupy, medium-coarse bubbles with light burn. Flavor is very clean bread crust, some cane sugar, bit of herbs and grass, touch of caramel, cherry and apple. Yummy, but not as intense as the aroma.
Carnegie Stark Porter;Falkenberg, Sweden;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Sverige;Aromas of chocolate and mild coffee. Roasted flavors on the mild side. Rather light bodied for a porter. A slight tartness, giving an interesting sweet-tart character. Good but a bit too light bodied and light flavored for my tastes.
Carnegie Stark Porter;Falkenberg, Sweden;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Sverige;Bottle from Systembolaget to. It's a trap! I wasn't warned this is Carlsberg. Pours almost black with beige head. Aroma has sweet roasted malts. Metallic flavors on a tongue, sweet, apple? Bit fizzy. Unimpressed.

Tonight we’re gonna party like it’s 1999. Bottle 03934. Pours a clear amber color with a tiny off-white ring for a head. The aroma has a weird tang atop caramel and brown sugar and leaves. Flavor of dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, and toast, with only the faintest bit of that tanginess from the nose. Light-bodied, with low carbonation and a malty, barely tangy mouthfeel. This was an interesting one to try for sure.
Pyramid 5,000 Year Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Taste from a bottle at phaleslu’s Weird Beers Tasting. Hazy light brown color. Mostly clear, some dark particles in there. Almost no head, minimal off-white ring and some bubbles. Loose dots of lace. Big dark fruit, vinous and oxidization in the aroma. Smells foreboding. Moderate sweet taste, light bitter. Big mustiness. Medium body. Very light carbonation. Drying finish. Tasting pretty oxidized, musty, and old.

Pyramid 5,000 Year Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);(12oz bottle from Chickencoop). Pours dark brown with no carbonation or head. Aroma has raisin, port, some caramel and a little must. Taste is semi-sweet with vanilla and port. Medium bodied with a dry, vinous quality. This very much reminds me of a wine-like beer with the age on it.
Pyramid 5,000 Year Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Another Rare treat from JohnGalt1 12oz Bottle pulled from a box. Pours out a dark brown with some red highlights topped with almost no head. Aroma was of pit fruit, brown sugar, oxidation, some wood, molasses, and rich malt. Taste was much as the aroma lots of sweetness, sad to say it has already peaked. But I was still very happy to try this.
Pyramid 5,000 Year Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Courtesy daknole. Pours clear amber with copper edges and really no head to speak of. The aroma is an odd mix of oxidation, soured moldy grapefruit covered with cigar ash and hints of the rich fruity esters way off in the background. The taste has molasses mixing with prunes and sugar stewed cherries. It then rolls into brown sugar toward the finish. There’s a moderate funky tart off-ness to it too.

A posh alcopop.

Whitbread Pale Ale (USA);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boston Beer Company;This beer was just OK for me. Brought it over my parents house few months ago for dinner. It had some decent flavor, just the mouthfeel felt a little funny to me....I was thinking it was part of English Pale Ale style and all, which may not be my preference for ales. I enjoyed trying it, but for the price I was a little disappointed that I didn't try something else. Wound up leaving the last few for my dad, as he liked it, and usually seems picky about some of the crafts I let him try.
Whitbread Pale Ale (USA);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boston Beer Company;"From Oct 2005 My first sample of the Cincinnati contract brewed product. I poured it into my glass and thought the appearance was quite nice with a good head of foam. Aroma wise, a strong malt presence was immediately apparent so I knew this was brewed to the style and that's a plus in my book. ;^) The taste was quite sweet with a bit of caramel overtones and the hop presence was in the background but in enough presence to give the brew a decent balance. I *could* taste a bit of the alcohol and that prevented me from giving it a higher score. Over all, I find it to be a drinkable English Pale Ale and if it were available locally, I'd buy it from time to time."
Whitbread Pale Ale (USA);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boston Beer Company;From old tasting notes. Brewed by Whitbread and Co., PLC in London, England. Clear, pale copper color with a foamy light tan head. Slightly sweet caramel-apple aroma. The foretaste is effervescent and tastes of slightly toasted bitter malt. Midtaste is dry and hoppy as is the finish. Week hopped, though not overpowering. Very good.

Whitbread Pale Ale (USA);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boston Beer Company;Bottle. Brown, medium off-white head. Aroma malts, some caramel. Taste evolves from malty to mildly hoppy. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Whitbread Pale Ale (USA);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boston Beer Company;Rated from old notes. Disappointed to hear this one was retired as it was an old standby for me back in the late 90s. Poured dark copper with a creamy head. Taste was caramel malt, nuts, and a light touch of honey. Good stuff.
Whitbread Pale Ale (USA);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boston Beer Company;Old rating. Bottle from Old Town. Pours an amber color with a modest off-white head.

Whitbread Pale Ale (USA);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boston Beer Company;"I have no idea how old this bottle is, but when in Rome...12 oz bottle into a wine glass. A: Pours a dark ruby color that’s in no way pale. About one finger of off-white colored head is formed, only to fade away quickly due to poor retention. No real lace. S: Wow, this is VERY sweet. Tons of dark fruits inhabit the aroma, with only a hint of oxidation to break up the monotony. Honestly, it’s a pleasant nose, just not that complex. If the bottle didn’t say ""pale ale"", I’d wonder if it were an old ale instead (it’s certainly old in more ways than one...) T: It tastes dangerously similar to prune juice - cripes, this is sweet. There is some mild oxidation, but nothing too horrible. The finish is a combination of chocolate and mineral water. Some decent qualities exist, but the whole package just seems...off. M: Despite the sweetness, the dry finish is honestly kind of unpleasant, which says nothing about how unfitting the sweet and dry get along on the palate. Carbonation is almost nonexistent. O: A truly great beer can stand the test of time (unless they’re hoppy, natch), and this hasn’t. If you still see this at your Neighborhood Liquor Store™ and you’re considering picking this up, don’t do it! Get something else instead."
Whitbread Pale Ale (USA);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boston Beer Company;This one of my first go-to beers years back. Malty caramel flavor. Little hop presence. Not had the British version yet.

Red Bell American Pale Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Beautiful copper color and modest lace that held all the way down the glass. Moderately hoppy, a refreshing alternative to some of the super-hopped American PA's out there. An unfortunate note, however, as this beer had a ton of diacetyl off-flavor. The aroma was pure butterscotch, which was interesting at first but became bothersome. Butteriness was also apparent in the flavor, though balanced by the firm hop presence. I don't know if it was intentional, but IMO it really detracts from the beer.

St. Ides Special Brew - Mixed Fruit;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;710ml clear twist-off bottle. Purchased around 47th and California. From the freezer. It is a fruit punch looking reddish/purple color, not crystal clear.The aroma is fruit punch with a hint of booze Don’t know if this is watered down st. ides or something else as the base. The flavor is essentially fruit punch with a mild booze pucker and some candy-like flavor in the aftertaste. Not being a soda drinker I find this stuff repulsive but a bit better than the steel reserve ones.

St. Ides Special Brew - Mixed Fruit;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of the Dr. Owl. Pours a hazy neon purple with minimal white head. Dissipates to nothing. Nose is like a bowl of mixed fruit. Watermelon mostly. Jolly rancher. I think I can small the sugar. Taste is the same but initially had a slight hotness from alcohol. That faded after a few sips. Overall this is the stuff that would get the job done for anyone without diabetes. ---Rated via intercellular device
St. Ides Special Brew - Mixed Fruit;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;8/17/13. 22oz bottle from Warehouse. Why do I do this to myself? Tickers gon’ tick... on a budget. Hilarious purplish pour with a small, loose, soapy pink head that fades in an instant. If you aren’t paying attention and turn your head, you’ll probably miss it. Tart, fruity aroma, only lightly sweet - actually a really good mix of fruitiness and tartness - reminds me of a hurricane or a nice tropical cocktail - I’m seriously really digging the aroma. A big plus is that it seems devoid of rocket fuel and garbage like other malt liquors, including other fruited St. Ides. In fact, based on look and aroma, I’d almost guess this was a Florida Weisse on par with JW’s stuff... this is not a joke due to recent events. The flavor sadly does not deliver... subdued tartness that was greatly exaggerated in the aroma with big sweet, fake fruitiness, corn, rocket fuel, apples, and dough. Blech. Rockin’ aroma, though.
St. Ides Special Brew - Mixed Fruit;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Hell yeah! 1 year and 3 months since this bad boy was last rated. Pours a cloudy beet purple with no head. Aroma of hawaiian punch and booze. Taste is very sweet. Same as aroma with cotton candy added. Its like a drunken carnival in my mouth. Medium bodied with a sticky texture. Fizzy carbonation and entirely too long of a finish. Overall, meh. Reminds me of four loko
St. Ides Special Brew - Mixed Fruit;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Bottle marked Oct1011-A071-2211. It pours maroon to purple with a beery head at least. The aroma is ridiculously fruity. It smells more like Hawaiian Punch then a beer. Watery body. The taste is nothing but Hi-C, Kool Aid, or Hawaiian Punch with a bitter coating. It might appeal to someone but not to me.

St. Ides Special Brew - Passion;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;This is an orange and cloudy brew w/ a big fruity noes... is what I would say if this were an actual adult beverage and not alcoholic Kool Aid. It seems somewhat less horribly sweet than some of the other beverages in this lineup w/ some interesting foxy grape and floral tones around the edges. Like most passion fruit flavored beverages, it doesn’t really taste like passion fruit just sort of non-specifically tropical.

St. Ides Special Brew - Passion;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;(bottle - 22 oz) Cloudy orange color with almost no head and very light carbonation. Aroma is a mix of orange juice and passion fruit flavors. Overly sweet passion fruit and fake citrus flavors in the taste. Not much else. Similar to the others from these guys with all the fake, sugary fruit juice concentrate flavors.

St. Ides Special Brew - Passion;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;weird hazy orange drink color, reminiscent of a really good hefe. No head. Smells fruity in an acrid sort of way. Fragrances of melon, apricots and passion. Taste is sweet with no sign of bitter ale bite, has some malt liquor alky flavor in the background, but just barely. Could be a little more bubble on the palate. Finish very odd, yes its fruity but I also get this unique lingering feeling like I just ate a bowl of sugar sweetened Cheerios. A little rude on the tummy, once inside.

Sinebrychoff Nikolai III;Kerava, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);50cl can. Simple pale lager - the colder you serve it, the better it gets. It is all about carbonation with this one. Not the best one from Sinebrychoff.

Sinebrychoff Nikolai III;Kerava, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);50 cl alu-can, K-Kilpisjärvi FI. Pours a foamy head, that vanishes on the golden body - deeper colour than usual pale lagers have. Foam leaves a few patterns inside the dimpled mug. Scents of hops, grass, peaches, raspberry bush. Taste of malt, painted candy, citric acid. Grains dominate mouthfeel, and it’s smooth and unusual. Aftertaste bread, syrup, corrugated papers, caramel, lemon juice. Overall unusual with it’s citric syrupy impression, and reminds me somewhat of waiting in a pharmacy, waiting for something nice.

Olvi Strong;Iisalmi, Finland;Malt Liquor;Olvi;Bottled (BB 01/2005) Dark honey color, small white head. Nose has sweet fruits and corn. Sweet, harsh flavor with alcoholic kick. This is a real malt liquor. Even Olvi Tuplapukki with 8,5% ABV is better balanced.

Harsh, sweetish-malty, alcoholic flavor. Light to medium-bodied, oily and stingingly alcoholic palate. A typical malt liquour with a pale lager body and a liquour flavor.

Olvi Strong;Iisalmi, Finland;Malt Liquor;Olvi;"(Can). I only sampled the contents of half the can (without much carbonation) as the other half leaked out in my suitcase during the flight from Helsinki(!) But even a normal carbonation couldn't possibly have hidden the fact that this is just another golden ""get drunk fast"" strong lager, quite uninteresting in any aspect. I give it a few points for not being blatantly offensive."
Olvi Strong;Iisalmi, Finland;Malt Liquor;Olvi;Golden coloured. Syrupy sweet, no flavours apart from the alcocohl. Very poorly made strong lager.
Olvi Strong;Iisalmi, Finland;Malt Liquor;Olvi;Sweetish aroma. Not much taste, the alchol in this beer drowns almost everything else, you can detect only faint malt and hops. But it will get you wasted pretty fast.
Melbourn Brothers Apricot;Stamford, Lincolnshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Melbourn Brothers All Saints (Samuel Smith);Bottle. Amber Gold. Very apricot fruity, slightly tart, refreshing, effervescent beer. OK, but preferred the Strawberry and the Cherry. (2008)
Melbourn Brothers Apricot;Stamford, Lincolnshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Melbourn Brothers All Saints (Samuel Smith);There is almost no foam by pouring this beer. On the other hand, there are plenty of pleasant fragrance. Apricot and flower welling up from the glass and get my expectations to rise significantly. The taste is of course dominated by apricot and the carbon dioxide is lightly sparkling. It is slightly sour and leave a good fresh taste. Suitable as a welcome drink, aperitif or as a cool summer drink.
Melbourn Brothers Apricot;Stamford, Lincolnshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Melbourn Brothers All Saints (Samuel Smith);Light amber. Taste apricots followed by slight bitter note. Light bodied and juicy.
Melbourn Brothers Apricot;Stamford, Lincolnshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Melbourn Brothers All Saints (Samuel Smith);Aroma is tart fruit/apricot and a sharp and undesirable element. The flavor is apricot, an undercurrent of fruit and a long and sour finish.
Melbourn Brothers Apricot;Stamford, Lincolnshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Melbourn Brothers All Saints (Samuel Smith);Golden color with small white head. Weird fruity aroma. Sweet apricot taste. Very funny beer to taste, but not my a beer for my taste.
Melbourn Brothers Apricot;Stamford, Lincolnshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Melbourn Brothers All Saints (Samuel Smith);powerfully fruity and would be much better enjoyed during the hot summer!

Tastes just like it smells. Apricots, peaches and fruity pebbles. Light bodied with a thin texture. Very lively carbonation and a long sour finish. Overall, not bad for what it is.

Melbourn Brothers Apricot;Stamford, Lincolnshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Melbourn Brothers All Saints (Samuel Smith);Künstlicher Fruchtantrunk, wenig sauer, nach Marmelade. Die Säuerlichkeit wirkt fast schon unpassend neben der aufkommenden Süße, weiter künstlich. Die Süße, die das Marmeladenaroma ausmacht, wirkt penetrant, das Bier unausgeglichen. Zum Ende herb marmeladig. Nicht gut und schon gar kein Lambic! 7/5/6/5/9/5

Bear Brew Honey Bear Brown;Orono, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Bear Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a murky brown color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white head. Disipated immediately. Lacing, what lacing? Not much there at all. The smell had some dry honey/nut/pecan sweetness all around. The taste was pretty much the same, Light sweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation runs light. Overall, good for what it is. Unsure if I’d seek again.
Bear Brew Honey Bear Brown;Orono, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Bear Brew Pub;"Draught sample at the brewpub, mid-May 2007. Somewhat murky medium brown with just a hint of foam lasting....pleasant, reasonably well-balanced aromatic profile, nuts and fruits (almonds, pecans, cherries) amiable sharing the sweetness....alas this does not carry over to the body, which is horribly vegetal and sour, loads of DMS or some equally bad infection, cardboardy and very dry at the finish with minimal carbonation....a trainwreck, ultimately; strange that the nose wasn’t off."
Bear Brew Honey Bear Brown;Orono, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Bear Brew Pub;Draught 12oz glass at the brewpub on 12/28/05. Pours an auburn-mahogany brown, with some tan/beige highlights and a small, but fairly well-retained beige head that dissipates eventually to a ring, with little to no lacing. Quite clear. Aroma of light walnuts, brown sugar, touches of treacle and light crystal malts and a light attempt at some soily/nutty hops. Flavor shows a bit of vanilla cream and caramel, light raisins, touch of mildly tart plum/prunes and then a dry toasted malt finish, with just the most faint hint of floral hops. Very bland/nutty/drying on the end, with low malt sweetness. Moderately carbonated, with an unremarkable texture, slightly papery.
Bear Brew Honey Bear Brown;Orono, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Bear Brew Pub;Tap, Bear Brew, well the color was Very Brown, looked like it could be almost black but it had all the normal brown traits, with some extra hop to it.
Bear Brew Honey Bear Brown;Orono, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Bear Brew Pub;Seemed much like a typical brown, which is good, but makes this beer not very memorable in my mind. I’ll drink it again, but it’s not one of my favorites.
Bear Brew Honey Bear Brown;Orono, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Bear Brew Pub;A pretty honest brown ale, on par for the American version of the style. Moderate hop-aroma, medium-bodied with excellent lacing, with a flavor that sees the scales tipped very slightly to the hops side. Mildly dry aftertaste which quickly dissapates.

Obolon 2000;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Obolon;In a little sour flavor of rotten fruit, honey tone, woody, strongly felt dried tomatoes and peppers, which can also be considered part of the wine. The taste is quite attractive woody, in harmony with her berry acidity and sugary malty sweetness, but then rolls with a strong bitterness frankly alcoholic tones. The aftertaste is hard, unpleasant bulges alcohol content, but fortunately calm down quickly, leaving the woody bitterness with sourness reach.
Obolon 2000;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Obolon;BOTTLE 50 CL. Clear golden-amber, small white head. The aroma is strong malty, with a touch of soap, plastic and fusel.

Drinkable.

Obolon Firmove;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Obolon;Naah, it can't be heavily fermented, meaning presumably a long process, and then demonstrate a classic taste, unless it is classicly heavily fermented and therefore thin, bland and characterless. Don't see how malt can provide bitterness as per the CD.
Obolon Originalne;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Obolon;This was not a common variety available on the stret. I think it makes sense at is was not memorable. Can't agree with the wine reference but for the label that looked a bit like a merlot or cabernet colour with the regal crest.

La Trappe Quadrupel;Berkel-Enschot, Netherlands;Quadrupel / Abt;La Trappe Trappist - Abdij O.L.V. Koningshoeven (Bavaria);4 finger light beige head. Fantastic lacing. Hazy, deep amber coloured beer. Aroma of banana mallow, sweet almonds, hints of christmas spices, bit of yeast and hints of white bread. Taste of the same but focuses almost entirely on overripe banana with a bit of yeast on the side. Mouthfeel is full, foamy and round. Very drinkable but holds everything in place aswell. Lightly dry. Medium bitterness. Medium-low carbonation. A bit sticky. Too sweet honestly. Alcohol shines through to some degree but not as much as a 10% ABV beer usually does. Overall: Definitely too 'light' flavoured Quad for me. I love Dubbel and Quad when they're less like a Tripel (aka less light coloured Belgo) and more of a dried fruit & slightly roasty type deal. Pleasant and I enjoy it, no doubt, but I expected something else.

La Trappe Quadrupel;Berkel-Enschot, Netherlands;Quadrupel / Abt;La Trappe Trappist - Abdij O.L.V. Koningshoeven (Bavaria);This beer is a very mediocre Quad due to the lack of flavour.

The smell is very sweet malt nose..smells buttery. The taste up front is big on the caramel sweetness followed by some hop bitterness midway through and through the finish. Not bad at all and actually, the more I sip, the better I like it. Try it and see what you think. Bottom line: A pretty malty sample of the style and if you like malty lagers, this one will surely please you.
Christoffel Robertus;Breda, Netherlands;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sint Christoffel Bier;From old tasting notes. Cloudy Orange copper color. Huge rocky beige head. Sweet toasted malt nose.

Christoffel Robertus;Breda, Netherlands;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sint Christoffel Bier;One of the very few Viennese lagers in the Low Countries, unfortunately no longer made nowadays. From old and very concise notes: frothy, off-white head on an attractively deep copper robe, malty, nutty, mildly (dried) fruity, soft floral hoppiness in the finish. Kind of a free interpretation of its style, which made it all the more interesting.

Fizzy carbonation. Long dry finish. Some character to it, some bite. Not giving me any saintly euphoria but would happily drink again.
Christoffel Bier;Breda, Netherlands;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Sint Christoffel Bier;Tap@Cafe Langebro, Copenhagen (08/07/2017) - pours gold with a white head. Citrus fruity notes of lemon and satsuma, malty and yeasty, nice subtle spicy hop bite, hoppy moderate bitter close. Very tasty.

Bittersweet malt flavor with notes of lemon peel. Intense bitter finish and aftertaste. From start to finish, there is a dramatic contrast in the texture of flavors. All in all, the citrus overtones are dominant. Notes of lemon, orange and grapefruit. Very good.
Sterkens White Ale;Meer, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Sterkens;One of the best White Ales that I've sampled. Even better, it's from Belgium. How can you go wrong? Smooth, crips, refreshing. Flavor is there too. Has that Belgian feel and taste, without the heaviness of the stronger ales. Cloudy medium yellow appearance. Flavor is a good balance of wheat, hops, and some fruitiness like banana with light spice. Above average carbonation gives it an airy/frothy head....be careful when pouring. Summer is pretty much here in Florida, so give this one a try.
Sterkens White Ale;Meer, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Sterkens;"Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #97. Draught pint at Bar Cento in Cleveland, mid-August 2008. Head dies quickly over the only vaguely hazy yellow-gold body; looks more like a typical light lager than a wit...thankfully things improve with the aroma, which is very pleasant, spring-herbal with mint and fresh flowers, a bit of orange and lemon, light yeasty-barnyard notes...an OK sweet-tangy balance in the body, gradually turning to bitterness and strong dryness at the finish...mouthfeel just on the thin/pallid side but not damagingly so."
Sterkens White Ale;Meer, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Sterkens;11.2 Fl. Oz. Bottle. Hazy yellow, abundant white head, some lacing. Citrus notes are predominant on the nose, but there are some spices in there too. Taste is Tart, lemon, coriander and a some yeast too. Refreshing and drinkable.
Sterkens White Ale;Meer, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Sterkens;bottle @ Party Source / Bellevue KY --- Cloudy medium amber, noisy effervescent head that drops quickly to the rim, tiny lace dots. Taste is mild malt that adds hints of spice (especially coriander) and lemon, then uses an edge of carbonation to provide sufficient balance. A very light, but agreeable, brew.

Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Bottle. Pours yellow with small foamy whitish head, doughy aroma, high carbonation, faintly malty taste with very little hops bitterness, thin watery body, abrupt finish. Generic lager, I don't know which panel decided that this was 'one of the seven best beers in the world'!
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;My last taste of Golden Eagle was in the late 1980’s and since my first taste in the late 1970’s, I noted two different bottles being used. There was a consistent difference in the flavor of each with the 12 oz bottle having the longer neck providing the much better flavor. It was a very fresh and green/bright flavor reminiscent of a freshly mowed lawn. The beer bottled in the shorter neck (longer body of the bottle) had more of a caramel flavor and less hoppy. The second type was on par or a little less good than Kingfisher while the first Golden Eagle discribed, has always been my favorite beer despite not being able to obtain it for the last 30 years.
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Fine hop aroma. Very malty lager with a good hoppy aftertaste. Very German in its expression, but certainly a type of real and thirst quenching lager.
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;600ml bottle. Pale gold pour. Aroma is paper. Flavor is just odd, don’t even know how to describe it, some kind of asian sauce.
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;22oz bottle poured into a shaker. Pours a slightly cloudy, very pale yellow with no head. Aroma of some weird stuff. Corn and grains with sour wheat and old flat beer. It kinda smells like walking into a bar Sunday morning before they clean anything. Taste is similar. Sour dirty bar. Wow, not good at all. Light bodied with a thin texture. Soft, but not flat carbonation and not much of a finish. Again, not a good beer. It’s like they took a really shitty beer, then watered it down. Hence making it even more shitty. EDIT: looking closer at the bottle, it appears to have been packaged around 18months ago. They may explain some of the crap flavor, but I’m still guessing this was just a crap beer to begin with
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;"A very surprising & unusual ale, one of the best brews I’ve ever tasted, this is not for the budweiser palette, trust me. Often described as ""smokey,"" it has strong hints of sage and maple, to which I can only add Yum."
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Golden Eagle Lager Beer has a thick, slightly off-white head, a clear, very bubbly, deep golden appearance, and lots of thick lacing sticking to the sides of the glass. When I swished the bottom and poured, some yeast chunks were seen in the foam, and the foam turned tan (at the top). The aroma is full- pungent, sweet, malty, and noticeable as soon as the cap is popped. The flavor is really strange. There is an overriding charcoal taste in the beer, so it has a pronounced rauchbier character. One will also pick up sweetness, barley malt, and hops, but the smoke is overriding. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Golden Eagle Lager Beer finishes crisp, refreshing, and smoky. Overall, even with the bizarre nature, it is still quite good. Check it out, for an unusual experience. RJT
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Bottle @ home picked up for $2.99 at Stockade Aurora for my malt liquor evening. Pours a clear golden appearance with a small white head. Weirdly smoky, green veggie, lightly toasted malty aroma. One of the most horrendous aromas I’ve ever came across. Fairly sweet, cardboard/paper, sulfuric, smoky flavor. Absolutely awful. Fuck you.
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;This beer has a very interesting taste. It has almost a caramel flavor. It isn't really your normal lager. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Golden Eagle Lager;Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;330ml bottle pours a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves very little lacing behind.

Taj Mahal;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;United Breweries Group;Pours light gold with a thick white head. Aroma of corn malt. Taste has light floral notes dancing over some carbonated bubbles. Palate has sickly sweet malt. Not bad for a cheap beer.

Taj Mahal;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;United Breweries Group;11 oz. bottle poured to a shaker at The Heartland Bar in the Sheraton Hotel in Madison, WI. showing a clear, golden hue, with a modest layer of soft white froth that reduced to a thin ring, and light spots & strands of lacing. The nose was light lager scent, light malt sweetness, some grassiness, and a hint of pit fruit. Light to medium bodied, the taste was similar, with lively, seltzer-like carbonation. Crisp & clean.
Taj Mahal;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;United Breweries Group;Pours pale clear gold big white head. Aroma typical pale lager, corn, light, not bad. Taste is slightly buttery buttery, sour corn, oily. Have had better tasting light lagers. Mouthfeel is watery but somehow not crisp. While appearance and aroma not bad, all in all a poor example even for the style.
Taj Mahal;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;United Breweries Group;Not really a fan. No head to speak of. Couldn’t detect hops and had a soft drink like sweetness to it. Paired ok with the spices Indian food but not something I’ll seek out any time soon.

F: big, white, average retention C: gold, light hazy. A: prickled or stewed pepper, bit grainy, chili. T: almost nothing else than strong chili peppery feeling, mineral, bit corny, interestingly later sips are not so burning, green hot pepper, medium body and carbonation, you can try also green chili inside actually it is no so burning, interesting experience all together, at least I can easy blow my nose after this.
Cave Creek Chili Beer;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;I'll admit....was sold on the chili pepper in the bottle. Actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be after reading some of the reviews. Had it over a year ago, but forgot to review then. No stomach ache or nothing. Pretty much a spicy pale lager, but did not find it overwhelming. Slightly hopped at the end. The best part I think was nibbling on the pepper at the end.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;Amber, clear with a medium off white head. Aroma of malt, bread, hay and dried fruits. Medium bitter with s malt and bread Finnish. Not bad.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;"Pours a hazy and translucent dark amber/light brown, with a classic huge white and dense weizen head; good retention and nice lacing. Soft aroma shows a well balanced mix of caramel, nutty and slightly toasted malts, with background estery notes of banana and clove. Very well refined though not very intense. Taste is quite brighter, same notes as per aroma. Obviously sweet as per style, maybe a little less than usual, with a balanced finish that leaves a spicy/clove reminiscence. Light to medium bodied with average carbonation, maybe a little less carbonated than average for style, resulting in a very nice smooth/soft feel. It's not the kind of beer that may make a huge impression on a beer drinker that is used to explore a wide variety of beers, but it's seriously smooth, enjoyable and well balanced. An excellent dunkelweizen."
Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;Clear golden with a frothy head. Wheaty smell. Wheaty taste with a decent bitterness, little acidity and a clove note. Medium carbonation. This is only the third Kristallweizen I ever tasted in my life. Having been disappointed by the two first I wasn't expecting much of this one, but in the end it's a very fine beer.

Slight hint of smoke in the taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Riverside IPA;Riverside, California, United States;IPA;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);Nice, though thin, head atop a golden body. Smells simillar to a sierra nevada, same kind of pineapple, grapefruit smells. However, the glass smelled of the cleaning liquid used on it, so it probably left off tastes to the brew as well as off smells. (would have smelled and tasted a lot better). Had the same fruityness around the tongue as it did in the nose, only there was a hell of a lot of hop bite. If your a hop head, you'd love this beer. Not quite as well balanced with malt as other IPA's, but the maltyness has a presence throughout the beer. Also leaves a nice lace on the glass.
Riverside Pullman Pale Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);From old tasting notes. Tawny Amber orange color. Fluffy beige head.

Riverside Pullman Pale Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);(12 oz bottle) Since I found this on the singles shelf of a small liquor store in Covina, CA (read: probably been sitting there for a few years), I expected it to be spoiled, but somehow, it survived okay. This is actually a fairly flavorful beer, though the age has probably had some impact on the overall flavor. It’s dominated by a strong fruitiness, but it’s also moderately sweet and malty, and lightly bitter. There’s a slight smokiness present midway through, extending into the finish a bit. Medium bodied with a fairly substantial mouthfeel. The nose is also quite fruity and sweet. Dark amber in color with lots of chunky sediment in the beer. Pours with very little head.

Not my style but worthy summertime drinker, or beginner's beer.

Buffalo Bills Alimony Ale;Hayward, California, United States;IPA;Buffalo Bills Brewery;"""The times they are a-changing."" - Bob Dylan The year was 1987. Somewhere between the pages of big-haired centerfolds, Playboy magazine a named certain West Coast craft brew called Buffalo Bill’s Alimony Ale the ""Bitterest Brew in America."" Fast forward to 2016. Playboy is nixing nude pictorials, and Alimony - weighing in at 70 IBU’s - is a far cry from America’s bitterest beer. Countless IPA’s, from the West Coast and other regions, have upstaged its hoppiness. The hophead in me knows one of the those changes is for the better. The horny teenager who haunts the corridors of my brain isn’t so sure about the other thing. Pour is darker than the usual shade of IPA orange; more like an amber/copper color. Aromas of caramel, rubber/latex, and butter. Again, not very IPA-like by the modern definition. The discrepancies continue with the taste. Mild flavor, malty, mellow. It does get bitter as it warms. It’s a medium body with a creamy feel. The knife-wielding brunette bombshell is an appeal to a time with curvaceous pinups and femme fatales worthy of Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity. Yet, lovers of the bitter, hop-forward, and innovative will understand one truth, harsh though it may sound: some nostalgia is bullshit."
Buffalo Bills Alimony Ale;Hayward, California, United States;IPA;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Bottle. Clear amber pour, with an off white head. Raw grain, sugar, grass clippings, notes of citrus, cardboard, and caramel. Not interesting at all, but I guess it’s partially drinkable.

Buffalo Bills Bellehop Porter;Hayward, California, United States;Porter;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Dark brown with caramel and coffee aromas. Very pleasant particulate mouth feel like a partial fining or filtration. It's good but with the brewery's description being something black with chocolate aromas, I think this may be a bit thin. Still very nice.
Buffalo Bills Tasmanian Devil;Hayward, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Aroma is sweetish malts, slight fruit and old hops. The flavor is mals, fruit, mild scotch undertones and a slightly sweet/spicy hop/warming alcoholic finish.
Buffalo Bills Tasmanian Devil;Hayward, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Buffalo Bills Brewery;21-Jun-13 (12-oz bottle, Enjoy by 12-Jul-13: Sample bottle from the distributor) This beer pours a very hazy, dark-golden body with half an inch of off-white head that settles to a ring. The nose is sweet, very caramely, somewhat sugary, and very floral from the hops. On the palate, it's again very sweet and tastes like caramely candy. Hops don't add much bitterness at all, but there's a pretty strong floral flavor that's almost sickeningly floral. Medium-plus in weight, medium in carbonation, and though sweet, it's not the point of cloying. Overall, this is nothing special, but I wonder if it's going to be better on tap because this is made by Pyramid, but at the brewpub, it's made there.
Buffalo Bills Tasmanian Devil;Hayward, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Caramel and hoppy flavor. Crisp start but flat finish. Overall, a forgettable tasting experience. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Buffalo Bills Tasmanian Devil;Hayward, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Bottle from Total Wine in Sacramento, CA. Poured into a Michelob Celebrate! tulip. :) Pours coppery gold with a slight white head. Aroma of malt and some rather unusual hops. Med body. Flavor is malty, but there are some floral, fruit and herb aspects to help with that. There’s a tree bark/twig aspect. It tries to be astringent, but not quite dry enough for that. This isn’t super today, but it’s nice to see the past brought back, and this would have been dynamite 30 years ago. I’m liking it.

SLO Cole Porter;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Porter;SLO Brew;From old tasting notes. Dark translucent black brown color. Huge rocky tan head. Rich chocolaty malt nose. Bittersweet roasted malt flavor is sharp and flavorful. Spicy hops in finish balance this Porter nicely.
SLO Cole Porter;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Porter;SLO Brew;12oz bottle (Old Notes-Brewed at August Schell New Ulm, MN)-Pours black with a decent head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste of the same with some sweetness on the back end. This full bodied brew is darn tasty.
SLO Cole Porter;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Porter;SLO Brew;Tons and tons of coffee in the aroma. This is a beer for coffee lovers only and I’m not one. Ti’s tasty enough but not lovable for a non-coffee guy.
SLO Cole Porter;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Porter;SLO Brew;"OK. I cut and pasted this part from my other ratings at SLO brewing: ""Tried at the brewpub in downtown Paso Robles after a day of visiting wineries. Man, the wineries ROCK here. What an awesome day. What a better way to finish off the day than to sit down with a sampler platter of ice cold uber-crappy beer."" On to the beer: You would think that roasted grains would hide the yuck...they don’t. Black color. Vegetal. Fluffy head. Dish rag taste and aroma. Lightly sweet. Impossible to finish the 3oz taster. Well at least I got 6 new ratings from SLO brewing."
SLO Cole Porter;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Porter;SLO Brew;Had this beer on 7/9/1998. Color is a rich black with good carbonation and a great creamy head. Aroma has the scent of sweet roasted malts. The taste is is smooth and nice with a mild bitter end. It starts off with a rich body that goes down smooth as the roasted flavors start to come though. Once down the finish starts with a rich almost sweet malt taste, that fades leaving you with a nice hop bitterness and a hint of hop taste. As you drink it the finish does become a little more bitter than I like.
SLO Cole Porter;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Porter;SLO Brew;22oz. Very rich and roasty porter. Lots of coffee. Strong porter. I used to drink out of the bottle back when I drank this in 1996 so I’m not sure how it looked. I doubt they even make this anymore.

SLO Cole Porter;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Porter;SLO Brew;Just found this in a nearby store, wonder how old it is considering the last rating was in October 01 and the last rater said they don't make it anymore...poured dark with a halo'd head with the constellation orion swirling in the center, aroma had a rotten veggieness to it which I couldn't get past to try to pick up anything else...totally redeemed by the flavor, THANKFULLY, sweet chocolate candy bars, frapachinos, whipped cream with shredded chocolate on top...still a bit rotten veggieness in the lingering finish..I guess it wasn't meant to be aged...I'm sure it was better in its prime
SLO Cole Porter;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Porter;SLO Brew;Dark Color. Rich chocolate malt taste, smooth finish. Dry Aftertaste........

Boulder Beer Sundance Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;On tap @ brewery. Pours a beautiful orange/gold with a perfect, minimalist head that lingers. But it smells and tastes earthy and metallic. Hoppy, but not smooth, without enough malt to balance.
Boulder Beer Sundance Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Draft. Pours amber with an off white head. Malty, toffee like aroma. The flavor has some crystal malt/toffee-like sweetness, along with lighter floral and earthy hop notes. Decent.
Boulder Beer Sundance Amber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;12 oz bottle courtesy of jbye4334. Pours deep amber/orange, kind of like the picture on the bottle. A vigorous pour netted a good 2 finger off white head.

Rockies Brewing Wrigley Red;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Had this on draft back in the early 90’s and what I remember is a nice amber color with a nice malty taste. Never thought it was a Scottish but a nice amber. Great drinking brew from Old Chicago.
Rockies Brewing Wrigley Red;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Boulder Beer Company;I used to drink this beer all the time back around 1992 and as far as I know this beer was brew only for Old Chicago’s as there house brew. It was a deep amber with a nice malty nose. Flavor came on a malty slightly roasted body with nice hop flavor and a mellow bitterness. I really liked this beer and was sad to see it go away. It is my understanding that they had to discontinue it because the name infringed on the Wrigley name.
Rockies Brewing Wrigley Red;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Fair as reds go, but as with most their beers anemic, not hoppy nor malt enough for me, but then I'm used to Belgian Ales that tend to be a bit over powering, just the way I like them.

Breckenridge Mountain Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);12 oz bottle This was given to me by a friend at Holden Beach. It is a most drinkable ale. The aroma was mild with a hint of orange. The ale poured a nice golden color with a foamy head and lacing. This is a refreshing ale for the beach or golf. It was much better than expected. It is not a complex beverage. The carbonation was average with a medium body. The finish had orange and pale grain.

Breckenridge Mountain Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Thick hazy yellow with off-white head. Lite fruity nose. Very lite hop, touches of wheat flavor.
Breckenridge Mountain Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Like standing in a Kansas wheat field. A good example of a style I know and love.
Breckenridge Mountain Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);This beer was a very ugly shade of yellow but its taste kind of compensated for it. It was a little acidic yet watery.
Breckenridge Mountain Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);"another snoozer from the little brewery that won''t. dirty yellow, almost ochre, with light haze. tattered gauze head with all the delicate lace of a flack jacket. light honey-apple aroma. the ""mountain wheat"" doesn''t add much. maybe that explains the problem, though: maybe wheat doesn''t grow any better in the mountains than avocados do. light apple and wheat bread flavor, modest sweetness prevails because of particularly parsimonious hopping. more interesting than an ordinary lager, and it was remedial on a big thirst. some beers just gotta come down right in the middle, so it''s nicely drinkable without being remotely remarkable."
Breckenridge Mountain Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);"Pours a clear deep gold, the head is average, white, the lace marginal. Nose has hints of wheat, front is somewhat sweet, the top light, the finish is lightly hopped, mildly acidic, a tad dry, a ""Weak/Watery"" concoction that gains little favor with me. Ranks #992 on my current 1000 beer list, with its other brothers/sisters from this brewery."
Breckenridge Mountain Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);A very sub-par wheat. Not enough wheat or yeast and a very one-dimensional beer. Breckenridge seems more interested in maintaining a repor and image with the rich skiers than with making truly remarkable beer.
Southampton Double White Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Southampton Publick House;12 oz can from Halftime. Orange golden body, cloudy, skin of white head.

Southampton Double White Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Southampton Publick House;From Mar 2006 Poured from 22oz bottle(room temp) a straw colour with a smallish head of foam that dissipated quickly. I also note that the carbonation level seems to be very low and that's ok with me. The smell is very spicy with notes of clove as well as some yeasty sourness. The taste has some of the clove noted in the smell but it's pushed into the background while other spices and a yeasty sweet and sour thingy take center stage. The finish is quite spicy and long lasting. Oh yeah, 7%abv eh? Well hidden! Overall, I find the taste different from the Wits I've tried before and in this case, different=it's quite pleasing. Bottom line: An easy drinking Witbier that must make the locals of this brewery very happy on a hot summer day. I recommend it. Thanks again to Nutbrown!
Southampton Double White Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Southampton Publick House;Originally rated on12/17/2008. This poured a nice looking hazy yellow body with a mid sized white cap that disappeared quickly and didnt leave much lace. Aroma of coriander and wheat. Flavor was a little off for me because i drank it too cold so most of the flavors didnt come out even though i let it warm a bit. Flavors of coriander, wheat and some spices. Overall it was smooth with a little bitterness from the lemon, worth a try.
Southampton Double White Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Southampton Publick House;Brewed for the winter, Southampton’s Double White is a bigger, heartier ale for colder weather. It almost drinks like a Weizenbock, yet it’s still light and refreshing. Lovely light yellow color with a head that sticks around. Doughy wheat, clove, coriander, pepper, and a subtle lemony brightness. Creamy smooth feel. This is the kind of winter treat I could enjoy year-round.

Breckenridge Ballpark Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Draft - nose is hoppier than I would expect from the style: citrus and pine. Sip adds doubt as to if this was the right beer. I’ll go along with it. Not a brown ale. More of a rye pale ale. Tasty. Malty backbone.
Breckenridge Ballpark Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);draft that poured a medium brown with eggshell head that lasted. first off this beer is was served way to cold. let it warm up got some mild roasted malts hints of chocolate and coffee. the body is rather thin and the flavor displays more of the aroma. just a basic mild brown ale that is decent but nothing to write home about.
Breckenridge Ballpark Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance had a deep roasted brown with a frothy tan head and a nice lacing. The smell had a nutty, roasty, bready, slightly grassy, and caramelly aroma. The taste was nutty, grassy, lightly floral, toffee, toasted malt, and bread. On the palate, there was a smooth lingering vanilla and slightly toasty malty aftertaste that lead to a dry finish.

Breckenridge Autumn Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Old Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);An enjoyable brew. Had a few samples from this brewery, nothing really stands out so far...but each one decent. I thought this would be lighter based on the label (lighter brown or Marzen/Oktoberfest), but more like a dark brown ale ...almost like a black lager. This is more like a winter ale, but it gets a lot colder in Colorado in the fall vs. Florida.
Breckenridge Autumn Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Old Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle. Toasted malt aroma with notes of caramel, toffee, nuts and some spicy hops.

Breckenridge Autumn Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Old Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Dark brown with thick frothy head. Rich malty aroma with toffee and caramel. Sweet malty flavor. It basically tastes like drinking straight malt extract, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Breckenridge Autumn Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Old Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Doesn't feel like an autumn beer. I didnt pick up any hints of fall spices. Aroma is very faint after pouring into glass. Dark brown color. Beer has a nutty caramel finish with a faint hint of chocolate. Definitely not an Oktoberfest beer not like it's a bad thing. Reminds me of a porter more than an ale. Head disappears quickly but leaves a slight lacing in my glass. It's solid but not exceptional.
Breckenridge Christmas Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Had almost 3 months after expiration date....smell is very malty....taste is very strong malt too...complex malt flavors but seemingly only malt flavors...a little rough on the palate with how bold it is... slightly bitter finish... but I'm a little floating in the clouds so...
Breckenridge Christmas Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Not sure if it's the late night buzz, but I am finding this beer pretty solid. Was actually expecting less based on my other Breck samples. After looking at my ratings, thought it woulda been closer to lower to mid 3's, but 3.8 is about where this is at. Has the potential to be a bit more. Some of the characteristics like flavor and overall may be high 7's, but had to round up here...as this beer deserves it. Has some peachy/apricot flavors. Reminds me of a maltier, spicier Magic Hat #9. Decent hop finish too. Could use some more carbonation for the body and head, but would possibly give up some of the smoothness that way. Missed this one during the holiday season, but picked a single up half price on clearance. Worth the try, and will look for a fresh one next Xmas season.

Not a whole lot going on with the nose - it’s pretty mild. Flavor is grassy and leaf like. A lot of strong tones from those character aspects. Sweet on the end. Feel has a thicker liquid feel and a low carbonation. Very smooth and highly drinkable.
Chelsea Pier 59 Pale Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Dry hopped cascade, drop of toast.

Chelsea Pier 59 Pale Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;On draft at pier 59 (6.2% ABV). Hazy orange, off-white head. Malty, cascade hops shining through. Balanced and refreshing pale ale.
Chelsea Pier 59 Pale Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;"Cask at Brazen Head. Listed as ""Chelsea Pale Ale."" Poured slightly hazy copper/orange with a small off-white head. Bright citrus, floral and peachy hop aromas. Sweet toffee malt flavor with citrus hops throughout. Mildly bitter grapefruit finish. Only minor complaint is that it is a bit too sweet and nectary, a characteristic which is perhaps amplified by the warmer temp and lack of carbonation. Sweetness possibly more restrained on tap?Otherwise another good offering from Chelsea."
Hurricane Reef Caribbean Style Pilsner;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Florida Beer Company;Pours clear solar yellow with a good ivory head. Aroma delivers zesty fresh malt, resiny hops, and not-so-subtle pomme notes. Flavor provides zesty malt with a floral touch, resiny hops, pomme and a bit of tropical.

Windhoek Light;Windhoek, Namibia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Namibia Breweries Limited;Alone at Copperlake Brewing co Joburg. Blond colored beer with small white head and lots of carbonation. Herby aroma. Full sparkling palate. Finish is bit bitter sweet.
Windhoek Light;Windhoek, Namibia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Namibia Breweries Limited;"I like everything about this beer; its taste, look, etc. Most of all, it is light in calories and very light in alcohol, in other words the perfect beer to look like you're enjoying yourself, without actually getting drunk or have a hangover the next day. It should therefore have a perfect score. But for me the deal-breaker and what takes the score all the way down is the new 440ml can. It used to come in a 330ml can, which was perfect. The new can size is not only bulky and ungainly, but the cans don't fit anywhere and the beer gets warm and stale by the time you get to the last few sips. This used to be my main beer, but now I avoid it, all because of the can size change."

Rogue Rogue-n-Berry;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rogue Ales;This beer is pretty nice, smooth. Fairly sweet start and finish - nearly no bitterness at all. Small head fully diminishes, leaving a few minute lacings. This beer is pretty flavourful, but I was expecting a little stronger berry flavour. 'Tis a nice beer for after-dinner relaxation, or perhaps with some dessert, but forget about having it at a barbecue.
Rogue Rogue-n-Berry;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rogue Ales;One of the better fruit beers I've had. Not too sweet, slightly sour, with a hint of berry flavor. Brew was obviously unfiltered as it was cloudy and had large sediment at the bottom of the bottle. I liked it better than the lambics I've tried. Some malt and hop present but not very pronounced. Overall, it smelled better than it tasted but it was certainly drinkable.
Rogue Rogue-n-Berry;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rogue Ales;Well they missed it here ,this is a good brewery, I just think they ought to focus on less beers and More quality, like 3 Floyds or Dogfish, not much here try again, another flavour maybe, fruity & sweet, not recommended by me.
Rogue Rogue-n-Berry;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rogue Ales;I'd rather have a lambic. Slightly sweet with odd dryness in finish. Not an alco-pop but not quite a beer either. Little flavor outside of the fruit.
Rogue Rogue-n-Berry;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rogue Ales;While not totally offensive, is too sweet and the wrong kind of sweet (not malty-sweet) for beer.

EKU Kulminator;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);"Old vintage bottle at Kulminator. Dark brown colour, failing to form a real head; caramelly aroma with bit vinous character, alcohol apparent, bit toasty as well; taste likewise, smooth caramel maltiness, slight roasted bitterness, warming alcohol. Suffered from old age as it was clearly oxidized and had lost most of its body; I’d prefer a young Bock over this."
EKU Kulminator;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Got an old bottle of this. Looks really good. Beer in the glass dark brown, no head. Alcoholic-dry aroma. Starts not as strong as exspected, modest dry, some woody notes. Then stronger and stronger, alcoholic-burning with soapy notes, tastes like 13-14% ABV... Finish intense woody-alcoholic, very warming. Interesting!

Hazy yellow color, enough firm and slightly little bubbly. Alcoholic and strongly bitter scent. Little harmonious and unbalanced. Unpleasant taste, overbearing bitter and with light malty and medicinal rumors. Much alcoholic and spiced, light flowery rumors in the end.
EKU Kulminator;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bottled. Vintage 1989. Body is garnet in color with speckles of sediment floating within it and the frothy cream colored head. Nose is a bit grainy while retaining the rich malt aromas and lighter caramel notes it had when fresh. Some hints of watery cocoa as well. Taste is light caramel with milder maltiness and stronger grains. Some intermittent oxidization. This is a bit past it’s prime. Body is light but still rather creamy. Finishes with malt, and light caramel-like sweetened notes. Good, but as mentioned, a little too far past it’s prime.
EKU Kulminator;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Strange yeasty aroma. Relatively light in body for a doppel and light in colour as well. Light nutty, buttery flavour. Not a good example of the style.

Gearys Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;Bottle from the brewery- pours medium copper with little head and no latticing to speak of.

Aroma is of caramel malt and toffee. Rather bold for a summer ale. Flavor brings more caramel/toffee maltiness. A pleasant earthy, spicy hop bitterness balances the sweet malt flavor.

Thin and covering white head, thin layer of bubbles lingers. Lacing is solid. Not a typical summer ale, this has a solid Amber stature rather than a weak and pissy yellow fizz. Aroma of bready malts, caramel malts, Amber grains. Taste of more bready, chewy malts, soft hop entrance in the end. One of the most different summer ales I’ve had. Drinks like a solid Amber. Full bodied, fun, and pronounced. Must go good with lobster.

Hurlimann Hexenbrau;Zürich, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hürlimann (Feldschlösschen);If you should ever see this on a shelf do yourself a favor and run the other way. This may at one time have been a decent beer. It ages terribly. I thought,from the label,was buying a malt liquor. What I got was nothing more than a dark beer gone bad. Imagine a cross between Heinies and Becks Dark with Gramma’s attic dust and some playground dirt tossed in. Drainpour!
Hurlimann Hexenbrau;Zürich, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hürlimann (Feldschlösschen);Purchased this afternoon for one dollar at a little second-hand store, found on a shelf mainly inhabited by empty bottles of long-dead American regionals. Practically opaque brown beer, dense light tan head. Aroma of malt and caramel. Flavor extremely malty, caramel, some roast and hints of dried fruit. Very faint hop grassiness. Medium to full body. Very drinkable, although I really should savor it slowly since it’s been discontinued. Quite good.

Hurlimann Hexenbrau;Zürich, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hürlimann (Feldschlösschen);Apparently, this beer is brewed only during a full moon. Hurlimann seems to like the stronger beers (Samichlaus) and this is no exception - I could taste quite a bit of alcohol in with all that malt. A pricey brew, too.

Liefmans Kriek Brut;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);One of the best (if not the best) 'kriek'beers in the world! Ok, there are better... but only brewed in a very small amount and almost not available if you don't know the brewer. But this is how a real 'kriek'beer should taste: sour and NOT sweet! Opening a big bottle is always a feast with friends: and always a nice surprise for those who never tasted a real 'kriek': tasty, refreshing and bringing a smile on the faces. For me the perfect beer to enjoy on a sunny evening sitting on a terras in the shade.
Liefmans Kriek Brut;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);330ml bottle. Pours deep murky ruby with a sparse beige-pink head. Aromas of sour cherries, malt and oak and vanilla. Acidic cherry and fruit flavours married with candy floss and malt. Low end of the carbonation scale, probably a wise choice to keep carbonic acid levels in check. Balanced mouthfeel with no creaminess detected. Finishes tart and quite dry. This is the beer that turned me on to sour beers, after struggling to find a liking in the trend for at least 10 years. It has become the beer I buy most frequently, even if it isn't the best example of the style.
Liefmans Kriek Brut;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);A bit sour, sweet and intense for cherry taste. Not for a daytime beer under the sunlight, but great for a warm evening.

Roman Dobbelen Bruinen;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Roman;"Cannot definitely age this but its definitely at least 2002, but I would guess more like 2000. Stamped L284. It pours a murky brown with a small head. Aroma is lively with light raisin, with sweet black bread, and light lemon-y wild characteristic. It seems aged but not in the ""old"" or ""cardboard"" way but the light lemon-like aspect. Taste is lightly water-y from the age, then there is a light black bread sweetness and light chocolate plum candy. A lighter side of medium body with a lightly below average carbonation. Aged nicely enough but I would not wait any longer.750mL cork and cap, Corsendonk tulip glass."
Roman Dobbelen Bruinen;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Roman;1996 bottle aged in my cellar. This is a very fruity brown ale that has held up quite well.

Ipswich Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;This is a backlog rating from 2012 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are roasted malts, earthy hops, doesn't fully satisfy, age questions.
Ipswich Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;New England sample #6- Even though I just got home from NE vacation, I didn't get to sample anything from these guys. Just bought a single tonight to try. Dark amber appearance with not much aroma. OK caramel malty flavor with medium hops at the end. Sort of like an ESB but not quite. Drinkable and decent.... but kind of forgetable.
Ipswich Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Very foamy. taste of burnt coffee and caramel. not too high alcohol content. Seems very balanced ale. not something I’d drink everyday but occasional winter nights. if you’re a dark ale fan, you will probably enjoy this.
Ipswich Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle courtesy of Strykzone. From the 22 oz bottle poured brown with quite a bit of foam. Not a gusher but close. Nose of roasted malts and some fruit. Flavor is a burn malt. In fact burnt coffee is more like it. The fruit kinds disappears under the burnt coffee taste. Finishes bitter but with some bite.
Ipswich Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bomber I came back from GTMW with. Cloudy amberish. A big gushing head, very gushing. The beer has dark fruit, cocoa, and rich malts. Something like vanilla beans with some toffee. Decent.
Ipswich Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"""Very malt driven robust brown ale. Possibly a little past it’s prime, and that is reflected in the score. Ever so slight vegetal offness. If not for that, this would be an exceptional robust brown. Roast, coffee, dark chocolate, light citrus hops...and unfortunately a touch of green olive :("""

Ipswich Porter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Ipswich Ale Brewery;From old tasting notes. Translucent dark brown color. Creamy tan head. Rich chocolatey malt aroma. Bittersweet toasted malt flavor hints at coffee and cocoa. Smooth yet flavorful. Very good.
Ipswich Porter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown color with a half finger white to off white foamy head that died down at a nice pace.Some stringy spider web lacing slid right on into the beer. The smell had a light roasty coffee to mild chocolate. The taste was roasty and somewhat bittersweet. On the palate, it sat right at a medium in body and was somewhat sessionable. The carbonation was good for the style and for me as it had just enough sharpness about it. Overall, I say this was a good porter worthy of having again.
Ipswich Porter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Shared 12 oz. bottle at a local geek tasting. Poured to a sampler with a dark brown color, creamy, brownish tan head foam, and a nice amount of wavey lacing. The aroma was roasted and smooth malt, chocolate, and a little coffee following up. The flavor was the same mocha and smooth malt notes, plus moderate hop bitterness and light sweetness, in a medium body. Probably shouldn’t have sampled the Oatmeal Stout right before, but still sensed a texture that was a bit thin. A quaffable, standard Porter nonetheless.
Ipswich Porter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"Bottle. Pours dark brown with a tan, retaining head. Aroma of dry chocolate, malt, and brown sugar. Initial flavor is very chocolaty, developing a more roasted profile by mid-palate. Finish picks up additional ashy bitterness and black coffee, though brown sugar keeps things in check. However, most of these flavors vanish impossibly quick on the palate (except, as Michael-Pollack said, ""Hershey’s Chocolate"". I just don’t get the fullness or robustness that I love in porters such as Smutty’s, Anchor’s or even London Porter. But I generally like this brew. And I like the flavors. Maybe I should have drank this warmer? I am wandering through my thoughts on paper at this point."
Ipswich Porter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz. Bottle: Aroma of Hershey’s Chocolate Syrup, dark malts, light roasting, and light coffee. Poured dark brown in color with a small to medium-sized, dense, creamy, oatmeal-brown colored head that lasted throughout. Almost opaque. Full of small and medium-sized particles.

Soft to average carbonation. Dull, roasted malt finish.
Ipswich Porter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12 oz. bottle. Pours a dark brown with small off white head and decent lasting lacing. Nose was chocolaty and malty.

Ipswich Porter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12 ounce bottle purchased at Manchester Wine and Liquors. Mildly transparent, dark dark brown/mahogany color with a frothy, yet slightly quickly dissipating tannish head. Floral, sweet, toasty, chocolate, milky, roasted aroma. Quite pleasant. Slightly astringent and vegetal start, turning toasted, roasted, and chocolatey with some delicate Euro hops. Smooth, flavorful, pleasant. The start is a bit unsettling, though.
Ipswich India Pale Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Aroma and flavor is pine, grapefruit, malts/caramel and a citrus/mild hop resin/earthy finish.
Ipswich India Pale Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle at home from backlog notes. Pours a clear amber color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale toasted malts, grassy and herbal hops, a splash of grapefruit peel, a hint of caramel, pretty basic and unexciting, no reason to repeat.
Ipswich India Pale Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bomber I brought back from GTMW. Bottle says it is 7.0 ABV. The beige head falls down on itself making an interesting layer. The beer is dark amber and clear. I smell caramel first. It also has a bit of cinnamon spice. A bitter bite hits early and resembles grapefruit but no citrus followup. A little pine emerges. Caramel is sweet. Not a top shelf IPA.
Ipswich India Pale Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Thanks to Jeff for the bottle. Light brown pour with a thick creamy head. Herbal hoppy aroma. Big malt body with a noble hop bitterness. Tasty.
Ipswich India Pale Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Nose is heavily caramel, and malt dominated. Mouthfeel is IBU central. Mostly pine resin type, full dry body.

Ipswich India Pale Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"""Not bad, not great. Nicely balanced caramel and biscuit malt, and citrus and piney hops. nothing really pops, but it’s pleasant to drink. perhaps a well made starter ipa?"""
Ipswich India Pale Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;It pours a nice cloudy golden ale color. A mellow and balanced hop profile match the malty body for a well rounded IPA. Obviously not a west coast IPA but rather a Massachusetts hop ale to hold its own.
Ipswich India Pale Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Clear amber, tall head. Medium body, well balanced mouthfeel, rich, intense but simple flavor, long palate. Very bitter and dry, despite maltyness, Hoppy but not in an American way, malty, floral, herbal, hint of grapefruit. A balanced and intense IPA, just not a lot of personality. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Perfect for an ESB. Sweet finish. Great Beer.
Ipswich Extra Special Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle: Good nose. Honey and citrus,mainly grapefruit, some orange.

Ipswich Extra Special Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"Translucent mahogany, medium head settles into a thin wisp of cream with great lacing. Fruity, sharp aroma; flavor strongly hoppy, but with a really interesting woodiness throughout and plenty of malt in the finish.

Ipswich Extra Special Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Amber hue with lots of cloudy sediment and light lace. Terrific sweet hopped aroma. Starts hoppy and crisp, finishes sweet and malty. Leaves a nice somewhat bitter aftertaste. This is what all non-dark beers should aspire to be. As everyone else has said, its perfectly balanced.
Ipswich Extra Special Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Wicked ESB!!!! Deep cloudy amber with a floral fruity aroma.

Stone Cat ESB;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"Dark amber. Light aroma for an ESB; not much bitter either. It was OK, but not great."
Stone Cat ESB;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;From Matt at 3R6P. Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a cloudy orange-amber color with a small tan head that faded quickly and left minimal lacing. The aroma was tart and bitter fruity hops. The flavor was crisp bitter fruity and floral hops with light notes of caramel and nut underneath. The finish was medium length with caramel and floral hops lingering. Medium body. Drinks better than the sum of it’s parts.
Stone Cat ESB;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"Pours a dark copper color, slightly hazy. Floral hops evident in the aroma. Good head retention with beautiful lacing along the walls of the glass. Medium bodied with a complex but not overpowering bitterness. Just enough malt character to balance the plentiful hops. It resembles an IPA, but much less aggressive. More like an ""American Style ESB"", less British. Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
Stone Cat ESB;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Darker amber in color, slight floral smell. Sediment. I can’t figure out what it wants to be. On one hand it has the hop taste of an IPA and finishes like a brown ale. Eh.

Stone Cat Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;With this, I complete my conquest of all Stone Cat beers. 2003 bottle. Hmm, they say filtered but there is some sediment at the bottom. Vibrant orange color, light copper, big white head. Aroma of sour yeast, bitter plasticy, piney hops? It smells like their IPA, and I cant quite place that aroma. It is sour, it’s almost sweet and plasticy. Soured milk perhaps? Is that their secret? Just kidding. Flavor starts out with a good amount of honey and pilsner like malts. Smooth body, low, pleasing carbonation. Medium, but not thin. Finishes with some very light fruit esters, more of that funky sour/bitterness. After drinking this, I want to just mail it out to everyone just because I believe it is so remarkable how strange it is. Not bad though, not bad at all. Where I have found this love for cream ales is beyond me. Earlier Rating: 10/18/2004 Total Score: 3.1 2004 draught. Golden with a light orange tint, mildly hazy and a large white head. Aroma of light grains, hay, spicy german hops and a hint of honey and almonds. Flavor is both sweet and sour, mixing well with the hops providing a good fresh spiciness. Touch of yeast apparency, and a good medium body. Not terribly crisp on the finish and a bit too sweet even with a even smooth body, but I’d actually prefer it be more crisp and light to get in a bit more of the hops bite. Ends dry, earthy and yeasty.
Stone Cat Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pour is a slightly cloudy blonde with a HUGE HUGE white head. Annoyingly big.

Finish is smooth and malty.

Stone Cat Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Amazingly, I'm the first RBeerian to rate this fine brew. Drunk from a snifter, you get quite a bit of the sourness in the nose, but the first sip further reveals its complexity. Considerable bitterness up front but little in the aftertaste. Medium malt body with noticeable citrus qualities. Cream ale? I don't think so.
Stone Cat IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Light orange pour with red edges. small fluffy head. Aroma is bitter orange peel, light fruitiness with some sweet toasted malt. Mouth-feel is light but adequate.

Wild Goose Amber;Easton, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);"Clear and glassy reddish-orange color. Puffy head. The top of the glass is nice, with fluffy foam and lace. Smooth and buttery aroma. Sweet and biscuity malt. Only a hint of butterscotch. Honey and a mild sweet grape. Really good. As it warms, more roasted. Nice balance of very bitter roasted amber malt flavor and some sweetness. Bready yeast. Tiny hint of chlorine in the pale malt, but not bad. Like a pale amber. Not overly burnt or too sweet. Appears to be ringwood yeast. Sweeter as it warms. Thick and milky feel. Leaves a bitterish mily film. A nice sweetish ale; ringwood and roasted malt make for a nice combo. A good, solid beer."
Wild Goose Amber;Easton, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);"I almost confused Wild Goose Brewing of Frederick, Maryland with Goose Island Brewing out of Chicago, IL. The latter I am pretty familiar with, but once more Wild Goose is a brand new frontier for me. Who needs space; beer is my final frontier, and I was lucky enough to stumble across a newly discovered territory: English Style Amber Ale. I don’t know what awaits me and if it will be a memorable experience, or a horrifying disaster. Let’s find out, shall we. That is, after all, half the fun of exploring the vast expanse of beer. He pours like liquid amber into my glass, shimmering and fracturing in the light with deep reds and soft coppery-orange hues. Faint streams of bubbles lazily make their way to the surface where a soft nose waits for the taking. Crunchy melba toast with a sweet glaze of caramelized maple syrup. Cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkles add spice as a whisper of bay leaves flit through the background. Dry, toasty, brisk and clean with a naughty snap of crunchy sweetness. Licking damp lips, I raise my glass to sup on her liquid bounty. Light with a clean presence that neither lingers too long nor cloys while crunchy caramelized sugars hint of maple. His finish is dry and spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg while the bay leaves flitter through the distance. Breaking him down, his spiced and faint herbal nature hits my senses first, leading me into a toasty, dry, and crunchy finish. As we near the end of our virgin tryst, burnt sugar crystals add another touch of crunchy sweetness with brown sugar relations. Balanced, sessionable, and complex enough to appreciate the flavors but not so much I have to put forth really serious thought. I love all beers at all different kinds of occasions and times of days. What I drink and when depends on availability, time of day, mood, food accompaniment, and what possible further quaffing plans lay yet still before me. From sipper to easy tasty quaffer, all good beer is good. Wild Goose realizes this with their English Style Amber Ale. Not all beers have to be a 20 page essay unto themselves. There is much to be said about a good session brew. That being said, may I have another please."
Wild Goose Amber;Easton, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);interesting English style amber i get steel and butterscotch....buttery and malty with a touch of something like rye. nice rich orange brown amber with no visable carbonation just a white head that dissapates in time. actually decently balanced with some hops it is rich, flavorful and probably something that most officiananos of beer would find demonstrative and pretty decent.
Wild Goose Amber;Easton, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Overall Impression: These guys make a decent Amber, it’s nothing special, pretty simple and subdued, but still tasty, and it’s a solid local (sort of) beer to where I live, so it’s got that going for it...

Creamy texture with a light taste of hops and oranges. A bit too mellow and harder to rate after the European Strong Lager I had just enjoyed. Pity that.
Wild Goose IPA;Easton, Maryland, United States;IPA;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);A hazy rust coloured pour, and a light tan cap greets the eye sockets of this old man.

Wild Goose IPA;Easton, Maryland, United States;IPA;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Poured from 12 oz. bottle. Hazy, copper brown with only a thin film of a head and good lacing. Aroma of bread malt, toffee and grassy hops. Taste of grassy, floral and pine hops, toffee and bread malt.

Wild Goose IPA;Easton, Maryland, United States;IPA;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);From a 12 oz bottle from a six pack purchased in Silver Spring, Maryland, this poured a slightly hazy amber to copper color with a foamy white head and good lacing rings. The nose is pine and citrus hops. Body is medium and mouthfeel on the oily side. The flavor is a good balance between the light caramel malts and bitter hops. The finish is dry and bitter. Good.
Wild Goose IPA;Easton, Maryland, United States;IPA;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);12 oz brown bottle. No apparent date, just a bottling code. It pours a clear orange/amber/gold with a fluffy white head that sticks for a bit and leaves some decent lacing. The smell is very doughy with an overlying of English hops. English hops aren’t always my favorite and here im getting a bit of a vomity/tomato scent. The flavor is simple, perhaps a bit vegetal and herbal with the hops. Not too much bitterness although it comes through in the aftertaste. The malt is rich but not sweet, it has more of a grainy/bready characteristic. It tastes pretty traditional, it doesn’t get out of control with the hops. It has a pretty good mouthfeel as well. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 09-23-2010 21:38:10

Wild Goose Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);"I had this beer on tap at the sampling at the brewery in Frederick, it was a nice spell from the heavier beers. The aroma was pleasant, but not overwhelming; a mixture of some subtle caramel malt, but also a grainy hops presence, and light citrus. A clear medium-gold color, with an average-sized, foamy white head. Good flavor, not too overly sweet, with some bitter-sour effects for balance. Fairly light and smooth on the palate, with average-low carbonation, and mostly wet. It was a quality beer, and fit its profile well."

Been seeing some new Oatmeal Stouts and Porters, so deciding to sample them since they are two of my favorite styles. This one was OK for me, but nothing special.

Wild Goose Spring Wheat Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Wheat Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);American Wheat is the worst style of beer. I think I actually prefer American Standard. Or even Japanese Dry. This one is well made--the malt has a tiny bit of complexity. But wheat without a good yeast is simply worthless.
Wild Goose Nut Brown Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);I keep telling people that the English Brown Ale style is one of my favourite styles, but sadly, North American brewers tend to go for an over-hopped undermalted version of the style. This however is one of the better attempts. A nice clear brown pour, the aroma is undoubtedly nuts and caramel. The flavour is slightly sweet with hints of both, but again, too much hops in the finish.

Wild Goose Snow Goose Winter Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);After 4 years in the dark cellar alll alone, pours amber thicker with a ton of sediment and beige head. Aroma brings sweet malts with aging character, started to turn a big. Flavor brings the sweet aged malt flavors as well, maintaining the English style with honey like notes, not piercing sweetness at all. It aged pretty well for 4 years!

Wild Goose Snow Goose Winter Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Too many gooses in the name for my liking.

Wild Goose Snow Goose Winter Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Reviewed from notes. Pours a moderate brown with a fairly thin head. A bit of the head remains after some time, although the remainder doesn’t leave much lacing as it goes down. The nose has got a surprising amount of hop activity with a good amount of pine and citrus. Some caramel and light molasses in the back. The taste brings forward some of the hop elements without too much bitterness. Some light doughy flavors with a bit of toast. Light to medium body. Drinks pretty well overall for a winter warmer and certainly bucks the insane spicing trend. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 10-21-2010

The aroma is floral, but not entirely pleasant to my nose for some reason. The brew however is a well-balanced, bitter sweet interplay of hop and malt with a pleasantly long, mildly bitter finish. I don’t think it is oak aged, but it has some of the taste notes I associate with oak. Very nice.

Batemans Dark Mild;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Batemans;Aug 2006 from BA: This review is from a pint had at the 30th CAMRA, Cotswold Beer Fest (last month). The dark, almost porter black colour is only the start of your journey to Mild perfection. It’s creamy off-white head should be thick and if poured correctly, stay until the end of the pint, sticking to the glass. Some Milds are thin and taste weak, Bateman’s is the opposite, rich and strong tasting, the ABV does not give a true picture of it’s complexity or character. Roasted nuts,ripe fruit and hops hit your nose and the taste is of the same intensity. This is a dark Mild that is well worth tracking down and drinking!

Batemans Valiant (Cask);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Batemans;From BA: May 2006. Long time fan of this beer, but never reviewed it until now for some reason. The review is from a tasting at the bi-annual beer festival at the Bateman’s brewery. They put on 5 cask beers of their own and have another 15 barrels from small brewers also available to drink. Hand-pulled in the base of their famous windmill, my pint glass looked beautiful, a light amber, golden beer, this was clear and had a good off-white head sat on top. The Styrian and Challenger hops give it a good hoppy aroma and the taste is crisp, sharp and refreashing. The flavours stay in the mouth, with bitterness coming through towards the end. A great beer, from a good brewery.

I don’t know what they’ve done to it in the last 6 months but the whole brewery is now undrinkable. Foul, nasty stuff. I don’t pour many bottles down the sink, but this one went. Great shame, as the old Victory was an accomplished traditional IPA easy drinking and heavy hitting. Malty, bitter, smooth. I have no idea why it’s changed.

Batemans XXXB (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Batemans;Slightly sweet with mild malt flavours. Doesnt capture any of the magic a bitter has on cask. Just toasted malts with sweet caramel making a mild but quaffable brew!
Hoogstraten Poorter;Meer, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brouwerij Sterkens;14-Aug-16 (750-ml ceramic flip-top crock) This Porter pours a medium-brown body and half an inch of pale-tan head that settles to a bubbly ring. The nose offers aromas of lightly roasty, very toasty malt, mild molasses, nuts, chocolate, brown sugar, and candied, dark fruit, kind of a candied orange peel aroma actually. On the palate, the malt profile veers toward the sweet, toasty, worty side rather than roasty and dry. Dried fruits, processed sugar notes, a touch of coriander, too much bread dough, finishing very pasty and doughy. It's a full bodied beer with light-medium carbonation, but the heavy, doughy mouthfeel makes this a short session. Some good points here, but not an impressive effort and not particularly drinkable past the requisite few ounces to jot down these notes.
Hoogstraten Poorter;Meer, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brouwerij Sterkens;Sample at Mechels Bierfestival 2018. Aroma of roasted malt, sugar, a bit nutty. Pours dark brown, beige head. Fading, dirty glass I guess. Taste is sweet, light bitter, a bit roasted.

MacAndrews Scotch Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);From old tasting notes. Hazy, copper colored brew with a sturdy beige head. Herbal hops compliment a pleasant toasted malt nose. Notes of pine and peat lead to a big smoky malt flavor. Reminiscent of aged imported provolone (with a little imagination). Complex, full bodied and hearty. Finishes long and smoky sweet. Very good.
MacAndrews Scotch Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);500ml bottle pours amber in color with a finger of off-white head that leaves a few spots of lacing on the glass.

Very full flavoured beer that was quite enjoyable.
MacAndrews Scotch Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);"Ok! I’ll admit I’ve not tasted this for a long time, but I was browsing through an old tasting book I found and came across this brew. I understand it’s now brewed by Sam Smiths and called ""stock ale"", still destined for the US market. My notes tell me this was brewed to the same recipe as Lorimer & Clarks (remember them?) Caledonian Strong Ale which used to be available in a few of Edinburghs better pubs when I lived there. It was a stunning beer rich and packed with fruit, malt and hoppy aromas and flavours, the 6.4% wasn’t to be treated lightly, a fine brew! If I find the Sam Smiths version I’ll give that a bash and report back!"
MacAndrews Scotch Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);***Prior to March 2006 - for prosterity*** I had this awhile ago, but knowing it was from Samuel Smith I knew that it was high quality (my favorite brewer). Didn’t know any better so I drank it right out of the bottle, so no appearance review. Carmelly sweet and dirt with the usual background of smokiness. Smelt very interesting from what I remember. I do remember no being overly impressed with it and never bought it again - one of the weakest Sam Smith brews I’ve had....now that I’d willingly get more, it’s not available in my area. Crap review going off of remaining damaged brain cells.

MacAndrews Scotch Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottled. Barleywine brown, and pretty close to a young barleywine in taste.

Boon Faro Pertotale;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Brouwerij F. Boon;Bottle thnx to Jef ! Pours clear , very dark amber. No sign of carbonation. Smell is oxidized, sweet, metallic. Taste is oxidized. Starts of having some lambic funk, yet fades away to a very sweet, metallic taste that is purely oxidation. Completely flat, I wonder if this ever was carbonated.

Boon Faro Pertotale;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Brouwerij F. Boon;"A ’versnijbier’ in an old, typically Lembeek tradition of ’double faro’, which was stronger than normal due to a more copious addition of candi sugar. Spiced with curaçao and - strangely - gentian and sweetened with candi sugar as custom for the style; subdued lambic character, wheaty, sweet and spicy, thin mouthfeel. Perhaps not to anyone’s liking but I still regret that a beer with such historical pedigree has been discontinued meanwhile; Boon’s Donkere Duivel, though a fine beer, cannot fully replace its authenticity."
Boon Faro Pertotale;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Brouwerij F. Boon;This one poured a darker red color with pretty much no head. Aroma of stale wine and oxidation. Flavor was similar, rotten grapes, light oak and caramle and minty oxidation. Not good

A. Le Coq Porter;Tartu, Estonia;Porter - Baltic;A. Le Coq (Olvi);From random store in Estonia, during Metallica tour in Tartu. Not on video, but based on new checklist. Smell- weak, maybe roast, but quite non-specific. Foam- thin to medium, roast, weak bitter notes and some, some coffee-caramel. Head is medium, creamy white, brown, orange color. Appearance- clear, very dark red-brown color. Taste- weak roast and bitter notes, malt, maybe some roasted caramel? Hard to tell, generally quite malty, bitterness more in aftertaste. Drinkable, but nothing impressive, goes ok with some meat.
A. Le Coq Porter;Tartu, Estonia;Porter - Baltic;A. Le Coq (Olvi);Bottle from a supermarket in Tallinn. Another MJ 500 down. Nose is subdued chocolate / cocoa, light soy sauce or Worstershire sauce, sea water, and light apple notes. Medium to dark brown with orange tints. Clear, with a low, thick head. Sweet, rich malt, chocolate, light caramel, miso, wood, lightly salty. It has that typical Baltic Porter umami to go with the chocolate. Body is smooth but not heavy. Slightly fruity too. A well-made and relatively typical Baltic porter. This is still a decent beer and rather representative of the style. today they have mostly gone big, while this is still just 6.5%. There is something bit run-of-the-mill about it, but I suppose that 20 years ago, when fewer of these existed, it would have been a good choice. Probably would be replaced by a much bigger example today.

Belfast Bay Hog Back Mountain Red Ale;Belfast, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;This had quite a prominent hop bouquet for a red ale, and was apparent in the initial taste. The aftertaste showed hints of malt, with moderate bitterness. Nice color, a pretty good Red Ale, though I must admit I've not had many to compare this to. Needs to be a little more red though.
Belfast Bay Hog Back Mountain Red Ale;Belfast, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;Wow. Another fine beer made here in Maine. This is a beautiful red ale with a very clean taste. A medium head with a nice amount of carbonation. Has a mild aftertaste of grain, and a mild taste of hops when first going down. I was impressed by this beer. And the red color.. awe inspiring..
Bar Harbor Cadillac Mountain Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Atlantic Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 11/16/2018. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, and dark bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. A bit too fruity/yeasty aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malts and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, and dark bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, woody, grassy, peppery hops; and roast/charred bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, dark bread/crust, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, charcoal, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malts and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with an awesome roast/hop bitter/sweet balance; and no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp finishing. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering hop/char bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 6.7%. Overall this is an excellent Irish dry stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malts and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth, easy, and fairly crisp to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Nicely soft and not overly bitter/charred. Awesomely clean/rich English malt complexity, balancing earthy hops, and restrained fruity yeast. Mild residual sweetness from lingering crisp dryness. A really enjoyable offering, and impressive spot on style example."

Bar Harbor Cadillac Mountain Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Atlantic Brewing Company;From Jul 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Vermonthiker. Thanks Tom! This pours a pitch black with a 2 finger head of tannish foam. I see some great lacing and the foam does shrink rather quickly but there's still a fine broken layer near the end of my session. The smell is first and foremost of roasted malt followed by coffee, a touch, nah, a good amount of dark chocolate and I can sense some hop presence lurking in the background. The taste is...ahhh. Very very tasty. Big roasted malt followed almost immediately by some dark chocolate, some coffee, some sweet/milk chocolate maybe caramel malt? that gave this Stout an overall sweetish but not too sweet overall flavour, some toffee, some dark fruit when I swish it in my mouth, a slight tartness in the background that I'm guessing comes from the hops. Wow. This baby is complex to the max but...it's so smooth and easy drinking(it's off the charts in my book) that it's scary. I love a good dry Stout and, though this definitely has some sweet notes to it, this one is pleasing me muchly. It's just shy of a full mouthfeel, the carbonation is on the light side but fits it to a tee, and it finishes with *that* dry, roasted malty goodness. What a brew! I can see why it is so highly regarded and sought after. I'm so happy I got a chance to try it so another thank you is in order to Tom!!

Harsh hops present in the beginning, and no finish to speak of. Light to medium-bodied, carbonated and sugary palate. A reasonably drinkable, but quite dull and uninteresting christmas brew. (2003 version was 4-3-3-2-7=1.9)
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;21.06.11:Tief schwarzes bier mit dunklen, brauner Schaum. Interessantes Aroma, zu finden sind Preiselbeere und leichte Apfelnoten. Diese setzen sich im Geschmack vor, gepaart mit Trockenfrüchten und leichte Röstnoten. Allerdings recht zurückhaltend. Das Mundgefühl ist weich und cremig mit wenig Co2. Sehr interessantes und leckeres Bier
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;Didn’t know this was retired. Had this some years ago on a trip to the Czech Republic had a liter stein of this after pints at U Flecku. My last beer on tap before we left for Munich on a night train. I didn’t think I was going to find this beer as it wasn’t even for sale at the very large Testco. Thought the beer was outstanding. Page 182 of Michael Jackson’s Great Beer Guide only 299 out of 500 Classics Brews to go.
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;(Bottle 50 cl) One of the first dark, Czech lagers on the Danish market but later retired - and retired altogether. Believe it has been substituted with a Urquell Dark these days. Velvety softness with a licorice-like dryness not that different from dry Irish stout. But stronger and more fullbodied. Surprisingly strong ABV. An excellent dark.
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;Well, well, well... just another dark beer... I still have to wait to find one I will like..
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;A dry burnt chocolately mouthfeel. LAcking in the hop prsence of most of its countrymen but a great beer. Bring on the black bread and herring.
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;This is one of the most typecasted Schwarzbiers, dry fullbodied and a roasty burnt coffee palate a perfect companion to food.
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;Very dark color, burnt flavour, average bitterness. This makes very interesting taste. Not bad, indeed.
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;Roasted, burnt flavour. Quite bitter. Nice beer!............................
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;Dark brown. Medium bodied, roasty, velvetty mouthfeel. Rather dry. Well balanced.
Purkmistr;Domazlice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Domazlice;Excellent ! Not as sweet as most Czech dark beers. Nice aroma, reminds me of coffee. Hard to think of anything negative.
Tides Full Scale Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;"Well it was ok. I would call it a pale, with not much going on, which is unfortunate. Sweet beer, slightly bitter, lots of citrus going on. BTW; If you happen to make it to Gig Harbor hit the Tides Tavern, it's a great place."
Tides Full Scale Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;I didn't much enjoy drinking this beer which means I can't rate it very high, but in retrospect it wasn't that bad. Nice floral aroma. Quite perfumey. My initial impression was that it was quite bitter, but it wasn't just hoppy floral. They have better stuff on tap than this, I wouldn't waste my time trying it again.
Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Shipyard Brewing Company;Darker Belgian pour with fast creamy thin head. Smell is a little mossy. Creamy malty darker sweeter tasting thing. Almost cloying at times. Thicker malty bitter stuff. Certainly has a darker celtic side to it. Could only do one. Does not hide alky well. Mouth coating malt. Down thar wit Gray Irish Great Lakes Conway’s Irish Ale Samuel Adams Irish Red Ale Ohio Brewing Double Irish Red Carlow O’Hara’s Irish Red & Flying Bison Aviator.

Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Shipyard Brewing Company;Normal and quite thin. Not bad but nothing special to comment. Quite like an ale more like a regular craft brew.
Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Shipyard Brewing Company;Reddish brown pour. Some caramel and slight dough. Malts and hops. Ok unspectacular.
Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Shipyard Brewing Company;(12oz bottle, Virginia USA) Aroma: decent nose, malt, roasted/toasted, chocolate, melted butter, some herbalness. Appearance: good looking beer, relatively dark, reddish amber-brown, good off-white head that dissipates pretty quickly, frothy/foamy. Taste: chocolate, tobacco, smokey, nice bittering hop flavor, not too bold, a bit soft/light in the middle, but ok follow thru. Hint of vanilla. Palate: dry, solid bitterness, relatively sparkly, some oiliness. Overall: a good, drinkable beer with solid (but not over the top) bitterness and flavor. Balanced and enjoyable. [update after follow-on tasting: The complexity and layers of flavor from the different malt/hops are very good. This a noteworthy beer]
Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Shipyard Brewing Company;BBD 11/30/15. Pours a beautiful clear dark ruby. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of toasted biscuit over a touch of caramel. Underneath is a subtle sweetness that hints of molasses. Very little earthy hop presence. Light medium body that is smooth and has a touch of creamy texture. Perfect carbonation with a nice effervescent burst in the middle and a prickly rollicking finish. The outstanding flavor profile is balanced, very complex and somewhat intense. It begins with toasted malt that flows into a light caramel that has a burned sugar quality. While never really sweet, the middle becomes mildly bitter and rather herbal. The finish is a slow slightly bitter and dry fade of charred grain and herbal hops.
Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Shipyard Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from Total Wine and More The Irish Ale pours a dark amber with a small off white head and no lacing.

Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Shipyard Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Not-quite-mahogany brown that looks slightly red until you hold it up to the light, at which point it looks quite red. Tan head is quickly gone with very little lacing. Nutty malty aromas. Not sweet, but a tad caramely. Very little hop aroma. Eh, smells like a red ale. Nutty malts first and foremost. Not a lot going on. Just the same as the smell. It’s not a bad flavor, it’s just not much flavor. Not as thin as I expected, which is nice. Even if there isn’t much flavor, there’s some body to remind you that you’re drinking something. Goes down easy, that’s for sure. I finished this before I knew it, so I guess it can’t be bad. I just barely noticed I was drinking a beer.
Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Shipyard Brewing Company;Pours deep red/brown amber. Quickly disappearing head and some lacing.

Bar Harbor Thunder Hole Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Atlantic Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 11/12/2018. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red, light copper/brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread dough/crust, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, peach, plum, pear, apricot, and red apple; with lighter notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, herbal, wood, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. A bit too fruity/yeasty aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, brown bread dough/crust, toasted biscuit, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red apple, herbal, wood, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery, roasted bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread dough/crust, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, fruit, herbal, wood, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp finishing. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol for 5.8%. Overall this is a very good English brown ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth, easy, and fairly crisp to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish; and despite the over-carbonation. Well rounded malt complexity, balancing earthy hops, and restrained fruity yeast. A very enjoyable offering, and well made style example. Just a bit too yeasty overall."
Bar Harbor Thunder Hole Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Atlantic Brewing Company;12 oz bottle bought in Bar Harbor, Maine.

Bar Harbor Thunder Hole Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Atlantic Brewing Company;Richer and thicker than a normal brown. But mostly boring like a regular brown. Liked the Acadia park thunder hole better than the beer.
Bar Harbor Thunder Hole Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Atlantic Brewing Company;Bottle market district. Best by 9/2016. Sweet malty nose. Nose is there right after you pop it. Dark brown almost black it seems. Whew, a friendly tart dark tasting beer. Initially better than expected. Yes, looks good and tastes pretty good too with its charcoally flavors n that backed by that slight tartness. The alky is not overpowering, its there but just enough to let you know its presence. Grows on you. Could drink a couple of these. Almost comes across as a porter or lighter stout in character. Yea, I think this is a little more than a brown ale. You know, in the end, I find the carbonation is simply enjoyable, refreshing & sizzling. Low hopes with a fine finish. Pretty good stuff.
Bar Harbor Thunder Hole Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Atlantic Brewing Company;This ale poured a deep amber colour with a big, creamy, tan coloured head. A little lacing.

Mauldons Dickens;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mauldons;Really really outstanding beer here in a bar i didnt even know existed. Aoma is super citrus grassy hops. Taste is similar pale malts add a small sweetness to help balance but this stuff is serious hop juice. My rating then goes on to rate the girls behind the bar: Giood friendly and reasonably good looking bar staff who seem to like me talking to them, all female...
Artisans Brasseurs Ma Chouette Petite Chope Ma Rousse;Namur, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Les Artisans Brasseurs/Brasserie Mibrana;Orange colour, poor head. Some sweetness and a good balance, but also a sourness noticeable in the aroma/flavour/palate, too often recurrent for this brewery.
Artisans Brasseurs Ma Chouette Petite Chope Ma Brune;Namur, Belgium;Dubbel;Les Artisans Brasseurs/Brasserie Mibrana;Dark amber colour, poor head. Nice malt aroma and quite good malt body, with a very light and really pleasant roasted malt note, nutty. Ordinary palate. Much more enjoyable than Ma Rousse.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;Poured into a mug, the appearance was a murky brown color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a decent pace. Stringy sliding lace. The aroma had some roasted nuts, light caramel/toffee malts up front and then had some sweet cherry wood coming out as it warmed. Light toast and then some butterscotch softened the edges. Light earthy hops. The flavor blended all of the previously mentioned aromas together for the most part and lightly touched the aftertaste. Finish is malty and lenient on the cherry wood. Seemed more like cherry sweetness on the finish. The feel was about medium bodied and punching the carbonation with a little bit of those earthy hops I smelled earlier. ABV felt as projected. Overall, nicely done brown ale worthy of having again.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;Muddy colored ale with slightly nutty aftertaste. Turns sweeter but finishes drab. Unremarkable.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;i’m not sure what the goal of the acme line is. i love north coast and several of their beers...it’s like the brewmaster at north coast had a little brother that needed a job, so he gave him the acme beers. this on, like all of em, are pretty boring. standard brown, nothing special.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;This brown is different from most browns in that it has an English flair. The malt and hops are English and mellow, but they have added some fruit essences that change the profile somewhat. This is a good beer that strays from the style.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;Medium brown pour, tan head. Nuts, light milk chocolate, some bready notes. Again, not much to write home about.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;Bottled. Amber colour with a small white head.

Balanced, but not that exciting.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;I found it didn’t have a lot of flavour, though it certainly wasn’t unpleasant. I much prefer the red Seal from North coast. Bottle in Taipei, Taiwan
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;It’s beer! This is a quiet little brown ale, and it is smooth, has a nice tight little head on it, and has a touch of mellow malt, and just a little bitter coming down. Sweet, kind hearted, and better than Newcastle with more up-front flavor.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;Decent malts and smooth, its not the most flavorful brown ale but it wasn’t bad.
Acme California Brown Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Brown Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;Brownish pour. Taste is slightly roasted malt. Taste is very watery, some malts. Rated 2/11/03

Anchor Old Foghorn Ale;San Francisco, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);It pours deep amber with slight clouding. It has an off white head with low head retention. It has a strong malt and fruit character to start with in the aroma. There are notes of dried cherries and toffee. There are marmalade elements to it with alcohol that is noticeable. It is sweet initially with plenty of malt from toffee to some bread. The dried cherry flavors are also strong with some marmalade and low sherry like qualities. It is full bodied with a fairly high level of bitterness to it. The alcohol is noticeable but not hot. Overall, it has strong malt flavors with fruit and is sweet, but not getting into the cloying arena.

Anchor Small Beer;San Francisco, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Large bottle in 2012. Clear mid golden with a thin white head. Aroma of grassy hops, slight herbal and floral notes and bready malt. Quite crisp, with a decent flavour, even if there’s not much depth. Easy drinking.
Anchor Small Beer;San Francisco, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);"This is a little tough to review, because I feel is probably better than the ratings show. Yeah, it's a watered down ""light"" beer, but for a light beer has some decent flavor and mouthfeel. My father-in-law talks about ""Combat coffee"" from the old military days...where they take the used coffee grinds from the first batch and make a 2nd batch of coffee. This sounds about like the same idea. My first small beer, so I would say about what I expected. Would I get again for this price?....probably not, but sometimes these low alchohol brews allow you to taste the malty flavors more. I would consider this if they had it in 6-packs for something like $6....as daytime or lawnmower beer."
Anchor Small Beer;San Francisco, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Bottle from old backlog notes.

Anchor Small Beer;San Francisco, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);"(Backlog 2014 Midwest tour recollected for completeness in tranquility). 650ml buddel, CHI hotel. Bref: earthy tealeaf bitterness remains on dried/spent caramels in this sparted ""Orval Vert"" version of Anchor Steam, an all-time favourite. Like the Lady Grey dregs in the teapot, watery remains of something basically lovely and well-quenching."

Deep orange colour on the body, clear, with a tall and thick white head on top,very good retention. Weird aroma, with cheesy notes, toffee, caramel and hay.

Atlantic SOB Special Old Bitter Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Atlantic Brewing Company;This is a backlog rating from 2007 from a bottle shared by Tmoney99, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are toasted pale and crystal malts, caramel, earthy and herbal hops.
Atlantic SOB Special Old Bitter Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Atlantic Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance had a hazy dark brown body with a foamy tan half finger white head that lasts for about a good minute. The body is too hazy for any carbonation to be seen rising and there is minimal lacing. The smell had bitter hops up front with a light bit of malts with an even lighter sense of molasses. The taste was a slight malty sweetness combined nicely with the bitter hops. A slight breadiness comes through as well. On the palate, it sat at/about a medium on the body. The carbonation is felt and seems to absorb some of the creaminess coming through, dry aftertaste and finish. Overall, I do like this. I like how a lot more hops come than most ESB’s I’ve had, and the malts are not necessarily subdued but has a certain strength in it. I would definitely get it again.
Atlantic SOB Special Old Bitter Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Atlantic Brewing Company;Bottle I shared around the campsite at BCTC. Pours a hazed amber with a thin to medium sized tanned beige head. Soft malt, cocoa, light bitterness right away. Sweet and lightly floral. Sweet, bitter and malty. Long bitterness, lots of malt and toast.
Atlantic SOB Special Old Bitter Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Atlantic Brewing Company;Caramel, fruit, and pine in the aroma. Flavor starts bready, then finishes with some grassy, pine hops. This tastes halfway between an ESB and an IPA, but it’s really good.

Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red/brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, roasted nuts, brown bread dough/crust, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, raisin, plum, fig, pear, red apple, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness.

Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, fairly sticky, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is a delicious English brown ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great rich and well rounded English malt complexity; with restrained fruity English yeast, and balancing earthy hops against sweetness. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."

Blue Ridge (MD) Hopfest Brown Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Another fine Blue Ridge showing for only 1.40 per single. Poured a somewhat clear brown color with a very nice head and great lacing. The aroma was nutty and light roasted malts with some hop presence. The flavor was hoppy, reminded me a little bit of Moose Drool, and balanced by nutty and roasted malts (some light chocolate in there).

Blue Ridge (MD) Hopfest Brown Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);What is this beer hopped, like fifteen times? Exceedingly bitter brown ale with a dry, lasting finish. Moderately tempered by a brown sugar sweetness. So many brews are listed “Brown Ales” and so many have remarkably different characteristics that it may be time to start breaking down the category into more specific segments. It’s a long way between this and Newcastle.

Brimstone Big Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Bottled in October 1998. 12 oz bottle generously given to me by beastiefan2k. Pour is a murky brown with copper, with a smallish light tan head. Very unfiltered looking. Aroma is brown sugar, some fruit sweetness and caramel malt. Taste is sweet malt, some apple, honey, and grassiness. The fruit sweetness is the main story. Palate is unfiltered, medium bodied, lingering cloying sweet in the finish. This held up well. Interesting, thanks Eugene.
Brimstone Big Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Bottle from Ughsmash. Murky mahogany, decent white head. Aroma is full of sour cherry, hints of vinegar, faint caramel. Flavor much the same, with some paper/oxidation in the finish. While it’s obviously past it’s prime, somewhat surprised.
Brimstone Big Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Courtesy of Styles Bottle: The aroma consists of cherry, caramel, vinegar, and sour notes. It pours a cloudy brownish-orange with a small off-white head that quickly fades to a thin film and ring. The favor starts with a quick dose of caramel. It finishes with sour cherry, vinegar, and light oxidation. Doesn’t come across as a barley wine at all. Medium bodied with somewhat lively carbonation.
Brimstone Big Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);In the bottle on 11/13/09. Thanks to Dave G. for the beer. Pours a chestnut color with a thin white head. Caramel with a model car cement aroma. At this point in the ten-year old bottle, the malt seems to be gone from the beer. The hops are also gone. This is much more like an old ale than it is a barleywine. The beer is clearly past its prime so my entry essentially represents beer archaeology. It still has a finish of big ethanol on the roof of your mouth. At this juncture I’d have to say it is really good but not great. I wish I’d tried this beer in its prime.
Brimstone Big Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);(Bottle, thanks to hopscotch!) Pours dark shimmering red. The aroma is quite oxidized with tones of cherries, massive caramel, juicy dried fruits and floral honey. Some old hops and wet cardboard. The flavour is medium sweet with tones of caramel, dried fruits, firey alcohol, wet cardboard and honey. The mouthfeel is numbing from the alcohol and a bit sticky. Honey and dried fruits in the finish. Medium to full bodied. Bit simplistic but enjoyable.
Brimstone Big Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);12 oz. bottle (Oct. 1999) from Cletus. Pours a mostly clear reddish copper brown with very little head and some floaties. The aroma has over ripe fruit, sweet malts, some alcohol with signs of oxidation (not as much as I would have thought). The bottle said it would continue to improvve with age for up to 10 years. Am I one year too late? The flavor has, in fact, held up pretty well. There is a nice moderately sweet malt presence, ripe fruits, warming alcohol and a surprising dry and mildly bitter finish. There signs of oxidation were not as much as I expected there would be. I would have liked to have tried this one closer to its release.
Brimstone Big Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Bottled - vintage 1998.

A very decent, malty, but well-hopped ale. Nice malt profile. I always liked the gimmick of stone brewing. A medium-bodied, inexpensive, cool and gimicky delight... in it's day. Time to retire this one, guys
Brimstone Stonebeer;Easton, Maryland, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);This one was a surprise, some non-beer geel friends brought it over for a cookout. I had always been leery of it, typically gimmick beers suck. Well it turned out to be OK, not great but OK. Decent hoppy flavors with good malt body and carmelly flavors. I have not seen it in years and asume that it is gone forever.
Brimstone Stonebeer;Easton, Maryland, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);"Great if you can find it anymore. If you get past the hype of an ""old technique"" you get to taste a truly unique ale> Don't know if it is the brewer (now gone from Frederick) or the hot stones. Yes, there is a delicious toffee sweetness to this ale."
Brimstone Stonebeer;Easton, Maryland, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);A moderate hop flavor, followed by a caramel flavor. Very interesting. Try it if you can find it.
Brimstone Stonebeer;Easton, Maryland, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);This is an ale brewed differently from any you’ve tried before. The label claims it to be a “resurrection of an early brewing technique used in the days before iron kettles.” Super-heated stones are dropped into the wort, as they were when wooden vessels could not be heated by fire. The hot stones carmelize sugars and release toffee-like flavors into the beer. The resulting brew resembles a pale ale, possibly even an IPA, as it is out of balance toward hops rather than malt. Crisp and delicious.
Brimstone Stonebeer;Easton, Maryland, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);This beer is worth trying just for the ad hype alone. Great label showing a devil-cat jumping over a volcano. According to the bottle, in ancient times before the use of metal kettles to brew beer, hot rocks were dropped into the wort to heat it and caramelize the sugars, and this beer revives the practice. Nice, light hoppy aroma, with a front well balance between sweet and hoppy. The middle was quick and the end clean, with a delayed hoppyness kicking in. Fairly assertive, almost too much so.
Brimstone Stonebeer;Easton, Maryland, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Wonderful malt characteristics. Rich, caramel flavor with a nice and sweet aftertaste. Fine beer.

Atlantic Brother Adams Honey Bragget Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Atlantic Brewing Company;1 pint 6 fl oz bottle. Pours a clear amber with a small beige head. Aromas are honey, toffee, molasses, and oak. Tastes are lightly sweet honey, wood, raisin, and some alcohol. Full body, medium carbonation with a long oaky and warming alcohol finish. Not a big fan of barley wine but they’ve done a good job masking the massive 11.8% abv.
Atlantic Brother Adams Honey Bragget Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Atlantic Brewing Company;Brought back to me from Maine by a new friend, this is a 10.5% 2015 edition. This is my first Bragget so It’s hard to judge. I am judging it the best I can based on Barley Wine experience. Super interesting, this ale is a must for fans of Bourbon. It’s what hits you first and foremost and clings on until the bittersweet end. There is no doubt that this beer is for special occasions, mine being moving a huge couch into a small second-story apartment...no small task. This beast is somehow both clear and cloudy at once, reddish brown and destroying any chance of forming a lasting head. In the nose is bourbon, vanilla, oak, fig, toffee, coconut, honey, brown bread, cherries.... all caramelised to the max. The taste matches perfectly and warms to the core with only one swig. There is only enough bitterness and alcohol to keep this from being to sweet but it does it’s job astonishingly. Slick and thick is the texture as bourbon, coconut and dark fruitcake send this softly carbonated beer down my throat. A magnificent creation for those who know what to look for.

Atlantic Brother Adams Honey Bragget Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Atlantic Brewing Company;An interesting yet intense honey beer.

Redhook Sunrye;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);2007: Looks like your average B/M/C fare. Light piss-yellow. Only difference is a full half finger of head. Transparent, light carbonation. No lace. Scent is a three-headed monster of wheat, orange and ale. Not like a witbier. Light but nice. Orange/wheat combo dominates. Nice ale flavor with wheat and orange bringing up the rear. It’s an ale first, but with a dash of a wit. Light and fruity. Feels thicker than an ale. Less light than it looks. An ale with some extras. Sweet but based in sweet/yeast beer. Refreshing.
Redhook Sunrye;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);12oz bottle from BevMo.

Redhook Hoptoberfest;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Nice, rich, malty brew.

Redhook Hoptoberfest;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Honestly, I can’t seem to put my finger on this style no matter how hard I try. I mean, I can’t tell you what makes a good one and what makes a crappy one. I did like this beer, though, for reasons I cannot quite put into words. The Oktoberfest is officially MY ARCH NEMISIS OF BEER. EACH YEAR, WHEN THE FIRST CHILL OF AUTUMN CAN BE FELT IN THE WARM SUMMER AIR, I WILL SHUDDER AND CRINGE AND VOW THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE THE VERY LAST THAT I WILL BOW DOWN TO THIS MENACE OF A BEER STYLE! October 05... I WILL BE VICTORIOUS!
Redhook Hoptoberfest;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"I am guessing this is the same ""Oktoberfest"" I had. Very roasty aroma . Quite sweet with brown sugar and caramel malts in the nose. Smells good. Transparent orange copper honey color with an off-white head. Malty, buttery, and somehwhat roasty start. Middle is way too thin. Finish is too hopped for the style. Cascade, piney hops to finish. Way off."
Redhook Hoptoberfest;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Copper Coloring. With Good Off-White Head. It Has a Good Balanced Aroma...but the Taste is More Hops. Sweet. Watery Overall.. If it Had More Malt Presence, it May be a Decent Brew.
Redhook Hoptoberfest;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Amber color with a medium head. Odd aroma of malt and hops, not your usual blend. Fairly dry taste from the hops. They are not as present as the hops in a Pale, but they are enough to say ""Hi, how ya doin?"" I really don’t want this kind of presence in my Oktoberfest."
Wyders Dry Apple Cider;Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Wyder's Cider;bottle - This cider smells of tart green apples. The flavor is sweet, light, and refreshing. It’s too thin. I didn’t find it as sweet as the typical Woodchuck cider. That’s a good thing. It’s decent but that’s about it.
Wyders Dry Apple Cider;Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Wyder's Cider;"""pretty par for the course...meaning average at best. nice if you’re a big apple lover, otherwise, it’s nothing special. doesn’t do anything unexpected, good or bad."""

Wyders Dry Apple Cider;Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Wyder's Cider;"Bottle to half-pint glass (shared with the Mrs.). Looks solid; a transparent light (almost clear) gold with soft carbonation. Smells and tastes of apples. Average on the palate. A bit sweet for a dry cider."

Wyders Dry Apple Cider;Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Wyder's Cider;Light aroma. Mainly apple. The first sip and aftertaste had bad qualities of a cheap, stale beer coming up rather than going down...? A sour tart taste. Very drinkable. Very sweet. Lots of sugar.
Wyders Dry Apple Cider;Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Wyder's Cider;Gold pour, white head. Apples, yeast, and a slight artificial sweetneer aroma and flavor. Easy enough to drink, but not good enough to drink more of.

Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Stuck into the variety case that I had to buy at Uncle John’s cond - Always have to buy by the case up there, so I look for the variety packs. The most interesting thing is the lemony zest. Palate is zingy, which is ok for a light summer brew to drink by the lake. Very light.
Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Pocono Light is part of the variety case available in PA. For seventeen bucks its not a bad deal. I hate when a light beer is put in a mixed case, but my girl volunteered to drink the Light’s. Doughy aroma, and the taste of bubble gum stuck on a piece of wet cardboard. Not my cup of tea, but my girl enjoyed the Pocono Light. She also drank a three year old Zima after having one so that should tell you where her palate was that night.
Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;OK, I did it - I tried a light beer. It was part of a sample case and i figured, for the sake of science, what the heck. Welp, it didn’t kill me, and it was OK, at first. Faint malt / herbal aroma. Unfortunately, malt in flavor is overtaken by a cornshuck taste and drinkability faded as it warmed.
Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with hopdog, thanks Steve!) Another pale lager, another sweet, corn-flavored beer. Minimal hops or bitterness here, so it goes down like water. And like many other pale lagers I’ve tried, the finish is short lived and thin. It has that sweet, grain, corn, honey nose that you smell so often in this style of beer. Pale yellow color is about as pale as you can get. Small, white head fades away to a very tiny rim, leaving a few spots of lace on the glass. Minimal flavor, minimal alcohol, so what’s the point? Whatever....
Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;"Light version of an average beer. I figured ""i might as well"" just because I’m trying to have one of every single of the 600 or so beers at Circle Liquors"
Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;I know light beers aren’t supposed to be full bodied and usually don’t have rich taste, but this stuff has no body and no taste. I can’t even really describe it, so I will just reccommend you go drink something else. This is too bad, because Pocono has some other decent varieties.
Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Clear yellow gold. FIzzy, foamy white head. Sickeningly sweet nose, which follows through on the palate which is all adjunct and gross stuff. Light body, light in gross flavor, and just plain old boring.
Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Terrible malt beverage, tastes like runoff from a 40 of Colt45. It had more flavor than most light beers for sure, but all bad.
Pocono Light;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Pours pale gold. Aromas of hops, yeast, corn. Not much taste. Finishes fairly crisp, smooth, and watery, with some hops at the end.

DAB Strong;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);(bottle) Pale golden colour with sticky white foam. As brewed with Australian “Pride of Ringwood” hops it has actually a very hoppy aroma, very herbal and grassy and not too gentle. The flavour is very bitter with a hoppy and tart aftertaste.

DAB Original;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Found this beer at a beer 'mega-store' in Warwick, Rhode Island, USA. It was inexpensive, came in a four pack of 16oz. cans, so I figured I'd try it....hey, it's German, so it has to be decent. I liked this beer right away...smooth, but with flavor, a nice head to it, and very easy and tasty beer to drink. For a price of $5.00 it was a bargain. It's great on a hot day when you want a somewhat light beer that has a real beer taste.

Mild aroma of grains, straw, malts and noble hops. Taste follows aroma. Malty, grainy, slightly sweet and spicy. Low on hops. Medium to strong carbonation.

Golden, clear, head with lace. OK, this is drinkable, but boring, but it is also the beer that started the this boring style. Not too sweet from ABV and from the loss of hopping, but quite balanced. Just not so 2010’s.

Dortmunder Kronen Classic;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Lighter version of the famed Kronen Export and a bit dryer. Thick, creamy, stable head, light golden blond colour, clear. Gentle but confident aroma of clean pale mals and flowery and soapy, aromatic hops. Pale malts taste, bit of hay, flowery hoppy finish. Very typical Dortmunder and not much difference in quality compared with Kronen Export.

Es kennzeichnet sich durch eine schöne Pilsfarbe; co2 ist etwas dünn, der Schaum cremig. Der Geruch ist keksartig und erinnert an einen Tortenboden. Antrunk fein perlig. Die Mitte kommt mit Hopfen und etwas Malz daher. Die Bitternote ist allerdings etwas aufdringlich. Abgang fein herb. So richtig einordnen konnte ich das Classic noch nie. Irgendwie steht es in der Mitte vom Pils und Export aus gleichem Hause. Trotzdem: Es zählt zu den angenehmen Dingen im Leben.Test vom 14.11.2006, Gebinde: Glasflasche"

Dortmunder Kronen Classic;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);"Vintage bottle purchased at The Stuffed Sandwich, May 2007 This beer pours with an almost clear, dullish amber color. It is almost perfectly still and has no head at all. Aromas of honey-like, aged malt, sherry, raisins, prunes and a really accentuated dark fruit character make up the nose. The beer is still quite sweet, despite the age; in fact the oxidation character may have even accentuated the sweetness. This beer has some really interesting aged flavors to it; notes of sherry, port, prunes, raisins, dusty cocoa, and an almost soda like quality (a mix of cream soda along with a hint of cola). This has quite a light mouthfeel, with lots of the heft having dropped out over time. There is a rich, nutty taste here as well. I am really finding the flavors in this clearly aged beer really interesting. I would not have guessed it would have lasted this long; it has morphed into something that is quite flavorful (perhaps even more so than it was initially) without the cardboard-tasting oxidation I would have expected."
Hansa Pils;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Riecht eigenartig. Im Antrunk viel zu viel Kohlensäure, bitter.

Beetje een romig biertje zoals me zwager terecht stelt. Dat merk je ook aan de vrij zachte schuimkraag die dun op het bier blijft liggen. Ruikt overall wat naar zoetige mout. Redelijk doordrinkbaar standaard lager pils lager met een redelijke bitter. Het haalt niet bij Heineken maar maar past zoals nu goed bij een pizza. Origineel glas

Hansa Pils;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);I found this bottle after a long walk in Paris, at the tanta emmen in Paris, Saint-Martin market, best before 04/2018. In my point of view, it is a ordinary pils, nothing sexy but it makes the job to become refresh, like the bottle and the English to India, at the difference that an IPA has more taste. The color is yellow/gold, normal carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste has this typical side of hop for pils, bitterness but not so heavy for the style, malt, watery and dry.

Hansa Export;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Has not the best reputation (at least where I come from) to be cheap and thus good to get drunk (an nothing else).

Felsgold Premium Pilsener;Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Metro Group (Metro, Real, Makro);Thanks to Matthias for the can! Pours clear golden with a small, unstable, frothy, white head. Aroma of corn syrup, grain, industrial bread, yeast, maize.

Too industrial.

Horror 1-ambience venue, but it has a freaking tick! Nutty bready aroma. Mushroomy nutty taste. Fullish palate considering it’s cold. and carbonation not too offensive. A bit muted, but fairly characterful. Not bed for macro. Anna had this the previous day: Aroma has slightly husky grains and very little else. The beer is mahogany with a smallish off-white head. A bit fizzy, and there’s a little of the carbonic acid in the finish. Served cold and gains a little woodiness as it warms. Competently made but boring."

Clarissen Alt;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);(on tap at Hoppy´s Treff, Holzwickede) The fact, that legendary defence player Dieter “Hoppy” Kurrat of Borussia Dortmund - one of the heroes of the European Cup Championship of 1966 (finally against F.C. Liverpool) - tapped this brew personally for me, doesn´t make it better. Dark brown colour with a reddish shade and a small frothy white layer. Not much aroma except some toasted malts. Medium bitter flavour, toastmalty taste and a (retronasal) skunky bitter and thin finish. The nice swing top bottles are not available anymore as far as I know. One can get it still on tap in a few pubs in and around Dortmund, but better stay away from this bland and boring Alt, except for rating reasons of course.
Clarissen Alt;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Dark copper color. Slightly metallic apple and caramel aroma and flavor.

Clarissen Alt;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottled. Nut brown. Very rich head. Sweet and lightly roasty. Offputting vegetable finish. Ohhh. So this was a Binding beer? That explains the lousy quality...
Clarissen Alt;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);My least favorite of the four alts I had in dusseldorf.

Indianapolis Duesseldorfer Amber Ale;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Indianapolis Brewing Co.;12oz bottle (Old Notes-Dubuque Brewing)-Pours a medium amber with a small head. Aroma of malt and caramel. Taste of the same. This light to medium bodied brew is not that good.
Indianapolis Duesseldorfer Amber Ale;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Indianapolis Brewing Co.;This brewery has been closed for some time, but I used to get this beer whenever I encountered it, which wasn't often. Its not really an American Amber - I never even realized it was an ale. It was definitely German in character, and I had thought of it as a Pre-Prohibition style amber lager. It was clean, fairly smooth, and rather drinkable. Not all that great in the end, but I do kinda miss it.

Great Lakes Rockefeller Bock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);My palate normally doesn’t enjoy these types of beers, but I actually liked this a lot.

Great Lakes Rockefeller Bock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Had this at Great Lakes brewpub. Great Bock. Nice dark redish gold color with a stong malty fruit, carmel flavors. Just like the commercial description, for once! I was very please with complexity of the hops and malt balance.

Very drinkable How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear light amber body with a medium beige head In long: Pleasant nose of earthy toasted malts.

Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;IPA;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pour is a clear amber with a large white head. Aroma is a faint whiff of hops with a caramel malt. Flavor is pretty much all caramel malt with a little hop bitterness at the end. One of those IPA's where 30 years ago this would have been groundbreaking but not it's just a sweet malt bomb with very little hop presence.
Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;IPA;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Bottle. Light amber color, clear. Clean, slightly hoppy aroma. Good, but not terribly impressive. Seems light on flavor for a heavier IPA.

Clear dark golden colour with an off-white head. Hoppy aroma, and s deeply satisfying taste of rich toffee and and caramel malts and pine resin hops.

Great Lakes Grand Cru;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Draft pout. Pours w hazy copper with a white head of foam. Aroma is spicy and sweet. Taste has a sweet orange taste to it. Overall, pretty nice.
Great Lakes Grand Cru;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);draft: spicy... but floral. It’s nice, a solid grand cru, but nothing that really blows me out of the water. Solid.
Great Lakes Grand Cru;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Draft at the brewery. Seemed like a witbier crossed with a Belgian ale and then someone amped up the alcohol a touch. Good if not remarkable.
Great Lakes Grand Cru;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at the source... Pours fairly similar to burning river, caramel orange brown and topped a soapy white head... Aroma of sweet crystal malt and Belgian yeast, dried fruit to pair up with the aforementioned. Sweet... Flavors are banana with sweet yeastiness and pale malt throughout. Medium bodied with medium level of carbonation. Not bad but not my style.
Great Lakes Grand Cru;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Draft at Dexters. Filtered looking orange-tan. Thin, oily white head. Hmm..this one is different. Creamy big Golden Ale, reminds me of Bier De Corsaire. Creamy, lots of smooth yeast notes. Could benefit form a more Belgian effervescence, as it is it’s a little undercarbonated. Orange-fruity yeast tones, all laced with alcohol and a faint Syrian-like bitterness. Solid beer, well done.
Great Lakes Grand Cru;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at the glbc tap room, poured into a pint glass A: orange amber color, slightly hazy, slight head with fair retention S: light citrus and spice notes, slight yeast and pepper T: well balanced beer with light caramized malt, citrus, and clove like pepperyness.

Great Lakes Grand Cru;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);This poured a hazy orange color with a a white head. Aroma was of strong belgian spice, aka coriander and orange peel, some yeast, and sweet candy sugar. Flavor was dominated with spice, not overly sweet like some belgians, and the alcohol is hidden very well too. Good example of the style.
Great Lakes Grand Cru;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Growler brought back by a friend. Pours a hazy gold with a medium off-white head. Banana and clove in the nose, but there is a peppery coriander characteristic that helps to mute those other notes along with some sweet malt. Peppery coriander flavor with sweet malt and a dry bitter finish. I didn’t really pick up on the orange, but still pretty good for a style I typically don’t go for.
Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"16 ounce can into signature pint glass, best before 4/3/2019. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep golden/amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough/crust, toasted biscuit, light honey/nutty, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hops/fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of big lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough/crust, toasted biscuit, light honey/nutty, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate pine, herbal, floral, woody, grassy, minty, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough/crust, toasted biscuit, light honey/nutty, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hops/fruity yeast notes; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and fairly crisp/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Slight lingering resins. Zero warming alcohol for 5.5%. Overall this is a delicious ESB. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hops/fruity yeast notes; very smooth and fairly crisp/refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Feels like Northern Brewer hops. Very clean and nicely rich English malt showcase, balancing earthy hops, and restrained fruity yeast complexities. A very enjoyable offering, and impressive spot on style example."

Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Unpleasantly bitter and tastes of dms. I've had this beer at the pub before and it was good.
Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);12 oz. bottle via local trade. 1999 vintage. Pours a hazed amber with almost no head but an off-white ring forming along the edge. It’s obviously oxidized and lacking in carbonation. Notes of tea, caramel, dust, earth, overripe fruit, and cardboard. Light-medium bodies, with an earthy, malty mouthfeel that finishes dry. This was the most-rated beer in Ohio I hadn’t had before, due to the fact it was bottled for so long and they stopped. I’ll rerate it next time I get to the brewpub but in the meantime, this old one actually isn’t drinking bad. UPDATE: This is now in 16 oz. cans and seeing wider distro. They originally bottled it, then made it a taproom exclusive, and now it's back in a new package. It's better than the crazy old one I had before, and is a pretty straightforward, well executed ESB. Caramel and toasted malts, earth, grass, tea, light florals. Light-bodied, modest carbonation. Good.
Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pours a pale copper with a white foam head.

Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);It has a large frothy white head that has very good retention and make great rings of lace with each sip. The body has a light honey color with a slight haze. The aroma is wonderful and well balanced. It has sweet bready malt with some buttery notes as well as some fruity notes and mild floral hops in the nose. The flavor matches the aroma with a solid malty base that brings buttery and fruity notes with perfectly balanced hop bitterness and flavor. Some of the fruity notes include elderberry and black currant and the hops give some floral and herbal notes to the party. The palate has a smooth silky texture with soft carbonation, a medium body and slow lightly bitter fading finish.
Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Moon dog floral and spice nose. Pale yellow sticky head. Taste is nice. Peppery honey with an effervescent finish.
Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Draft. real clear gold color with ample head. English malt and citrus hops. Flavor is mostly the same. Body is lots of bready malt with a weak fruity hop like note in the finish. This style in general doesn’t get me excited so.... I can’t really say anything other then it didn’t have much flavor to me. Maybe if you love ESB’s you will want to order a pint.
Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy orange brown with a super thick off-white head. Aroma of wort, grassy hops, pale malt. Flavor of light fruits, jam, pale malts, and bitter grassy hops in the finish. Easy drinking, lightly hopped, very tasty ESB. 7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)
Great Lakes Moondog Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall It was a pretty solid beer of the style. It was flavorful, easy drinking and well balanced.
High Falls India Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A great value for a fairly good IPA. Not as assertive in the malts or hops as most IPA's, but a well balanced and tasty representation nevertheless. Improves as it warms. A clean, crisp hop bitterness completes each swallow. Good stuff if you can find it.

Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;Pours a clear copper with a minimal white head. Faint earthy hop aroma. Tastes more like an hoppy pilsner or a weak pale ale, but as an IPA this just doesn’t cut it. It severely lacks any hop character any IPA should possess and not much else holds up very well in any other part of this brew. Must say my first offering from Casco Bay is a disappointing one.
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;This is Casco Bay IPA, from the Casco Bay 12er variety pack I just picked up in Western, MA. Not sure why I cant find it, but this seems close enough. Abv reads 5.75%, aroma is muddled soil, grass, and hay, overall a complex farm like musty ipa. head is large and forthcoming, very nice, and holds up nicely as the brew settles. Taste is not overaly hoppy, maybe a tad more than a pale ale, no realy hop bite, but for a sessionable ipa this one can gravatate towards enjoyment as its composure still carries a microbrew mentality. Color is burnt oragne and bronzed cheddar cheese. Mouth feel is medium/full and carriers thoughout. Overall i was hoping for more bite and hopfullness in this, but rathers its a mellow ipa that grows on you as its sipped. Not that bad, but not that great either.
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;"Bottle - Amber/brown in color with a good white head. Needs more hops; not nearly enough for a decent IPA. Decent drinking beer, but not sure I would buy again."
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;Thick, white, lasting head on a light amber body. Grassy, herbal hop aroma w/ a light caramel. Hoppy, burnt, roasted malt flavor w/ little fruitiness...very little. Seemingly well balanced, but a little too well for an IPA. Hop flavor is low and there's not much complexity. Bitterness is way to low for an IPA as well. This might work better as an American Amber if it had more crystal/caramel malt character. Body is watery, and it's over carbonated for IPA, as well as lacking alcohol. Again, this might work better as an American Amber.
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;Prett good IPA. Its fairly balanced for an IPA. Malty. Hops are almost pepperish. Bitter, dry finish.
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;Thick, foamy white head sits atop a yellow/brown, slightly cloudy color. Aroma is yeasty and hoppy, with a faint but distinctive note of black olive (I know, strange, but I definitely smell it). Flavor is smooth early on, with a hoppy midsection and a medium bitter finish. This is alright overall, but nothing particularly good. Could use some more malt perhaps, or maybe a little sweetness, to balance out the bitter finish.
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;Ugh. this one was very disappointing. Tasted like dirt and dirty laundry. some hop character, but overwhelmed by ickyness.
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;Hmmmm, I didn't like this one all too much. I think my bottle was a little old. Good aroma, nice color, but just a musty taste. Not nearly as good as some other people's experiences with this brew.
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;"(southern accent here please): i received a calling. yes i did. to provide the ratebeer sactified brethren with the first testimonial for this glorious IPA, praise be to bacchus! i bear the good news gospel that this is a kick ass, uh, i mean, most exalted beer. golden as the grail, some haze. upon tasting, i spoke a curious message in tongues, perhaps some member of the flock could translate: ""yubba dubba doooo""(okay, enough televangist) creamy white upholstery on top is plush and holds up to considerable wear and tear. loquacious aroma of grapefruit, bamboo (y'know, like stuff at the pier one), and yet even some bread notes emerge from a sound underlying malt structure. almost tart, lively carbonation, on the dry side, loooooong pleasing bitter finish. ace beer, one does suspect divine intervention."
Casco Bay Carrabassett IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Casco Bay Brewing;Had a few bottles of this IPA prior to warming up the grill. Pours a clear sparkling copper. The generous tight creamy off-white head is fully lasting with good lacing. The fresh clean nose is roasted malt, spicy resinous hops, and the smallest hint of dried fruit, and dough. The brew starts flowery with a moderate acidity and finishes with heavy bitterness. This ale has nice depth and complexity. The finish is long and very rich as I would expect from a good IPA. The medium body is both creamy and lively with a nice dry finish. Very well done.

Liefmans Frambozenbier;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);"Classic fruit beer based on ’oud bruin’, this one with raspberries, since 1985 but unfortunately discontinued when Moortgat took over the Liefmans brand - but I wouldn’t be surprised if it returns one day. Very fruity aroma of fresh, real raspberries and even a hint of raspberry bush, as in the best framboises made with lambic; the maltiness is nicely blended in as well as the woodiness and acidity. Great, elegant and complex beer, of the same profile as Liefmans Kriekbier (now Liefmans Cuvée Brut), just a bit sweeter and more fruit-dominated."

Petes Wicked Maple Porter;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Porter;Petes Brewing Company;I had this beer on a trip to the NE in 99(?) and it was ok.

Petes Wicked Maple Porter;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Porter;Petes Brewing Company;Had this beer on 7/10/1998. Color is a deep dark brown, with low carbonation and very light head. Aroma is the sweet scent of Maple syrup. Taste is rich with a sharp bitterness. It starts with a good medium body that right from the start brings on a smoke taste with light back tones of maple starting as it goes down. All of this builds a little stronger in the finish, which is filled with a sharp bitterness. The smokey maple flavor is a little to strong for me but the rest of this is ok.
Petes Wicked Maple Porter;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Porter;Petes Brewing Company;Very tasty. Sweet finish. full body with a nice dark brown colour. A bit of a malty taste.

SLO Blueberry Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;SLO Brew;Keg at the brewpub in SLO, 30/04/14. Clear golden amber with a moderate off white covering. Nose is blueberries, light spice, wheaten bread, sugary notes, berry fruit medley. Taste comprises much the same, pretty 1D stuff, blueberries, pale malt, straw, sweet notes. Medium bodied, light spritzy carbonation, crisp clean execution. Ok as fruit beers go, the carbonation level keeps it drinkableand stops it from getting sticky sweet, ideal beer on a tasting flight as I wouldn’t be looking for a whole lot more!

Saranac Maple Porter;Utica, New York, United States;Porter;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;had a few times and never rated the description said it well and i recall it seemed to have a bit of anise or licorice near the frothy sudsy hop burn.
Saranac Maple Porter;Utica, New York, United States;Porter;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice dark brown color ranging close to black. The head was small and quickly fading barely leaving any lacing. The smell had a large amount of maple up front (gently sweet) overpowering a light robust coffee/chocolate aroma trying to come out. The taste was balanced fairly nicely between the maple and the coffee/chocolate. On the palate, this one sat right at a medium on the body. I would say this was fairly sessionable. The carbonation was fairly subdued. Overall, this was a good maple Porter worthy of coming back again.
Saranac Maple Porter;Utica, New York, United States;Porter;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Its body has a brownish color with reddish amber highlights. It produced a light beige, two finger thick head. It is a slow fading head that fades down to a just a ring of lacy foam. Lacing on the glass is spotty and slick. There is a definite sweet maple syrup like aroma with a touch of toasted malt. It has a very sweet mix of thin toasted bready maltiness covered with maple flavored corn syrup. I also get some buttery notes as well. This flavor reminds me of a frozen waffle covered in a Log Cabin like breakfast syrup and butter. This one is all about the sweetness as there is only a very slight hint of leafy hops in the middle that tries in vain to add some bitterness. The finish has some maple sweetness and a bit more roasted maltiness fading off the tongue. With all this sweetness it is still fairly light on body and thin in texture. Carbonation is light as well and makes the thin texture somewhat slick. For me this beer is way too sweet. I can not help thinking that I should be putting this on pancakes or something. Drinkability for me is very low, as I couldn’t see drinking any more than one of these at a time.
Saranac Maple Porter;Utica, New York, United States;Porter;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;11/1/2009. Bottle from a sampler box. Poured dark mahogany with a tan head. Roasted malt aromas, dark fruit and spices. Flavors are a little sweet from the syrup, but this is not bad at all.

Saranac Maple Porter;Utica, New York, United States;Porter;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Mild roasted aroma, hint of molassis. Dark brown colour. Big stable light brown head. Sweet molassis flavour. Roasted syrup. Vinous finish. Drinkable, but not really good.
Saranac Maple Porter;Utica, New York, United States;Porter;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Ahh, Saranac, an old love. This seems to be the fraternal twin to the Caramel Porter, one of my first love beers. This is a good stab at basically the same beer. Pours with a slightly thicker white head and a decent lacing. Aroma hits you with a good, yet artificial, caramel and sweet maple sugar, but not too sweet. Flavor has even less sweetness than my nose detects. Porter behind it is unassuming and unoffensive, artificial character is tolerable. Sweet, dark beer, that is all.
Saranac Maple Porter;Utica, New York, United States;Porter;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Thanks JoeMcPhee. Malt with maple syrup aroma. Deep mahogany colour with a great tan head and lace. Malt, maple syrup goodness. Slight smoked roasted hints. Lovely beer with a great texture.
Saranac Maple Porter;Utica, New York, United States;Porter;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle from A-1 Liquor in Indianapolis. Part of a Winter Saranac mixed pack. Pours a cloudy brown color with a small beige head. Holy smokes, the maple syrup notes absolutely explode out of this one, all over the nose and flavor. Also slightly roasted caramel malts, brown sugar, some winter spices, toasted nuts. Light-medium bodied, with a sticky mouthfeel and low carbonation. Man, this is a sweet, sweet beer. Use caution.

Löwenbräu Original;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);Pours a clear golden yellow on tap with fluffy white foam that dissipates to leave moderate lace. Aroma of light herbal noble hop notes over pilsner malt with a touch of DMS and lager yeast. Taste follows, low bitterness with a touch of sweetness and the vegetal undermodified pilsner malt DMS.

Löwenbräu Original;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);"500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.2%. Shiny clear golden yellow. Decent head, in size and duration. Sweet grassy aroma. Moderate carbonation, feels well-judged. The ""well-judged"" theme runs throughout this beer - interesting to compare to the Spaten lager owned by the same company - that felt somewhat disparate and minimalist, this feels more holistic and minimalist. Here's a grassy, tangy (like citrus without the flavour) hop that melds seamlessly with a light, sweet malt, which at no point becomes sickly. A fine drinker's lager, albeit with little to no interest for the beer connoisseur besides perhaps a one-off tasting. Manages to hit that lager spot quite precisely, while assiduously avoiding the many duff notes of the style - no metal or sweetcorn-juice here, and if there's a slight spicy earthiness, it only serves to elevate the beer. Feels well-crafted, at least in the sense of the makers having had a certain focus on the palate (light, yet in the middle) and succeeding in hitting their mark. What does it really matter that they used hop extract to do it? It's funny how it crops up among the ingredients of certain company-owned brewer's beers, though...anyway, this is a simple but well-judged lager, hits the spot, a fine beer as well as a fine example of the style, although don't expect oodles of flavour. There's ""macro"" and there's ""macro"" - this is the good kind."

Nokian Laivuri III;Nokia, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nokian Panimo;Quite good, fresh and fruity with some taste to it. It seems to be made by Nokian Panimo for Oulun Juomatukku, so I guess it’s quite close to Laivuri or even the same.

Belfast Bay Port Authority Pale Ale;Belfast, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Belfast Bay Brewing Co;Ok, now when I drink a pale ale, I expect a hop flavor. This beer had a really mellow hop flavor, and what seems to be way to much carbonation. I can normally pour a beer without a head, I poured about 2 inches of this beer into my pint glass and had about 5 inches of foam. Once I got it poured though, it was a light, clean, crips flavor that did go down really well. It washed down a meal quite well. Oh, and I have only seen this in 1pt6fl. oz bottles. I love 22oz beers.
BackAlley NightStalker Alt;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;BackAlley Brewing;Had this beer on 3/9/1998. Color is a rich amber brown with a nice carbonation and good head. Aroma is a rich malt scent with very little hop tone in it. As for taste, it’s a smooth drinkable beer with a slightly sharp nip on the end that lets you know it is there. It starts with a malty medium body then goes down fairly smooth, having only the slightest bite, and finishes clean leaving you with a mild yet sharp bitterness

BackAlley Aleopelli Red Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;BackAlley Brewing;Too bad BackAlley is not readily available in NJ. This is the best red I've had to date. Its color is striking, and its flavor is bursting with RED!!!
BackAlley BeerGoggles IPA;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;BackAlley Brewing;Had this beer on 2/25/1998. Color is a rich red shade with nice carbonation and a good head. The aroma is a sweet caramel malt scent with slight hop back tones. Taste comes on with a strong bitter taste that is balanced well with a good malty body. It starts off with an almost creamy body then goes down crisp. The finish is where most to the flavor is, the creamy body leaves you with a nice malt taste and a big bold bitterness that is just right.
BackAlley BeerGoggles IPA;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;BackAlley Brewing;ok, two VERY different opinions here. i thought this was one of the worst IPA's i've had...had a nice color to it, but ZERO head. and the aroma wasnt that bad, but the taste was too bitter..anyway, maybe my tastes are less experienced than that of others, but this is an IPA i wont try again.

Nokian Tumma Kommodori 4.5;Nokia, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Nokian Panimo;from old notes Tight tan froth on a cloudy mahogany beer. Nutty, bready and lightly smoky nose containing a scattering of woodsy hops. Tastes of dark bread and walnuts prior to a cocoa dryness and un unexpectedly bright, grassy finish. Small and slick with prickling carbonation. Too bright and eager this time. 50 cl can, best before March 2009. 50cl can, bbe 05/06/2008. Dark brown hue with red highlights. Fizzy, tan head is short lived. Sweetish aroma of toffee and buttered rye toast with honey. Slightly peppery, cola-like edge. Nutty, round and sweet flavour with a hint of toasted marshmallows. A bit brushy, woollen with the hops...peppery even. Medium-light bodied, velvety textured, fizzy carbonation. Left me wanting the flavour and aroma to be bigger or more nuanced.

Pours a slightly hazed gold with a thin white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left spotty lace. Mild aroma of citrus along with a trace of malt.

Gilded Otter Back Porch Summer Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Tap at the source. Pours light golden, clear, white head. It has blueberries in it. One of them keeps going up and down within the glass. Interesting. Aroma is blueberry muffin. Yep. Flavor is crisp lager, blueberry. Actually a good blueberry beer. Way better than like blue point blueberry ale. And the blueberries in it are sweet. I kinda dig it. It’s honest about what it is, that’s for sure.

Gilded Otter Back Porch Summer Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Draft. This shit is purple. Light purple, but definitely purple. I guess that’s what happens when you use real blueberries. The flavor has natural blueberry flavor, low sweetness, a clean grainy base, and some very light hops in the finish. Good stuff.
Gilded Otter Back Porch Summer Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub as part of sampler. it seemed really popular and i saw several people come in and request growlers of this, and they put a handful of blueberries in each pour. the pour looks like grape soda. its just there regular lager mixed with blueberry juice in my opinion. tasted like fizzy soda pop beer. not undrinkable but not a beer drinkers beer.
Gilded Otter Back Porch Summer Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Taste like their lager with blueberries squeezed in, which could very ell be what they did. Blue tainted light lager colour. A little head and lace. Sweetish. Soda like carbonation, watery. Avoid this creation
Gilded Otter Back Porch Summer Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Growler filled at the brewpub and consumed the next day. Pours a hazy but translucent blueish-purple with lots of blueberry bits floating about. The head is brilliant white with a slight blueish tint that makes it almost seem electric. Looks pretty in the glass. Pleasant aroma of blueberries. The flavor begins with blueberries, but is quickly truncated by some astringent hops. The hops bitterness is basically flavorless and contributes nothing to this beer. Watery body. No lager smoothness at all. Disappointing.
Gilded Otter Back Porch Summer Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;unique color. looks like dirty water - dark but translucent. Strong, delicious blueberry flavor and arouma. Lager yeast is subdued and actually balances the sweet blueberry and malts well. pretty tasty

Gilded Otter Back Porch Summer Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;On tap at the Gilded Otter. Pours a hazy but mostly clear brownish purple blue with a medium lightly purple white head. Slightly disturbing looking… comes served with a spoonful of blueberries in it which bounce around the bottom of the glass in the carbonation. Big blueberry aromas, with a little spicy grain in the background. Thin to medium bodied, somewhat empty flavorwise at first, then slowly a big grainy lager flavor builds up. Finishes lightly, but heavy on the grain again. Not something I’ll be repeating. Very watery.
Gilded Otter Back Porch Summer Lager;New Paltz, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Sampled @ Otter: Not a fan of fruit beers, but this one nailed it. The aroma is a great blend of blueberries and wheat. The color looks pretty authentic to me, giant berries floating at the bottom. Taste is delicious, not offensive like I thought it would be, although this was a sample size... could see it being a bit much in a pint.

Two Brothers Bare Tree Weiss Wine 2001;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Had the privilege of tasting this rare bottlle at the 2016 RBSG weekend, whew. Big thanks to alexsdad06 for melting my palate. Nose tells me there is lots of apparent alky in this one, but in a nice sexy way like a slightly drunk mate at the the end of a night. Alarming amber light in color. First taste? Big strong sweet almost cloying, american, needs aged, wanna bee barleywine. Yes, its got a few years on it but it needs a couple more to get that old country aged feel on it. Little oxidation considering the age. I must say tho, it has aged the rudeness out of itself. Yes, the sweetness needs just a couple more years of wisdom (& oxidation) to make it like the old country J.W. Lees Harvest Ale (Lagavulin) & O’Hanlon’s Thomas Hardy’s Ale (2003 - 2008). I’m really surprised this brew is not flat!

Two Brothers Bare Tree Weiss Wine 2001;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Two Brothers Brewing Company;750 ml bottle shared by shigadeyo. Pours a hazy orange amber color with a medium sized white head. There was quite a bit of suspended particles throughout. The aroma had caramel, candy like sweetness, ripe fruits, plum prunes with some mild oxidation. The flavor has sweet caramel, prunes, ripe fruits, some oxidation with mild barrel notes. As some of the yeast gets mixed in, there seemed to be more roast for some reason. This has held up surprisingly well. I think it is better than the 2 or 3 most recent batches.

La Tropical (USA);Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Florida Beer Company;Bottle at Bongos Downtown Disney. Pours a lgight gold color with a thin white head.

La Tropical (USA);Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Florida Beer Company;Bottle - small foamy head, very light straw color, pretty standard pale lagerish type of flavor, may be refreshing on a hot day at the beach, but otherwise certainly nothing special

La Tropical (USA);Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Florida Beer Company;pretty horrible beer. Tastes like musky and skunky hay. Pours a light yellow color with a very small white head.
La Tropical (USA);Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Florida Beer Company;Bottle. Obviously not from Cuba given this country’s ridiculous policy towards them. I tried it anyway. Pours a honey-gold color w/ a decent sized white head. Crisp flavor. Mostly malty. Heavily carbonated. Light bodied. About what I expected.
La Tropical (USA);Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Florida Beer Company;Bah. I mistakenly bought this hoping for a Cuba tick, as that’s what the ID card at Total Wine said... should have looked on here first. On well. Skunky from the start in aroma and flavor, with a plain pale lager taste and disturbing creaminess. Skip it... thanks for nothing, FBC.
La Tropical (USA);Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Florida Beer Company;yipee, another sub par FBC beer. Pours semi hazy golden with thin white head. Aroma is malty, hints of hops, nothing special here. Flavor, hints of pilsener malts, light sweet caramel with some added sweetness in the finish. Crisp and soapy mouthfeel with a lingering malty mouthfeel.

Bøezòák Svìtlý Ležák 12°;Velké Bøezno, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Velké Bøezno - Bøezòák (Heineken);Aroma is balanced – notes of butterscotch with some maltish hints shows more classic profile of that kind without rustic hoppy bites, unfortunately there a bite of wort. Taste is semi dryish with some malty base, grassy note and base of grain. Specific, not really out of style but something isn't okay.
Bøezòák Svìtlý Ležák 12°;Velké Bøezno, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Velké Bøezno - Bøezòák (Heineken);Can. Pours light amber, white, rapidly-dissipating head.

Lobkowicz Prince (Klasik) Blonde Bock Beer 10°;Vysoky Chlumec, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Vysoký Chlumec (Pivovary Lobkowicz);"Somthing a little different here; Pale, transluscent, good head formation. Starts out rather sweet but has some nice hop crispness that’s more reminiscent of a pilsner. The bitterness in the finish does work really well against a lingering, sweet aftertaste. Strays from style a little, but who really cares? A VERY drinkable beer that I’d definitely go for again. Hard to find, but definitely worth a purchase if you find it. You gotta love the relationship to Beethoven too (if you don’t know the connection, the you HAVE to get it). Even if you’re a redneck you’ll feel a little more sophisticated drinking it."""

A very boring beer.

Nova Paka Kumburák;Nova Paka, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Nová Paka;This stuff is crazy! In bottle from beer store. Opened the top of bottle and nothing but foamy head coming out, not an explosion like it was shaken or anything but nothing but foam....take several sips to down it and it keeps coming up, down to half bottle and it keeps pumping out foam! This is the most CO2 from any beer I have ever had from a bottle. Anyway couldn't pour it, but smells of barely, malt , cereal. Obviously very foamy, but a smooth texture, not too hoppy....has a cereal like finish and linger. Pretty decent Pivo!

I’m impressed that they have their own beer, this is my favourite cinema in Prague. Pours pale gold with a white head. Corny, slightly grainy flavour with some misplaced sweetness.

Ježek Výèepní Tmavé 10°;Jihlava, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Jihlava (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Bottled at Mosebacke, Stockholm (as Jezek Dark Lager). Clear dark brown, minimal head.

Ježek Výèepní Tmavé 10°;Jihlava, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Jihlava (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Bottle at GBBF, August 2005. Dark russet colour, with a garnet tinge. Plenty of bready malt in the aroma. More fruity malt on the palate, leading to a dry finish. Low hop profile and not much bitterness. Consequently the overall feel is rather soft and it has a fairly light mouthfeel. The preamble is promising, but it fails to develop from there. Doesn’t really have a hook line. Decent but short of excitement.
Ježek Výèepní Tmavé 10°;Jihlava, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Jihlava (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Plums, pastry dough and fresh bread in the welcoming aroma. Clear chestnut brown with rapidly and fully diminishing head. Bready malts, pastry dough yeast character, plum-like fruitiness and mild nuttiness with a moderate roasty bitterness in the finish. Medium body is quite dry and suffers from very low carbonation. A shame really - the flavours and aromas promise a great deal but the lack of carbonation really knocks this one down quite a bit. Bottle sampled at GBBF 2005.
Ježek Výèepní Tmavé 10°;Jihlava, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Jihlava (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Bottle (GBBF): Dark brown with no head. Huge malt nose. Wonderful toffee and choc.

Jihlavský Pivoj Výèepní Svetlé;Jihlava, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Jihlava (Pivovary Lobkowicz);"The Lure: Flowers on pastries, mint leaves on bread. Earthy yeast whispers in an all-around peaceful perfume. The Festivities: A surprising wooden, resinous hop flavor and bitterness which might prove a little harsh for the unsuspecting vycepni drinker. Slender honeyed malts morph into bread crusts and earthiness. It’s pasteurised and filtered, yet the yeast and hops are doing their job well, and this is almost flavorful (""vycepni"" means light, remember?). Transcendence: When Atlas need to clean his toothbrush."

Park Pirminator;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Parkbrauerei;This is undoubtedly the BEST beer in the world! I have never met anyone who has tried it who would argue otherwise. I would do anything to get some unfortunately it is not exported and only American soldiers are aware of its existence outside of the three small towns it is distributed in.

Park Pirminator;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Parkbrauerei;Thanks to Erzengel for that bottle. Looks really good. Beer in the glass zippy, huge head. Starts strong-malty, a bit alcoholic without being too much. Soft-spicy, some grasy notes. Finish well balanced, still fine spicy. Nice!
Park Pirminator;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Parkbrauerei;500 ml bottle. BB 16/09/2014. From my Secret Santa. A big thank you Erzengel! Clear deep golden colour with a small frothy white head. Sweetness, grainy malt, mild alcohol and play dough in the aroma. The flavour is mild grassy hops, mild bitterness, farmyardy malt, almondy sweetness and... not very good. As I’m not huge fan of Bock this isn’t easy one. Strong, sweet and malty. Reminds a bit strong Baltic/East European Lagers.
Park Schwarzbock;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Parkbrauerei;50cl bottle from Erzengel, many thanks! Pours clear reddish brown colour with a mid-sized most good lasting beige head. Aroma of dark roasted malt, caramel, wood. Taste of dark mild roasted malt, caramel, some alcohol.

Park Schwarzbock;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Parkbrauerei;Schöne rötlich-barune Farbe mit beigem Schaum. Der Geruch ist malzaromatisch und leicht süßlich. Der Antrunk ist mild-säuerlich und leicht malzig. Zum Hauptteil tritt diese Verbindung von Säure und malziger Süße noch etwas mehr an die Oberfläche, hinzu gesellt sich eine milde, aber trotzdem deutlich wahrnehmbare Herbe. Das Bier wirkt weich, allerdings merkt man die 6,9% vor allem in Richtung des Nachgeschmacks deutlich. Eine leicht vergoren wirkende malzige Süße bestimmtden Nachgeschmack, die leichte Herbe bleibt sehr zurückhaltend. Auf der Zunge bleibt eine malzig-süße, aber nicht zu süße weiche Note mit ganz leicht vergorenem Einschlag. Die Herbe gesellt sich angenehm hinzu und wird mit der Zeit zusammen mit einer nun auftretenden trockenen Malzigkeit ein wenig dominanter. --> Leckeres, dunkles Bockbier. Jedoch für einen Bock etwas aromenarm. (Test vom 21.2.2009) --> 12,11,12,10,12,11 - 11,15
Park Schwarzbock;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Parkbrauerei;There’s some decent roast grains in here, with a little of the coffee bitterness, but lacks the oomph and heft of some of the other dunklers out there. Kind of lackluster, but drinkable
Park Schwarzbock;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Parkbrauerei;Brown color, large fluffy tan head with great lacing. Aroma of toasted graham crackers covered in honey. Taste is sweet caramel.
Park Schwarzbock;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Parkbrauerei;Süßer Antrunk, fast schon etwas zu stark. Ausgewogen malzig, schnell kommt durch die Süße eine etwas lkaoholische Schokoladennote empor, die aber nur kurze Zeit von Bedeutung ist. Dann wird die Aufmerksamkeit wieder auf die süße Würzigkeit gelenkt, die das Bier außerordentlich süffig macht. Zum Ende fester malzig, die Süße nimmt ab. Zum ersten Mal etwas hopfig, auch dieses Aroma ist eher nebensächlich. Ausgereifter Bock, der einigen wohl zu süß sein dürfte. Danke an Erzengel! 10/11/12/11/10/12
Park Schwarzbock;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Parkbrauerei;This beer has a rosted nut aroma that is highlighted by the dark amber color. A very interesting taste it is not quite sweet but not bitter either, a bit nutty. For a bock it has a very light body, thin texture, with flat carbonation and finishes abruptly.

Malty aroma with some presence of grassy hops and a bit yeasty. Taste starts malty, followed by some bitterness with the addition of some soury feel and yeasty notes again.

Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;Not a bad beer, kind of along the same lines as Kell’s. Very light bodied, clean and crisp with a butterscotch maltiness with traces of sweet bread crumbs. A very basic light beer, with a lemony zest in the finish. Shows that you can make a decent tasting light beer with quality ingredients.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;Pours with a pale yellow body topped by a medium thick head with some lacing. It’s slightly sweet and lightly malty with a grassy note and a touch of hops. Light bodied and smooth.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with goldtwins, thanks Larry!) Kind of a lemony citrusy light beer, so at least this isn’t a flavorless bottle of water-like substance. Aside from the tart, lemon citrus, and a mild bitterness in the finish, there isn’t much else in the flavor. Mostly a citrusy nose as well. Light bodied, and with the tartness, it’s pretty clean and refreshing. It pours a cloudy, medium straw color that is topped by an explosive, white head that rises to over two inches and requires several pours to empty the bottle. It settles in a rocky fashion, maintaining a very foamy layer atop the beer, leaving globs of foam on the glass. Nope, don’t like it.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;Not bad at all for a light beer. Slightly darker than the standard light lager. Simple breadish malt and citric/grassy hop aroma. Low sweetness thorughout with traces of acidity and a light finishing bitterness. Watery and thinnish with decent carbonation. I suppose, if I saw the point of drinking low alcohol / light beers, I’d pick this up fairly often.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;your basic light beer. i wasn’t crazy about it but it didn’t have a godawful aftertaste like most of em do. instead of being brewed with stones i would have rather been stoned while drinking it.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;Stone brewing rules, its been a while since i had one of these styles. This one was a dull yellow color. Had a bit of lemon in the aroma and body at that. I could drink these all day, but at 3.8 percent, what is the point.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;Thanks to beeryum for this one. Pours canary with two-finger white head. Aroma of malt, some hopcit, some lemon. Tastes citrusy, with some finishing hops and tart dryness. Somewhat light palate, but refreshing.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;For an Ale, it’s pretty damn light. For a light beer, it’s not bad at all. Taste is light with some corn flavor. Had a raw wood taste like a popsicle stick. Some light bitterness which may be citrus or grass.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;Thanx to Beeryum! This was quite good. light and crisp yellow with a fizzy head, did not last. aroma of grapefruit and ginger ale. Sweet but not to sweet. Nice for a light beer.
Atlanta Kellys Light Irish Stone Brewed;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Red Brick Brewing Company;Golden yellow and highly active. Nice sticky bright wide head. No aroma, really. Flavor is at first a full-on starch, then settles into hints of skunky lemon grass. Disappoints.

Rochefortoise Blonde;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottle, 6.2%. 2 years past BB date. Nasty metal aroma. Cloudy golden colour. Frothy white head.

Rochefortoise Blonde;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottle Conditioned, aged 4.5yrs, 330ml. Yellow straw colour with big clumps of yeast, I poured so carefully to avoid these that the head was minimal. Clevs to the fore on the taste front with a spicy body, full thick winey beer with a still sweetish finish despite the age. Interesting enough and a shame that it is no longer available.
Rochefortoise Blonde;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;(Bottled) Opaque golden color with big yeast clumps - lots of them! Medium, tight, creamy and lacy head. A sugary, distinctive aroma of red- and blackcurrants. Sweetish, malty, a bit wineous, berryish flavor with some acidity and smoky, ashy hints. A bit papery.

Rochefortoise Ambree;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottled@The 1st Vaasa CS/ES beer session (thanks WK! no BBE date noted on bottle, but probably old accoring to Wim). Deep amber colour with huge fluffyY/foamy slightly off white head, that leaves nice lace. Aroma is some wooden notes, mild toffee, alcohol as well as some berries. Flavour is quite similar, but much more mellow than the aroma would promise. Mild yeasty and earthy notes as well. A quite pleasantly balanced beer.

Rochefortoise Ambree;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Bottle. A quite clear, golden beer with an enourmous off-white head. Sweetish, caramel-like aroma with a good fruityness, and the flavor is much the same, sweet, malty and fruity. Medium body, very effervescent. A nice beer that still feels a bit ordinary. Not sure if it deserves the rating I gave it, but at the moment I was drinking it, it was right. Afterwards, it felt a bit high though. (080411)

Rochefortoise Brune;Péruwelz, Belgium;Dubbel;Caulier;Caulier version, the ’massive ale’ in this series. Dark brown, hazy beer with stable off-white foam. Caramelly malts, candied fruits, chocolatey, nutty, yeasy with a rounded, soft, almost fluffy mouthfeel, bit warming alcohol, herbal hops and toasted malts in the finish. Very nice, the best of the (discontinued) Rochefortoises, in my opinion.

Rochefortoise Brune;Péruwelz, Belgium;Dubbel;Caulier;Cremig-malziger Geruch, deutlich alkoholisch. Süßer Malzantrunk, Alkohol ist definitiv nicht erkennbar. In den Vordergrund stellt sich ein Aroma aus vergorenen Früchten, etwas süß, weiter sehr malzig. Die Malzigkeit wird dunkler und cremiger, der Alkohol ist nun zu erahnen. Die Fruchtigkeit nimmt nun deutlich zu, das Malz zieht nach, eine herbe Note setzt ein. Hier ist das Bier sehr würzig und steigert sich immer weiter, bis es schließlich im Nachgeschmack nach und nach schwächer wird, die nun röstige Malznote bleibt als einziges konstant. Das Bier ist hier sehr würzig und stark, darauf wird man sanft vorbereitet. Überaus harmonisches, vollmundiges und leckeres Bier! Test vom 24.12.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 11,13,13,14,12,13 - 12,90

Rochefortoise Zythone;Eprave (Rochefort), Belgium;Brown Ale;Rochefortoise;(Bottle 33 cl) Slightly hazy, dark amber with a gigantic head of the type that simply won’t stay down. Slightly perfumy and very refined nose. The perfumyness continuous in the flavours but is kept in balance by a very pronounced bitterness. But a good quality, artisanal Belgian ale. 230200
Rochefortoise Zythone;Eprave (Rochefort), Belgium;Brown Ale;Rochefortoise;Orange color, no head. Butter and peacharoma. Buttery and yeasty flavor. Some tropical fruit hidden behind the yeast. Licorice. Like most other Rochefortoise beers, disappointing.
Rochefortoise Zythone;Eprave (Rochefort), Belgium;Brown Ale;Rochefortoise;Dark blond with a big quickly disappearing head. Sour malty aroma and taste. Rather flat. There is a slight bitter finish.

San Mig Light 5%;Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;Oct 2019. Silver can bought in a 7 Eleven in Bangkok. Brewed in Thailand by San Miguel. No ABV given. A thin lager, but drinkable when cold.
San Mig Light 5%;Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;Great beer to quench your thirst after a good long bicycle ride - or couple it with some spicy food. Doesn't expand your waistline, light and refreshing is the word. In one word: superb - the only beer I need, keep the rest!
San Mig Light 5%;Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;The foamstability is medium, body very light. It smells malty, watery, weak. The taste is watery, malty, weak.
Ambari;Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Impala Distillery & Brewery;11.2-ounce brown bottle dates 16 months earlier. Poured a hazy straw color and bled an odd nutty/malty aroma. A sharp, seemingly brettanomyces yeast character dominates the flavor profile- not pleasant. A pale lager malt flavor tries to emerge but is quashed by a harsh, hearly sour note among the otherwise sweet flavors present. Might be better closer to the brewery.
Ambari;Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Impala Distillery & Brewery;"I was at Mela, a delightful Indian restaurant in Soho, with a good friend, ethnically Indian, who insisted that this kind of beer is exactly what you need with Indian food, and particularly in hot climates (London doesn't really qualify). That ""contextual"" argument for the appreciation of international lagers only goes so far. Despite an interesting, even compelling fruity sweet aroma, and more light-hearted fruity notes in the tasting, this becomes overwhelmed by grassy, ugly flavors. Nice head, but otherwise typical and undistinguished appearance. Don't seek this one out."

Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);This brewry was started across the street from my old office in Richmond, VA. It had state limitations on selling beer on the premises. This bottle was enjoyed on the Mattaponi River at an Easter dinner. The bottle of stout poured with a browish head and jet black in color. The stout went down smooth. There was chocolate and malt flavors that acsented this fine stout. The finish was dry but full of hops.
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Olde Coot wards off swamp insects and that's a big selling point with me...it's all about dual purpose
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);This was good! Pours almost pitch black with a brown but quickly receding head. Smell of instant coffee and dark chocolate. The taste is a little bitter because of the hops but is very smooth. The chocolate is very pronounced in the finish. Good beer!
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Nice nearly black color with a diminutive head. Aroma of dark coffee with some burnt notes and something not quite right in the background. Initial flavor of roasted coffee and some bitter notes with the same ""not quite right"" note in the background. After the initial few sips, I spent the rest of the glass trying to discern that off aroma/flavor and never could. It was a huge detractor from my enjoyment of the beer, and I can only describe it as smelling/tasting like some aftershave an Old Coot might wear. Slightly medicinal/hospitally and not like wet cardboard or skunkiness. Bewildering!"
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);I love this brewery - their beer tastes like my homebrew, especially from the early days. This stout starts with a yeasty-fishy nose and gets chewy as hell - no that's not right, more like gritty, a big rough texture with alternating bits of burnt toast, coffee grounds, clawing hops, and maple syrup. It's just a big homely stinky bachelor uncle of a brew, and loveable all the same.
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Overly, not that great in my opinion. Good aroma, burnt chocolate, but it was kinda watery and boring in taste.
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);A decent stout with a fair amount of well-balanced complexity. I'd try it again.
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Fantastic stout from a great, craft brewery located in Richmond, VA. This is their winter seasonal that is rich and delicious. Somewhere between a traditional dry stout and an Imperial stout, with a big smack of hops thown in for good measure. Some really nice chocolate malt aromas meld with piney, cirtic hop aromatics. The palate is firm with lots of flavor and character. Flavors of sweet malt, chocolate, and coffee coat the tounge. This beer finishes chocolatey and roasty up front, then exploded into a nice hop bite that lingers. Really a great winter brew, that could be enjoyed all year round.
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);A good stout as they go, I liked the heavy thick chocolate burnt grain taste, fair hop bite. ABV relatively high, decent after taste and deep brown to black color is appealing.
Mobjack Olde Coot Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Had a nice ""homebrew"" flavor - fresh tasting. Sweet start, burnt in the middle, with a dry finish. Enjoyable."

Acadian Vienna Amber;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Acadian Brewery;This WAS a very good local beer. Unfortunately, it’s now a defunct brewery. New place has opened up, and the original brewmaster is back, but he hasn’t started making it again. In it’s heyday, when the original Acadian was open, you could get this stuff for $1 a pint at the bar! The good old days.

Acadian Vienna Amber;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Acadian Brewery;Very carmelly with a distinctive cedar taste to it.

Acadian Vienna Amber;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Acadian Brewery;Very good Vienna style amber lager. Very malty, with enough hops to prevent excessive sweetness.

Acadian Pilsener;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Acadian Brewery;12oz bottle-A golden body with a decent head. Aroma of nothing with the taste being a typical pilsner.
Acadian Pilsener;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Acadian Brewery;A tasty brew that needs to be served with foods to be truly appreciated. Somewhat lackluster without foods. This is a Cajun brew that is very woody in the aftertaste.
Acadian Pilsener;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Acadian Brewery;Not as good as the vienna amber, but a great cajun pilsner with that Louisiana cypress taste that many Louisiana beers offer. Needs to be served very cold to enjoy.
Acadian Pilsener;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Acadian Brewery;Noticeably hoppy, accompanied by slight skunkiness. I've had worse, but this is a sub-par brew, not in the same league as their excellent Vienna Amber.

Westvleteren 12 (XII);Westvleteren, Belgium;Quadrupel / Abt;Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus;Well, the hype is real. Trying to put away the external factors when tasting/evaluating this beer is difficult, because they are an integral part of the experience. Its relative exclusivity, the confirmation bias that comes with the huge undertaking of buying this beer at the abbey, the feel of the place, the low-key bottle (oh, how I love the unblemished trappist bottle where the cap holds all the information), the crate and last but not least, the ratings and reviews - the hype. The appearance is immaculate. The color of the beer and the look and feel of the foam are just... right. In the Westvleteren glass it looks almost understated, yet oh so inviting. The smell is understated too, maybe a tad too much, as when I first smelled it my stomach wrenched in worry that it would not deliver as promised. Well, it does deliver. It really, really does. Trying to describe the taste in detail is a bit meaningless for me, it is too complex. It has many of the tastes you expect from a dark trappist, dark fruits, nuts and all that other nonsense which I am not good at describing, but what sets this one apart from the rest of the trappists, and other belgian triples and quadruples for that matter, is a taste I can best describe as a soft bitterness. But its not really soft either, its there, and it fits so ... again, right. It gives the beer a dimension I have not experienced in other of its kind. Either way. I realize I could never shake off my aforementioned confirmation bias, but hopefully the description of my experience could convince you to try it, as the hype is most definitely real.
Westvleteren Extra 8;Westvleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus;330 ml bottle. Pours a very dark brown color and topped by a small beige colored head of foam that fades away to a thin film. The aroma shows notes of dark cocoa, dark fruits with figs and plums most prominent, toasted caramel, and grapes over a dark malt base. The flavor follows suit with the dark fruits of plums, figs, and grapes up front to go with the dark, toasted caramel, some cocoa, and Belgian candy sugar with a light bitterness on the back end. Medium bodied and smooth with soft carbonation that leads to a dark fruit, toasted caramel, and loads of grapes on the finish. Interesting and solid Belgian strong ale but I prefer the 12 to this. Still glad I finally got to try this after all these years.
Westvleteren Extra 8;Westvleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus;Bottle from a Bruges convenience store. Pours very dark mahogany with a large frothy beige head.

Biddy Early Black Biddy;Inagh, Ireland;Stout - Dry;Biddy Early;On tap at the brew-pub, Inagh, Ireland, June 8. Reviewed by son-of-ColoradoBobs, who fashions himself a stout-lover. Black Biddy is a good name -- totally opaque black, with just a hint of garnet if you hold it up to the light. Huge creamy fully-lasting off-white head reminiscent of soft-peak meringue. Excellent sticky lacing. Rich malty bread aroma. Chocolatey, almost smoky roasted malt is followed quickly by moderately bitter hoppy flavor, with a long bitter-sweet finish marked by an upsurge of hops again at the last. Creamy palate, with soft carbonation. Brewed from pale and crystal malts and hopped with Green Bullet and Fuggles hops.

Biddy Early Blonde Biddy;Inagh, Ireland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Biddy Early;On tap at the brew-pub in Inagh, Ireland. Review by Mrs. ColoradoBobs. Average sized rocky white head that diminished quickly over a light amber sparkling clear body.. Light strawy malt aroma mixed with floral hops.

There is not much hop; It has a medium to heavy body and high carbonation. There’s a roasted malt finish in the sourness remains. A touch of berries, maybe.

Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Pours golden with a white head. Aroma of malts and grass. Not really much flavor, basically some toast and grains
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);"I should have known, the regular tastes bad - how can the light be any better???? It isnt. Same bad aftertastes and odd extra flavors that do nothing, good, to the taste. hops lovers may disagree, but their title as hops lovers gives away their bias. I like good beer. Most of what I like has little of the craftie movement's ""spices, pine cones, herbs, flowers and other crap"". German beer is the standard. Learn from them. Want to sell odd flavors 2 bottles at a time in small Vermont towns between 10 am and 1 pm?? have fun, but it isnt beer."
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Can at the local Mexican restaurant. It almost looks like a Coors Light can. Consumed it straight from the can . Aroma is weak corn with weak musty/ skunky grain. Flavor is the same with a extremely watery texture. It has almost no aftertaste at all. It was in fact the cheapest beer on the menu, yeah.
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);A lot like regular only thinner, along with malts and a beery finish. Was expecting it to be very light but drinkable and that pretty much sums it up.
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Straight from the bottle to wine glass very cold beer Appearance: Light pale yellow, minimal head, a lot of lacing Aroma: scent smell of malt, nothing else Taste: not really great Mouth feel: very carbonated Overall: good beer for the hot weather
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Can. Pale yellow colour, small white head. Aroma is maize, some skunky notes, grains and mild herbs. Flavour is maize, some slight earthy and herbal notes with quite a dusty tone to it. Unpleasant.
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Lata, de PEMEX. Pours a flat, dead-looking morning urine yellow into the wine glass. Has some vague malty-grainy-estery stuff on the nose, indistinct in the way a hot dog is an amalgamation of everything scraped off the killing room floor. Taste is more straightforward - just grainy, estery macrobrew. Finishes tart, grainy. You know when you could have bought a better beer but went for the tick? The better beer was Victoria. I want my 14 pesos back.
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Water down a regular Modelo and presto! watery, grain flavored beer. Not the worst light beer out there.
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);"Pale, watery, boring. Finish BEFORE the ""Extra Frio"" disappears from the can!"
Modelo Light;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);"Can from the Isla grocery store with a label that is a straight lift from Coors Light including the ""cold enough"" color indicator. It’s not offensive but it’s far from good. Just a watery pale lager."
Victoria (Mexico);México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);A classic beer beer. The palate kicks in like the smell of beer-soaked carpet in a front bar.
Victoria (Mexico);México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);12 ounce bottle. Pours a golden amber with a thin white had that lasts. Taste is of malt, grain, wheat and yeast. Mostly clean aroma. Has a decent body with a slight bitter finish. Overall, a nice, drinkable Mexican lager. Worth getting again.
Victoria (Mexico);México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);A big XX fan and Victoria has a great taste too. Full body flavor that goes great with just about any foods.
Victoria (Mexico);México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Bottle. Actually some decent amber malt character for an otherswose light mexi lager. Not bad for what it is
Victoria (Mexico);México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Had it in the bottle at the local restaurant. Some sweetness. Lighter beer. Goes good with spicy food and a lime.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Clear bottle, painted label. Pours a crystal clear light gold color with a fizzy white head and decent retention. No lacing. Light skunk aroma. Tastes like a Euro lager mixed with a Mexican lager. Thin pale lager flavor with a slight skunk edge and a short finish with a hint of diacetyl. Not as crisp as I expected. Overall it's harmless beer.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);This beer has a very golden color in is real nice smooth if you like the Corona taste you will enjoy this beer as it has a similar taste.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Pale lager. Bit sour, bit malty. Well, it's a thoroughly forgettable lager but whatever.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Grabbed a sixer after work opted for tick versus revisit something decent. Clear bottles.

Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Clear bottle. Pours a pale gold with a decent white head. Aroma of malt and grain. Taste is malt, corn, and a bit of grass. Some skunk taste. Decent with the right food pairing.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Not a malty beer but has more body than I expected. Some sweet corn. Pretty easy drinking. Would go good with food. Better than expected.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);After moving to CA last year, I explored the vast selection of Mexican lagers at the local beer store. Most local Hispanics buy beer in cans only, and there is a reason. Mexican lagers in clear glass bottles go skunky in a matter of minutes due to extreme light sensitivity. Fact is they are much better in cans, and Estrella is no exception. Estrella in cans has a clean fragrant aroma and a cotton candy finish with absolutely no bitterness in the finish. Skip the bottle, search for the can.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Pale gold with a thin white head. Light fruity aroma with a sweet corn taste. Ok lager.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);24 oz. can. Pours a medium, poorly retained, off white head, no lacing, over a clear light gold (SRM 4) carbonated, body.....nose is toasted malts with bread tones, slight herbal hop notes, balanced......taste is toasted malts with slight sweet notes, late dry, mild bitter finish.....mouth feel, medium body, no alcohol, slight carbonation. This is rather simple in aroma and flavor, and as a result really misses the stated style of Pilsener, but it is still drinkable compared to Pale Lager.
Estrella Jalisco;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Bottle pours a clear pale golden with a small white head. Aroma of semi sweet malt, beechwood, and light grassy hops. Taste of sweet malt and corn.
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);At a restaurant in Mexico City: somewhat dirty and metallic amber lager. Side by side with Montejo, Montejo had more and better flavor, which is not what you would expect. Not my favorite.
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);A sweet malt aroma, pours a clear brown, aged copper color with a thin white head. Light body, somewhat watery, a sweet malt taste with a short lasting sugary malt finish.
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);One of several ambers I sampled in Mexico on my trip to Michoacán in 2010. Only now getting to the rating. Light and sweet. Very mild and watery.
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Dark amber beer with big but quickly disappearing head. Aroma of honey and some spicy and grassy hops. Quite sweet mixed with bitter. Palate a bit too thin. Altogether nothing very convincing.
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);355 ml bottle @ Karisma Cantina Mexico City. Pours a clear Amber with a large bubbled beige head. Aromas are are subtle (poured fairly cold). Tastes are grainy malts, slight hop profile, and a little metallic on the back end. Light body, assertive carbonation, short metallic finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Appearance: Reddish-amber body that’s a bit (too?) clear with a decent 2 finger head that recedes to a thin layer then to nothing rather quickly. Smell: Best feature for me. Malt & mild bitterness (hops?) with a underlying coffee presence, not sure. Taste: Wow, not much here. Some malt, maybe some caramel but extremely subdued. Taste is fleeting. A bit grainy but i’m grasping at straws here due to the lack of flavor. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Texture is, for lack of a better word, rubbery. Crisp & clean and finishes like water. Kind of flat also.
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);"Deep amber with minimal head. Aroma of sweet malt. Taste is also sweet with a bit of chocolate. Glad we saved this one for ""dessert"""
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Can in Mexico City. Pale sweet beer, no depth or complexity. Incredibly boring, a touch maltier than a pale lager but out of can I’d be hard pressed to say this was dark beer. Sticky. Meh.
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Can (thanks Jukka). Kind of amber colour with some brownish hints to it, mediumsized off-white head to it. Aroma is kind of crisp malts with some grains, mild toasted notes as well as some slight earthy notes. Flavour is rather grainy witha quite sweet touch to it. Smooth, but somehow the sweetish notes are strange and feel a bit unclean. Bulky, but easy to drink. Watery palate.
Leon Negra;México DF, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);355ml bottle. This is a beer similar to victoria but a lot less character, thin and watery, forgettable.
Montejo;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Bottle at a restaurant in Yukatan Pours clear golden with a small white head, light lacing. Honey, pale malts, wheat, corn Decent
Montejo;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Maybe the Mexican beers aren't at the top of many people's lists but they do have their place. I got a 12 oz bottle of Montejo at the local craft beer shop, ready to try it now. The expected grain and water scent. I'm staying with the bottle so no comment on appearance. It is a bit different tasting, there is barley, rice and water, maybe a hint of citrus. I'll solve that. A slice of lime goes in. Much better. Enough lime I could drink a bunch of these.
Montejo;México DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);At a restaurant in Mexico: easy drinking golden lager with ample amounts of grains and hops. Not a watery lager but still simple and refreshing.

Tabacco, boiled patatos, herbs, cereal and earthy. This strange dryness continues in the taste, that’s light bitter and albeit being drinkable not very pleasant.

Thin body, soft carbonation. Sweet taste with subtle grassy hop bitter notes. Malts and grains, mild peppery. Generic macro lager, a bit on the sweet side. Meh.
Oranjeboom Premium Lager;Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;United Dutch Breweries;"""Oranjeboom Premium Lager Beer"", 500ml can brewed in (or at least product of!) Belgium at 5%. 50/50 head, quite foamy but cavitating quickly. Shiny clear yellow colour. Pear and especially sweetcorn on the nose. Very audible fizz but mild carbonation all the same. Taste follows the nose, bit of pear, lot of sweetcorn. Slight murmur of malt in the aftertaste. Well done for what it is, but at least at the time of drinking, I was not remotely in the mood for what this is. Tasted sickly, verging on horrible. If you find malty sweetcorn-water to be palatable, you may very well enjoy this - I don't think it's badly made, per se, and I have tried a few genuinely badly made beers - so don't get me wrong. I have had this before and don't remember it being quite so unlikeable, so it's possible this was a bad batch or I was having a bad day so to speak - it's also possible my palate has changed since then."

Fischer Adelscott Noire;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Smoked - Rauchbier;Fischer (Heineken France);Excellent! Maybe one of most famous beers that no one knows about. :-) But seriously - this is fantastic. Go out of your way to acquire it. Light nose - not much there initially - leans towards sour milk at times, but overall pleasant. Dark, dark black-brown color and a light frothy head. Slow start with a rather long taste profile -> moves from caramel to choco/coffee to roasted malt and to a peaty finish. Earthy wood tones and charcoal at times too. Varied and interesting taste profile. Maybe a little thinner than desired, but given its complexity, this is well-balanced. Can't explain why I was so drawn to this beer. Definitely one of the best - if not THE best - French beers I've ever had.
Fischer Adelscott Noire;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Smoked - Rauchbier;Fischer (Heineken France);Great and very interesting beer: Malty nose, almost chocolate - melted. Black with a little head layer. Chocolate milk taste, like whipped cream added in a dark cacao - but also smokey. Medium lasting fullmouth finish. Weired but excellent from my´point of view.

Fischer Adelscott Noire;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Smoked - Rauchbier;Fischer (Heineken France);This had a weird, grayish head, though it wasn't really bad looking, surprisingly.

Emerson's Weissbier;Dunedin, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle in Dunedin NZ. This is a rather disappointing effort at a hefeweizen from this commended brewery. It lacks the big banana and clove elements of the originals but comes up trumps on the spritzy fullish mouthfeel and appearance (hazy orange with fluffy white head). Not one of their best.

Emerson's Pilsner (Organic);Dunedin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin, foamy head. Aromas are fresh and balanced - NZ hops upfront (passionfruit, guava and ripe tropical fruits) backed by bready and slightly sweet continental pilsner malt. Flavours are similarly hop driven and harmoniously balanced. The palate is incredibly smooth, enhanced by soft carbonation, gentle bitterness and a slightly acidic hop tang. A classic modern Pilsner.

Emerson's Bookbinder;Dunedin, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);OK for a low alcohol beer if you’re driving, but not much else. No aroma to sniff of. Nice dry finish
Emerson's Bookbinder;Dunedin, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle pours a brown color with a bit of head. Noticeable low alcohol. Some mild hop bitterness overpowers
Emerson's Bookbinder;Dunedin, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle. Toasted hazelnuts, toffee, apple, toast. Thin, far too carbonated body. The carbonation takes over the flavour a bit too. Honestly a bit of a mess. As an Englishman, I find it outrageous that this is rated higher than bitters back home, despite being completely out of style and really not that pleasant. Perhaps the Kiwi palate is more easily pleased. Hard pass.
Emerson's Bookbinder;Dunedin, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle BB 1/6/2016 (though I don’t think this was correct as I got no trace of oxidation). Hoppy malty aroma. Slightly hazy light brown color with slight head. Good bitterness up front with a slight burnt roasted character at the back. At 3.7%, an excellent session beer.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Beautiful persistent foam. The aroma is rich and revealing good malt and a little hop. The taste has light floral touch and crisp caramel malt. In addition, a luscious shade of flower with light taste of alcohol. An ale with great richness.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I have had this before along time ago and then one night staying with a beer writing friend of mine, whose collection of aged beers is the best I have ever seen, brought out this bottle. It had five years of age on and released malt-driven flavours with sherry, orange peel and grain. It was sweet without being cloying and ended a night of remarkable beers by punching well within its weight. Grand.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled@EBF 2008. Slightly hazy orange colour with a small white head. Aroma is candysugar, some sweet malts, mild grains and a bit herbal. Flavour is grass, candysugar, mild alcohol sweetnes along with some toffee. Quite bitter finish.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Orange i färgen med vitt skum. Doftar malt, apelsin, citrus, gräs, karamell, lite godissötma. Smakar friskt av apelsin, söt karamellmalt, citrus, gräs. Fin bäska rakt igenom och bitter avslutning.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);2012: Orange colored old ale with a nice foam. Bland flavor. The taste is intense sweet.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Hazy light orange with an off-white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, dried fruit and yeasty. Flavor is quite sweet and light bitter. Sweet finish. 141211
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours dark amber with a small head. Loads of sweet malt and oats on the nose, along with soft hints of spiced orange marmalades, golden syrup, pancakes and maple syrup. Similarly sweet flavours, more oatmeal, pancakes and golden syrup. Unfortunately there’s a fair whack of alcohol in the finish. Very soft carbonation could be higher, body could be thicker and more syrupy.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);From a 500ml bottle on 8/4/2011. Pours a dark golden orange colour with a decent head. Has a pleasant aroma of sweet caramel malt and brown sugar. The flavour is pretty much the same, with some toffee and marmalade thrown in. The malty sweetness is quite pronounced, but it has enough hops at the end to balance things out nicely. The palate is quite creamy. All up, this a very enjoyable, well put together ale.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle, vintage 2010 320A. Clear rich amber hue, very large light beige foamy head slowly settles to a small creamy head, excellent lacing. Very nice diverse mixture of aromas - malty, caramel, butterscotch, smokey, woody, marmalade, chocolate, Christmas cake, spice, yeast, vanilla. Tastes nice - moderate to strong sweet, moderate bitter, a faint touch of sour. Smooth and velvety,softly carbonated, oily creamy sticky texture, long bitter slightly astringent finish. Very nice indeed. Had the last few mouthfuls with some Christmas cake and yummmm, great food match.
Emerson's Old 95;Dunedin, New Zealand;Old Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);2010 Vintage in Bottle on release. Lovely warm malty notes with orange marmalade and clove. Lovely bright fresh hop notes.
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle best before Dec ’04 tasted in ’09. Nice nose, smoky whisky notes dominate. Subtle smoky whisky flavour hint of roast malt coffee. Body has thinned with age but the flavour has not.
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);03 or 04’ bottle thanks to Stew! Pours clear almost black with a slight head. Oaky chestnut, chocolate, barely any whiskey notes... just a slight soily, smokey thing going on. A hint of vanilla and some staleness might be there too. Nice full body with a fairly roasty bitterness which I thought time would have softened out. Flavour carries a lot of chocolate and some wood notes, time has made it a bit stale and meaty too i think. Interesting stuff, but I wouldn’t give it any longer in the cellar
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A well aged bottle shared at BJCP tasting a while back. All the porter characteristics with a nice whiskey flourish. While it’s not the spirit of my choice it works fine here but much prefer the bourbon version.
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tasted a bottle purchased in Tauranga poured a dark brown almost black with a light brown head which quickly dissipated. I can smell th bourbon character but overwhelmingly a smell of green apples dominates. The taste is sweet and is like chocolate apples with hints of bourbon with smoky notes on the finish. this medium bodied beer obviously has a few problems but something kept me at it until the glass was gone. I will try this one again, I would like to experience it with out the apple flaw.
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Sweet, spirity, peaty nose. Quite lifted and indeed whisky-like. Dense. Concentrated in the palate. I got a weird chocolately pongy note, can’t put my finger on it, but I think this beer is ok.
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Dark brown color. Light brown head. Whiskey and dark chocolate are present in the nose, but very subtle. Whisky and dark chocolate are present in the mouth and I thought this was very much like a Baltic porter. Whiskey character has definetely settled.
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A hazy deep red beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet with notes of whiskey and malt. The flavor is a somewhat weird combination of whiskey and malty as well as light roasted notes and hints of smoke. I find it unbalanced.
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Dark red brown colour with a beige head. Light roasted malty, dark fruits, whisky aroma and a sweet light fruity, whisky taste. Medium body with a heavy whisky finish. A bit to much whisky for my taste.
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Fantastic! I love Emerson’s-- can they do no wrong? This is really good porter made better with a whiskey polish. Pours dark chestnut brown with a creamy lasting head. Definite whiskey aromas mixed with scorched malts and maybe some coffee (like their pilsner, I could smell this all night). Whiskey flavour on the palate, but not dominating. This is assuredly a smooth porter with whiskey as a side note-- in other words, very well-balanced. Not an ""every occasion"" drink, but definitely a treat to be savoured."
Emerson's Whisky Porter;Dunedin, New Zealand;Porter;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);As a Scots-Australian who enjoys a dram or two, I approached this with optimism. It’s a bottle-fermented New Zealand porter that has been matured in whisky barrels from the local distillery. It poured the expected ebony colour with a formidable head. Looked great. Fierce nose: burnt chocolate and coffee grains. Like the aftermath of a fire in a grocery. Medium-bodied and as dry as a bushfire. Smoky notes, some peppery alcohol, licorice and toasted malt. But God it’s dry! Like licking an ashtray. (Bottle, 2003)
Cascade Premium Lager;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);There is worse macro beers out there. Refreshing and slight floral aroma, but lacks any vibrancy, malt firmness or significant hop character
Cascade Premium Lager;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);On tap in Sydney. Pours a pale straw gold with a white head. Bready malt, grain, mild honey notes. Biscuity malt, grain, straw, very mild lemon flavours. Medium bodied. Moderate to high carbonation. This is pretty average, but still better than most of the other Australian macro lagers.
Cascade Premium Lager;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);On tap at Cascade. Clear golden with a short-lived head. Clean, somewhat metallic taste. Not a premium beer by many peoples standards, but a perfectly drinkable standby.
Cascade Premium Lager;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Easy drinkability. Very light beer. It is noticeable an industrialized beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Cascade Premium Lager;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);5.2%ABV. Pale Lager. This tapped out a deep gold. 6°SRM. Nose had some clean beery aromas, lager-like with pale malt sweetness. Mouthfeel was watery. Palate had some pleasant smokiness with pale malt sweetness and a faint bitterness of raw peanut skins. Finish is clean, light and abbreviated with some faint herbal notes. A good and proud lager with more than an interesting backstory. Goes on Favorites List!
Cascade Premium Lager;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Pours golden with small white head that quickly vanish. Aromas of grain and some spices. Light body, medium carbonation. Short sweet finish. Nothing to talk about here.
Cascade Premium Lager;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);375ml bottle into schooner glass. Light caramel nose. Amber beer with diminished head. A few bubbles. Watery mouthfeel with abrupt sour malt finish. The blurb on the bottle is describing a completely different beer to what I’m drinking, something wrong here. Blurb or beer?
Cascade Premium Lager;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);"Tasted 9/9/2014 Alice Springs Airport. BB 17 Jun 14. Poured a clear amber with a few millimetres of white bubbles that diminished quickly to nothing. Nil lacing. Carbonation low and coarse. Aroma subtly of sweetish malt and possible citrus; malt intensifies as beer warms. Taste with moderate level of spicy hops and malt sweetness; malt intensifies as beer warms. Light body. Clean, crisp, smooth with lingering low level bitterness."

Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;Pour is a clear copper with a fizzy white head. Aroma is some caramel malt and not much else. Flavor is a little caramel malt with a watery finish. Chuggable and nothing else to say.
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;16 oz. can. Purchased in Atlanta by my wife on a recent work trip. Poured light amber, white head. Aroma was grainy, barley, malty. Taste was mild sweet, dry, watery.
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;Frothy Golden with a thin white head. Acerbic rice aroma. Taste is extremely weak, rice elements. Palate is nonexistent. Vaguely beer flavored water. Terrible.
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;Can from Rooster’s bar helping Harper do homework. Really needed a stronger beer for this endeavor. Pretty much tastes like every other ultra light lager out there. Slightly sweet and corny. Ho hum.
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;"Bottle. Not much of an aroma; some corn and grain. Not much of a taste either, though the hints of toast and perhaps minimal hops do make this easily better than the usual swill. Light bodied, watery and yet crisp. Clear amber with some off-white bubbles."
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;Good old American suds. Nice and watery, goes great with a bag of bbq chips. Tastes good for a low calorie beer.
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;This beer is nice and reliable. Don’t go in expecting too much and you’ll be satisfied. A good beer to kick back with the boys and smack a few of. Definitely recommend next to a bonfire
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;Very light and watered down. Corn.. Easy drinking. Hard on wilsons cousins trip TN.
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;Served from 12 oz bottle into shaker glass. Pours a pillowy off white head that drops slowly with some mild lacing. Color is clear light amber with plenty of streaming carbonation visible. Surprising amount of aroma for a light lager -- caramel and light toasted malt are mild, but noticeable. Mouthfeel is light and fairly crisp with a mostly dry finish. Flavor is also mild, but much more flavor than most competitors. It tastes like regular Yuengling slightly watered down. I very rarely drink light beer, but if I chose to buy it regularly, this would be a go-to.
Yuengling Light Lager;Pottsville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yuengling Brewery;Fresh bottle (screw-top). Nose dusty, sweet, corn, dash floral. Pour much deeper, darker golden than expected, still translucent, but some dark ambery and almost brown tones, head is a bad soapy off-white. Taste is sweet, strong corn and floral tones, a little malt, a little bread toward the end, but stripped throughout. Fizzy-crisp medium body a bit heavier than that, touch of amber malt character or even caramel. Not dirty, but rushed. Macro swill, ultimately. [2018.07.19: 1.9]

Sea Dog Penobscot Maine Pilsner;Topsham, Maine, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);To be honest, I was very dissapointed with this. Color was ok, aroma was a bit light, flavor was...well, not much of anything to be honest. Where are the saaz hops? Tasted more like Bangor, ME city water than anything else. A shame, I usually like SeaDog brews, too.

Ballantine XXX Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours golden with a thick white head. Aroma of acerbic malt. Taste has a light sweetness to it. Palate is nearly nonexistant. cheap beer.
Ballantine XXX Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pabst Brewing Company;This was apparently my Grandfather's favorite beer, I guess if you can survive the Pacific Front on a B-24/29 bomber, you can stomach something as awful as this. Notes are grain, ass, cracker, and stale skunk. Thin and awful
Ballantine XXX Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pabst Brewing Company;best 40oz you can get at any liquor store/bodega in the NY area. My dad told me it was his grandmother's favorite beer. Funky, malty, hoppy enough (not too much), they should sell it in cans but bottles are fine (tastes best from can or 40oz), gotta have this ice-goddamn-cold. Highly recommend
Ballantine XXX Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pabst Brewing Company;Decent ale. Smells like resin, but that doesn't really detract from this beer. Would have again and again.
Ballantine XXX Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours a medium yellow with a thick long lasting white head that leaves lacing. Nose is malt with a hint of resinous hops. Body is medium. Taste is slightly sweet malt. 16 oz can BBY 12/17/18
Ballantine XXX Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pabst Brewing Company;Another old favorite. Tastes much better than it smells. (Not bad but strong) Just a tad too much foam, but it’s worth it. Very pleasant taste. Something about it just says, “Brooklyn” to me.

Ballantine XXX Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pabst Brewing Company;"From Oct 2006 Poured from 16oz can a straw gold with a lot of foam that settles down to a fine broken layer. The smell is on the sweet malty side with just a bit of ""lemon pledge"" nose to offset it and that's ok with me. The taste is sweetish malty up front with some graininess and just a wee bit of bitterness right before the finish that could easily get over looked and the finish itself? That's on the watery side and probably the weakest taste feature for this APA. I remember this brew from back in the 70's and 80's and it had a really nice hop bitterness bite to it that threw the flavours totally out of balance but that's what made it so darn tasty. I really miss that old formula but this one is pretty good as well. If I had it in my market, I'd visit it often."
Ballantine XXX Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pabst Brewing Company;Aroma and flavor is malts/pale malts, medium skunky and a slightly bitter/mostly smooth finish. Surprisingly decent.

Tyskie Gronie;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Clear golden with a one finger wide head. Strawy, grainy smell.

Ksi¹¿êce Tyskie;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Pours a clear golden color, topped with an average white head. Aroma is grainy, mild and nothing else. Taste slightly sweet, light body with some mild bitterness in the finish. Nothing special.

Tyskie Mocne;Tychy, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Tyskie Brewery (Asahi);Can.Orange and clear with some sweetness. Sweet aftertaste that lingered for some time. Better than expected but then i wasn’t expecting a lot!
Tyskie Mocne;Tychy, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Tyskie Brewery (Asahi);I see some haters here....personally I’ve tried many a beer all over the world. If you get one that’s fresh...and I did many a times it seems...great beer, smooth, good head and body, nice dark golden color...can’t taste the alcohol....easy to drink, lots of carb.
Tyskie Mocne;Tychy, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Tyskie Brewery (Asahi);Almost no smell, but by sniffing powerfully, some sweetness from the malts are recognizeable. Unfortunately the aroma isn’t the worst thing about this beer. The taste is a sourish and has sweetness from the malts - quite a lot like much eurolagers. Then the taste is completely twisted into some acridness with alcohol on the side. Even though this is a very popular brewery in Poland, I think this certain beer is of very bad quality. To end this rating I have to say that the beer has a metallic taste too, almost no hopping, and feels infinite to drink when poured from this 50cl can. One of the worst beers I have tasted.
Tyskie Mocne;Tychy, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Tyskie Brewery (Asahi);Not bad. Available in more area now, but like Okocim better. Maybe it was on the shelf too long. Used to be one of my favorite beers.
Tyskie Mocne;Tychy, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Tyskie Brewery (Asahi);(on can!) There´s has opend a polish drugstore in Copenhagen and in between cabage and odd sausages, I find three products from Tyskie Browary. This is indeed a very good strong lager. Lots of carb and and sweet, allmost physical, soft malt tone to the nose. The alc isen´t tasted, before the very last aftertaste, wich suits me fine.
Tyskie Mocne;Tychy, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Tyskie Brewery (Asahi);Cheap Polish immitation for beer. Avoid !!!.................................
Tyskie Mocne;Tychy, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Tyskie Brewery (Asahi);One of best strong lagers made in Poland . Strong but alcohol is softly present , not to sweet .
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Okocim Zag³oba by³ moim pierwszym wyborem przez d³ugi czas po tym, jak zorientowa³em siê, ¿e koncerny robi¹ jakieœ sztuczki z piwem. W tamtym okresie by³ to w mniemaniu wiêkszoœci moich znajomych Browar, który nie zmieni³ siê na gorsze.
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Œrednie piwo, ale przypomina mi mi³e czasy. Na etykiecie s³ynny Zag³oba pij¹cy piwo. Lager mocno wysycony jasnego koloru ze spor¹ piank¹. Smak to ju¿ go¿ej, s³odkawy i odrobina hmielu w koñcówce. Po latach przywrócone do produkcji ale troche inne w smaku i wygl¹dzie jest tamto piwo.
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Okocim Zagloba was one of my favourite beers, one of the best in Europe, before Okocim brewery got a part of Carlsberg. Okocim becaming /changing to Carlsberg, good old traditions of Polish Okocim started to dissapear. Now when i visit Poland I dont buy its beers becouse it is not this good Okocim but bad Carlsberg.
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Bottle. Yellow with a medium rather short lasting white head. Aroma of malt, grains and some hops. Flavour is crisp, malty with some sweetness, grainy, some bitter hops. Bit bitter in the finish.
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Wonderful, another retired beer than shouldnt be drank after one year (or less.) Well, guess that just my luck. Pour is a slightly hazy gold color and a white head. The aroma is grassy and pretty much a standard lager smell, I’ve got something boiling in the kitchen 10 feet from me so its filling up most of the smell. The flavor is almost not there. Really, there is a bit of sugary sweetness, some grassy malt, but those are deep down there. Not a whole lot going on here.
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Cellared can from a Polish co-worker which I opened over the weekend. Gold pour, with a solid hop presence and a smooth finish. Perhaps ballsier, and definitely with more punch than typical pilses.
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;"This was a nice, strong, forward hoppy pilsener. Not delicate at all, more brutish, but with a clean natural finish following the brash forward bite. I liked it. For a while they had a crappy replacement ""Export"" Okocim before bringing back this one and that Export was really lame. I think they took their time and care with this superior Zagtoba (Which I’m pretty sure used to be labelled ""pils"" instead.),Requiem for a pretty good beer - tough yet respectable."
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;This is Ok for a Pilsener. Some bitter, earthy, mettalic, and straw flavors. Finishes some what bland, crisp, and clean.
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Pale straw colour with a quickly disappearing white head. Leaves thin lace on the glass. Classic faint floral aroma with little trace of maltiness. Faint bitterness, thinnish body, but with a crisp finish. Pretty standard, but not offensive.
Okocim Zagloba 12.5° (until 2001);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;One of my favorite pilsners. Finished some of the last bottles available in Canada a few months ago. It would be my number one if it were not for the heavier, filling finish to this beer. That is personal taste though. I believe that a great Pilsner should be light in body and palate, start crisp, stay dry and aromatic to the nose, and then finish smooth with sharp citrus dryness. Oki smells great, starts crisp but is a bit heavy on the palate and finishes a tad filling. It is also one of the darkest Pilsners. These are all small idiosyncrasies in Oki’s overall character. Generally, it’s a very good Pilsner....I miss it
Okocim Mocne;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Tastes 100% like a warka strong, same way of doing beer, doesn’t feel too alcoholic, not a bad choice.
Okocim Mocne;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Strong molty and corn-like sweetness, discreet bitterness, refreshing after taste. Slight unplesent flavor like typical high alc v beer. Reasnable beer for the price in Canada.

Okocim Mocne;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;"Can at home. Colour - Beautiful soft amber (4/5) Head - Medium-large, with short to average lasting Aroma - quite basic but not bad at all; malty, hoppy, hint of wood, soft smell, maybe a hint of citrus? (7/10) Taste - very well bodied, wet and refreshing, bitter backhand. Crisp and sharp (8/10) Aftertaste - I can only describe this as an immediate very short tangy/fizzy zing around the entire mouth, with a nice bitter lasting aftermath. Crisp and sharp but does get drier quickly (4/5)"

Okocim Jasne (Light);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Polska;Zeby ie bylo ze jestem dupa ocenie to piwo skosztowane w latach 90-tych, a wiec w poczatkach postkomunizmu. Pamietna butelka (szkoda ze juz takich nie ma, przynajmniej u nas) w piwach. Delikatne, pijalne, niemal slomkowa barwa. Piwo dobre po wysilku lub po slonecznej kapieli, nic poza tym.

Okocim Jasne (Light);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Polska;A slightly milky, golden beer with a hint of grass. It is quite smooth (almost creamy). Enjoyed this is Krakow with pierogi ruski, borsch and golabki. Probably wouldn’t drink it again.
Okocim Jasne (Light);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Polska;"Near golden color with a tall somewhat fluffy of white head. Light malt and resin aroma. Fairly harsh malt and alcohol flavors for the stated 5.5%. Near sour nut type flavors. Interesting for a ""light"" beer. Actually seem to gain flavors as it warms, quite unusual for a this style. Losses the sourness and has a dry roasted nut flavor and finish. the longer more I drink the more I like this one. Interesting indeed."
Okocim Jasne (Light);Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Polska;Lighter version that Jasne Pelne (Full Light), refreshing, very drinkable. Despite that this is Light version still kept all the good stuff, just less alc.
Karmi Classic;Warszawa, Poland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Polska;0.5 l bottle from 'EDEKA Preller' (Breckerfeld), best before October 2020. Clear, ruby with a medium large, frothy, almost stable, beige head. Sweetish, bready and a bit malty aroma of bread crust, some caramel and traces of wort. Fairly sweet, malty, gently bready taste of caramel, bread crust and nuts, followed by a short, minimally bitter, bready finish. Medium body, smooth and slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Very sweet but quite pleasant.

Belhaven Light (Keg);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Mild Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);"Casked. Hazyish amber colour, mediumsized white head. Aroma is fruit, caramel and hops. Flavour is very malty with slight caramellishness and hoppyness. All quite wellbalanced, but still very watery. I got the warning at the pub it might be a bit green still (they had just connected it), so I will not mention the slight ""eggfart"" notes in aroma and flavour."
Belhaven Light (Keg);Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland;Mild Ale;Belhaven (Greene King);Not a light beer person, drinkable, but way to mild for me. Fair malt nose, and a little hop freshness.
