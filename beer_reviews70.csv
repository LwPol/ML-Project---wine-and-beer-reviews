Rock Bottom Portland 12BBL Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Portland;"On tap at the Portland Rock Bottom. This place always cranks out some great seasonals. This wasn’t ""stand up and clap"" amazing, but such a solid pale. Maybe it was because I was there on the hottest day we have had in 6 months, but this beer was just really well balanced, lightly crisp in the finish, with a sweet citrus hop nose."
Rock Bottom Portland Dunkel;Portland, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rock Bottom Portland;Draught @ Rock Bottom Portland: &nbsp Pale muddy light watered down chocolate milk appearance. &nbsp Thin whispy head, off-white, spare lacing. &nbsp Pale wheaty aroma, slight straw/hay, smidgen of clove. &nbsp Pretty much what I expected on the tongue, like a lighter version of the syle. &nbsp A little flat on the tongue, not as bubbley/carbonated as I would have expected. &nbsp Clean, decent, doesn’t dissapoint. &nbsp Decent spring quaffer. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Fairly sweet but not cloying. &nbsp Has a bit of a dry/chalky aftertaste. &nbsp Not bad overall.
Rock Bottom Portland Dunkel;Portland, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rock Bottom Portland;Tap... Poured amber with a slightly off-white head. Seemed like a dull lager and not as complex as a dunkel could be. A bit cloying from unbalanced, sweet malt. Could of used a tiny bit of bitterness.
Rock Bottom Portland Dunkel;Portland, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rock Bottom Portland;It must be the season for Dunkels, all the brew pubs in town are bringing them out. My first sample from the Ram was rather disappointing, this one however was really nice. Pours red/brown with a smooth tan head. Rich roasty flavor with a bready/chocolate character. The malts were well balanced against the hops, easy to drink while holding a great weight on the palate. 2nds were a pleasure with this beer.
Hugos Chocolate Nut Brown Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Hugos;Looks generic dark brown. Heavily chocolatey aroma. Lots of chocolate taste, too, with sort of a bright hazelnut thing in there as well. Pretty sweet, and finishes somewhat syrupy like the Longboat. I suspect the beer base is a bit thin, and this is countered by the syrupy thickness...just like Longboat.
Hugos Chocolate Nut Brown Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Hugos;(Draught) Pint glass at the brewpub. These guys serve their pint glasses from the freezer - its really annoying. However, their new Choco Nut Brown Ale is pretty good. Nose is nutty and mildy cocoa. The flavour is nicely choco-fied with bitter cocoa and a decent roasted malt base. Too thin as with all their beers but this is definitely the best I’ve sampled yet.
Big Horn Slapshot Stout;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Black with a nice tan head. Aroma of roasted malts. Dry and roasty with an interesting light sweetness that I can’t place my finger on. Pleasant.
Big Horn Slapshot Stout;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"From Seattle Ram on cask - Dark black w/ good head. Very nice irish stout...lots of grain. Very dry with just enough hops. Tasty; one of the better dry stouts I’ve had."
Beaver Street Copper Creek Lager;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beaver Street Brewery;standard lager - maybe a little darker than some. Clean taste, but otherwise pretty boring as there wasn’t a lot going on.
Beaver Street Copper Creek Lager;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beaver Street Brewery;Golden to amber in color, head ok, lacing ok. A diacetyl bomb with a lot of fruitiness, somewhat of a light altbier, yet clearly not an altbier. Hop presence (all noble hops?) was there along with some dryness, but this thing wasn’t malty enough and the flavors that were there just didn’t do it for me. Kinda like a light altbier.
Beaver Street Red Rock Amber;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Beaver Street Brewery;a balanced amber with some dirt and caramel malt and light citrus hops. nothing pops, just ok.
Beaver Street Red Rock Amber;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Beaver Street Brewery;Poured an amber color with a decent initial head, lacing was disappointing for the style. The aroma was fruity esters, grapefruits. The flavor followed suit, lots of hops here, tons of dryness, nothing malty to back it up, certainly less malty and hoppy than the regular Railroad Red. Thin and light mouthfeel, some acidity.
Water Street Herberts Legendary Ale;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Water Street Brewing and Alehouse;Tap at Brouwers. Bright copper pour with a really nice nice head considering it came from cask. Aroma of caramel and toasted malts with that signature Water Street hop profile, citrus, earth, and leafy greens. Nice toasted sweetness initially is followed by big earthy hops in the finish, nice, dry and hoppy. Lingering bitterness, but still a pleasant semblance of balance here. The best of the 5 Herberts I had by a long shot.
Water Street Herberts Legendary Ale;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Water Street Brewing and Alehouse;Oh man was this tasty.....think it got 2nd at the WA Cask Fest. Very cloudy copper wti hgood head. Sweet hop aroma with tons of c fruit and just the right sweetness. Almost creamy texture coats the throat nicely. AWESOME.
Riegele Weizen Doppelbock Augustus;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauhaus Riegele;From the 330 ml. bottle. No bottling or best by date. It pours a medium amber tone with golden highlights and a humongous, lingering off-white head. Can you say malts? That's the major sensation on the nose. Caramel and butterscotch malts. A slight berry character too. A vague floral hop note. The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Malt sweetness in the taste to the extreme but there is also a kind of olive oil flavoring hovering in the background. It feels and warms the mouth and senses
Riegele Weizen Doppelbock Augustus;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauhaus Riegele;Appearance: Beautiful muddy amber color. Foam settles quickly. Very high quality. Fragrance: Bright banana, a little caramel and some pastries. Taste. Soft body, white bread and fruity notes in taste, hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Bottom line: Very high-quality Wheat dopelbok, but quite restrained in taste. No Wow Effect
Riegele Weizen Doppelbock Augustus;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauhaus Riegele;Spina da 0,40. Schiuma scarsa e volatile. Colore legno. Carbonatura minima ma adeguata.

Riegele Weizen Doppelbock Augustus;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauhaus Riegele;Bernsteinfarbenes, durchgehend trübes Bier mit elfenbeinfarbenem Schaum. Sehr fruchtige Nase. Reife Banane, rote Johannisbeere, Kirsche? Wahnsinnig weicher und runder Antrunk, der die Früchte noch stärker zur Geltung bringt. Sehr angenehme Rezenz mit leichter, erfrischender Restsäure. Die 8,0 vol% Alkohol sind an keiner Stelle spürbar, wunderbar in die Gesamtkomposition eingebaut. Eine leichte subtile Bittere begleitet uns in den Abtrunk. Alles in Allem nicht so komplex wie der Aventinus, trotzdem sehr einzigartig und in eine eigene Richtung weisend. Spitzenbier.
Riegele Weizen Doppelbock Augustus;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauhaus Riegele;50cl bottle thanks to @rauchbierlover. Pours cloudy amber with white head. Aroma has caramel and banana. Taste is very smooth with pleasant sweet and banana notes rounded of by warming alcohol. Very nice and perfectly balanced.
Riegele Weizen Doppelbock Augustus;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauhaus Riegele;Slightly cloudy golden beer. A Weizen but then stronger with pear and apricot. And alcohol! Slightly tart but a nice beer for sipping. Cheers!
Riegele Weizen Doppelbock Augustus;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauhaus Riegele;Aroma of sweet bread, toffee, dried pear and apricot and golden raisins. Banana and phenols are somewhat subdued for style. Taste is sweet and malty. Alcohol is very smooth for 8%. Slight wheat tartness. Texture and carbonation are pleasantly smooth. Distinctive German weiss character, but has more to it than that.

Kenbach Beer;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivara Bitola;Bottled. From supermarket in Bitola. Malty aroma with some hoppy tones. yellow color. Malty flavor, but can feel hops too.
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;Pours clear golden with a thin head. Aroma is corny. Corn corn and corny. Tastes awefull... sorry to say but this is probably the worst beer i've tried
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;Bottle at Grna restaurant in Bitola. Just so average and not much to comment in really. Not bad though.
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;Pours a clear golden, topped with medium frothy white head that’s gone in a matter of seconds. Quite smelly grainy nose with some fruity presence. Medium sweet, a hint of bitterness with a medicinal aftertaste. Light body. Had worse, but still wouldn’t have this one again.
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;An unremarkable beer from Macedonia that grows on you but does not overwhelm. Average bitterness and drinkability.
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;Tried it randomly after a local from Macedonia recommended it. Was a little sketchy at first but was very surprised with the outcome. Not as bad as people complain about, highly enjoyable. A bit too carbonated for my liking but still a very nice beverage and a big achievement for a small country. Highly recommended, would buy again!
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;Butelka 0,5l wypita w Macedonii w 2003r. Kolor złoty, piana znikoma. Aromat alkoholu i słodu, smak podły słodowy.Bardzo słabe piwo.
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;Big plastic bottle from Remstore, Ohrid. Pours a deep amber colour with a just off white head, soon disapating to something rather flat. Aroma of sweet malt, with a sweet caramelised taste to finish. Average carbonation to begin with, rather artificially sweet, not great really. RERATED based on 500ml glass bottle which was better, more golden in colour with a good white head which stayed, much less sweet and much more enjoyable!
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;My friend really liked this one compared to other local beers, but I didn’t. It is clearly darker than many pale lagers, with a golden hue. But I found the body to be a bit sticky, heavy with a plastic and chemical note. I didn’t care for it. 1.5 liter bottle purchased in Skopje.
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;Vo Makedonija na vtoro mesto ... posle Kenbach :-) Aromata mu e prekrasna, bogata. Ima vkus na medovina no e so pogolem procent na voda vo sebe od Kenbach - ot pa zatoa e malku poslabo, no e mnogu slicno na nego :-)
Bitolsko Pivo;Bitola, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivara Bitola;Bottled (500ml). Pale yellow color and white head that fades quickly. Cheap lager aroma. Awful, highly carbonized and very metallic taste and a slightly bitter, metallic aftertaste. One of the worst beers I have ever had.
Krali Marko Svetlo Pivo;Prilep, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Prilepska Pivarnica;hvala mom prijatelju makedoncu koji je dostavio ovo pivo iz skopja ... pivo je klasicno lose pivo koje se prodaje u marketima ...okus je ostao u proslosti ..treba mjenjati ono sto ne valja ...zao mi je ali nisam zadovoljan ...preslab okus ...prazan
Krali Marko Svetlo Pivo;Prilep, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Prilepska Pivarnica;Słomkowe, piana ujdzie. Aromat mało wyrazisty, jest trochę dmsu, bardziej psującego smak. Potem dochodzą estry.
Krali Marko Svetlo Pivo;Prilep, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Prilepska Pivarnica;Can, 0.5l. Nothing much to say about this one - it's below average macro pale lager. Generic aroma of grains and corn paired with a metallic aftertaste. Aggressively carbonated, plain and watery. Some supermarket beers are better than this. Meh.
Krali Marko Svetlo Pivo;Prilep, North Macedonia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Prilepska Pivarnica;0,5 flaske delt med Kitty på Dublin Irish Pub i Ohrid mai-18: klar, lys strågul med fint skum som varer.

Sixpoint Poppas Pilz;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Tap at Bobbique - perfetly clear golden, with a gigantic, foamy, well-retained head - grassy, herbal aroma, with notes of lemon zest, light peppery/spiciness - mild honey sweetness and a bit of lemon at first, but no apparent pilsner malt qualities - actually, not much malt presence at all, leaving the beer a little thin-flavored in the middle - a slightly higher hop profile than your average pils (no suprise from these guys) swells up near the end, along with some light grassy character, leaving the finish dry and crisp - overall, mildly sweet/fruity, ending with dry hoppiness, lacking the character and complexity of some of the better examples of the style - quite drinkable, though.
Sixpoint Poppas Pilz;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Tap at the South 4th Bar: Pours a slightly hazy golden with a thin white head. The aroma is very pleasant. Very lively, bready, fruity (subtle lemon notes), grassy hops. This a very creamy, and hoppy Pilsener. Starts with some straw notes, then a solid hop flavor is evident which gives off a nice fruityness of light lemon suggestions. The malt is subtle, but it’s presence is a perfect balance. Gives it a slightly doughy background. The finish is dry, slightly flowery and bitter. An extremely well crafted and quaffable Pilsener.
Sixpoint Poppas Pilz;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Draught at Waterfront Ale House (a few weeks ago). Slightly hazy gold with a frothy head, leaving spotty lacing. Aroma of grassy to lemony hops, with like a ’polleny’ dandelion scent. Honeyed grain flavor, lemony hops and a trace of apple/pear fruitiness. Medium bodied and mostly smooth. Mild carbonation. Pretty good pilsner from guys who only brew ale.
Sixpoint Poppas Pilz;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Tap at Boston EBF 2007 (new offering from the brewery). Slightly cloudy yellow body topped by a large and long lasting white head leaving good lacing. Very crisp beer that is more intense than the average pilsner. Lots of hay, a bit citrusy, generously hopped with a very nice dry bitterness of medium intensity (officially 47IBU). Somewhere between a hefeweizen and a typical pilsner. Very nice. Lucky kids, in my family I it’s Poppa’s Molson Dry.
Old Bog Quarry Cracker;Oxford, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Old Bog;Cask, Mason’s Arms, Oxford. Warm copper with a fine layer of white. Tawny citrus aroma, catty, abundant and lively. Lovely blending of hop, malt and yeast character--so nicely integrated it’s hard to tell where one contribution ends and another starts. Fresh, satisfying beer. Delicate palate, just enough pithy texture to give the flavor a place to catch. I’ve been wanting to try something from this tiny (1 bbl system!) brewery for a long time, and what a nice introduction it was!

Cazeau Tournay Wohlenberg Blond;Templeuve, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Cazeau;Bottle, from trade with HenrikSoegaard. A gusher, producing an unclear, golden-orange body with some floaties and an off-white head soon diminishing into a layer of bubbles. Cellar, a lactic hint, pale malts and fruits on the nose. The flavor has a citrus peel bitterness, fruits and pale malts. Effervescent and medium bodied. Some bitterness in the finish. Sort of refreshing, but definately not the beer I would chose as my house beer. 091120

Brentwood Honey Bunny;Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brentwood Brewing Co.;Brighton Beer Fest. Flowery hops in a mildly sweet yet fairly well attenuated and clean malt base. An attractive modern bitter well made though lacking in depth and excitement.
Church End Petes Progress;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Church End Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the Bag ONails, Bristol 28/8/08. Magic Dave has got this beer spot on - Pale amber with plenty of juicy hops and some well chosen malt to balance it off. I could have drank this all night, if there hadn’t been a good selection of ales on.
Church End Petes Progress;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Church End Brewery;bOTH AROMA AND TASTE ARE REALLY HOPPY, GRASSY WITH A TOUCH OF CITRUS MALT CHARACTER IS MINIMAL, REALLY DRY BITTER FINISH.
Custom Beers Tomahawk;Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Custom Beers;Cask@Sussex BF. Custom beers kick arse i reckon. This was tasty stuff. Lightly sweet notes of toffee, from the malts i’m guessing, then there is a good dose of citric, lightly floral/aromatic hops in the finish. Medium bitter finish. Well done.
Custom Beers Tomahawk;Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Custom Beers;Brighton Beer Fest. This is a lovely beer. A fragrant and sweetly malty premium bitter made by Peter Skinner, ex-Dark Star/Skinners Ales/Skinners Custom Brews, very close to the current Dark Star brewery. There are good hop nips in the finish, and a general feel of a rather splendid ale. Fresh, fragrant, flowery, alive and clean and sweet and just lovely, lovely, lovely.
Pitfield Piglets of the Caribbean;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Strong Ale - English;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);A Mes rate: Cask at the Wenlock (you know Dave). Dark amber colour. Dark cherry in the aroma with some chocolate. Surprisingly sweet chocolate flavour with some random citric notes. Sour finish that has reasonable length. A very random blend.
Pitfield Piglets of the Caribbean;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Strong Ale - English;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Cask@The Wenlock Arms. Deep amber/brown. Sopay coriander flavours come through first, with some lime/citrus zest. Finish is acidic and slightly watery. This is also a little bit sweet.

Dark Star Spring Equinox;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask (Gallows Bird, Espoo) Clear gold, small head. Bready and yeasty aroma. OK, OK, there’s plenty of grapefruity sweet citrussy hops too. Fresh and sharp - there’s a zingy little dance on the tongue. Long long finish - soapy hops. Quite simple and similar to many of their other brews, but as they churn out dozens of great beers, that’s not a problem at all.
Elland Black Rose;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Stout;Elland Brewery;Cask@The Evening Star, Brighton. Quite roasty and bitter, while having quite a light body. Some dark chocolate bitterness lurks around abit aswell. Good length of flavour for having such a light body.

Custom Beers Special Mild;Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Custom Beers;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Fin’s excellent Merton Beer Festival. Black brown with no head. Good roasted malt aroma with slight bread, chocolate and earth. Once in your mouth there is no doubt this is a lovely mild. A glorious blend of berry fruits and bitter chocolate. Slight liquorice and if I didn’t know better I would swear I detect hops. Lovely dry bitter finish. Bags of flavour and character. A jolly good mild.
Custom Beers Special Mild;Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Custom Beers;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Merton Summer BF. A black beer with a tan coloured head. The aroma is fruity with berry notes as well as some smoke and petrol. The taste has more smooth fruits. Pretty mild with roasty fishy notes. Nice.
Custom Beers Special Mild;Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Custom Beers;Gravity, at the excellent Merton summer festival. This batch at 4.8%. Chocolate brown, fine tan head. The smell of clothes after coming inside after a long day in the cold outdoors. A pinch of cocoa. Grassy, resiny, dark choclate flavor. Soft, restrained sweetness. It’s possible that there was a tiny bit of first-pint bias in my notes, but I though this was a distinctly good beer.
Custom Beers Special Mild;Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Custom Beers;Cask, gravity dispense at Merton Summer Beer Festival July 18th and 19th 2008 Poured v.dark brown plenty of hops on nose but some roasted notes also. At times this came across as quite silky smooth and others quite robust and reckless I had this a couple of times and liked its individuality, it didn’t taste 4.8 as Glen points out there was an easy going bitterness the roastedness was interlaced with a nice hoppiness and you kind of get the feeling that the brewer was trying to really stamp out his mark on this, I think that he suceeds and I’m sad that we won’t see any more Custom beers. Quite enjoyable if not exactly true to type.

Quite strange this, it’s a dry, rather than fruity mild, but with a perfumed hoppy note within the flavour and also slightly bitter. There is a thinness to it. This is the 4.8% ABV version so the thin character is quite surprising. It’s ok.
Custom Beers Special Mild;Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Custom Beers;Brighton Beer Fest. Smooth dark mild with gentle chocolate flavour and a medium bitterness. Pleasant roast malt notes - nothing too sharp, aggressive or bitter. A well rounded and pleasing beer - though lacking in distinct character, and with hazy bits.
Custom Beers Special Mild;Haywards Heath, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Custom Beers;Cask@Sussex BF. Another nice Custom beer. This was a very nice mild. With soft, yet complex flavours of wood, nuts, roasted malt, chocolate. Some slightly jammy fruit in here aswell. I could have drank this all night, pleasant.

Cowaramup India Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;IPA;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Tasted 6/4/2016. Draught at Cowaramup Brewery, WA. Poured a crystal clear dark golden colour with a three-finger bright white foamy head that retained Ok and laced well. Carbonation low with medium sized bubbles. Aroma subtly of light citrus/fruits and a hint of caramel but no obvious hops. Taste of very sweet fruit (orange, possibly lime) with no real bitterness. Light body. Smooth, crisp and sweet with subtle bitterness on the finish. Not a good IPA.
Cowaramup India Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;IPA;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Tap at freo beer fest. Real pine and tropical driven ipa. Flavours are quite sutble but overall pretty refreshing stuff!
Cowaramup India Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;IPA;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Mid gold pour with thick white head. Aroma is pine, citrus, toffee. Lots of bitterness, pine, tropical fruit, caramel. My favorite of their brews
Cowaramup India Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;IPA;Cowaramup Brewing Company;"Draught @ Cowaramup Brewing Company, March 2012. Bright, orange copper with a lasting, dense and compact white crown that leaves rings of lace. Bright, herbaceous hop nose; spicy and piney with hints of tangy marmalade, rose petals and stinging nettles. Toffee and toasted, sweet grains poke out, as does a hint of higher alcohol. On the palate it seems aggressively hopped. Piney, herbal, floral and oozing with caramelised citrus. Finishes with a flooding, hoppy bitterness that lingers long. Sweet toffee front balances it with a firm, malty and nutty mid-palate. Light smoke and burnt caramel builds in the aftertaste alongside those hearty hops. Oily in mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Borderline heavy, but I reckon it could still be a sessionable number. Come along way since my first tasting back in 2007 where the final gravity saw the beer peak at 6.3% ABV. Very nice stuff!"
Cowaramup India Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;IPA;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Amber body with a short head. Sweet caramel nose, should show more hop characters, got the first three beers close to the mark but this needs more work, too much residual sugar and the colour is a bit too dark.
Cowaramup India Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;IPA;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Amber, served very cold. A strange pineapple ester obscures everything else. Resinous and sweaty and sweet. Seems like it needs some TLC. Good to have some new places trying the style though.
Cowaramup Pilsner;Cowaramup, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cowaramup Brewing Company;"Tasted 6/4/2016. Draught at Cowaramup Brewery, WA.

Cowaramup Pilsner;Cowaramup, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Light golden pour with a thin white head. Aroma was malt, some herbs, maybe a little citrus. Dry, good bitterness, a little floral taste. Not at all bad.
Cowaramup Pilsner;Cowaramup, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cowaramup Brewing Company;A tasting from late 2008. On draught at the brewery in the company of head brewer and owner Jeremy Good. This was first taster for the day. Produces a sparkling medium gold with at frothy snow-white head that lasts and suds up the glass. Dusty but sweet nose. Good lot of citrus balanced by toasted grains with a hint of fresh cracked black pepper. In the mouth it has a good base of Pilsner malt balanced by bitter, grassy and herbal hops. A touch of tangy sweet marmalade comes through upfront and along the side of the tongue with a little wash of lemon. Finishes bitter, crisp and clean, nicely carbonated and light in body. A pleasant Pilsner, very easy drinking.
Cowaramup Pilsner;Cowaramup, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Almost bright gold body with short head. Nice crisp bitterness, lemony hop nose, fairly light in body but good length of finish. Quite liked this pilsener it was clean, fresh and had great hop characters.
Cowaramup Pilsner;Cowaramup, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cowaramup Brewing Company;I was warned by the friendly staff at the brewpub that this beer was bitter at first, but then gets better, as if bitterness could be a bad thing in a pilsener? seems like it was made with a dry, bitter German style in mind. Very pale, with good head. Light, clean, dry malt base with lots of herbal, resiny hops. Apparently some of the hops are grown on site which could explain both the freshness of the hop aroma and the green, rough resins. A bit on the grassy side, but it’s great to have a really dry and hoppy pilsener that isn’t fruity or full of diacetyl like so many aussie pilseners.
Cowaramup Special Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Tasted 6/4/2016. Draught at Cowaramup Brewery, WA. Poured a dark amber/copper colour with 5mm of off-white foam for a head that retained OK and laced OK. Carbonation low with fine to medium bubbles. Aroma quite bland, maybe a hint of malt. Taste of roasted grain and sweet caramel malts. Light to medium body. Finishes with a sweet caramel, hints of roasted grain and a nice moderate strength bitterness. Lack of decent aroma detracts.
Cowaramup Special Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Tasting paddle. Pour light coppeer with a white head and a light spicey/citrus aroma. More spice a nutty/biscuit malt in the flavour.
Cowaramup Special Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Red gold pour with decent off white head. Aroma was nuts, malt, caramel, biscuit. Decent bitterness, nice biscuity flavour, caramel, long finish with a bit of sweetness,
Cowaramup Special Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Cowaramup Brewing Company;A tasting from late 2008. On draught at the brewery and with this batch weighing in at a hefty 6.2% ABV it seems fair to vary this from other raters tastings. Onwards and forwards! Ruddy copper body, not quite bright but radiant and harbouring of a very fine bead. Dense, creamy off-white head settles atop to leave some very messy lace upon the glass. I must admit it produces up well! Initial whack of salty peanuts and oranges on the nose, shows a lot of biscuity malt, floral hops, fresh baked white bread and forest floor must. Alcohol is evident on first sip, a nice earthy, floral hop bouquet displayed, some rough peppery notes with a nice bitterness on the swallow. Palate is firm, medium, well rounded, nice earthy hop finish, dries out considerably in back. Good malty rich palate, toasted, mildly nutty and gritty, a developing linger of citrus like lime and orange . Very good drinking despite the higher ABV, this was delish! Yum.
Cowaramup Special Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Good colour, amber red (rhubarb colour) with a short light tan head. Burnt nutty taste also burnt caramel, slightly meaty, almost medium body with good length of finish.
Cowaramup Special Pale Ale;Cowaramup, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Apparently made with maris otter and goldings, which should ensure a pretty drinkable ale. I don’t know what else they put in, but this beer had a strange muddy licorice flavour that was a bit offputting. Underneath that, an amber beer with a full body, and low bitterness. Whatever hops were in there seemed to be struggling to get through.
Cowaramup Hefeweizen;Cowaramup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Tasted 6/4/2016. Draught at Cowaramup Brewery, WA. Poured a clouded light golden colour with a two-finger white foamy head that retained OK and laced very well. Carbonation high with medium to coarse bubbles. Aroma nicely of spices/cloves and sweet banana. Taste of cloves, sweet malt and banana. Light body. Crisp with a soft mouthfeel and strong cloves on a sweet finish. A traditional Hefeweizen.
Cowaramup Hefeweizen;Cowaramup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Tasing paddle. Pour cloudy golden with a creamy white head and a light estery aroma. Banana and yeast esters dominate the flavour.

Cowaramup Hefeweizen;Cowaramup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Tasting from late 2008. On draught at the brewery. Second of the day enjoyed whilst admiring the hop vines growing just down from the brewhouse. Sunny orange gold and not quite bright, yet not hazy as I expected. Head held out for a mere five minutes, a pillowy white fluff, before receding back to a thin layer of bubbles. Ripe banana and strawberry, and vanilla bean nose with an underlying taint of rubbery, band-aid phenolics. A lot of banana and sour wheat malt notes in the mouth, slightly gammy and tangy along the sides and in the back where some strawberry lingers along with notes of clove, band-aid’s and a hint of poppy seed (?). Esters and phenols die off crisply in the swallow, very clean and short. Nice light body and spritzy carbonation make it featherweight to drink. So refreshing, I can see why it is popular. A simple, nicely made wheat beer!
Cowaramup Hefeweizen;Cowaramup, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cowaramup Brewing Company;Murky straw, almost yellow body with a decent white head. Cloves first up on the nose followed by light banana, some lemon characters in the taste. On the money for a summer refresher.
Big Bear Bock;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Big Bear Brewing Company;on tap-pours a light tan head and mahogany color. Aroma is candy sugar, medium/dark malt-sweet caramel. Taste is candy sugar, medium/dark malt-sweet caramel, yeast, leaning towards a dubbel bock, dark fruit, secondary hops bite, spices. OK carbonation.
Big Bear Bock;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Big Bear Brewing Company;Draft... Mostly clear mahogany lager with a mid-sized, frothy, off-white head. Good retention. Malty, fruity nose and flavor with notes of caramel, toffee and honey. Proper hopping allows the malt to roam freely without overstepping its bounds. Full-bodied and fatty with prickly carbonation. Lengthy, moderately sweet, honey finish that winds up almost dry.
Big Bear Bock;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Big Bear Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: The fruity caramel maltiness and earthy noble hops of this tasty dunkler bock create a comforting flavor sequence which remains drinkable throughout despite its chewy malt abundance. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the clear dark red hues. -The body is definitely huggable. -Again, this is served way too cold to be thoroughly enjoyed. -The finish is clean and supporting hops are able to dry out most of the maltiness. -Carbonation’s a little fizzy, not necessarily fitting the style, imho. On tap at the brewpub.

Amiad Winery Mead Honey Wine;Kibbutz Amiad, Israel;Mead;Hills of Galilee Winery;Its hard to fins the delicate balance between a sweet mead and an overly sweet mead, this falls right between the two categories. the taste of honey is the true dominate flavor giving your palate a real shock. still its quite good for the dessert mead crowd
Amiad Winery Mead Honey Wine;Kibbutz Amiad, Israel;Mead;Hills of Galilee Winery;The aroma is strong with honey and citrus. The appearance is light yellow. The flavor is quite sweet and has honey and citrus. The palate is thin. The finish is medicinal and really the only bad thing about it.
Silver City X Anniversary Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Porter - Imperial;Silver City Brewery;Draft at the 2006 Washington Cask Beer Festival. Remember this being a standout. Big fruit and malt nose. Flavor is thick with malt, berry, bit of dirt, and then a NW bitter blast ta boot. Yum!
Silver City X Anniversary Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Porter - Imperial;Silver City Brewery;On tap at the 2007 GABF, I think it was labeled as an imperial porter: Nearly opaque black pour has a wispy dark tan head. Aroma of lightly smoky and roasted dark chocolate malt and dark fruits. Body starts with a good earthy dark chocolate and caramel maltiness finishing slightly more bitter and roasty with lingering dark chocolate. An enjoyable imperial porter.

Silver City X Anniversary Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Porter - Imperial;Silver City Brewery;GABF ’07. Pours black with a small, frothy, light brown head, diminishing with fair lacing.

Maritime Pacific XPA Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;Draft at the jolly. Pours a crystal clear medium amber with a loose and sudsy white head. Big fresh pine and grapefruit nose. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Toasty sweet light mid palate with a sharp and bracing pine resin finish. Goes from nice wet malty caramel to a helmet slap of resin quickly. Not as volcanic as the bigger ipas by any means, but impressive for its body to flavor ratio and its crispness.
Maritime Pacific XPA Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;Draught. Poured red orange with medium head. Hoppy aroma on a roast spine.

Diamond Knot Double Herberts Legendary Red;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Diamond Knot Brewery;Listed as a collaboration between Mcmenamin’s, Scuttlebutt, and Lazy Boy. Not sure if this is the same beer. Don’t know if this was an Irish Red being that all the other Herbert’s are either IPA’s, IIPA’s, or ASA’s. Whatever. Amber pour thin head. The aroma is a nice mix of malt and hops, toasty sweet, with that signature floral, and to me peppery DK hop aroma. Nice caramel malts, some sweetness, and a nice floral earthy finish. Some lingering resins as well. These Herberts are all pretty good stuff.

Slight grassy/buttery scents almost like a chardonnay....hmmm... Apricots, cherries and a sticky sweet body touched with cereals and sugars. Decent example of the style, hides the alcohol well.

Titanic Brewing Tripel Reserve;Coral Gables, Florida, United States;Tripel;Titanic Brewing Company (USA);Overall impresses by the quality of Titanic. This tripel had a great appearance and aroma. Taste of yeast and fruit flavors.
Titanic Brewing Tripel Reserve;Coral Gables, Florida, United States;Tripel;Titanic Brewing Company (USA);Pours straw pale and hazy. Nose is watermelon, apple, sundry other fruit. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy but small and timid. Tastes playful, yeasty, fruity, sweetish and surprisingly light. Clean. Alcohol is playing hide and seek and winning. Looking forward to another!
Titanic Brewing Tripel Reserve;Coral Gables, Florida, United States;Tripel;Titanic Brewing Company (USA);My Bottom Line: Various citrus fruit and plantanes lace the bready yeast in an enjoyably soft and pillowy flavor profile. This is a simple but pleasant Americanized take on the style. Further Personal Perceptions: -A thick sheet of foam covers the cloudy yellow blond. -The creamy, delicate carbonation works hand in hand with the flavor profile. -The sweetish front benefits from a wise herbal hop support. -Alcohol never shows. -The timid aroma is disappointing. -Guanabana and starfruit come to mind...I’m having fun with this one, can you tell? On tap at the brewpub.
Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);2014 rating. Pours a foamy bubbly head but doesn't stay too long. Has a clear yellowish appearance. No lacing whatsoever. Aromas of lime, grains and malts. Flavours are fairly sweet, some lemony lime notes. Refreshing and low abv brew for hot summer days, but not something I would drink any other time.
Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A limit shandy with hints of beer. Thin and more than a little too much chemical character.
Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"From Jul 2007 Purchased as a single for US$1.49 at Liquor Shed in Casper. This pours from 12oz bottle a pale gold with a small head of foam. That soon shrinks to just a few islands in the middle of my glass. The smell reminds me of a wine cooler. Fruity, lemon lime. The taste has a lot of lemon and lime flavour to it until about midway through and through the finish where it's quite watery. I'm glad I only bought the 1 bottle. ;^)"
Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);330ml bottle from Cellarbrations, Main beach, Surfers Paradise Pale straw with OK head. Aroma is lime with sulfur/DMS note. Slight bitterness with thin watery bottle - more of a Radler/shandy. For thirst quenching purposes only.
Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Straight from bottle. Another lawnmower beer. Refreshing when you are hot and wish to down something quickly. Cold filtered water though might do the trick even better. Also good to put six or so in the Esky when you have a large gathering as there is always someone who will prefer this to beer (who has never had anything other than a macro lager). E.g. me 15 years ago.
Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);355ml bottle. Old rate. Shitty macro alcopop meets adjunct lager bullshit, avoid

Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is a summer beer for the beach. It is a clear pale yellow colour and tastes like lime.
Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Single 355 ml bottle from the grab bin at Park Lane Liquor Store, served in a footed Big Rock lager glass. Part one of a mini-series of light lagers, ticked and rated. Pours a highly carbonated, golden straw yellow with a pearly white head that pops, crackles, and vanishes, leaving some lace web fragments. Aroma is sweet cereals, lime, and grassiness; flavor is faintly lager-like with dominant, semi-ersatz lime. Thin mouthfeel, but finishes crisply, though the strong lime essence sticks around longer than I’d care for. A serviceable cerveza with nothing horribly off-putting; it’ll quench thirst handily. Note: this review is for ""Miller Chill Lime"" found in Canada, which has no mention of ""Chelada Style"" or salt on the label; judging by other reviews below, ""chelada"" apparently is Spanish for ""revolting""."
Miller Chill Chelada Style;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle: I’ll be honest. Back before I liked craft beer & drank solely for the social purposes of drinking, Bud Light Lime was my beer of choice. I didn’t really care for Bud Light (aka BEER AS I KNEW IT) back then, so the Lime helped to distract the fact that I was essentially drinking rain water. I remember trying Labatt Blue Light Lime for the first time & thinking it was even better. I also remember seeing Miller Chill for the first time & getting excited like a school girl, only to be extremely let down compared to its two competitive brethren. By far the worst of the three (we are talking bronze medalist of the Special Olympics, here). Lime is actually the heaviest but comes off as way too artificial, distracting, & cloying. Weird salty notes don’t help either. Kind of vegetal. Astringent, metallic. Shitty. Honestly if you want a MACRO MADE lime lager, LBL-Lime is the way to go.

Green Flash Le Freak;San Diego, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Green Flash Brewing Company;Grassy hop aroma with a little citrus on the side. Crystal clear golden medium yellow with a billowing white head. Pineapple sweetness hits first with a little taste of orange. Then a full on Saison flavor comes bursting in with hay, coriander and a touch of lemon. Nice alcohol bite that cuts through the sweetness and keeps things nice and balanced. A full malt body and tastes develops that adds a lot to the mouthfeel and flavor. Finishes sweet and dry with a little residual earthy bitterness. Very interesting combination of styles done in an excellent way.

It’s cloudy dark amber with a long lasting head. It’s got tons of plum, banana and spice in the nose--a real fruitcake of a beer. This is a bit too sweet bit does have a nice toffee malt character and rich, thick texture to show for it. Tasty Belgian. If it was dry, it would be excellent.
Rock Bottom Bellevue MaryJane Tripel;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Tripel;Rock Bottom Bellevue;On tap at the brewpub. I’ve slagged this brewer before for favoring brewhouse efficiency over flavor, but this beer is a surprising break from the formula. Pours clear bright copper with a lacy white head. Sweet spiced peach aroma. Full, almost syrupy body with moderate carbonation. Spicy sweet taste of fruit and nuts with a dash of citrus hops. A tasty beer!
Redoak American IPA;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught at Redoak, Sydney. Pours amber with a medium beige head that lingered. Aroma and flavour of tropical fruit, apricot and a great hit of hops. Medium bodied with great bitterness through to the finish, with more fruit. very well balanced and surprisingly smooth. A very tasty and fun IPA. Edit - had this in July 09 but moved rating to correct beer descriptor.
Redoak American IPA;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Huge hop aromas, definitely smells good and very inviting to take a swig. Flavour does not disappoint, dominated by citrus and floral hops, good underlying malt, hop flavours kick in mid palate and last for ages. An excellent example of an IPA, very delicious!
Redoak American IPA;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;On tap 01.17.09 at the Red Oak, thanks to kempicus for recommending this place. Hazy orange amber, off white head. Aroma is hoppy citrus and floral. Flavor is very hoppy and bitter with some wet graham cracker and slight peat. The aroma and the flavor would stand to be more crisp.
Redoak American IPA;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Big cascade hop aroma, clear gold colour, nic ethick white head. Mild floral hop mouthfeel, as warmed up citrus orange coingthrough. Nice hoppy mouthfeel that lingers for ages.
Redoak American IPA;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"On tap at the Redoak (Pint). Let this warm up for a good 2 hours prior to tasting. Arrived a light orangery bronze with a small white collar of foam that was mostly lasting. Strong note of piney hops and stone fruit in the aroma with apricots, nectarines, caramel malts, toffee, marmalade, grapefruit and some resin. Flavor was very similar to aroma with a good piney hop bitterness (not as intense as expected, but very pleasant), caramel malts, toffee, marmalade, apricots, nectarines, mandarin and some resin in the finish. Very well hidden alcohol content, seemed around 5%. Medium bodied with soft carbonation, a quite dry, slightly resinous mouthfeel, an almost oily texture and a great finish. Very well balanced; great hop to malt ratio, that being said it could of done with a bit more hop punch, after all it is suppose to be an “American” IPA."
Redoak American IPA;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tough to pick teh difference between this beer and the IPA. Beautiful white creamy head and thick lacing. Dark orange in colour with an attractive dark amber glow. Big nose of fruity hops and malt sweetness. Very soft and appealing. Seems to step back a gear to taste although the beer was served too cold (is there a common theme here?). More floral hops poke through later and the beer gets progressively firmer and bitter. Much more balanced than the somewhat abrasive IPA.
Redoak American IPA;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;A fantastic IPA. I am sad I never got to try their english IPA (the original Red Oak IPA) but this beer has perfect strong alpha tastes and is excellently rounded. delicious!

As ""Salitos Cerveza"". Clear bottle Mexican style with print directly on the bottle. Some hovering versions of the Earth, a horse driven cart and some rural buildings on the label. Promises me an ""Superior Lager"". Pours clear yellow with small white head. Settles as thin patch of foam drifting around in the middle of the glass. Moderate lacing. Aroma is malty sweet with a light fruity sourness. Sweet pale malts, corn, wet cardboard. Light hints of lemon. Some metallic odor lurking in the background. Strong fizzy carbonation. Thin, watery, very lively texture. Flavor is quite sweet followed by a moderate sour bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetish. Lingers shortly. If they try to imitate an Mexican Lager they do a pretty good job. It is both too sweet and too watery."

Heavy Seas Holy Sheet (1997-2012);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;"Sampled in 2011 after aging since 2008. This pours murky, reddish brown with a quickly dissipating thin head. Very light carbonation. Aroma is malty and sweet with raisin and bready notes and no hops presence. Tastes overly sweet with some alcohol noticeable. Mild fruit, cardboard, and no bitterness whatsoever. Finishes cloyingly sweet and warming. Once again, this one falls flat because of too much time spent in the bottle. This one had some potential; it might have been nice a while back."

Heavy Seas Holy Sheet (1997-2012);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;It has a deep garnet color body with good clarity and some nice viable carbonation flowing up to the surface. On top is an average size light tan head. It hangs on well as I drink it slowly fades to a thin covering that lasts to the end. On the glass the head leaves behind some spotty lacing. The aroma has a sweet candy like nose that reminds me of cherry flavored Jolly rancher candy. Its flavor has a big malty sweetness with the same cherry candy notes as in the aroma. There is also a slight cherry chough syrup like alcoholic touch in there. Hop bitterness and flavor are mild and really only show up in the finish where they try in vain to balance the malt sweetness. On the palate it has a slightly thin feel for the sweetness and nice average carbonation. Overall I feel this one was a bit on the sweet side with a simple raw character.
Heavy Seas Holy Sheet (1997-2012);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Poured an amber color, aromas of caramel, dark fruit, light spice, and some molasses. Flavors are the same with a light sweet aftertaste.
Heavy Seas Holy Sheet (1997-2012);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Bottle. The pour was a dark cranberry brown with a large (2-3 finger) light tan creamy head that diminished down to a thin layer and large collar of residue, thus producing some really good sheets of streaky lacing. The aroma was of a dark bread malt and a sweet doughy yeast with notes of dark fruit (plums and raisins), brown sugar and a mild ruby port scent. The taste was sweet, malty and a bit acidic with hints of port wine and brown sugar early on and then became sweetly acetic with a good strong note of dark fruit and a decent alcohol finish. The flavor lasted an average time proceeding the swallow with a nice fruity alcohol warming sensation at the end. Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy in texture with a mildly soft carbonation. Overall a fantastic Abbey Ale with the fruit, malts and alcohol working very well together. YUM...
Heavy Seas Holy Sheet (1997-2012);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Not the most original taste from Clipper City’s other beers. Somewhat bitter. But not a bad beer. If this is the only Clipper City brew at a store or bar, I’d buy it.
Heavy Seas Holy Sheet (1997-2012);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Thanks to my friend Greg for grabbing this one! Cloudy mahogany pour, smallish head. Nose and flavor are rife with sweet caramel, molasses, touches of vinous port and wood, almond, and fig. A bit too sweet for the style, but as a beer it’s pretty well done.
Heavy Seas Holy Sheet (1997-2012);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;22 ounce bottle, no date on it but I’m pretty sure it’s about a year or so old since I know I’ve had this bottle a while. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a ruby red/copper color with about a half inch light tan head and some sediment floaties noticeable. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums), caramel, bready malt, and some brown sugar. The brew tastes like dark fruit (mostly plums), bready malt, caramel, wood, and a slight bitter flavor that I can’t identify. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it’s a bit slick and has good carbonation. I think it’s a good brew, I enjoyed it.
Heavy Seas Holy Sheet (1997-2012);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Dubbel;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;"Clipper city brewing, heavy seas, Holy Sheet uber abbey ale. Yep, that’s a mouthful, and so is this beer. Coming from just outside of Baltimore, Clipper City has made some serious headway in the world of craft beer. Their Loose Cannon has become one of the most popular craft beers in our store, and their seasonal are always worth grabbing. This brew tonight is their limited Holy Sheet ""uber abbey ale"". At about 9% abv, its definitely going to be uber something. It pours out a dark amber color, with medium head. The foam is unusually tiny bubbles, but fades quickly. At nine percent alcohol, I’m not surprised by how quickly the foam disappears. The Holy Sheet smells like a malt bomb, and I’m getting excited! My first sip reveals tons of complexity, malty goodness, and a little bit of booziness. I’m getting flavors of toffee and caramel, with plenty of sweet malty flavors like vanilla and honey. The Holy Sheet reminds me of a blend of two of my favorite beers, the Chimay Grande Reserve and Delirium Nocturnum. Medium to full bodied, a bit on the boozy side, with just the right amount of malty sweetness. I’m a big fan of the Holy Sheet, I recommend it highly."
Big Horn Honey Bunches of Oats;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Sweet, berry/fruit juice aroma.

Amager Christianshavn Pale Ale;Kastrup, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Amager Bryghus;Expired bottle from de Caigny in Essen, Belgium. The beer is golden to amber colored and has a large and stable white head, with nice carbonation. The aroma is malty with caramel notes, but mostly hoppy, with fruits (citrus, grapefruit), grass, pines and a hint of spices. The taste is light to medium bodied with a malt character where caramel is noticable, and changes into a light dryness with pines, fruits (peaches, grapefruits, citrus) and some spices. The finish is refreshingly dry and bitter, which is long noticable.

Amager Dragør Tripel;Kastrup, Denmark;Tripel;Amager Bryghus;Remarkably nice continuous and dense foam is the first thing you notice about Dragor Tripel. The aroma is very kind of real and you sense distinct citrus and mango. The fruit flavor is the most prominent impression, but a little malt may also be noticed. The flavor is very sweet and fruity and almost immediately enters the alcohol with a good heat and a somewhat strong character. Initial reaction from my side was a quiet thrill but after some time, turning a full taste of exotic fruits back with a light malty background. The foam is still quite eminent and keeps well in both taste and smell, even after a long time. It is almost impossible to bestow up without floating yeast residues in the glass, but little tissue in the glass is not something that deters me. A fantastic full-bodied and warming triple that certainly is on par with the big Belgian classics.

Amager Batch One;Kastrup, Denmark;Strong Ale - American;Amager Bryghus;500 ml bottle Hidden in the back of the cellar I found this well aged bottle. Surprisingly it has held up extremely well though I can tell the edges are a bit rough. If you happen to be sitting on any I would not wait much longer to crack them open. AROMA / APPEARANCE Long creamy legs and a cocoa head pair well with the dense base. Musty sherry feels mellow and cool despite a heady aspect which gives away the near 10% ABV. FLAVOR / PALATE Red wine and dusty chocolates warm the tongue. Soon after a wave of sherry and honey settles in. The full bodied transition borders on cloying yet stays enjoyable. The thick mouthfeel even manages to not overstay its welcome despite this clearly being a nightcap. It would be interesting to have put it up against a fresh bottle for contrast.
Amager Batch One;Kastrup, Denmark;Strong Ale - American;Amager Bryghus;Draft at FOB. Pours beautiful reddish brown, fairly transparent, with moderate white foam, very fine. Aroma is herbaceous, tropical, fruity. Body is very dense with good carbonation. Taste is intensely bitter. Some sweetness too, in the back, but buried in all those hops. Finish is long and bitter, maybe excessive.

The aroma and flavor have sweet malts, caramel, dark fruit, raisins, mild citrus notes, mild to moderate bitterness to the finish, good.
Amager Batch One;Kastrup, Denmark;Strong Ale - American;Amager Bryghus;Bottle. Moderate malt notes of roasted grain, nutty and cookie, light to moderate cooked orange peel for the hops, dough and leather for the yeast, with toffee, date and canned cherries in the background. Head is small to average, frothy, light beige, with excellent lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is murky medium reddish brown. Flavor starts moderately to heavily sweet and slightly acidic, then finishes moderately sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium to full, oily, with a soft carbonation and a lightly alcoholic and tangy finish. Maybe a bit out of balance, but this is a tasty and satisfying Barley Wine.

Gorskie Mocne;Jedrzejow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);No 454 Rated: 14.07.2008 Can, 500 ml Appearance: Pours pale golden, medium carbonated and perfectly clear body texture, head is white, foamy, initially small and decreasing to a minimal froth, there is no lacing. Aroma: Clean, slightly alcoholic with some wet, grainy touch hidden at the background, wet soil, some accidity, watered down not praticulary interesting hops, rather gentle in general assumption and not particulary inviting. Flavour: Very wattery, mineral and thin body with a kind of nasty aftertaste, watered down poor quality hops, on the other hand very soft and easy going with no alcohol in flavour, dishwater aftertaste, slightly salty, finish duration is short. Palate: Body is light, texture is wattery, carbonation on palate is medium, finish feel is gently chalky but generally flat.

Town Hall Red Ochre Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;my first taste of this new Irish Red Ale comes directly from the growler in to a glass... Clear and completely red in appearance, with a more than adequate supply of foam up above, a creamy, puffy cap. Good. Nose is all malt and fruit, grape and cherry, with a small quotient of hops in attendance, sweet, livley, lovely. Tasting: juuuust right, a nice meld of hops and malt, just enough of both for the style...well, maybe enough for me, too much for others...easy drinking, lean bodied, fully flavored, sleek, yet multi-faceted, much going on here, more than a mere drinker, this....nothing wrong with that, nay, so much the better...a tasty malty, hoppy toss ’em backer just meant for what I now discover is known as the St. Patrick’s Season. (Why on Earth should the Irish get only a day, when Germany gets a whole month?)(Quick, Belgium, invent a holiday!) ’tis a good red ale, tickles my tastebuds plenty.
Town Hall Red Ochre Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Normally irish reds don’t interest me all that much, since they are usually malt dominated with little use of hops. This was a refreshing brew. Caramel, light fruit, make this a good session drinker. There is enough flavor to keep me at least intrigued.
Town Hall Red Ochre Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Red-amber color. Biscuity caramel aroma with hints of cranberry. Strong medium malt taste with a tint of floral hops at the finish. Incredibly easy and inoffensive, likely to both the discerning and the non-discerning. Almost as if it’s made to be consumed en masse by the almost Irish hordes.
Town Hall Red Ochre Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Brown Amber Color with White Ring. Sweet Caramel Malt and Fruited Aroma. Toasted Malt Notes...Biscuity...A Solid Hop Charge..Notably Amarillo... Overall A Notably Present Hopped Irish Ale, But Still Balanced Enough to Make you Come Back for More... Balanced Clean Aftertaste....with Some Lingering Dry Hops on the Palate Afterwards. Not Being a Hop Head. I Still Found This to be an Enjoyable Seasonal.
Town Hall Red Ochre Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap at pub. clear Reddish/copper with a light tan head. Great sweet malt backbone. Very easy drinking and a nice change of pace from the hop bombs.
Town Hall Red Ochre Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"On-tap at the brewpub: Nice dark orangey bronzed color, quite clear and maintaining a decent capping of off-whitened foam on top. Lace is minimal in a few small specks, spots, and thin sheets. Aroma is fair, mild, and clean; drying with a hint of spicy hop notes adding a grassy herbalness and has a bit of pale sweet red maltyness thats a bit like a mild cherry soda or marmalade and some stale bread. Flavor is good with a nice clean profile of tender, light malty sweetness thats dry of breads and grains with a hint of cherry and orange fruityness tugging at the middle. Nice herbal grassy finish that lasts for great length. A very nice finisher that lends itself well to being a good drinker. Feel is broad and clean with a mediumish body. Firm on the palate with a slight tender dryness mixed with an even lighter sweetness makes for a nice start. finish is the key and by far the most complexing and subtle character of the beer where grassy herbal hop notes dry out with a miraculous noton of length and body. Yet stays even and balanced without giving away the farm. Its no huge beer by any means. A very simple, subtle, well made beer that’ll suit a whole lot of sessioning with an impressionable finishing stance."
Mitchells Millwood Premium;Knysna, Western Cape, South Africa;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mitchells Knysna Brewery;Draught at Paquitas, Knysna Koppe. Pale amber coloured. Light fruity aroma. Light fruity flavour with a slightly sourish touch. Rather bland. It did not seem to be in very good condition.
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;kind of a hybrid schwarz.black IPA. Mainly roast, caramel and dark malts, but well hoppier than any normal schwarzbier. Good.
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;hazy tea color, Wispy top. Empty caramel nose, faint toast. Flavor similarly soft, orange and caramel amidst playdoh and light vegetal. Sticky and thin, sugars are thin.
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;Poured amber with a white head. Aroma of pine. Some chocolate and citrus flavors. Different.
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;On tap at 1702 during Rogue night - Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. Light lacing. Aroma is roasted malt and coffee. Flavor is a bitter roasted malt. Palate is left bitter and a tad dry. Seems a little thin. A decent beer.
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;Comes out of the tap a rich, opaque chocolaty brown, almost black, with a thick and fine-bubbled dark tan head. Aroma is quite strong, like roast coffee with a strong chocolate undertone. Mouth-filling flavor has strong coffee and chocolate components along with nutty and smoky hints and a molasses undertone. Texture is thick and smooth. A must for all dark beer fanatics!
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;Black with a mocha head. Aroma is roasty with chocolate, and caramel. Taste is roasty, chocolate, caramel, and very roasty if I haven’t said that already.
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;On tap at the Tap and Mallet (Rochester), graciously shared by Lubiere. AU15/08. App.: Black with remnants of a tan head. Aroma: Lots of C-hops, a bit of dark malt, some coffee and dark chocolate, quite a lot of pine and grapefruit. Palate: Medium+ body, fairly full carbonation. Flav.: Lots more C-hops, some malt but less than the nose, kinda fruity, dry with good bitterness. An enjoyable twist on the normal BB.
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;Brown-black with a very creamy brown head. Strong aroma of hops and to a lesser extent roasty malt. Taste is extremely bitter, as the name (which I did not know at the time of tasting) now suggests. It’s like a black IIPA with an underlying sweetness that borders on cloying. $6.5/pint
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;"Sampled on Tap at 1702, Tucson AZ This beer arrives with a brown tinged, tan colored, creamy textured, one-finger thick head. The beer is a very dark brown color and quite clear. The aroma smells of chocolate / cocoa and toasted malt up front and once you start to dig around, some notes of pine and citrus. As the beer warms up a bit the hop character becomes much more noticeable in the nose and actually ends up on equal footing with the malt in the aroma. The flavor is so much more hop focused than I expected (based on the aroma at least); there is a ton of bitterness, lots of pine flavors and notes of candied citrus peel. This is definitely a bit green in its hop intensity, a bit astringent, but still nicely balanced for a very hoppy beer (e.g. it doesn’t get too harsh). This is really an super hoppy IPA that was brewed with dark malts. There is a touch of roasted, toasty grain and maybe a touch of chocolate that struggles to be noticed through all of the hop character. This is quite quaffable with a light-medium fullness that is just enough to carry the hops. Quite a tasty beer, enjoyable if you have a hop-hankering and the dark malt adds a light, other-dimensioned note to what is otherwise a hoppy IPA."
Rogue Black Brutal;Newport, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - India / Hoppy;Rogue Ales;On tap at the Drafting room. Strong aroma of roasted coffee. Very thick mouthfeel, deep malty flavor.

Foamy off-white head. Fruity; grapefruit and orange citrus. Hoppy; grassy hops. Malty; grainy malts, caramel. Good stuff. Quality Bitter. (2016-10-06)"
Oakham Asylum;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Gravicask (StABF2016) (5:4:5:3-:10=2.7-) Sickly sweet pungent hop aroma. Messy marmalade. Misty orange. Sweet and sticky in the mouth, some starch, messy and pungent. Palate is actually slick. Poor, not on form - not even attenuated properly, IMHO.
Oakham Asylum;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Cask gravity dispense at Craft 100, as ’Oakham Asylum’. Amber orange, hazy, clear, no head.

Golden brown, clear with a thin almost-white head on top. Pithy grapefruit aroma with some floral notes and biscuit malt. Ambrosial taste. Sweet without being sickly, and just held back by the bittering hop. Soft waves of citrus wash over the tongue to the balances, grapefruit-laden finish. Medium body, smooth texture. An absolute gem of a beer.
Oakham Asylum;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Draught at Holy in Stoke. Well put together, another good beer from Oakham. Citrussy and refreshing.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask @ Castle Hotel, Manchester. Clear golden with a creamy head. It's a smooth malty ale, with its malts heavy in its aroma.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask at The Roebuck, Leek (Titanic) A clear deep amber colour with a medium off white head. Aroma of caramel, some bready malts, slight fruit and subtle earthy hops. Taste of caramel, toffee, some bready malts, subtle fruit and slight earthy hops. Light bodied and soft carbonation. A dryish, earthy hop bitterness in the finish. A big standard bitter. Easy drinking, inoffensive.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask@Newark Beer Festival 2010. Dark bronze beer with a roasted and bitter aroma. The flavour is nicely roasted and bitter with a slightly yeasty finish. Overall a nice roasted beer.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask in the market porter. Alround rating: Roasty ruby mild malt character, some roastybitterness, but the sweetness dominates and makes it nice and tasty.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Half pint from the Palmerston Arms, Peterborough. Poured dark brown with a fizzy tan head. Moderate roasted malt aroma with a decent amount of coffee notes. Thin bodied. The coffee comes through in the taste along with the roastiness. I thought this was pretty good and would be better if there was some body to it.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. A dark brown coloured beer with a ruby hue, and a tan head. The aroma is fruity with a hint of sour acidity. Again fruit and a little acid in the taste. Pretty thin and forgetful.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask (handpump) at the Pembury Tavern, Hackney, London. Deep, dark, chestnut colour with no head. Surprisingly dark for a 4.0% bitter. Bags of toffeeish malt on the nose. More chewy caramel malt and touches of liquorice in the flavour. Mellow and smooth mouthfeel. The relatively low bitterness makes this something of a one trick pony (boom boom) but the quite full body gives this a warming, wintery feel.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask@The Pembury Tavern, Hackney. Nutty and dry, with some earthy hop characters in the finish. Quite easy drinking. A touch broing, but quite drinkable.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);A Mes rate: Cask at the Pembury Tavern. Too watery. Nice roasted notes in the aroma and flavour. Nothing too bitter like about it in the aroma but it’s almost there in the flavour but only really due to the hoppy finish. Creamy malt all round really. Odd but ok.
Brewster's Cheval Mort;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask handpull at Pembury Tavern March BF 07. Very deep chestnut/brown colour with lasting bubbly beige head. Quite a malty bitter. Malt aroma, malt flavour, bit of choc in mouth. Spicy hop finish. Bit spritzy in the mouth. Decent malty bitter.
Milton Elysium;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Milton Brewery;Cask at the Pembury Tavern, March 2007. Almost black but actually an extremely dark brown. Chock full of choc in the aroma and flavour. Bitter chocolate / cocoa that is. Also bags of roast and rather burnt malt, which accentuates the bitterness and disguises an underlying slight sweetness. Maybe just a little light in weight but otherwise very good and an emphatically enjoyable brew.
Milton Elysium;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Milton Brewery;Cask@the Pembury Tavern, Hackney. Good stout, tastes like they have put vanilla and/or chocolate into this. Quite velvety, with coffee ice cream and mocha flavours. Vanilla notes also obvious. Has a tendency to be sweet, but the roasyness in the finish helps you to forget that a little bit.
Milton Elysium;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Milton Brewery;Cask gravity at Pembury Tavern BF March 2007. Black beer with thin beige head. Coffee-ish aroma, grainy. Nice intensity, especially the chocolate. Bit of hot alcohol. Pretty good stout. Malt is ok, maybe a bit of vanilla too. Bit of whiskyish malt maybe?
Milton Elysium;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Milton Brewery;A Mes rate: Seem to remember this being a gravity dispense cask. Festival special maybe? It’s not on their website. In my experience Milton do a pretty damn good stout and this was no exception. So much dark chocolate. Reminds me of cocoa powder specifically. Absolutely glorious. The aroma was almost an 8. Just so chocolate dominated that I felt I wanted just a little bit more. More chocolate in the flavour with plenty of roasted dark malt. Usual coffee and dark fruit as you would expect and then drying towards the finish. But damn that chocolate, it’s great. I’m sure there must be some added, I’ll have to check.
Milton Elysium;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Milton Brewery;cask @ pembury festival. Black with a malty ring for a head. Aroma of chocolate and coffee. It has a strange medicinal character - reminds me of cough syrup. Taste of roasted malts, black coffee and sweetish cherries. Tingles a bit on the tongue, but overall pretty smooth as expected.
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;473ml can. Big, creamy, mocha head. Almost completely black, tiny hint of red around the edge when held up to the sun. Roasty malt aroma, hints of chocolate and coffee, but mostly pure malt. Aroma is not strong. Thin taste and body. Body is watery but still cream. Flavours are subdued. Overall, it was good, but only good. Should have been more.
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;473ml can. Pours a black color with a nice beige head. Aroma of chocolate, some roast malts. Taste is roasted malts, some coffee again. A decent stout, but there are better ones out there.
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;"May 7 2012. 463ml can poured into pint glass. All hockleys pour with a big thick head. Very bubbly carbonated head fades quickly. Colour is solid black; tad brown in light. Aroma is malty and hints of bitter chocolate. Taste is subdued malts with accents of chocolate and grains. Some hops gives an odd salty feel and almost sour aftertaste. Leaves an odd balance in mouthfeel. Thought this one would be my favourite hockley but maybe not."
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;It’s ok but way too thin of a stout for my tastes. Not enough flavour. What does exist there is fairly good though, just too subdued, so I’m not rating it as low as it otherwise would get, they know what they’re doing they’re just not doing it enough.
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;463ml can poured into pint glass. The foamy brown head quickly explodes to subdue half the glass. Man, this is one black beast! (Lovibond 39) As dark as a Guinness!? Head is soapier than the dense Guinness head. Smells faintly malty and chocolatey. Taste is refreshing and lightly sweet. Wonderful accents of chocolate and grains. No aftertaste. Just after thoughts (that is, I was considering cracking open another!) Low to moderate carbonation. This really is superb.
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;Fan of stouts & expect a watery taste to stouts under 5%. 2 finger head witch is brown and cola like. Jet black beer. Smells oif sourness,veary light roastness & chocolate. taste is too much cold water,then a tad hint of sourness mabye. A little hop agressive bit of some sort,plus light dusting of roastedness & chocolate. Doesn’t seem balanced proerly in my opinion. I’d perfer some water taste gone and the other flavours stronger. It’s okay. Stout fan but better stouts are out there. Not bad btw. Cheer’s!
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;500ml can pours almost black in color with a finger of beige head that retains decently and leaves a thin spotty lace on the glass. Aroma is chocolate and coffee with some roast malts. Taste is roasted malt bitterness with some chocolate malty sweetness and hints of coffee with a faint hop presence. Body is a little thin for this style and carbonation is decent. Overall, this is a decent stout which is easy to drink and quite tasty.
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;Pours black with a disappearing brown head. Aroma is weak, extremely mild roasted malt smell. The taste is quite dry but the finish is sharp and short. It’s an alright stout and moderately refreshing but thin bodied and forgettable.
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;Brown-black body and dark beige foamy head but it disappears too fast. Sweet molasses aroma. Flavour is burnt barley, but not too strong as the mouthfeel is rather weak. Odd hints of fermented chocolate in there, too. This ain’t a good stout either.
Hockley Valley Stout;Orangeville, Ontario, Canada;Stout - Dry;Hockley Valley;Can. Very dark pour. Coffee and chocolate as predicted. Not too bad, but the Dark is better.

Iron Springs Honey Bunny Blonde;Fairfax, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Iron Springs Pub and Brewery;Tap at the West Coast Brew Fest 2010. Pours darkish gold with a creamy white head. Light malty aroma with a hint of honey. Flavor is a bit grainy/papery with mild sweetness. There’s a bunch of bitter though. That makes it really good - especially in the finish.

Iron Springs Honey Bunny Blonde;Fairfax, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Iron Springs Pub and Brewery;Just not much here ... although a very clean brew. Murky, light amber tending toward gold. Medium, white head that lingers as film relatively nicely. Not much aroma. Malty ... Not much in terms of flavor ... also malty. Medium-light bodied. No aftertaste. Clean, just not much there ... more than the sum of its parts though and highly drinkable!
Mogollon Woody Mountain Porter;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Porter;Mogollon Brewing Company;On tap 1702. Deep black with thin cocoa head. Light aroma of smoke. First sip really comes with big smoke. But still not overpowering. Really nice balance of dark malt. Smoky finish. Really nice.
Mogollon Woody Mountain Porter;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Porter;Mogollon Brewing Company;Sampled at 1702, Tucson, November 2011,br> The beer arrives from the tap with a ½-finger thick, lightly browned, dark tan colored head. The beer is a concentrated brown / amber color that shows a clear, slightly lighter version of the same when held up to the light. The aroma has a nice smokiness to it that adds a savory almost meaty quality to the nose. The smoke is easily the most dominant note here and when the beer is cold I am having a hard time smelling anything else. An underlying toasted, brown grain character comes out a bit more as the beer warms up. The beer has a soft prickly carbonation to it up front, but this doesn’t keep the body from have a nice, viscous feeling richness to it that just lingers on the palate. The finish has a sort of bitterness to it that is contributed by some roast character. The roast contributes a soft, supporting, toasted grain character to this beer that accentuates the dominant smoky character. The smoke character is quite smooth and well integrated, but it is easily the most dominant flavor in this beer. There is an underlying caramelized malt character here that seems to boost the balanced smokiness and savory character of this beer more than anything, but it does suggest at a caramelized sweetness and also some of the toasted, biscuit like malt notes. As the beer warms up more of a malt sweetness starts to become noticeable. Perhaps a touch simplistic, but it is certainly hitting the spot right now. The smokiness, while dominating, is smooth and savory enough to work quite well with the supporting cast that makes up the rest of this beer’s profile. I could easily drink a few pints of this and be quite content. If you are a sucker for smoke beers then you will like this, if not, then you will likely hate it.
Mogollon Woody Mountain Porter;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Porter;Mogollon Brewing Company;Pours the usual dark brown porter color, some reddishness to it, although the lighting at Mogollon’s wasn’t stellar (never is). Head was thin and didn’t yield much lacing. Aroma was heavy roast and coffee. The flavor was strong roasted malts, light coffee, firm smoke, firm peat presence. Mouthfeel was moderate for the style and acidic. Not really bad, not great.

Riegele Golden Seit 1386;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauhaus Riegele;Bottle from my Advent calender. Don’t like the design, looks like an alcopop. I understand the point is to show off the golden color, but precipitation in a clear glass bottle is very unsexy too! Another sin (for a collector): blank bottle cap. Luckily it gets better after opening the bottle. The aroma is the best part and reminds me of an american pale ale with lots of nice hops. It starts like that in the mouth too, but almost no bitterness follows. Goes down very smoothly and leaves behind a light afterimage of the initial aroma. The beer is better than it looks, but why does it have to look so bad?
Riegele Golden Seit 1386;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauhaus Riegele;Bottle at home. #7 of my advendkalender. Hazy golden beer, small head, some yeast in the bottle. Aroma is citrus, lemon and yeast. Taste is the same. quite nice.

Rather sweet with light body. Exquisite flavour of chocolate and plum brandy. A beer this light requires very soft mouthfeel to work in my opinion. This one has the flavour, but the mouthfeel is hard, reducing my enjoyment significantly.

How: Tap at brewpub The look: Dark golden body topped by a small off-white head In long: A medium intensity nose of leafy, citrusy and grassy hops. Taste has typical toasted caramelized malts followed by a citrusy, pine-needles and leafy hops. Bitterness level is medium. I’ve had IPAs just like this one a hundred times. Nothing memorable but pleasant to drink nonetheless. Better than I expected after walking in that awful awful place that is Abbey Wright.

Bullfrog Trippel Trubbel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Bullfrog Brewery;750 mL bottle. Poured hazy medium orange with a short-moderate cap of off-white head. The aroma picked up a huge dose of tart lighter fruit skins, floral notes, and peppery alcohol over semi-sweet honey.. the blend of components was enjoyable, but it was a touch heavy-handed. The flavor found honey and sliced lighter fruits at the core (think green apple, pear, and some honeydew).. black pepper, tart fruit skins (and maybe a little oak), and a pinch of cinnamon around.. alcohol amplified everything.. spicy, tart finish.. again a bit assertive. Heavier-bodied with thick carbonation on the palate.. OK feel overall, but hot at times. Solid brew.

Poured a dark brownish black with a minimal fuzzy head. Lots of solid dark malts fighting with some big hops here. Quite aggressive for Baird. Well done, although wouldn’t go out of my way at some 1300 yen a pint
Baird First Impact;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;Black and mysterious. Smell of raisins and leaves, Assam tea baked in sunshine, blackberry pie, figs encased in rum pudding. Complex yet so drinkable. Simply fantastic...Baird’s best brew, by far.
Baird First Impact;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;My Bottom Line: This bountiful India Black Ale offers a scintillating kaleidoscope of hop resins, blackberry fruitiness and roasted maltiness that dazzles the tastebuds throughout the glass. Quite bitter, it still presents balance within its intensity. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the ruby black. -The hops possess citrusy tips. -Alcohol is not a factor in the flavor profile at all. -This is really similar to their Divine Vamp III...although in a slightly more intense presentation. On tap at Ushitora.
Baird First Impact;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Baird Brewing Co.;"Had this at ""Ushitona"" in the Shimokitazawa district ofTokyo with TimE. We both selected this as our first beer that night! A dark brown cola colored brew, no head to mention. Strong citrus/pine hop scent with plenty of rich malt sweetness to balance. Fruity, rich, like a prune dessert (flambes?) A delicious lingering bitterness follows. Tim is writing notes that rival War & Peace, he said ""This beer is awesome"", I agree!"
Grisette Country Cool;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;"Another of the Grisette beers commissioned by Saint-Feuillien, with extracts of apple, plums and quinces. Creamy, snow white, stable head, dirty ochre blonde colour with pinkish hue, cloudy. Strong apple cider smell, apple juice, lemon, wheat, grass, plum juice, berry jam, honey; soft orangey and apple-like taste, sugary sweet, wheat and honeyish sweetish malts in the middle, dominated by an artificial, even bit lemonade-like sweetness, soft sourishness in the end, cloyingly sweet. I do not like top-fermented sweet fruit beers but this is a bit better than many others I tasted. Which doesn’t mean it’s good."

West Virginia Baltic Porter;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Porter - Baltic;West Virginia Brewing Company;Oh yes yes yes, a good example of baltic porter well made by the americans. Slight musty aroma. Pour is pitch black and barely any head. Yes, very strong for any porter. Just like a baltic should be, forget about imperial porter! Very much like an imperial stout. Very good example of oppressive dark beer for the lager lover. Carbonation is nearly flat. A little too bitter for my girlie taste buds! I prefer the sweeter porters. However, for a baltic, its in style.
West Virginia Baltic Porter;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Porter - Baltic;West Virginia Brewing Company;Sampled on draught at Penn Microbrewers Fest. Has a light nose to it, with hints of smoke and coffee and a bit of dry hoppiness. Dark brown clear with a small tan head. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Starts with a decent roasted character, with a light sweetness. Good coffee bitterness with a thick roasted taste and mild tang. Carbonic gaseousness, too. Mild bitter dry finish and light aftertaste. A bit watery, but otherwise a pretty stable porter.

West Virginia Baltic Porter;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Porter - Baltic;West Virginia Brewing Company;Drank at the pennsylvania microbrew fest and rated on my phone. dark brown, big tan head. aroma is dominated by roastiness, this would be great aged in a boubon barrel. flat taste and mouthfeel, decent but not great.
West Virginia Baltic Porter;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Porter - Baltic;West Virginia Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at WVB in Morgantown. Appearance was deep brown to black in color, nice initial head, solid lacing. The aroma was light coffee and licorice playing off each other. The flavor was astringent, under attenuated, coffee, very faint chocolate, and faint licorice. Lacked some of the depth and richness offered by the style, more licorice depth, some dark fruits, etc.... The qualities led me to immediately ask the server if West Viriginia had a 6.0 or comparable brewing law, which indeed s/he said it did. That explained the disappointment with this, as it is hard to compete against peers in this style at only 6%.
Mordue Millennium Bridge;North Shields, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mordue Brewery;Cask conditioned handpump Criterion Leicester. A blonde beer with a slight haze and a white bubbly head. Grassy lagery hops in the nose and also, but less so, in the mouth where there are biscuity nmalt flavours also. A little peach. Not bad.

Columbus Brewing Smoked Java Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Columbus Brewing Company;Shared by OhioDad. Lightly smoked coffee aroma is nice. Black body with a thin head. Medium palate. Lots of cappuccino flavors with just a hint of smokiness to be found. Interesting, but just not strong enough. Perhaps it’s the beachwood...

Decent nose malt, chocolate, coffee, and smoke from the beige head floating on top of its dark brown body. Chocolate malt flavors, bakers chocolate, did i say chocolate? finishes slightly dry and bitter. Good beer, it just needs a little more complexity.
Red Rose Fuggles;Great Harwood, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Red Rose Brewery;Brighton Beer Fest. Butterscotch flavour which, thankfully, doesn’t quite insult with diacetyl. The beer is very pale, though slightly hazy. The hops are kept low by the strong butterscotch. Drinkable.
Gribble Slurping Stoat;Oving, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gribble Brewery;Brighton Beer Fest. Remarkably tasty. Sweet and hoppy in an astonishing upward spiral of flavour, texture and harmony. A splendid drop of beer. Lovely. Pale, biscuity, fragrant and very earthy. Mmmm.
Bubes Crazy 8 Imperial IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bubes Brewery;If you like heavy hard hitting IPA, ignore my numbers because this is terribly on style for such a beer. I just don’t care for this style and I rate em as I like em. Slight hop aroma, less than expected for this type of brew. Darker red orange color. Yes, big and strong from the start. However, I’m not sure if it gets into the middle of a double IPA style. Perhaps its because ofthe freshness. Very little co2 but what is there makes it a little palatable to this lager lovers tastebuds. As session continues, that notorious mouth coating buildng back of throat medicinal soapy ipa thing starts to happen and never goes away. Tes, terribly on style for an ipa and it’s fresh!
Bubes Crazy 8 Imperial IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bubes Brewery;Growler shared on a fishing boat. Poured a deep copper with a decent off-white head. Nose is pretty hoppy, with plenty of citrus, fruit, and sweet malt. Taste is similar, though I thought the hops were not as forward as the aroma and the malt backing was a bit weak. The body was lightly carbonated and smooth. Overall, a nice IPA.
Bubes Crazy 8 Imperial IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bubes Brewery;Brewed in the USA....... Courtesy of Rick from Bubes Brewery, thanks. Pours a caramel / amber color with zero head. Aroma of caramel and a hint of citrus. Taste is very malty with some mild hops. Not bad, but it was a week old.
Bubes Crazy 8 Imperial IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bubes Brewery;Growler shared by one of the brewers. He apologized that it was kinda flat, he said that he had been holding onto it for about a week. It was a dark reddish amber with a small collection of off-white bubbles on top. The smells and the taste were full of juicy hops, very citrusy with a hint of pine and light caramel. Had the fullest body of any DIPA that I can remember but wasn’t sticky or cloying. Pretty tasty despite the fact that they can’t dry hop on their system and had to improvise.
Bubes Crazy 8 Imperial IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bubes Brewery;Really nice brew. dark amber colour, nice thick body. not much of an aroma, but has a nice strong bittery hop taste to it.

Highgate Classic;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Aroma hits me with citrus hops but they seem to die away and leave a slightly spicey malt base. Taste is similarly spicey touch honey sweetness off the malts, grass and citrus off the hops very drinkable though perhaps not memorable.

Bootleg Summer Lager;Margaret River, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bootleg Brewery;Presentation looks alright but it stops there. Pale yellow body with a half decent head. Bitter lemon aroma. Not too sweet taste, quite tart but not a lot else.
Milton Gargantua;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at the Pembury Tavern, November 2006. Gingery amber colour. No head. Described as very hoppy but there was not a huge amount of hop in the aroma. In fact it had a rather unexpected hint of smoke. More hoppy on the palate but it is quite a peppery, spicy feel rather than aromatic or floral. Clean and smooth on the palate. Not one of my favourite Milton beers - not as vibrant, and the hops do not make as much of an impression as anticipated. Not bad but I’m doubtful whether this was in tip top condition. (6/3/6/3/11 = 2.9) RE-RATE. Cask at the Pembury Tavern, March 2007. Seemed rather paler in colour - mid gold. The hop character was a little resinous but still not as powerful as suggested, so I guess that’s the way it is. A hint of fruit in the flavour and a slightly chalky mouthfeel. decent but not one of my preferred Milton beers. (6/3/6/3/13 = 3.1) Score ugraded
Milton Gargantua;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;On draught at The Pembury Tavern, Hackney. Clear, deep golden colour with almost no head.

Milton Gargantua;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;cask, 2nd pembury fest. Gold, no head. Sour hops in the nose with malts and orange zest. Taste to match. Light bitter finish. Ok, but fairly basic.
Milton Gargantua;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at the Pembury. Darkish golden colour with no head. Almost tangy hops and plenty of citrus. Hit of alcohol for the finish, Slightly different but one dimensional.
Milton Gargantua;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;Cask@The Pembury Tavern, Hackney. Seems like its sticky, yet i found it quite dry at the same time. Normally i associate sticky characters with sweetness. Lots of resiny, grapefruity type hop characters. I think this lacks a bit of depth. I also found the alcohol quite noticable.
Milton Gargantua;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;Cask gravity at Pembury Tavern BF March 2007. Gold/copper colour, no head. Bit of mineral in the mouth. Some decent sherberty hop. It’s ok, but I expected it to be hoppier from the description. Duff is right the hop is resiny but understated.
Milton Eleutherios;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milton Brewery;Cask at the Pembury Tavern, March 2007. Straw colour with no head to speak of. Distinctly hoppy on the nose, especially for a beer of such modest strength. Very clean and crisp. Not the fullest body but quite hoppy, making for an excellent quaffing beer. In Greek mythology by the way, Eleutherios was an epithet for Dionysus so I guess this may be a variant of that beer, or perhaps a batch where there was a mistake. If so, there was certainly no harm done - I scored it higher than Dionysus.
Milton Eleutherios;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milton Brewery;Cask, Pembury Tavern. Light copper, no head. Spicy citrus hops, dulled by a bit of jam/sherry. Flavor is still bright--nice citrus leaning hops, clean malt, a bit of cinnamon. Nice delicate palate. Feels a bit off it’s stride, but still not bad.
Milton Eleutherios;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milton Brewery;cask @ 2nd pembury festival. Thanks to my strange little friend Andy for letting me sample this one. Uhhh, it smells like dog urine. I’m worried that Andy liked this so much. Watery, hoppy, blah!
Milton Eleutherios;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milton Brewery;A Sim rate (Draught at the Pembury Tavern): Earthy hops. A bit of manure left over from the hopsy soil. Dry hoppy flavour and a little wheaty. Finish of dry wine.

Blakemere Kingfisher;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blakemere Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Wellington, Birmingham 20/04/2007 Some carbonation. Hoppy and citrus aromas. Clear golden coloured fruity hoppy and slightly creamy with a little dryness in a crisp and bitter finish.
Blakemere Kingfisher;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blakemere Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at the Pembury. Diacetyl central in the nose. Taste is a little better. Mainly grassy and hoppy. Made with a half pound of real Cornish butter.
Blakemere Kingfisher;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blakemere Brewery;Cask gravity at Pembury Tavern BF March 2007. Golden colour with disappearing white head. Diacetyl on this beer too. In mouth, some hop, some tea. Still too much butter. Hay style hop on finish is quite strong. Diacetyl ruins it.

Het Anker Gouden Carolus Easter Beer (2007-2009);Mechelen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Anker;2009 bottle consumed in 2011. Light yellow orange pour with big white head. Aroma of Belgian banana wheat and slight hay. Taste was again a very mundane banana and herb thing which just didn’t do it for me. Slight oxidation.
Het Anker Gouden Carolus Easter Beer (2007-2009);Mechelen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Anker;Aromas are bubblegum and mellow berries with soft spices and lots of herbal notes.

Het Anker Gouden Carolus Easter Beer (2007-2009);Mechelen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Anker;2010 drink by. So I guess it is a 2007 bottle. Filthy deep gold, very cloudy, going to brown, with a low head. Big, malty nose, honey, biscuits, sweet orange and herbs. Luscious malt flavor, honey and citrus, bread and biscuits, apple, ripe pears, alcohol, spices. Much depth. Huge, full, silky palate but with just enough carbonation. Much fuller and complex flavor than any aged blonde I have had in years.
Het Anker Gouden Carolus Easter Beer (2007-2009);Mechelen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Anker;Style et résumé: Belgian strong ale brassée pour pâques. Comment: Bouteille de 750ml encore une fois merci Patrick. Description: Cette bière était malheureusement un peu trop vielle, elle commence à se dégrader. La robe est jaune dorée. Le nez est quelque peu oxydé, il y a une touche de miel. La bouche est de miel, sucrée et bien sur oxydée. Du racio et des amandes grillées. Note: 5/10
Het Anker Gouden Carolus Easter Beer (2007-2009);Mechelen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Anker;Une bouteille poussiéreuse qui m’attendait dans le fin fond d’une cave. Donc, une certaine appréhension. Un liquide qui dévoile une robe orangée. Un col mousseux bien mince. C’est pardonnable. Un nez qui présente certainement quelques rides. Des malts doux qui compriment les autres parfums. Du sucre belge, indéniablement. L’impression d’un produit qui a connu un élevage oxydatif. Peut-être des épices et des fruits dans le fond de mon verre. Des saveurs qui sont pourtant loin d’être déplaisantes. Des malts qui tiennent le fort. Des saveurs vineuses qui sont touchées par les années. Une bouche encore bien vivante. Une texture douce dans un corps qui n’est pas trop mince. Une finale dans laquelle les vapeurs d’alcool transportent des pointes épicées. Tout compte fait, une bière capable de se défendre devant les inepties de certains brasseurs.

Kannah Creek Black's Bridge Stout;Grand Junction, Colorado, United States;Stout;Kannah Creek Brewing Company;On tap @ the brewery in Grand Junction. Had both nitro and the cask at the same time. Obviously prefer the cask, which is what I’m rating. Not bittered black earthy malts aroma. Mouthfeel is light and easy drinking yet a shot of dark earth malts and mild malt bitterness. To me, this is a nice dry stout. The nitro is a waste of time. Color is too light, dark brown.

Kannah Creek Black's Bridge Stout;Grand Junction, Colorado, United States;Stout;Kannah Creek Brewing Company;Draft at the Kannah Creek Edgewater pub. Head is fully lasting (nitro). Body is dark brown to black. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (chocolate milk, roasted grain), with notes of vanilla and marshmallow. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Light to medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. Another fairly disappointing, mediocre brew...perplexing since I’ve had fairly good luck with the bottles. I even got a full pint of the Amber (more of less my fave from bottles) but the carbonation was poor and it was otherwise pretty clunky/flabby and lifeless. Maybe the Edgewater site has a different brewer at the controls, I dunno.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. It’s a very easy-to-like brew, with some diverse aromatics that start off fairly prominent at first pour but unfortunately dissipate relatively quickly (so the nose during most of the drinking experience is a bit less exciting than the first several whiffs...first pour volatiles probably earn an 8, though). Nicely balanced, clean, looks good, and has a great mouthfeel...this really has no weak points to it, but admittedly the style itself is a bit limited. Tough to find an Irish red that I’d drink more than one bottle of, but this is one of them. A consistently good brewery so far, hopefully we’ll see some more interesting seasonals and/or year-rounds come out...I’d love to try a porter/stout from these guys.

Kannah Creek Broken Oar IPA;Grand Junction, Colorado, United States;IPA;Kannah Creek Brewing Company;12oz from whole foods, but also saw it at brewers haven and a couple other places... Pours sorta clear light amber.. short lived white head shows good lacing. Fruity yeast and dry toast, grassy/floral hoppiness is the big player with a lesser citrus.. Flavor mirrors the aroma perfectly.. Decent bitterness up front and on the finish but is very flimsy in the middle. Not sure what to say about this one.. There is a minerally dry finish that carries the bitterness for a while... Personally, I don’t care for it but I guess if the brewers were shooting for English IPA, then they did an okay job.

Kannah Creek Broken Oar IPA;Grand Junction, Colorado, United States;IPA;Kannah Creek Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours with a crystal clear gold body that supports a tall light tan head of foam. The aroma offers up an odd mix of malts, caramel malts, tart smelling grapefruit and then stale malts and acidic tartness. Odd. The taste begins with tartness and maltiness kind of going at it with thin rings of citrus hops and then fleeting citrus hop juiciness. It quickly gets into earthy lime and a bit stale malts. so so brew that I doubt I’ll try again.

Belgia Gingers Beer Lime;Kielce, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Browar Kielce (Kompania Piwowarska - SABMiller);I seriously thought I didn’t wash my pint properly and it had some dish washing liquid in it when I drank this.

Cambridge Chocolate Chili Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Cambridge Brewing Company;On draft at Redbones. Delicious chili spice flavor on top of the porter’s chocoloate malts. Not for everybody, but something you should definitely try. If you like spicy food, you’ll probably love this.
Cambridge Chocolate Chili Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Cambridge Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Pours a rich nutty brown almost black with a nice tan head- leaves some nice lace. Aroma is nutty and chocoaltey but you can tell something lik ethe peppers are in there- has a sharp off green pepper chilled burniness to it. Flavro starts off with the chocoalte nutty malts, toasty and lightly bready- definite burnt malts in there, some smoke and then bam- lots of chili pepper raw spiciness which attackes the tongue and almost numbs it. Crazy beer, yet not too over the top. Still- not something you would want more than one glass of.
Cambridge Chocolate Chili Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Cambridge Brewing Company;Draught pints at Redbones porter and stout dinner on 3/12/07 and again on 3/16/07 at Redbones Dark cocoa-flecked tan head is medium in size and shows strong retention for a chili beer. Dark brown body has a medium-high clarity and a chestnut-mahogany hue on the edges. Little/no lacing, probably inhibited by the chili oil. Not much chili in the nose, and only a dry pinch of baker’s chocolate powderiness. But more fudgey chocolate notes emerge, especially with warming. A bit of vanilla and slight caramel malt sweetness, but overall a rather reserved, somewhat weak aroma, though that seems to be the norm with many spiced/peppered dark ales. Flavor is a whole nother story, though. Dry chocolate with a pleasing chewiness and light fudge character. Bit of vanilla cream sweetness and slight roastiness emerging, as the chili finally comes on in the finish. Very spicy, with a slow burn that builds up on the palate, while all the while the chocolate lightly complements the heat. Light caramel and more stickiness, with low carbonation. Delicious and the best chili beer I’ve had easily. Think of it as a double IPA that is balanced through the middle but with tons of hop bitterness on the finish.
Ballards Duck House;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ballards;Bought from the brewery on the release date dec 2009. Its passed its BBE. Pours completely flat, no head whatsoever. Dark ruby. There’s balsamic vinegar and sherry on the nose. Very complex medium body reminiscent of an oud bruin. Oxidised of course with a lot of vinegar, some soggy cardboard, autolysed yeast marmite flavours, a hint of lactic acid, rounded body, quite sweet, vinous fruit. Long savoury finish with more marmite.
Ballards Duck House;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ballards;Cask - White Cliffs Festival 2010, Dover. Oh dear. Ok, so it looked average - a dark brown with a fine & frothy, disappearing beige head but apart from that... Aggressively acidic & tangy on the nose, I’ll go as far as calling it Balsamic vinegar rather than regular malt vinegar but little else is on offer. Taste is pretty much the same, maybe some raisin notes in there but I may just be being kind. Yea, the palate is alright as well - apart from being a bit cloying - but nothing more than average.
Ballards Duck House;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ballards;Dover Beer Festival 2010. Another Old Bounder, another foul beer. Malt vinegar aroma. Rough malt and ugly tobacco hops. There’s very little to commend this. Cereal, thick, unpleasant. Barely drinkable.

Midnight Sun 2007 Deadly Sins: Gluttony;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;"Hazy copper and super amber coloured body with a ruby and peach glow, all with a two centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of alcohol, bright grassy, piney hops with a lot of alcohol and a touch of apricots, peaches and pears - nice and pungent throughout. Medium to Full-bodied; Strong rich hoppy flavours dominate with a lot of grass and resin, some pine and a bit of a citrus note near the end, along with a big malt backbone, along with a floral and dry/woodsie flavour near the end. Aftertaste shows a lot of pungency, with the alcohol showing up at first along with a big malt presence, some lighter fruit sweetness and then a ton of residual hoppy flavours that have a big bitterness, still. Overall, a nice and deeply pungent beer, but that was to be expected at 10,5%. A nice offering, full of flavour in the right dimensions with perhaps too much resin and pine and not enough complexities, but pretty good overall! I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Whole Foods in New York (Bowery), New York on 18-June-2015 for US$13,99 sampled almost exactly two years later a few hours before leaving for New York again on 07-June-2017."

Palate is smooth and semi dry, reasonable fine minerally carbonation. Light malts, fair bit of caramel and cream and an underlying bitter toffee streak. Spicy orange marmalade with thin pine.

Tübinger Red Ale;Valdivia de Paine, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tübinger;Bottle at Bar Irlandes. Should have checked the date, considering the oddness encountered. Actually I may have, and if so, I believe it was relatively fresh. Lots of paint in the aroma. Slight tang coupled w/ sweet very reminiscent of New Glarus Crack’d and Black Wheat. I can’t imagine this being intentional or how it happened, but it was good. Everything is pretty subtle in this, but mostly good. The paint faded some after it had awhile to breathe.

Fisher's Ale Blowfish Bitter;Perth, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mash Brewing;Cask @ Clancy’s Freo For novelty’s sake this is ok, but in terms of a real ale, it lacks biscuity sweetness of british base malt, and it is served in really ugly glasses.
Fisher's Ale Blowfish Bitter;Perth, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mash Brewing;Hand pumped @ Clancy’s Freo.

Bush Shack Pharaoh's Spelt Wheat Beer;Yallingup, Australia;Specialty Grain - Other;Bush Shack Brewery (ex Wicked Ale Brewery);Draught @ Bush Shack Brewery, Yallingup. Produces up a sandy yellow, just shy of bright, with well conditioned, fine carbonation. A persistent, rocky, snow-white crown atop leaves behind a web of lace. Pleasant, sweet, nutty spelt on the nose, very grainy, raw and cereal-like with hints of lemon zest, peppery spice and earthy old hop leaves. In the mouth it is zesty, lots of lemon and citrus comes through over layers of sweet grainy spelt. Light phenol hit in back, a little hops show just on the swallow before a dry wheat swallow. It bounces across the palate with alarming ease, the body rather light, filling out as it warms, the flavour rounded and balanced. The use of spelt wheat gives it a unique raw peanut and almond character that works well. It is really refreshing, especially with the warmth of the sun through the trees overlooking the brewery. Very nice drinking ale.

Hinterland Bourbon Barrel Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;I was really excited to try this. What a letdown. There is some battle with the bourbon and coffee flavors that give it some sort of off-putting rotten vegetable taste to me. Maybe my palette was off today, maybe coffee and bourbon don't mix. I may try this again in the future. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Hinterland Bourbon Barrel Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;Pours opaque dark brown. Small tan head. Pronounced bourbon aroma. Also some odd chemical aroma, almost like drain cleaner, plus some wood. Palette is a bit chalky. I get the coffee in the flavor, but not really in the aroma. Maybe a bit overcarbonated.

The bottle pours with a hazy deep gold body that supports a near white head of foam. The aroma offers up smooth big sweet banana with a bit of spicy cloves around the periphery.

Hazy dark yellow with a huge pillowy white head. Heavy yeast on the nose along with lots of spice a little fruit and plenty of sweet bread. The flavour is similar but seems a little too yeasty and the aggressive carbonation gives it a slight feel of infection. The finish brings it back round. Really good sweet fruity malt, some bread and biscuits and then some late lemon. Given the 1985 Stille Nacht we had before this, it had a hard act to follow. Good enough but certainly not the best Alvinne beer. Still, a toast to an exceptional day, good friends, good food, good weather... Life is good.

Iron Hill American IPA;Newark, Delaware, United States;IPA;Iron Hill Newark;Maj 2014. Komplex, välbalanserad doft av många olika humlesorter. Mycket intressant humlekomposition i smaken. Mjuk kolaton i botten och så en bred palett av citrus, tall, grape m.m. inte överdrivet besk. I eftersmaken växer en djup och dov beska fram. Mycket bra. Bärnstensfärgad och med skum som inte lämnar spår.

Iron Hill American IPA;Newark, Delaware, United States;IPA;Iron Hill Newark;Really nice IPA on draft at Phoenixville. Pours a light gold color with an ample white head. The head leaves some really nice, sticky lacing inside the glass. The nose featured a great profile of dry and spicy hops. The flavors were really delicious and well-balanced, with notes of grapefruit, lime and pine. This IPA had just enough bready and sweet malt for balance and flavor. The finish was well-rounded, dry, spicy and hoppy.

Iron Hill American IPA;Newark, Delaware, United States;IPA;Iron Hill Newark;Draught in Newark. Orange-amber pour, smell the American hops from 3 feet away! Beige lacing, sweet and super juicy. Not really bitter, fruity sweet juicy hops, citrus and resin but no grit, awesome change of pace but want to keep it at low volume. [2009.08.21: 3.5] Draught at the new Maple Shade location. Poured a pale golden. Bone-dry, heavily -hopped nose and body with a nice resiny grit. Definitely dry-hopped. Citrus and toast, leafy greens, smooth and complex. A little alcohol showing, a little soapy, medium body, very nice, might session with this if it were a bit weaker. [2011.05.09: 3.7] Draught in Newark. Lightly hazy golden-copper with a lacing white head. Soft light-medium body (cask?), hoppy and seemingly wheaty, lots of fruit an light tropical notes, certainly zesty with a touch of tartness and citrus. [2014.08.04: 3.2]
Lost Coast Dunkel Weizen;Eureka, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;Special draught at Mellow Mushroom, Brandon, FL. Watermelon aroma with some cardboard notes. Murky brownish amber. Steady carbonation. Small tan head. Some lace and good color. This tastes nothing like a Dunkelweizen. No wheat flavor. Lagerish. Smooth pale lager. Very average.
Lost Coast Dunkel Weizen;Eureka, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;Rating #1045 Draft @ Mellow Brandon Hazy brown body, white cap of head. Kind of astringent flavor… odd mix of green citrus oils, green banana, and cardboard. The palate was buttery and finished with hints of caramel, toasted bread, and a mouthful of pennies. I was very under-whelmed by this effort from a brewery that usually does some fine work. Not a dunkel weizen in most any sense…
Lost Coast Dunkel Weizen;Eureka, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;Draft... Cloudy amber ale with a small, creamy, white head. Incredible retention. Not a whole lot going on in the aroma or the flavor. Well-balanced... malty sweet, but adequately hopped for balance. Full-bodied and fizzy with a short, crisp, clean finish. A very [b]decent[/b] beer... just a bit boring. I’ll go with mgumby10 on this one... way more dunkel than weizen. Where are those fruity esters and spicy (clove) phenols?
Lost Coast Dunkel Weizen;Eureka, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;On draft at redlight. Pours a dark copper wit ha light off white head. Smell is pretty mellow, light maltiness and some grape citrus in there. taste is pretty mellow as well. Some cinnamon, wheat, and sweet malts. Tastes more dunkel than it does weizen. Some wheat characterisitics though. Some dark fruit is present in the aftertaste and the finish is relatively smooth. Decent.
Lost Coast Dunkel Weizen;Eureka, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;on draft @ redlight redlight. Caramel and fruit on the nose, more berries than say citrus or banana’s that i would imagine. Pours caramel brown. Quite crisp, not what i was expecting, some roasted flavors coming through strongly in the begining, and a big hop presence, malty finish. i don’t pick up much wheat. It reminds more of a dunkel lager honetly. Its not bad as a beer, not great if i was judging it by the name.

Ffos y Ffin Cwrw Caredig;Carmarthen, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ffos y Ffin Brewery;Bottle in the rake. Alround rating: Dusty yeast, noteably plastic off the bottle conditioning, nutty malt, dry hopping. Its typically failed british bottle conditioning.

Citrus, yeast and some papery notes in the aroma. Dry but same time fruity flavor. Citrus-orange with some yeasty notes. Lingering dry bitterness. Not the most exiciting bitter, but ok.

Ffos y Ffin Cwrw Caredig;Carmarthen, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ffos y Ffin Brewery;Cask at the Rake Welsh Festival, 1st March 2009. Standard amber looks. Lots of grassy hop on the nose, bit funky. Quite thin palate. Usual light ale flavour but this is too flawed to be a great beer.
Ffos y Ffin Cwrw Caredig;Carmarthen, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ffos y Ffin Brewery;Bottle. Orange and a bit lively upon opening. Poured flat with no carbonation at all. Slight bitterness with some presence of hops.A reasonable bitter.
Ffos y Ffin Cwrw Caredig;Carmarthen, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ffos y Ffin Brewery;Bottle. Amber beer with a strong head. The aroma is lightly fruity and lightly hopped. The flavour is quite sour and bitter. Overall quite a standard bitter and sour bottled conditioned beer.
Ffos y Ffin Cwrw Caredig;Carmarthen, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ffos y Ffin Brewery;Dark golden pour with a strong white ring. Rather shy nose is owned by tart grainy cereal malts that develop more sweetness than you would expect in mouth. Herbal flavours will eventually clash in it, but you eventually doubt that they are a flavour from the hops as the sweetness keeps on and on, into a poor sticky finish. Not sessionable, that’s for sure.

Aggressive balanced hop cocktail aroma of soft wine gummy lemon and lime, resinous grapefruit, pine, chlorophyll, slight urinal. Flavour follows on with more pungent orange greenery, great sweaty resins, excusable mealy Wotsit softness, vanilla, maize, husky pale malt creaminess, maybe oats. Lean, punchy and alpha-driven like Atomic. No frills aromatic citrus and biting green resins, but not at the expense of the malt. Beautiful, unexpected hop-drenched sessions, fresh on and £1.50 a pint. Hangover here we come...
Ashover Light Rale;Clay Cross, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ashover Brewery;[i] Cask conditioned at The Cross Keys, Belper, 17-01-08 [/i] Very Pale golden in colour with a tiny bit of haze. The nose on this one was a little more sulphourus than it’s stablemate [i] Poets Tipple [/i] which I had first, but there was also some light fruitiness on the nose and then in the mouth. Lovely bitterness, great session beer, really impressed with both of these beers.

Nøgne Ø Dark Horizon First Edition;Grimstad, Norway;Stout - Imperial;Nøgne Ø (Hansa Borg);500ml bottle. Pours nearly pitch black in color with not much head to speak of. The aroma shows notes of big dark fruit, raisins, treacle, dark caramel, and dark roasted malt base to go with notes of licorice and faint coffee. The flavor follows suit with huge dark fruit, toasted caramel, molasses, treacle, dark chocolate, and a touch of roast from the coffee with some nice warming from the alcohol. Full bodied and viscous on the mouthfeel with minimal carbonation that leads to a dark fruit, caramel, molasses, and boozy warming finish. Really well made with big bold flavors and held up surprisingly well for being 10 years old or so. Interesting to see how this has aged and can only imagine how big and bold the flavors must have been when fresh.

Nøgne Ø Dark Horizon First Edition;Grimstad, Norway;Stout - Imperial;Nøgne Ø (Hansa Borg);9 - 3 - 9 - 5 - 19 Ever since I created an account on RateBeer more than 7 years ago, I've wanted to taste this brew. For a Nøgne Ø fanboy as myself, this is the ultimate white whale, and having the opportunity not only to try this creation in the tasting room at the brewery, but also doing a vertical tasting with DH1, DH2 and DH5, is almost a bit too much. In other words, I'm probably not 100% objective when rating this brew, and I might be guilty of some serious overrating. Anyway, it pours a pitch black, still-looking body with no head. Uh. The aroma is malty and quite intense, with delicious notes of coffee, chocolate, dark caramel, and other notes of dark roasted malt, and brown sugar. The intense flavour follows the aroma. The alcohol is perfectly integrated, this doesn't feel alcoholic at all. Despite the incredible intensity of this brew, everything feels magnificently balanced, with no single element outshining the other. There are no rough edges left, one can almost claim that this beer has become gentle in its 2nd decade. The taste is quite heavy sweet and heavy bitter – the tastes are in perfect harmony. The mouthfeel is of course utterly perfect: it's a full-bodied beer, with a syrupy texture and a very soft carbonation (but there are actually some bubbles left). As opposed to DH2, the DH1 has aged with style. But be aware, there's a new kid in town: DH5 has matured excellently during the year after launch, so in a couple of more years DH1 will have some serious competition. But for the time being, DH1 is still the ultimate Nøgne Ø brew. [sample from 50 cl bottle @ Nøgne Ø, RBNG18

Wood and some fruit, but really not much there. Medium body. Flavor is caramel, sweet malt, some smoke, and milk chocolate. Finishes with a bit more smokiness. Baird usually puts out really good beers but this one just doesn’t cut it. It’s not a bad beer but it’s just sorta there.
Baird The Professor Munchner Dunkel;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Baird Brewing Co.;Med chestnut color, virtually no nose. Some cherry notes. Malty caramel and milk chocolate in mouth. Not as balanced as usual. Dry malty finish.

Baird Jubilation Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Flavored - Other;Baird Brewing Co.;Sampled at an ESBLs. Deep golden amber. A beige layer of foam. An odd aroma that I am not sure what to make of. Spices are prominent in the flavor. A little like fruit cake but more complex. Interesting.

Baird Jubilation Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Flavored - Other;Baird Brewing Co.;360 ml bottle in FL. Pours with a murky, copper body topped by a good bone-colored head. Excellent mother with ample natural carbonation. Drinks like a fine Belgian ale in that it’s highly complex and well balanced (assuming you like figs), Faint cinnamon works well. Nearly too much dried dark fruit flavor, even for me. Overall: recommended! Sip slowly and contemplatively.
Baird Jubilation Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Flavored - Other;Baird Brewing Co.;Hazy red/copper with a thin white head. Aroma is sweet and fruity, taste goes straight to the fig, honey and malts. Quite sweet, medium bodied and boozy. Decent and original beer.
Baird Jubilation Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Flavored - Other;Baird Brewing Co.;Draught at Naka-Meguro taproom. Rich fig with a honey edge, allspice, oily mouthfeel, sweet finish with light boozy notes. Interesting idea but a bit too heavy and sweet in the end.

Alchimiste Double Bock;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;My Bottom Line: Berries burst from the sensual caramel maltiness in this very satisfying, plump doppelbock. Certainly one of L’Alchimiste’s best efforts to date. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the clear mahogany. -Supporting hops are engulfed by the aforementioned fruity caramel, barely drying out enough of the finish to suggest another sip. -This isn’t too complex, but it’s a smashing libation for malt lovers. -Alcohol is well concealed. On tap at Vices et Versa.

Dempseys Frostbite Lager;Watertown, South Dakota, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Dempseys Brewery, Pub & Restaurant;On draught at the brewpub in Watertown, South Dakota. Pours a semi-clear golden pale brew with a creamy off-white head that has some nice retention and very little carbonation. Lacing is spotty but still attaches to the glass side. Aroma of semi-sweet white bread malt, a touch of banana esters from yeast, honey and some green vegetables. Taste is medium bodied, very light carbonation with flavors of semi-sweet multi-grain white bread malt, both flowery and citrus hops with a touch of honey and lemon zest. Finish is smooth, creamy with a touch of banana aroma yeast that slowly disappears. One of Dempsey’s better beers. Try this one unfiltered and it has a more hefeweisen taste and character.

Poured a golden color with maybe some orange hues. The head was decent initially, lacing only ok. Aroma was grassy, honey, vegetal (is that a word? Do I care?). The flavor was grassy, honey, vegetal, earthy, hay, a pilsner take on this one? Mouthfeel was moderate and carbonated, nothing else really noteable. Not bad, not great. Thanks, boys, for the opportunity!

Pours a clear reddish cooper amber brew with a creamy off-white head that slowly dissipates to a fine film and off-white ring with good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, some light tobacco, dry grassy hop character and a touch of vegetable. Taste is light bodied, some carbonation with flavors of dry caramel, tobacco and some light green vegetables. Finish is semi-dry, some mild bitterness that lingers after the finish.
Dempseys Valkyrie Red;Watertown, South Dakota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dempseys Brewery, Pub & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Clear reddish-brown color with a light white head. Aroma was a sweet blend of caramel, molasses, and fruit. Flavor was very sweet with a berry-like flavor to it. Different, but good. Too sweet for a session beer, but good for one or two.

Poured a golden color with orangeness, good head and lacing of the glass. Aroma was light hops, touch of pine. The flavor was light pine, resin, bittering hop presence over a soft but decent body, moderate carbonation (slight grainy/gritty-ness feel to it). Again, nothing great or special, drinkable, smooth pale ale (or, I guess they call this an amber ale, but....). Thanks, boys, for the opportunity!

A thick, firm & creamy white head with a good uniform lacing & a clear golden orange body. Zesty lemon and floral hop aromas with some very mild sulphur notes coming through. Crisp citrus flavour profile with some sweeter, juicy hop fruit tones. Firm mouthfeel, light to medium body with a lingering citric hop bitterness. A pretty good pale bitter.

Watery malt base with a nutty edge. Slightly metalic hop profile that dies away quickly. The pint was in great condition but the beer is at best rather boring.

Biscuit malt with a mainly malty kick and overtone. Notes of grassy hop briefly penetrate. Becomes bitter with a strongly bitter finish noted particularly in the back of the mouth. This beer certainly grew on me during the tasting!
Nethergate Barfly;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask @ The Black Bull, Whitechapel, labeled Barfly Special. Clear gold with a thin white head. Metallic hops, apple, malt and an odd white grape hint. Smelled kinda like pee which made me hesitant to drink it. Bitter and very soapy hops at first overpowered by a malt and butterscotch finish. The flavours seem to work against rather than compliment each other, not a fan.

James Ready Light;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;355 ml can from Alcool NB Liquor. Pours a clear golden yellow with thin white cap. Light grains and adjunct in aroma. Flavour is sweet grains/corn ad quite watery. Predictably light body. Pretty unimpressive.
James Ready Light;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;pale, thin - there really isn’t a lot to say about this typical macro light beer other than it might have slightly more taste than Bud Light or Coors Light, for example. I will have to compare at the same time, but it almost seems like, while the mouthfeel is very thin, there may be a few more hops than the regular James Ready (not that that is high praise or anything). Taking the price into account, I would definitely choose this over Coors, but that doesn’t mean I plan to buy either in the future.
James Ready Light;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;355ml can. Mild funky lager aroma. Very pale, clear, yellow colour. Small head disappeared instantly, no lace. Taste is thin: sour grain, cardboard box, sticky sweetness. Palate is watery and carbonation is forced and chemical tasting. Overall, worth passing over, despite the price.
James Ready Light;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;This light version of the James Ready pours a very pale yellow colour with a big frothy white head that stays longer than expected, and lacing is pretty good. Smell reeks of bad grain, perfume and some citrus lemony aromas that help out the situation. The taste is not as bad, just corn, and quite light. The scent gets a bit better, as it turns to mild corn after a while. Refreshing enough for a light beer, and very inexpensive for a 24-pack (only size it comes). Only meant to drink from the bottle though.

Heather-like hops aroma has wheat, melted plastic and a strange perfume thrown in too. Clear, pale yellow body with a quick white head. Flavour has wheat characteristics, some sweet floral and almost silky chocolate notes. Smooth light body. Like heavily carbonated perfume water.
James Ready Light;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Bottle courtesy of tupalev. Pale yellow body with a small white head. Sweet grainy, grassy aroma with muted floral notes I assume to be hops. Sweet grainy flavour has mild vegetal notes at times, but mostly sweet muted grains, hints at cream corn. Overall flavour is on the sweet side. Average to thin palate. Pretty bland and watery. Mostly inoffensive, but why bother?
James Ready Honey;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;2nd macro beer offered at the K-W crapfest of bad beer. Crystal clear, food color amber, disappearing head, fizzy with little aroma aside from a synthetic saccharine-like cloying. Any detectable grains or hop is obliterated by this overpowering, sickly sweetening they dose this bland concoction with. Stinging harsh synthetic sweetness in a fizzy body....pretty much shite in a bottle.
James Ready Honey;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Bottle (341ml). Courtesy of blankboy. Deep clear amber, fizzy bright white diminishing head. Smells like candy and paper - I don’t get honey, I get weeds soaked in maple sap. The taste is ... ergh ... harshly sweet, metallic and nastier as it warms. Thin, fizzy mouthfeel, ugly sweetness lingers harshly - even for a cheap Canadian honey beer this kind of sucks.

James Ready Honey;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Bottle. Pours a clear, very bubbly gold with an average size diminishing white head. Very mild aroma of grain, sugar and corn. Flavour’s pretty sweet and watery with some slightly cloying honey, grain and some faint hops in the finish. Light to medium bodied. This is really poor stuff.
James Ready Honey;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Bottle- Good thing this is available in Ontario now, as there aren’t enough honey lagers that please me. It’s golden pour is topped with a short lived, fizzy white head. Candy-ish aromas, grain, maybe some bread, with corn. Tastes fairly sweet with faux honey, adjuncty grainyness, bread crust, creamed corn. FInishes almost cloyingly sweet, stale. Thanks to Joe at TBS for the hook up!

Pyramid Crystal Wheat;Seattle, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle, sampled at Trackside’s Saturday tastings in Medicine Hat. Pretty frigging sweet that my little local not only brings in stuff I’ve never had before, but actually lets me pay a buck to try it out! clear pale gold, not much of a head in my little sample tumbler. Aroma is sweetly wheaty. Flavours are light sweet grains with a hint of lemon. Not much to it really, but as a summer sun beer, it would pass.
Ringneck Bourbon Aged Im-perle-ial Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter - Imperial;The Brew Kettle;Draft. Aroma: Bourbon is upfront and in your face. Grainy maltiness with some smoke, coffee, and cocoa. Not getting much hop behind all that malt and bourbon. Appearance: Dark, dark brown in color. Light beige head was small and creamy with good retention. Nice lacing. Flavor: Lots of roasted grainy malt up front with some coffee and cocoa. Getting a big anise/licorice flavor, too. Borbon comes on fairly strong and threatens to overpower, but doesn’t. Some light vanilla and wood . There’s a very light mint flavor right before the finish. Finishes a little sweet. Palate: Full bodied and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Alcohol warming in back of mouth. Overall: Nice beer. The barrel aging really rounds this one out, but the bourbon comes off a little strong.

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel);Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;North Coast Brewing Company;A wrapped cap 500ml bottle, XXI release. Poured into a snifter glass. It was black in colour with a big two finger tanned to brown head that had excellent retention and left lots of nice lacing. Aromas, roasty, chocolate, bourbon sweetness, oak, caramel, and some raisins. Tastes moderately sweet, lightly roasty, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light caramel and dark fruit, maybe raisin and plum, also boozy on the finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, nice enjoyable sipping. Bourbon may be a little strong versus other flavours, but it’s still good.
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel);Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;North Coast Brewing Company;Let this beer age for a couple of years, amazing. Modest head. Creamy texture with the super dark, roasted malts you expect. Big alcohol and licorice, incredible stout. I love this beer!!!
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel);Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;North Coast Brewing Company;Solid BBA imperial stout, a definite improvement upon OG Rasputin, with a heavier, deeper roasted malt presence full of unsweetened chocolate, anise, dark fruit, and roast, backed up by a hearty bourbon sweetness and a strong bitter oaked fade. Mouthfeel's still on the thin side for an impy stout, but the beautiful pour and waves of roast and bourbon on the nose make up any lost grand. Tasty beer.
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel);Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;North Coast Brewing Company;Pours oil black with somewhat large brown head. Chocolate dominates the aroma and the flavor, but not the palate. There's a good amount of the distinctive bourbon barrel flavor, too. All in all, this is very drinkable and nicely balanced despite the high alcohol content.
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel);Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;North Coast Brewing Company;Pours a pitch-black coloration with a huge, creamy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and dark fruit, with some chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and charred oak coming through as well. Taste is dominated by roasted, caramel malt, dark fruits: fig, raisin, vanilla and tobacco, with lighter notes of dark, bitter chocolate, coffee, molasses, licorice, bourbon and charred oak. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted, caramel malt, dark fruit and tobacco lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation. This is a nicely balanced Stout with a rich and complex flavor profile that has some quite bitter, roasted, charred and sweeter dark fruit and vanilla notes to it, as well as a good bourbon-barrel presence that never turns too boozy, although it does suffer a little in the mouthfeel department. Not even remotely worth the ridiculous price though.

HaandBryggeriet Dark Force;Drammen, Norway;Stout - Imperial;HaandBryggeriet (Norway);"330mL bottle from Boozebud 8.5%ABV BB cant read Sinisterly dark brew - pours sump oil like, opaque, dense, dark tan head persists. Rich aroma; tarry, inky, burnt nuts, lots of molasses, dark chocolate, dark fruit notes of plum & prunes & blackcurrant, becomes even more apparent with warmth! It's reasonably thick without being HUGE - sort of shows its true colours a touch (being sub 10%), but there's certainly enough viscosity to upshow some much bigger beers, very smooth too, lingering, oily. Fudgey chocolate notes, lots of dark/burnt sugars yet a savoury affair, those dried black fruits poke through on the finish, vinous in some regard, bitterness on the low end. Very very nice, almost like a Baltic Porter in some regard."

This should be interesting. It pours black with a pretty big head of tannish foam..nah, it's tan. Good lacing. Once things settle down, there's just a ring of foam around the glass. That smell! Roasted malt, dark chocolate, toffee, some coffee..3 years old. The years must have been very kind; never had this fresh so I pretty much don't know what I'm talking aboot. The taste reflects the smell with no hidden surprises. Roasted malt rules the roost with bitter dark chocolate following closely behind. Some coffee, enough for you to know that it's there. Semi sweet/bitter overall and a real treat. Medium bodied with light carbonation...there wasn't a sound when I popped the cap. So darn good. A revisit is mandatory."

East End Pink Clouds Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;East End Brewing Company;On tap at Sharp Edge Beer Emporium. Dark brown body. Aroma is lightly woody with some roastiness and chocolate notes, but fairly mild overall. Pretty full-bodied as far as porters go. Some very enjoyable flavors of nuts, molasses, vanilla, and chocolate, however a bit of a soapy metallic quality to it. Respectable porter but not fantastic.
East End Pink Clouds Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;East End Brewing Company;On tap at the Sharp Edge. Brewed with recipe by Keith Kost. Sweet molasses and mild smoke, light soy sauce, mild fruity hoppiness. Big hit of coffee with a little chocolate. Dark brown-black clear. Light cocoa colored creamy lacing head. Medium-heavy body, not quite oily, with mild carbonation. Very odd taste to start. A bit metallic, with some bitter herbal note, and then some Band-Aid. After that, big coffee smoky burnt maltiness. Light sweetness, chocolate. Cloying roasted bitterness in the finish. Nutty molasses after. A pretty hefty porter, but just a bit off.
East End Pink Clouds Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;East End Brewing Company;"On tap at the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium. First off, let me just say the the name is pretty odd for a darker beer, but I rather like it. In the glass it’s dark black brown and ruby, and has an ethereal purplish hue. The head is tan. Aroma is malt, caramel, faint grass. Flavor is caramel, vanilla, roasted nuts, chocolate, and also has that East End signature earthiness. This is one of the best porters I’ve had. I also really like cheapdarks’s description; I think it’s pretty apt."
East End Pink Clouds Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;East End Brewing Company;On tap at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse in Pgh. The pour is pitch black or totally dark brown, very opaque. The head is darker tan. It fades to a thin froth after a few minutes. The aroma is that of a wonted stout or thick heavy porter, complex malt roastyness abounds throughout the olfactories. This beer looks great in the glass. Oh, yes, an aged roasted, nearly burned, wet wood or roasted flavor immediately greets the tongue. This can almost be classified as a stout and I am left wondering why it is not. Lovely enjoyable taste. A Coffee bitterness is well hidden within. One cannot say this is watered down as with many popular porters. Probably one of the most flavorful personalities I have ever tasted within a porter. The feel is smooth and heavy, like used shovelhead Harley Davidson oil would be if you could drink it. Medium to low carbonation. Extremely complex, a real contender in the porter arena. The lacing is beautifully prevalent and lasting, like the lingerie of your favorite female companion. Though this is borderline stoutlike, it lacks the medicinal bitterness on the uvula that is so common with strong stouts. It leaves a finish that is impressionable, yet does not have the lasting acrid linger. Friendly & enjoyable. This is a brew that must be experienced. If you are a stout or porter lover you better check into this. Pittsburghers rejoice!

I remember cquiroga liking this better than I did, thinking it might even be better than the Relapse (which uses it as a base beer). I disagreed; I found this even more disappointing than the Relapse. Not much on the aroma. Vaguely hoppy flavor on a fully, syrupy body, with a weak citrus finish that again reminds of hops amid all the syrupy sugars. Seems like a lot of this went unfermented.

Dark mahogany in colour with ruby highlights and a clean thin white head. Sweet aroma of red liquorice confectionary in there. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malts give a strong maltloaf base with strong fruit notes of raisins, figs and black cherry. Very little in the way of hop resins noted in the extremely short aftertaste but a curt nod of oak tannin evident. Finish is smooth and malty with roasted grain, plain chocolate and Bassets liquorice allsorts flavours evident in the mouth, along with vinous oak cask notes as well. This is a cracking new porter, very easy to drink despite the 4.9% and well recommended.

Buonatesta Stout;Paillao, Valdivia, Chile;Stout;Buonatesta;Pours a deep dark hazy brown color, almost black. Medium off-white and fast diminishing head that leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is is malty, toasted. Dark bitter chocolate, mokka and milo hints. Cocoa powder and other chocolate alternatives. Flavor is sadly infected, with choclatery and roasted ceral notes underneath citrusy touches. This had potential to be good but it’s ruined by the infection. However I still think it’s not as bad as the previous ratings. Maybe the aging helped. Carbonation is medium, the finish is intense, lactic but leaves lemony notes. Medium to big body, smooth silky texture. I hope this one gets over a better quality control and that the brewery resolves its infection issues. Thanks David for the bottle
Buonatesta Stout;Paillao, Valdivia, Chile;Stout;Buonatesta;"Appearance: dark brown color. Medium head, of beige color, few persistency. Aroma: toasty cereals, sweet, highly yeasty, something rancid, candy, not nice odor. Reminiscences of dark olives. Flavor: toasty of low persistency, sweet malty, very much yeasty, rancid. Touches of chocolate, berries and dark olives. Finish with light hoppyness, metallic and smoked; bitterness mainly from toasty. Slightly warming. Palate: light to medium body, watery and silky texture. Low carbonation. Too much light body and toasty for a stout. Rancid, but I don’t perceive infection problems. Not complexity nor character, disappointing chilean beer…."
Buonatesta Stout;Paillao, Valdivia, Chile;Stout;Buonatesta;(in bottle – restaurant in Pucon City). Black opaque and cloudy color. Great body of foam, but that disappears too rapidly. The aroma is strong, malt and something of grass. has a aroma not very agreeable. The flavor is bitter and very acid (Probably the beer this one bad). Probably should obtain a new bottle, but I am not sure to try.
Buonatesta Red Ale;Paillao, Valdivia, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buonatesta;Pours a beautiful hazy red/copper color with a big nice off-white frothy head that lasts until I finish my glass. Aroma is yeasty, fruity with cereal traces. Notes of ripe fruits, spices, hebrs and honey sharing the stage. Pretty adventurous for such a small beer. Very good. Flavor is rather weak but not bad at all. Fruity notes of apples, strawberries and raspberries with a dry finish. A small citrusy trace appears showing a slight sign of infection but it doesn’t detract much. Medium body, very high carbonation that should be handled. Too much yeast present I think. Alcohol is also a little noticeable but that’s a fair touch. Nice aftertaste. I’m actually surprised. This one is an interesting beer and deserves a higher rating. Thanks to davidpl for this bottle.

Buonatesta Red Ale;Paillao, Valdivia, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buonatesta;Appearance: amber orange color, turbid. Medium head and persistency, beige color. Aroma: candy, yeasty, nice hoppy smells, citric-fruits, peaches and honey. Flavor: rare bitterness, maybe from yeasts. Bitter and citric fruity, like peel grapefruits. Slightly candy, hoppy and rancid. Palate: light to medium body, semi-oily texture. Low carbonation. Very average.
Buonatesta Red Ale;Paillao, Valdivia, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buonatesta;(in bottle – restaurant in Pucon City). The color is very dark amber, few foam and almost without cord. The aroma is to sweet malts. The flavor in the mouth, is with a strong sickly-sweet taste, but with a very bad finish, which remembers the oxide and the metals. Has a good texture, slightly gaseous, and rather oily. I must admit that, a red ale does not seem.

No jeweller would pay a price for amber of this colour. This is a schwarzbier or a dunkel, although its sweetness does make it taste more like one of those brazilian Malzbier. It’s quite alright, with some roastiness and even a feeble berry note, although the sweetness is a bit off-putting. Too thin."

Black Princess;Serra do Capim, Teresópolis (RJ), Brazil;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cervejaria Teresópolis (Petrópolis);Bottled 600ml. -from big Carrefour in Sorocaba, Brazil. Black coloured, brownish head, mild chocolate in the nose. It promises but not for long. Light roasted malt, milk chocolate and a way too sweet caramel and brown sugar taste with sweet finish of course. One-dimensional.
Flossmoor Station Shamrock Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft goblet, FSRB. Pours solid black with a light layer of foam. Dry stout smell with a bit of mint around the edges. Taste comes down to whether you like mint in your beer. I liked it a lot better in the Christmas Chocolate Shout. But I’m not sure I cared for this. The mint taste does give the beer a chocolate impression at first, but it also brings out a harsh astringency from the dark roast malt. No hop match to give it balance. And I may just have a bad reaction to it. Astringency more pronounced at finish. I’ll leave others to their opinions, though. And maybe shamrocks themselves might contribute something to a beer? Or a shamrock honey mead, perhaps?
Ølfabrikken Abbey Ale;Roskilde, Denmark;Dubbel;Bryggeriet Ølfabrikken (Gourmetbryggeriet - Harboe);19-Jan-15 (750-ml corked-and-caged bottle, Bottled on 30-Nov-06, Drink by Jan 2012) This is well past expiration date, and given my experience with cellared Belgian-style beers, I didn't have high expectations here, but damn, this beer is rocking it! It pours a medium-dark brown body with just over half an inch of tan head that settles fairly quickly to a patchy sheet and thin ring. The nose is very toasty and fruity, with bread crust, caramel, fig, date, raisin, and brown sugar jumping out. Essentially the same on the palate, a strong combination of malty and dried fruit flavors dominating, such as fig and raisin, very toasty and caramely malt with a hint of smokiness, lots of toffee and brown sugar, a touch of maple syrup perhaps, and sweet, Christmas cookies. Oxidation is present but not yet detrimental. It's full bodied and rich on the palate, almost chewy, with light-medium carbonation and a soft, round mouthfeel. Overall, this is delicious. I didn't share this beer because I expected it to be over the hill, but now I'm sad I had to greedily drink the whole bottle myself. Okay, maybe not THAT sad because I have one more bottle that will hopefully be as wonderful as this bottle has been, and I'll definitely share that one.

Produced 30.11.2006, BB3 01/2012 Aroma is very sweet with raisins, sugar, plums and malt. Flavour has raisins, plums, sugar, toffee and some malt. Too sticky and sweet – even after six years.

Rockingham Forest Cottingham & Middleton Blend Cider;Middleton, Corby, Northamptonshire, England;Apple Cider;Rockingham Forest Cider;From the barrel - Leicester BF. An orangey, green coloured cider with a touch of haze. The aroma is on the sweet side with obvious apples but seems a touch artificial. The taste is medium dry, and there’s a reasonable depth of apple pulp flavours. Pretty nice.
Potbelly Clippies Stout;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Stout;Potbelly Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at London Drinker Beer Festival 2007 as Twickenham Joint Effort Oat Rye Stout. Very dark brown colour with a thin beige head. Very roasty and a touch biscuity. Hints of chocolate in the flavour. Whilst its not a thin beer, its not particularly full in the mouthfeel. Perhaps the multi-grains used produce a lighter bodied stout? Interesting, but didn’t quite do it for me.
Potbelly Clippies Stout;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Stout;Potbelly Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Leicester BF. A black beer with no head. The aroma is roasty, oaty and toasty. Very dry and oily, rich and fruity. The taste is sweetish with the oatmeal obvious. Cereals and berries. Roasty and very good.

Jacobi Dark;Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Stout;Jacobi;Clearish cola coloured. Medium light tan head. Earthy and minty, herbal nose where cola notes rise up amongst minerally and greenish, wooden undertones. Undefined fruitiness is there all along, perhaps pear-like. It never goes too sweet while developing its liquorice-like flavours. Not the biggest blockbuster, but well built ale.
Jacobi Dark;Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Stout;Jacobi;Cask @ GBBF 2007, London. Clear dark brown color with virtually none head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, chocolate, notes of oak and licorice. Flavor is moderate sweet with a average duration. Body is light to medium, texture is watery, carbonation is flat.

Jacobi Dark;Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Stout;Jacobi;Cask conditioned at Brecon Beer Festival, Castle Hotel, Brecon, Powys. Dark brown with malt head. Sweetish full flavoured beer, particularly fruity malty, more a mild in my view than a stout. Some licorice with a touch of treacle, moorish.
Falstaff ERM;Derby, Derbyshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Falstaff Brewery;Cask at the Derby Winter Beer Festival. A pleasant aroma of toffee and some malts. The flavours of buttery toffee and sweet malts are well-balanced for something this strong but I still found it a bit too sweet. The booziness overshadows all the flavours as well.
Falstaff ERM;Derby, Derbyshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Falstaff Brewery;"Cask at the Derby Winter Beer Festival. 2006 vintage. I’m not sure barley wine is the right style for this beer. For me, it seemed to be going for a more yeasty. astringent Belgian sort of style. It’s surprisingly quaffable and fruity for the ABV; I think of a barley wine as being richer and more powerfully flavoured. This, however, is enjoyably fruity enough and, drunk after an imperial stout of similar strength, almost refreshing."
Falstaff ERM;Derby, Derbyshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Falstaff Brewery;Bottled at RBESG 2007. An orange beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma is sweet malty with a light touch of caramel, while the flavor is sweet malty with strong notes of alcohol, which burns in the throat.
Falstaff ERM;Derby, Derbyshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Falstaff Brewery;500mL bottle with a very ugly label! Hazy apricot coloured ale with a lasting off-white head. Heady and rather musty nose holds at the same time lots of alcohol and lots of esters (peach and banana fruitiness). Considerable leafy and earthy hops never manage to overtake the strong alcohol nor the oxidized feel of musty, cobwebby attacks. Poor.
Falstaff ERM;Derby, Derbyshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Falstaff Brewery;Bottle. RBESG. Amber colour. Dusty malt aroma. Papery, dusty, cellary flavour with fruity notes and caramel. Belgian yeasty with dry finish.
Falstaff ERM;Derby, Derbyshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Falstaff Brewery;Bottle, RBESG 07. Sweet, warming beer - the warmind due to the alcohol. Some fruit, but dominated by the treacle from the malt.
Falstaff ERM;Derby, Derbyshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Falstaff Brewery;Bottle, at RBESG 2007 in Glasgow, Grand Tasting. Hazy golden brown colour, large off-white head. Nice oaky aroma, some fruity hops too. Malty flavour with fruity hops, the high ABV is noticeable but not too dominant.
Falstaff ERM;Derby, Derbyshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Falstaff Brewery;Bottled at RBESG ’07. Amber colour. Fruity and resiny. Sqweet and full bodied with bread, caramel, minerals and plums. Quite boozy with lots of warming alcohol. Salty finish.

Bells Copernicus;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Strong Ale - English;Bells Brewery (UK);500ml bottle. Will not be agitated into a head from any height. Pitch pour with ruby edges and zero carbonation. Potent sweet sherry alcohol aroma,with touches of red wine and liquorice. Mouth damp and mildewy, developing some heady stewed apple, alcohol bitterness and parting roasted malt/liquorice. Lingeringly charred aftertaste. Too much alcohol, too many off-notes and not enough body for the malt to shine. Warming, flat and difficult. Musty hops sneaking through in the aroma as it warms. A gnaw of bitter choc. Eventually develops an Aardmonnick-like combination of sour fruit and smoky malt if left to stand, but not sure it’s intentional...
Bells Copernicus;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Strong Ale - English;Bells Brewery (UK);Cask, Leicester Fest 07. Deep chesnut brown in colour. Aromas are Autumn fruit with spices and caramel malts. Alcohol is very evident. Flavours are syrupy malts with some chocolate. Too much alcohol diverts from any character the beer may have. Sweet, forgettable and turbo charged.
Bells Copernicus;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Strong Ale - English;Bells Brewery (UK);Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Leicester BF. A dark mahogany coloured beer with no head. The aroma is pretty harshly alcoholic and has notes of nail polish. The taste is like stinging nettles. Harsh and phenolic. Not the best strong beer.
Red Squirrel Colorado IPA;Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Squirrel Brewing;"Cask at the St. Albans Beer Festival 2013. Poured a clear amber colour with a thick, rocky head. Aroma of sweet malts, pineapple and light spruce. Initial flavours are also very sweet with golden syrup, dates and sweetened grapefruit. Palate is a little more of what you’d expect; grassy hop resins and dry grain. I haven’t had this in a few years, but I recall that it was far more hoppy in the past. Possibly my preference for hops has increased a lot since then, or this barrel was not at its best."
Red Squirrel Colorado IPA;Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Squirrel Brewing;Cask at GBBF 2010. An amber beer with an off-white head. The aroma has notes of citrusy hops. The flavor is sweet with notes of citrus fruits, leading to a dry and very bitter finish.

Red Squirrel Colorado IPA;Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Squirrel Brewing;Cask (GBBF 2010) - Gold/amber in colour. Grapefruit, pineapple and peach in the aroma.

Residual suddy head. Semi dry and semi criso palate. Crisp orangey hops with a little marmalade and a little spice. A whisper of sulphur doesn’t detract too much. Good effort!

Meta Beer Export Lager;Sebeta, Ethiopia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meta Abo SC (Diageo);Покупал и интернет магазине в Великобретании. Совершенно незапоминающийся вкус.
Meta Beer Export Lager;Sebeta, Ethiopia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meta Abo SC (Diageo);I like this natural tasting beer, that reminds slightly of beers that one used to get in Eastern countries before modern breweries took over. Almost a bread lining taste in this brew.
Meta Beer Export Lager;Sebeta, Ethiopia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meta Abo SC (Diageo);Bottle. Orange light hazy. Murky malts on nose, some tart orange, papery cardboard. Light med body. Feels rather belgy really. Ripe fruits, oranges, but all in a stuffy cardboardy manner. -- bb
Meta Beer Export Lager;Sebeta, Ethiopia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meta Abo SC (Diageo);33cl bottle pours with a clear gold body that supports an off white head. The aroma swells with sweet pear and apple candy blended with an odd somehow earthy undefinable “stuff” sort of sensation. Hmm. The taste is similar with a mild meat like odd earthiness blended into sweet apple and pear sweet fruitiness creating a flavor that isn’t all that inviting. It then becomes more cereal like to midway and into the finish and tries in vein to turn this thing around with more “beer” notes but in the end the cereal notes fail to do so.
Meta Beer Export Lager;Sebeta, Ethiopia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meta Abo SC (Diageo);Dammit ibrew2or 3! This is some wonderfully awful beer. Just stank and sweet and gross. Not even a new country tick. Dammmmmmit.
Meta Beer Export Lager;Sebeta, Ethiopia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meta Abo SC (Diageo);Golden colored beer with a lasting white head. Paper aroma, maybe metallic. Malty and sweety, not very balanced.
Meta Beer Export Lager;Sebeta, Ethiopia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meta Abo SC (Diageo);This one is pretty rough, even on Ethiopian standards. A little too much of that sour mash malt finish on this. The St. George’s was a much better choice next to this. Bottle at Zenebech’s with some excellent food that somehow made it alright.
Meta Beer Export Lager;Sebeta, Ethiopia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meta Abo SC (Diageo);Keg at The Obelisk, Addis Ababa airport. Clear golden body with a thin white film. Steady carbonation. No lacing. Aroma of grain, newspaper and a hint of lemon. Flavour of sour grain. Thin body with a watery texture. Soft fizz. Bordering on undrinkable.

Fruity yeast, orange citrus, and coriander on the nose. Sweet bready malt upfront with orange citrus and some fruity yeast notes.

Furthermore Fatty Boombalatty;Spring Green, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Furthermore;Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #45 12 ounce bottle drunk at my friend’s house in St. Louis Park, MN, August 2008. Huge head diminishes slowly atop a cloudy goldenbody....lovely floral/earthy aroma, woodsy and barnyard-inflected, with soft peaches and a touch of sour lemon...sweeter than some, and a bit syrupy, has a honey/vanilla character, but enough earthy yeast makes it through to keep it reasonably balanced...soft, moderate carbonation, light-bodied yet not at all thin, tingly...slightly more alcoholic than it’s weight would indicate, but this really isn’t problematic given the overall qualities on display.
Furthermore Fatty Boombalatty;Spring Green, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Furthermore;Esters, wheat and other grain malts. Slightly hazy gold, small, creamy, white head. Medium sweet. More citrus, orange, esters, soft carbonation, medium bodied. Decent Witbier, maybe a touch sweet. Keg at The Old Fashioned, Madison, WI.

Furthermore Fatty Boombalatty;Spring Green, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Furthermore;I Bought it for the sole reason that it had a funny name. Drinkable, but disappointed.
Furthermore Fatty Boombalatty;Spring Green, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Furthermore;Nose is full of perfume and roses. Very floral. Light pear. Taste is initially bitter then a significant alcohol warning. More pepper as it warms. Overall a nice Belgian triple or gold strong. A little sweet but well done.
Furthermore Fatty Boombalatty;Spring Green, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Furthermore;"Poured from the bottle of a six pack, lots of foam on this one, an annoying amount actually. Could only pour about a half a bottle at a time. My palate is not that of the aristocrat so I was not able to taste the bubblegum, but I was not disappointed by this beer, i caught a good buzz and was not offended. I would say that calling it a fatty is somewhat of a stretch, moderately overweight would be a more accurate description, maybe a person with a 27 or 28 BMI. If I were to name this beer I would call it ""husky"". Lose a point for all the foam."
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Thanks to savvy1982 for the share. Pours a light amber with almost no head. Aroma is slightly oxidized with sweet malt, cherries, port, caramel, and berries on the nose. The flavor is a little lost. A little cardboard showing, with cherries and plums. Time has not treated this beer overly well, but it was still enjoyable.
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Bottle, a thousand thanks to Dave at Half Pints for this rare oldie. Pours orange/amber, with very little head, no lacing to speak of. This beer shows it’s age, oxidation is clearly present, but this beer still has some love to give...Nose is leather, soft toffee, red fruit, oxidized but still interesting. Flavor is very soft, shows the age far moreso than the nose, things here are beginning to fall apart, leather, prunes, extremely soft carbonation. Likely a work of art in it’s prime, still quite drinkable now.
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;clear dark brown. Light malty aroma. It smells a little funky. Like a mild paint smell. Tastes alright banana and a light malty flavour very low in carbonation. The bottle has taken its toll on this beer, it tastes good but i I bet of was much better when it was fresh.
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Thanks to HogTownHarry. Appearance: Deep red, medium white head, no visible carbonation.

Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Deep bronze in colour with a lingering thin tan head, light lacing. The aroma is very caramely, high sugary sweetness, some dark fruits, lots of malt, some chocolate. The flavour is lightly bitter, some orange citrus, light caramel sweetness, chalky. Lightly sweet mouthfeel, medium/lght body, medium carbonation. Finishes with a moderate bitterness, light chocolate. This had an unbelievable aroma but after that it sort of loses track and takes another direction. The aroma and flavour are 2 different beers. 660ml bottle obtained in a trade with piscator34, thanks Kris. Opened on July 16, 2008. No date.
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;341ml bottle. Mild fruity esters, dried wood, green pepper and some grassy hops on the nose. Pours a dark copper/amber with a lasting white head. Flavor is heavy on the toasted malt and surprisingly light on the esters. Wheat toast, very faint banana, dried leaves... I can see how this would pair nicely with a slice of multi grain bread. Medium bodied with a dry toasty finish. Thanks Scott!
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;341ml bottle. So sad to see the ol’ bombers go out the door. Nice hazy brown beer with a small tan head with some staying power. Aroma is very complex. Banana, clove, pepper, sugar, yeast. Phenomenal. Light feel with a biscuity malt, spicy hop flavour and small bitterness in the finish that carries over after. Well balanced. Refreshing. Makes you want summer to arrive that much more.
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Very complex aroma with carmel and the sweet classic wheat beer scent. Cloudy red color, with a sweet and bitter flavor. Is a cross between a Hoengardeen and a red ale. I like it.
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;[998-20071223] 660mL (w/ GregClow, jerc). Boozy roasted malt aroma with a bit of wheat. Slightly cloudy, red body with a quick foamy off-white head. Fruity boozy wheat flavour base has a bit of heather floral. Medium body. Mild, not bad but would want to re-rate a fresher sample.
Half Pints Weizenbock;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Bock - Weizenbock;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Bottle shared with jerc & mabel - my bottle via trade with piscator34. Ruby-copper colour with a wispy head. Aroma is mellow and warm, with some spice/clove and caramel notes. Medium body. Flavour is mild, with some sweet dark fruit and subdued spice. All of the elements were enjoyable, but it felt sort of muted to me. (Although to be fair, it should be noted that it was about 9 months past the bottling date when I drank it.)
Alpine Beer Company Captain Stout - Vanilla;Alpine, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Alpine Beer Company (CA);On tap at the ABC pub. They call this one Captain and Vanilly. Pours almost black with a nice head. It is a combination of their Captain Stout and Willy Vanilly. Smells of vanilla and burnt chocolate. Tastes like a vanilla milkshake. Tasty stuff.
Alpine Beer Company Captain Stout - Vanilla;Alpine, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Alpine Beer Company (CA);on tap-pours a tan head and black color. Aroma is dark malt-chocolate/vanilla. Taste is dark malt-chocolate/vanilla, faint hops-slight bitter. Good carbonation.
Alpine Beer Company Captain Stout - Vanilla;Alpine, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Cast at O’Brien’s. Dark Pour with smallish head. Vanilla was quite evident in the aromas, not so much in the flavor. Flavor was still decent stout with some roasty as sweet malty flavors. Touches of apricot on the aftertaste during that last swallow. Pretty good.

Black chocolate, tobaccoash, mocha, roasted malts. Sweet, very sweet chocolate, touch of mocha/coffee. Finish has bitter/roasted coffee notes, better. Well-bodied, slick to viscous.

It’s going to be KILLER!!!

Appearance is copper colored, with a small white head, and nice lacing. Aroma is a little caramel, and some kind of fruit, maybe banana or plum. Flavor is malty, sweet, and it has a good crisp finish. Some hops, but not enough to make it taste like something other than a bock. Good beer.
Big Boss Half Goat Bock;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Boss Brewing Company;The aroma was fruity and estery with a light presence of banana coupled with caramel and a malty nose. The beer was clear amber with a low white lasting head which laced the glass. The flavor was smooth and malty with a light candy presence and a nicely achieved malt character. The bittering level was such that it struck a nice balance between hops and malt with malt still leading the charge. The hops were light, spicy, and well done. The body was medium and the carbonation was a bit on the low side but the beer maintained a creamy character to the mouthfeel. The finish was just dry and crisp. A wonderful bock flavor, with a bit too fruity of a nose. A nice beer no matter what! Pint at Horniblow’s.

It pours a cloudy orange with a 1 finger head of foam. Decent head retention and there's some lacing. The smell has notes of peach, yeast, wheat, a touch of banana. The taste is yeasty, has some peach, light banana, slightly spicy, a bit of citrus and some earthiness. Sounds interesting but the flavours don't work all that well together.

Cricket Hill Jersey Summer Breakfast Ale;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;In no way a Belgian ale--ABV is too low and it’s far, far too hoppy in its aroma, foretaste, and finish--but it has enough malt and other notes to keep things at least somewhat interesting if not quite enjoyable

Abbaye du Cateau Vivat Blonde (Cask);Le Cateau-Cambrésis, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Abbaye du Cateau;Cask conditioned @ Giddy Bridge (JDW), Soton. Another of the foreign beers Wetherspoons have had specially casked for them. Golden colour. Fruity floral nose leaning towards vanilla with enough citrus amongst it to keep it clean. Reasonably full malt with a hint of candyfloss, not overly sweet but a bit too sweet to want to drink much of. Soft smooth body suits the soft flavours well but I have a feeling this might be more drinkable with the higher condition not possible in a cask beer.
Hydes Vertigo;Salford, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hydes Brewery;[CASK: The Gray Horse Inn, Manchester 12/03/07] Number 2 of the Inn Tune with Hydes series and not bad.

Americas Hair of the Dog Barley Wine;Aurora, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Americas Brewpub;This poured dark enough to have me initially wondering if the bartender had brought me the wrong beer. Served in a snifter, it’s a very dark brown and is capped with a sustained, creamy tan head. Nice lacing. The aroma is malty, sweet with juicy fruits, has a touch of toffee, and a whiff of alcohol. Smooth. The flavor is a pleasant blending of the elements from the aroma, although the toffee seems to fade, being replaced by a mild earthy bitterness that intensifies somewhat towards the finish. Good stuff. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL

Jämtlands Påsköl 2007;Pilgrimstad, Sweden;Strong Ale - English;Jämtlands Bryggeri;A Sim rate (RBESG tasting): Sweet sticky aroma with red wine and grape. Nice red / dark brown appearance with a decent head. Flavour is similar to the aroma but extra sticky like teriyaki sauce.

Jämtlands Påsköl 2007;Pilgrimstad, Sweden;Strong Ale - English;Jämtlands Bryggeri;Bottle. Dark copper, clear beer, with a beige head. Dried fruits and malt in both aroma and flavor. Some sweetness as well, in the flavor. Medium body. I found it a bit strange, wondering what their intentions with the beer is. The commercial description says it is a nice beer with the food of Easter, but what do the swedes eat then? Doesn’t mean that much anyway, I’m not a great fan of this beer. Don’t misunderstand, it’s not bad. (070705)
Jämtlands Påsköl 2007;Pilgrimstad, Sweden;Strong Ale - English;Jämtlands Bryggeri;500 ml bottle. Dark reddish body with a beige head. Aroma is aromatic citrus hoppy. Flavor is fruity, malty, hoppy and harmonic. Nice but not outstanding.
Jämtlands Påsköl 2007;Pilgrimstad, Sweden;Strong Ale - English;Jämtlands Bryggeri;A damp earth coloured beer with an eggy off-white head that fails to last. Rather grainy nose, but the dark kind, quite nutty, almost bock-like in its caramelly attempt that head toward buckwheat honey territory. Mild acidity takes on, bringing a certain wooden berries component into the mix and finishing with fading support hops. Fairly balanced, but subpar jamtlands offering from my very high esteem of their line. A bit underdefined in texture.
La Rouget de Lisle Burgonde;Bletterans, France;Flavored - Fruit;La Rouget de Lisle;Bouteille 33cl - DLUO 2014! (Bue 07/2019) Mousse : léger voile, carbonation très faible Couleur : Rousse / ambrée Nez : Cassis, malt caramel Bouche : Première bouche mêmes saveurs qu’au nez en plus malté et vineux. Corps aqueux, sans consistance, ce qui fait retomber l’ensemble rapidement et donne un final sur le jus de fruit sucrée / sirop. Avis : Bue 5 ans après sa DLUO je ne peux donner de note. Le produit est certainement plus fade, mais reste buvable. C’est d’ailleurs étrange, les levures ou houblons devraient provoquer de gros défauts après une si longue période.

Amager Sundby Stout;Kastrup, Denmark;Stout;Amager Bryghus;Barwa czarna bez prześwitów, piana beżowa, średnio wysoka, dość szybko stopniała do grubszego kożucha.  Aromat to przyjemna palona słodowość, o kawowo czekoladowym charakterze. W tle akcenty ciemnych, smażonych owoców a dalej nuty popiołowe, papierosowe. Smak podobnie jak aromat ze sporą dawką kawowej paloności, finisz wyraźnie popiołowo papierosowy, współistnieje z kawową goryczką. Piwo ma sporo ciała, jego faktura jest tłusta, a nawet oleista. Choć piwo nie jest słodkie to jednak pozostawia na ustach lepki, słodki film. Wysycenie wysokie w kierunku do średniego, trochę przeszkadza.

John Butler Porter;Tver, Russia;Porter;Chastnaya Pivovarnya Afanasiy;Picked up a bottle in a local supermarket only to find that it has recently been retired so that was a bonus. Pours a dark colour with a light brown head. Aroma is malt, roastiness, caramel, chocolate, nuts and hops. Taste is medium sweet leading to a light roasty finish. Pretty decent.
John Butler Porter;Tver, Russia;Porter;Chastnaya Pivovarnya Afanasiy;Bottle. (33cl swing-top!) It looks clear when poured, with a dark chestnut color and a large tan head. Quite sweet aroma with lightly burnt malt, quite a lot of malts actually, and hops and resin. Sugar, roasted malt, hops, caramel and some alcohol in the flavor. A bit warming, almost full mouthfeel. A nice blend of a doppelbock, a porter and hops. Thx KnutAlbert for this rare gem. (070321)

Aksarben Bourbon Barrel Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Imperial;Aksarben Brewing Company;A special batch brewed for the first time this year. The brewmaster told me it would be brewed every year, and with good reason. This is simply their best beer. Poured black with a light brown head. Aroma was a strong bourbon, complimented by chocolate. Flavor was a creamy chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and some coffee to round it out. The finish was slightly bitter, and the alcohol barely noticable. I was told it was over 10%. Good body and great flavor. Very similar to the GI Bourbon County Stout.
Aksarben Maibock;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Aksarben Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub. Pours dark brown with a dirty white head.

Full Sail Nugget Special Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;From Mar 2008 I got this in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! The pour reveals a clear amber with a 1 finger head of foam with a little lacing. Good head retention. The smell has notes of both caramel malt and hops with the malt winning out. Nice nose here. The taste has yummy caramel malt up front with a very nicely done hoppy bitterness midway through that does a heck of a job in the balancing department. I can tell I'm going to enjoy the rest of *this* beer. More sips in and I get some roasted malt that works with the hops in the bittering and again, I'm quite pleased with how the hops and malt are working together. Full Sail sure does make some darned good brews and this one is no exception. The mouthfeel borders on being full and it finishes slightly bitter and has a good aftertaste. Nothing boring about this Amber.. something I can't say about many examples of the style that I've tried in the past. Darn good stuff!!
Full Sail Nugget Special Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;22 oz bottle. Poured a deep amber color with a larger sized off white head.

Full Sail Nugget Special Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Sampled Spring 2007 from Bomber bottle. Pours a deep amber with off-white head. Generous head, retains nice and thick for the first 10 minutes or so but then dissipates into a thin glazed layer. Aroma is very fresh. I detect bread bakery aromas, clean citrusy hops, and some toasted nuts... maybe almond. On the palate is initially a pleasant toasted caramel malt sweetness but is quickly overcome by assertive hop bitterness. Malt and hop mingle nicely with an overbaked biscuit sweetness and hop tang on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full and the beer is very appetizing for the next sip - very drinkable. I’m having trouble getting past the bread and biscuit components because I love them so much in a beer.
Full Sail Nugget Special Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Red-amber in color with a tan head. This almost looks like a brown ale. The smell is faint. The taste is unoffensive and kind of bland, some bitterness. I was hoping for something like Nugget Nectar &#40greatest “amber” ale ever&#41 or the Lagunitas Lucky 13 red ale. Full Sail is kind of hit or miss in my book but the hits keep me coming back. I am still looking forward to the next brewmaster reserve series. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 06-11-2007 21:47:14

Overall: While a little thin bodied, a really nicely done amber with nice residual sweetness. For a brew master’s reserve - nothing outstanding and I am not sure if it is a ""RED"" ale. A little more hop-flavor (not just )"
Full Sail Nugget Special Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Has kind of a dark amberish pour, with a small frothy head. Has a toffee and caramel malt type thing mixed with a bit of fruit bread, some sweet figs and prunes, perhaps some apple skins as well. Not really enough of a push by the hops, it could be a little more assertive. Still enjoyable and easy to drink, just a slight bit unbalanced. Not really sure where they were going with this one.
Full Sail Nugget Special Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Full Sail is one of those brewers who are just so hard to nail down. Sometimes their brews aren’t all that good, other times they are a total suprise. This beer kinda falls there in the middle. Even though it’s in the middle, it was still enjoyable. The beer pours out a medium copper/reddish color with a nice sized white foam head. Aroma was spicy/herbal apple cider, caramel, with a touch of breadyness. Flavors had notes of some sweet fruits, piney hops, grains, alcohol and herbs. Easy to drink a pint or two. Not sure how much easier a 3rd pint would go down.
Full Sail Nugget Special Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;22 oz. bomber courtesy of Nate. Pours amber red with touch of brown.

Full Sail Limited Edition Lager (LTD 02);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Full Sail Brewing Company;From Jul 2007 Purchased as part of a mixed 6 Pack at Wilbur's in Ft Collins. This pours from 12oz bottle(best by 091407) a hazy orange-gold with a small head of foam. It doesn't take long for it to shrink to just some spotting and there's almost no lacing. The smell is very malty. I note some caramel and some grain. The taste is pretty flavourful. I'm getting some sweet malt and grain with some floral hop pungency with a dash of earthy tones that grows in presence, especially about midway through. The finish has a touch of hop bitterness to it and all in all, this is a very drinkable Lager. I like it.

Full Sail Limited Edition Lager (LTD 02);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle from Bobar Liquor: Created a thin layer of head which eventually retreated to a shape of an O shaped ring while the liquid was a clear golden blonde color. In the aroma there is a sweet scent of malts that smell a lot like corn. The flavor is bland with a minor taste of sweet malt liquor like malts and grassy hay hops which is clear to me that this 6 pack is way past its prime, but it has held up rather nicely in its year on the shelf.

Baladin Nora Sour Edition;Piozzo, Italy;Sour / Wild Beer;Le Baladin;Bottle split at Leighton's 20K, from an IP trade with Joe Muck of Bald Wizardry fame, 01/03/17 Hazed orange golden with a decent off white cap.

Baladin Super Baladin Sour Edition;Piozzo, Italy;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Le Baladin;750ml from State Line, picked up quite a ways back. Seems to have held up well, with nice frothy carbonation to the amber pour. Semi-tart nose of lychee, apricot, and other similar elements. Mildly acetic, some funk, some oak. Mouthfeel’s a bit underattenuated, though there’s some fizz and pertness in the finish. Flavors have gone a bit soft, though, with strong apple juice vibes and only moderate complexity, fairly muted acidity.
Baladin Super Baladin Sour Edition;Piozzo, Italy;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Le Baladin;2005 bottle. Poured clear, fiery orange with a short cap of smoked beige head. The aroma picked up sour cherry, apricot, oak, and lesser appley notes over fruity and biscuity notes.. interesting stuff. The flavor opened with a tasty blend of tart and sour fruit skins, with aged light fruity meat on the middle.. tart oak, more skins, and light metallic notes throughout.. nice residual fruit skins and oak on the long finish. Medium-bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. a bit slick for my liking on the middle.. overall a tasty brew that held up well over 7 years and exceeded my expectations.

Sudwerk Oatmeal Stout;Davis, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Sudwerk Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub in early March 2007. 16 ounce sample. Lightly metallic, roasty, choco-anise nose. Nice roasty notes present with some vanilla present, too. Nice and aromatic. Moderately opaque mahogany body with a smallish light tan head and fair lacing present. Lightly chocolatey sweet malty start, which becomes a bit vanilla-like flavorwise. Some roasty maltiness with a bit of anise flavor is apparent later on with some more burnt malts and a light hoppiness. A pretty solid, yet unspectacular stout.

Pours a murky dull peach color with a small fine wispy white head. Soapy citrus aroma, light and delicate. Dull soapy taste with some bright citrus notes. Strange cedary finish, spicy rye is odds with.
The Livery Laughing Dragon American Red Ale;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Livery;Cask at TND &#40at 6.25%ABV&#41: Aroma of hops, citrus, tropical fruit, and pine. Poured amber/light brown in color with a small, loose, off-white head that lasted throughout. Cloudy. Very slightly sparkling. Full of small particles throughout. Small lacing. Flavor is slightly sweet and light to medium bitter. Tastes of hops, pine, spruce, slight resin, and a hint of caramel malts. Light to medium body. Thin, watery, slightly dry texture.

The Livery Laughing Dragon American Red Ale;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Livery;Pours a murky dark amber with a gold hue, thin white head, and slight lacing. Aroma of mild hops, slight wheat, mild malt, and yeast. Flavor is a bit earthy, mouthfeel is slightly slick, and finishes dry.
The Livery Laughing Dragon American Red Ale;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Livery;Objectively speaking: Strong American ale with a sharp hoppiness and more yeast than most. I like: Charming straight resin smell translates into a broader flavour profile in mouth. A fair dose of yeastiness offers a sourdough hint. Beefy malts are chewy and thick, accentuated by the absence of filtration. Very, very toasty and that’s a trait I love. Both bitter and aromatic, the direct hop punch is effective and counterbalances the growing sweetness with agility. I dislike: Certainly not very complex for an 8% strong ale. Not very nuanced hoppiness.
The Livery Laughing Dragon American Red Ale;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Livery;On tap at the brewery. This hazy amber ale poured with a thin off-white head and a yeasty aroma. There is a hefty caramel malt flavor followed by a sour and bitter finish.
The Livery Laughing Dragon American Red Ale;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Livery;"Draft @ the Livery. Pours a hazy, golden-brown color, tea-like; off-white head with fine-bubbled lacing. Brown sugar, earthy bitterness, and resiny citrus notes in the aroma; some fruit (apples) and sweetness. Medium mouthfeel: surprisingly light-bodied for 8%: tea, resiny citrus and earthiness, and apple-centered fruitiness; chewy, soft, very drinkable ASA with a nice perimeter of soft citrus bitterness; intricate malt core. Medium finish: earthy bitterness, toasty basic malts, and some lingering apples."
Bent River Whitewater Wit;Moline, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;Pale yellow body, awfully clear for the style, with a modest white head. The aroma has some wheat flakes to it supported by lemon and coriander. Kind of thin. It tasted of citrus juices, soft malt, and light spices. Drinkable. Monthly Chicago Area RateBeer Gathering at AleFest, Arlington Heights, IL 4/14/2007.
Bent River Whitewater Wit;Moline, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear golden color. Hear was white with decent retention and some lacing. As one would expect, the aroma consisted of orange and coriander. Minimal sweetness on the tongue with nice malty cereal grain, citrus, and coriander flavors. The beer was a bit thin and lacked the yeastiness I had hoped for.
Bent River Whitewater Wit;Moline, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Light yellow with a smallish white head. Lemony, citrusy aroma was faint but good. However, this was thin and lacking in flavor or complexity.

Fitgers Chester Creek Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Mystery Growler at during Cellar’s Wine & Spirits Wednesday evening beer tasting. Pours a semi-hazy golden amber brew with an average off-white head that slowly dissipates to a fine film and off-white ring. Aroma of some mild Cascade-type hops, some grapefruit, multi-grain malt and a touch of honey.

Poured a hazy copper, darker than usual for this style, with a quickly disappearing off white head. Aroma was grassy hops, and citrus fruits (mostly lemon).

Earthy orange appearance; milky skin with gorgeous rafts of bubbles. Grapefruit zest, grass, biscuits, honey and orange in an aroma of pristine balance and fairly simple character. Flavor is softly fruity, giving hints of cantaloupe and mandarin, before drying with lemon seeds, florals, and white bread crust. Crisp in the mouth, light to medium bodied, effervescent, soft. Finishes very bitter with a wink of grassy sweetness; cool, pleasant, alluring. The quality is unmistakeable in this well integrated, easy, and forward example. Thanks for sharing, Bob!"
Fitgers Chester Creek Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at the brewpub. Heavy orange Cascade aroma. Crisp and sweet. Light phenolic wisps. Pours a mid-orange with amber hue. Thin white head, ebbing lacy. Flavor is a rich, toothsome sweetness, with a unique grain sugar character and a wheaty, oil texture. A lot of breadth in this flavor, especially in the hops. Great feel and texture for an APA. Lots of smoothness and drinkability, yet persistent body and flavor. Citrus mels with lemon. I can reach out and get a West Coast, bittering with planty pine and then a real floral, citrus aroma and flavor, then a crisp lemon and grass smack, covering the bases of hop variety in the best places they are used. Unassuming and possibly an APA masterpiece. Attenuated to the point of lacking any cloyingness. Bready yeast esters light up the background and add another level of depth.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Pours a deep amber, almost brown, with almost no head. Smell is pretty simple, a bit more malt, but otherwise a typical amber. Taste is quite malty and the slightest bitterness, light citrus, cherry, and a bit of booze. Easy drinking, decent.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours a dark red color with a medium beige head. A sweet malty nose, caramel, banana. A very sweet flavor, rich fruits, banana, sweet caramel. Fruity. Not bad.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;draft @ brewpub. Dark red-copper with scant head. Sweet-n-spicy candy like hot candy/cinnamon. Silky palate. Flavors are not bad at all but sooo spicy-sweet and not enough hops. Too much candi sugar. It dries at the end but still not that nice.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Pours a gorgeous deep ruby red that’s pretty much opaque dark brown until you hold it up to the light. This is a big fat amber without a doubt. Nice thick tan head as well. Mild doughy malts on the nose. Big, creamy body with carb somewhat on the reserved side. Doughy malts with some candy bar notes showing--toffee and caramel. Very mildly hopped. Could drink a lot of this but it’s really awfully polite for how huge the malt bill is.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Copper colored brew with a thin spotty head and sticky lacing. Malty nose of toffee, caramel, some fruity bitterness. Flavors of toffee, caramel, vanilla, some dark fruit. Hops are fruity and not too bitter, just enough to balance out all the malt. Creamy, and rather heavy mouth feel.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;On tap at Big Time. Frothy head on dark red amber. Almost no head without a strong swirl whereupon you get some nice hop scent. Thick mouth coating. Viscous beer. Hoppy but not super hoppy. Sweet malt and vanilla. Like a high gravity vanilla accented amber.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Full amber color. The head thins quickly like a prematurely balding man to a brief matting. Easy crystal malt aroma with some well placed hop notes together producing a moderate fruitiness and candy-sugar complexity. Flavor reflects the aroma with good balance and moderate fruitiness. Alcohol accentuates the flavor, but lacks the brazen appearance of fusels. A touch of bubblegum in the finish. Impossible to believe this comes in at a hefty 8.5%.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Draught at Brouwer’s Cafe: Dark amber, quite dark actually, large foamy cream hued head, moderate carbonation, sticky lacing. &nbsp Sweet malty nose, slight fruity/floral notes. &nbsp Minor alcohol is noticeable. &nbsp Has that slight musty earthy fromage sorta funk too. &nbsp Big malty tongue, soft alcohol, minor hop bite. &nbsp Noticing a somewhat heavy floral aspect, but it is shadowed by the bigger malts. &nbsp Fairly sweet. &nbsp Moderate to large body and mouthfeel. &nbsp Picks up a slight citrusy aspect as it finishes. &nbsp Fairly good stuff, one of the more memorable ones.
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;"Sampled @ Big Time, April 2007 This beer has a sweet malty taste and a punchy hop flavor to it that I was not necessarily expecting. The aroma is a bit hard to pull out, but smells vaguely of toasty malt and caramel. The beer is a dark amber color that has a touch of haze to it and is topped by a wispy amber-tan colored head. This beer is really quite sweet; it is not quite sticky or syrupy, but still noticeably sweet. This sweetness really accentuates a fruit character that reminds me of berries, raisins and red grapes. This beer is actually fairly hoppy (for some reason I was expecting a bit more malt focus); the hops contribute some herbal notes and more berry notes as well. The finish has a lingering bitterness to it as well as a touch of warming character from the alcohol."
Big Time The Big Dance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Cloudy dark amber. The aroma is toasty but also soapy as well - I think in addition to a standard hop woodiness it’s also giving off a floral character that matches the organic dish soap I buy back home). Fairly dull balance. Light toasty smoke, darjeeling, wood. Finishes with a good balance of caramel malt, and a woody hop that is a bit more complex on the palate than the nose. Nice.

BN 150109 8.2% Golden body, no head. Aroma somewhat muted, baked apple, some stonefruit undertones, Body reasonably full, slick sort of texture, lingering finish.

Henry of Harcourt Duck & Bull Premium Draught Cider;Harcourt, Victoria, Australia;Apple Cider;Henry of Harcourt Orchardists & Cidermakers;Very nice fruit aroma, from a clear golden cider with a very thin white, bubbly head. Taste is actually quite empty, almost like soda water. Quite a let down
Henry of Harcourt Duck & Bull Premium Draught Cider;Harcourt, Victoria, Australia;Apple Cider;Henry of Harcourt Orchardists & Cidermakers;Bottle (500ml). Purchased from Plonk Cellars (Canberra). Poured pale yellow with a slight haze. Aroma was of fresh, sweet green apples with a light acidity, grapes and some light pear notes. Flavor was of dry green apples with a good pear-like tartness, wine yeast and crisp grape skins in the finish. Very well balanced with a well hidden alcohol content – dangerously drinkable. Medium bodied with soft carbonation a dry tart mouthfeel and a good finish. Great cider.
Henry of Harcourt Duck & Bull Premium Draught Cider;Harcourt, Victoria, Australia;Apple Cider;Henry of Harcourt Orchardists & Cidermakers;"Pours a full coloured lemon / gold. A little cloudy and soapy. Nose is quite understated; faint fruity apple notes and hints of tart acid. Palate is very easy going; mild apple fruits (perhaps a touch dilutive), plenty of fizz, soft acids, citrus fruits, some firming hardness and alcohol to finish. Somewhat unremarkable (for mine) but sound in construction. 9% ABV is very well hidden."
Archers Tinderbox;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask handpull at Waggon and Horses, Essex. Clear orangey/gold colour with thin disappearing white head. Cheesy hop aroma. Some citrus, some minerality. Some malt juiciness in mouth. Finish has some tangerine juice and it’s really a very pleasant session bitter with very nice tangerine/orange fruit juice on finish. Some dryness too.

Delvin End Smiling Moose Cider;Halstead, Essex, England;Apple Cider;Delvin End Cider;Cask handpull at Waggon and Horses, Essex. Very pale crystal clear yellow/green colour. Almost silvery. Apple fruit juice in mouth. Bit of peanut butter coming from somewhere. Certainly nutty. Moderate juice in mouth. Some apple on end. Not really dry, but there is a certain puckering in the mouth towards the finish, so medium dry? Good to see a real local cider on at this pub. It has some character, nutty dry finish keeps you interested. 7% and frankly I never noticed.

White Marsh Batch 1000 Barley Wine;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Handbottle from brewandbbq. Pours a dark, cloudy, mauve-mahogany color. A shall, foamy, off-white head quickly recedes to just a wispy film. Random, soapy spotting marks the glass. The aroma shows a surprisingly earthy, dark malt background that borders on downright smoky. Figs, raisons, and black cherries lend their signature, dark, sweet fruitiness. I sense some currants in there as well. Molasses and sherry make for an odd couple. This truly smells unlike any other barleywine I have ever encountered. Flavors again boggle the mind, with an unfamiliar blend of cherries, currants, figs, caramel, and smoked wood. There is a touch of cola sweetness, which I attribute to the molasses. There is a hint of oxidized, earthy hop bitterness, as well as some dark spice, particularly nutmeg. Medium-full, slightly sticky body, with an odd, spiced finish. This beer is very strange from start to finish. I’m not sure this is something I’d want to revisit. Put me in the confused category.
White Marsh Batch 1000 Barley Wine;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Pours hazy mahogany with amber hues. A thin, off- white head rose and dissapated quickly. Aromatics lead off with sherry, oak-steeped figs, maserated raisins, and chipped toffee. Very complex and vineous. Some mild oxidation doesn’t detract. The mouthfeel is thickish and slick. Light carbonation allows the layers of flavor to peel away at fir sip. The pallet is laden with more vineousity and sherry character. Bitterness is firm, and the residuals linger without being overly sweet. Some tannic oakyness complements the brew without being overdone. Nicely balanced and warming. Leaning in a british direction, but more like a big, old ale. Finishes with an undercurrent of black cherries, some light roast, and lingering maltiness. Big thanks to my buddy Mike for hooking me up. Tasty brew and mucho complex.
White Marsh Batch 1000 Barley Wine;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Cask - Ruby brown, creamy light tan head. Nicely complex nose of coconut, melon, orange zest, nutty oak, and touches of vanilla bourbon. Up front flavors of orangey coconut, vanilla, booze, and wood. Only a slight hop tone late aims to cut down the sweetness. Not nearly sucessful, but it still makes for some nice sippin. Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, sweet bourbony finish. My only wish would be for the hops to stand out more...

Boggart Mad Hatter;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Mild Ale;Boggart Hole Clough;A Mes rate: Cask at the Wenlock. A pretty good mild in my opinion. A little mellow in the aroma but it’s decent enough. Slight red wine notes. Lovely purple black colour very similar to Vampire Purple Montana. Feels and tastes like it has a higher abv, which is good. Lovely full velvet mouthfeel. Strangely hoppy for what it is though. Slight sourness in the finish. Enjoyable mild.
Innstadt Doppelbock Extra;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Innstadt Brauerei;Dunkler Doppelbock mit 7,2 % Alk und angeblich 18,0 % Stammwürze (Flaschenetikett und Herstellerwebseite schweigen sich hierzu aus). Sehr dunkle Farbe - schwarzbraun mit rötlichen Schimmer. Geruch Traubensaft, Alkohol und etwas Malz. Geschmacklich ist dies auch vorherrschend. Die Süße wird von einer bitteren Note unterlegt. Insgesamt für einen Doppelbock aber eher neutral und außergewöhnlich süffig. Ich finde das eigentlich ganz gut. Dem Bockbierfreund fehlt es vielleicht etwas an Intensität, Tiefe und Schwere. Mir schmeckt es aber ganz ausgezeichnet.
Innstadt Doppelbock Extra;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Innstadt Brauerei;16.9 oz bottle from Evergreen Discount. Deep, dark brown with a lasting off-white head. Sweet and malty aroma with caramel, bready malts, chocolate, sugar and a light tang. Similar flavor with a medium body and a sweet finish. Not bad, probably been on the shelf for a while, though.
Innstadt Doppelbock Extra;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Innstadt Brauerei;Location: 500 ml bottle from State Line, 4/24/13 Aroma: Has a fairly sweet nose with some bready malts/pumpernickel, fruity notes, and caramel Appearance: Pours a dark reddish-brown color, with a small beige head and some drippy lace Flavor: The taste is sweet as well, bready and malty, fairly fruity, and without much bitterness Palate: The body is medium, it drinks pretty smoothly and easily, with a bit of stickiness to it Overall Impression: I thought this was a tasty beer. It is quite sweet, but not to the point of being cloying or undrinkable. This is just some solid stuff. I don’t have too many complaints.
Innstadt Doppelbock Extra;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Innstadt Brauerei;Pour is a cola brown with a small tan head. Aroma is a nice dark bread with some raison and other dark fruit. Flavor is a little watery but some dark malts and a slight bittering show up. Flavor after the swallow is typical dopple dank maltyness. Decent beer and maybe a beginner example of the style.
Innstadt Doppelbock Extra;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Innstadt Brauerei;A half finger of tan head on a dark copper colored body. The aroma is fresh bread, caramel, burnt wood and licorice. The taste is mild bitterness with a ton of malt sweetness middle to end. Rye bread and licorice too. Good but fairly sweet. Crisp texture with moderate carbonation. The finish is a little sticky.
Innstadt Doppelbock Extra;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Innstadt Brauerei;Tap. Pours cloudy brown with a large creamy beige head that dissipates slowly with nice lacing.

Innstadt Doppelbock Extra;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Innstadt Brauerei;MacArthur Beverages 500ml ($4): Pours a reddish brown color with an off-white head. Aroma is dark fruit and stuff. Something is amiss with the taste though. I am not sure if there is quite enough of it. Some sweetness. Some roastiness. But really not enough interesting stuff going on. The later sips got better than the earlier sips, but still this doppelbock does not stand out very much.

The Brew Kettle Amarillo ESB;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;22oz bottle.

Nose was light all the way around in spice, hops and malt. finish was light in hop bitterness and maybe even a little watery, an ok ESB.
The Brew Kettle Amarillo ESB;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;Appearance: Pours a hazy, copper body with a small, off-white head. Smell: Strong scent of freshly-sliced grapefruits with a backing of pale malts. Taste: Flash of pale malts and malty sweetness, then the flavor jumps into a hit of citrusy grapefruit with a moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: I’m not sure I honestly care for the American slant to this noble English style.

The Brew Kettle Amarillo ESB;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;10/30/2007: Amarillo ESB has a clear, bright copper color with a dense off-white head that leaves ring-like lacing. The aroma has tons of orangy Amarillo hops. The flavor has some toasted or lightly roasted malt with a bit of caramel maltiness as well. There is a smooth, even bitterness that really works well to balance this beer and add a lot of good citrus hop flavor. This beer finishes like a nice pale ale. Overall it this is a really nice ESB spiked with flavorful hops. This is a great twist on an under apreciated style (in the USA) that works really well. I highly recommend this beer. 16 oz draught at The Brew Kettle in Strongsville, Ohio. Rating #6 for this beer.
The Brew Kettle Amarillo ESB;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;On tap @ Brew Kettle: Orange amberish body w/a lasting off white/cream colored head. Initial aroma is dominated by citrusy grapefruit hops. Toasted and caramel malt trail not far behind. Slightly grassy, but a nice caramelly malt sneaks in as it warms. Lightly fruity, but mostly from the hops. Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma. Finishes on the semi dry side, lots of hops (grassy & grapefuity) in the flavor, and lingers into the aftertaste. Medium body, medium carbonation, a little dry on the palate. Very nifty little offering from Brew Kettle. Nice & fresh, but it didn’t fare too well w/ the mild colby & gouda cheese that I had with it. Actually, they both might have been better off alone than paired, at least on my palate.
The Brew Kettle Amarillo ESB;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;On tap. Fascinating blend of English bitter and American hops. The Amarillo really shines through with a nice herbalness.
The Brew Kettle Amarillo ESB;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;Draft. Aroma: Nice maltiness with some light caramel and nutiness. Citrusy hops with some pine and earthiness. Appearance: Light amber in color and clear. Off white head was small and frothy with decent retention. Not much lacing. Flavor: Medium sweet malt flavor again with caramel and toasted nuts, but with a grainy character, as well. Citrus, pine, and light resin hops with some light earthiness into the finish. Bitterness was fairly strong for the style, but was still balanced. Nice dry finish. Palate: Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Overall: Pretty good ’americanized’ ESB. I like Amarillo hops, so this one was good for me.

Thirsty Bear Menage à Framboise;San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thirsty Bear Brewing Company;(On tap) Hazy, dark brown with an orange hue and a small, off-white head. Lightly tart aroma. Medium body - you don’t sense 10% alcohol at all. Lightly tart brett-likke accents - where do they come from? Dry, lightly roasted accents. Very interesting really - reminds me mostly of a good Flemish Sour. 240307
Thirsty Bear Menage à Framboise;San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thirsty Bear Brewing Company;Draft. Brown beer with a reddish tinge and an off-white head. Malt, oak, and a slight raspberry aroma. Oaky, malty, syrupy raspberry flavor. Medium body. LIngering syrupy finish. Muddled. Trying to do too much with this one.
Thirsty Bear Menage à Framboise;San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thirsty Bear Brewing Company;"Deep purple coloured body with a thin white head. Aroma of vinegar (unpleasant) and prunes, along with some light malt and caster sugar. Light-bodied; Strong raspberry flavour up front with a good sweetness and a decent body. Aftertaste is a bit more ’off’ with an odd alcoholic and funky taste to trail the actual taste. Overall, a decent fruit beer - one to try if you really like raspberries. I sampled this beer on draught at the brewpub on 28-February-2007."
Church Brew Belgian Black Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Church Brew Works;I believe they have this as Belgium Strong Ale in the brewhouse today. Big comparison to thunderhop. Smokey hoppy aroma. Some extra malts are used that aren’t in Thunderhop. Deep and hoppy.
Church Brew Belgian Black Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Church Brew Works;"4/13/2010: Church Brew Belgian Black Ale... Aroma: Sugary. Appearance: Brown, mostly opaue; still visual presence. Flavor: Malty and sweet; dates, baked fruits; some alcohol venting; some chocolate notes in the finish; too sweet. Palate: Medium-full; soft and mellow; almost chewy. Overall: Very much like a barleywine or sweet scotch ale; is this is a Belgian Quad? Draught (20°P, 1.080 OG, 25 IBU, 8.0% ABV) at Church Brew Works in Pittsburgh, PA. Rating #7 for this beer."
Church Brew Belgian Black Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Church Brew Works;Enjoyed on tap in an elongated tulip glass. The beer pours an opaque black color, with a moderate light tan head. The nose brings first notes of milk chocolate, plumes, and figs. As the sample warms, a more grainy tropical ester profile emerges. Not unpleasant, but not as appetising as the best Belgian variants of similar styles. The palate is moderately estery up front, with the aforementioned notes replicating themselves. The mid-palate transitions to a nicely malty note, with Continental character malts making themselves known. Interestingly, roasted character is fairly muted, and it seems the beer would actually benefit from a more liberal hand with chocolate and roasted malts, as it would add a bit of body to what threatens to be a slightly thin mouthfeel. The finish is fairly sweet, and fairly fruity. Overall, certainly one of the better seasonals that CBW makes.
Church Brew Belgian Black Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Church Brew Works;On tap at Church. Cherry cola body with a white ring for a head. Malt dominated nose, light yeast and bubblegum provide a sweeter balance. Flavor has stronger bubblegum, chocolate malt, fairly strong yeast, and heavy ethanol, particularly with warmth and killing the short finish. This definitely needs to drop the sweetness and get rid of the alcohol, but the chocolate malt and bubblegum were surprisingly nice together.
Church Brew Belgian Black Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Church Brew Works;On tap at Church. Rich malty aroma with candi sugar, plum, licorice, and roasted grain. Light fruity hops. A bit of alcoholic vapors, and smooth. Nice aroma. Dark brown-black clear with no head. Medium-heavy oily body with light carbonation. Alcohol burn and some syrupy thickness. Starts sweet and malty with brown sugar, alcohol and fusel notes. Dates and nutty with light yeasty bits. Light bitter finish with sweet nutty after and lingering bitterness. Full of flavor though a bit watery at the end. Nice ale.
Church Brew Belgian Black Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Church Brew Works;Had this beer on draft with Pizza at Church Brew Works. I really nice belgian and the dark malts added even more character. Otherwise I very good example of the style. Again at the Church and still remarkably good if a little sweet
Church Brew Belgian Black Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Church Brew Works;Dark cola body. Thin light tan head. Sweet metalic fruity water aroma. Fruity belgian esters, fizzy and awkward body. Sweet estery fruits, but some dry roasted malt character too. Like a sweet belgian brewpub dunkel. Seems like a slight mess at first with all the bubblegummy fruit, but somewhat thick and redeeming after a while. Definitely a litte unique.
Church Brew Belgian Black Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Church Brew Works;On tap at the Church. Dark chocolate brown, off white head. Aroma is banana, malt and bubblegum, quite sweet. Flavor is banana, malt, meat, subtle blue cheese, pine.

5 Seasons North Connemara Irish Red Ale;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale - Irish;5 Seasons North;Draft at Westside. Brown with a thin tan top. Scent is roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is caramel, nuts and roasty.
5 Seasons North Connemara Irish Red Ale;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale - Irish;5 Seasons North;Appearance: Clouded, dusky russet body with over an inch of off-white foam crowning the glass. Smell: Biscuity, bready foremost, then, a hint of toast and, further down, a low note of roast with a sweetish toffee accent enveloping all of it. Small smidgen of dried herb and fruit. Taste: Sugary toffee tossed with crumpled bread and biscuits. Scantly toasty. Small nibble of red apple. Herbal hops provide a little amount of balancing bitterness, though the ale still manages to finish out a bit sweetish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Just a half-notch above medium-bodied. Overall: Has a more beefier character than most Irish Ales, presumably thanks to not being ruthlessly over-filtered.

5 Seasons North Connemara Irish Red Ale;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale - Irish;5 Seasons North;Hazy garnet color. Very nice lacing! rich nutty, malt flavor. light bitterness. sweet like boiled peanuts. smooth, light-medium bodied.
5 Seasons North Connemara Irish Red Ale;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale - Irish;5 Seasons North;Excellent! The cloudy dark brown color is inviting, and the aroma is decidedly ale-ish and smoky. Flavor is mild and free of bitterness, but vivid and with smoky and nutty undertones. Smooth as a baby’s cheek, this is a delightfully drinkable ale, the sort that you sip.
Rock Bottom Yorktown 630 Suburban Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;This beer is just ok. Very similar to Goose Island 312...just an imitation.
Rock Bottom Yorktown 630 Suburban Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;The mug is filled with a thick & cloudy dark amber beverage with a bubbly white head that laces nicely. Pleasant aroma (They dasn’t serve me with a chilled mug!) of wheat & honey with traces of lemon & orange. It has a honey sweet flavor with soft wheat and an orange juiciness. Some lemony bitterness emerges at the finish and rounds the drink out nicely. Not bad. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL
Rock Bottom Yorktown 630 Suburban Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;"Mug Club draft. Light amber color with a short but stubborn head. A light wheat beer smell, which, when drinking, brings a hint of fresh hops. Carbonation is distractingly low for a wheat beer. Bit of toasty malt, barely supported by light citrus hops; Slight weizen yeast note. Rather slight in taste, yet it has room to improve if they brew it again. And after leaving, I still had a sense of well-being, so it’s not all bad.Taster from cask, 6/5/07: Not many chances to try an American wheat on cask. Here it brings out a bit of sourness (I hope that’s not fouled lines), plus extra banana esters. In other words, a different beast served warm. Head remains very short, white, and even more stubborn."
Rock Bottom Yorktown 630 Suburban Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On tap at R.B. Yorktown. Poured a hazy medium golden with a dusting and light ring of white head. Not much to the aroma.. some toasted wheat, darker banana notes, and a touch of other sweetness. Flavor picked up a lightly-sour wheaty base with some darker sugars and toffee.. banana accents & some caramel sweetness too... not bad. OK feel on the palate with some grainy and sour notes.. lighter-bodied.
Laurelwood Strong RyePA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Very tasty beer. Malty and hoppy are the first flavors you pick up, then the spiciness of the rye. Slight alcohol warmth. I love the different flavors. The only problem is this finishes a little too dry and strong for me. I love the first pint but wouldnt want another after, almost makes you feel parched. Actually now that i think about its a perfect set up for having a really malty or light refreshing beer immediately after.
Laurelwood Strong RyePA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Poured a hazy deep orange-amber color with a small off-white head. The aroma was hop forward but nicely balanced. Citrus and oranges with caramel and some rye. The flavor is also hop forward but balanced . Citrus and piney hops with fruity malt. Spicy rye finish. Semi-dry with a stiff land long bitter finish. Medium to full body and fairly warming. Seems stronger than 8%. This was a pleasant suprise.
Lost Duck Oatmeal Stout;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lost Duck Brewing Company;6 oz draft pours black with a dark tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste is the malt and coffee. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Lost Duck Oatmeal Stout;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lost Duck Brewing Company;Had at the 4th Annual Festival of Iowa Beers on tap. Big bitter coffee grinds mask real complexity. Nice mouthfeel, though!
Lost Duck Oatmeal Stout;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lost Duck Brewing Company;From a grolwer that I purchased at the brewpub. The body was black with a light tan had. The aroma was sweet with milk chocolate and wood. The taste was coffee with some prunes. There was also some bread crust and a nice woody finish. Decent.
Lost Duck Oatmeal Stout;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lost Duck Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear, but very dark, brown color with orange highlights. Head was thin, off white, and didn’t leave much lace on the glass. Aroma was of subdued chocolate. Flavor was better with an almost tootsie roll-like character characterized by milk chocolate and light roasty malt. Delicately sweet and medium bodied.
Lost Duck Oatmeal Stout;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lost Duck Brewing Company;"They changed the name to Brewster’s Oatmeal Stout and I was told by the bartender at the Duck that the owner ""tweaked"" the recipe, so I thought I would review it again. From the tap, served too cold and over carbonated for my personal taste, in a pint glass. Poured a purple hued black with a small foamy off-white head that settled into a thin lacing. Aromas of lightly roasted malts, coffee and sweet lactic, a light fruitiness, and a little hint of toffee. A tad fizzy, over carbonated, and a softly crisp, medium bodied mouthfeel, the over carbonation hurts the smoothness and diminishes the drinkability. An ordinary tasting, bland Oatmeal Stout, weak roasted coffee, a sweet lactic flavor that has a artificial sweetener quality to it, a soft raisin and banana fruitiness, a touch of toffee, and a watery malty finish."
Lost Duck Pintail Red Ale;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lost Duck Brewing Company;From the tap, served in a pint glass, made a decent appearance, poured a hazy purple/reddish hued brown with a small tan head that quickly settled into a fine lacing, moderate carbonation. Had a dark fruity and earthy nose with a slight metallic maltiness in the background. A bit coarse and textured on the tongue, medium bodied mouth feel, average drinkability at best. An interesting, but a little off balance tasting, fruity, almost like sour fruit hard candy, an earthy bitterness in the middle with a subtle vanilla cake flavor as well, some metallic malty notes and a semi-dry sour fruity finish, I’m sorry, but unpleasant tasting overall. An interesting, different, but confused red ale from Lost Duck, worth trying, but not that great.
Valley Brew Decadence 6 (-2010);Stockton, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Valley Brewing Company;Lavender and perfumy nose with notes of pumpkin and squash. The taste is lightly tannic, with lots of astringent caramel, iced tea, some caramel and raisins. Body is thin.
Valley Brew Decadence 6 (-2010);Stockton, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Valley Brewing Company;Not a great beer at all, not terrible, I wouldnt buy it again. I was expecting substantially more. not very good, tasted like there was dirt in it
Valley Brew Decadence 6 (-2010);Stockton, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Valley Brewing Company;Tasting at Papsø’s Hazy blond color. Both aroma and flavor remind me the corn mash used to feed chickens. Poor.

Clear light to medium yellow color with a small, fizzy, virtually none lacing, fully diminishing, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, keller, honey, light flowers.

Valley Brew Decadence 6 (-2010);Stockton, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Valley Brewing Company;Bottled. A hazy golden beer with a thin lazing white head. The aroma has strong notes of spices - black pepper, all spice, and oregano as well as some malt. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of spices - all spice and oregano as well as some notes of malt, citrus, and hay, leading to a dry spicy finish. A bit over the top for me.

Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;Foam is renewable, but not so great. The scent is sweet malty with hints of burned malt. First, I can believe that the taste will be something like a Kozel Dark, color, foam and aroma resembles Czech dark lagers. Unfortunately, you probably really disappointed when tasting - I did that in any case - it is a sugar bomb of rank! Had it just been a natural malt sweetness could probably have gone the way, but 1883 is sweet in a very artificial and awkward shape. Only slight positive things are a little aftertaste of licorice towards the end, but its too dominant sweetness takes over everything, including hop bitterness which perhaps could have been a liberating factor. Congratulations to Harboes, which once again has managed to give their beer a bad reputation, and once again has managed to totally ruin an otherwise lovely beer style. I wonder if they really even taste the beer before sending it into stores? - I doubt!
Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle @ Home. Pours dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma of malt, caramel, sugar. Taste is sweet with malt, caramel, braon sugar, faint sweet fruit. Medium body, soft carbonation. Very sweet brew, but actually one of the better Harboe. 150212

Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a small off-white head. Has a fruity malty grainy aroma. Sweetish malty caramel flavor. Has a sweetish malty caramel finish.
Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;heavy cloying sweetness, alcohol, brown, clear, brown foam, light body, thin feel, soft carbonation, not too good of a beer, really intense in taste and kind of foul for me. Also, 0,5 L is far too big of a bottle for this kind of beer.
Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle 500ml @ home Pours clear dark brown with a off-white head. Aroma is sweet malt with hints of licorice. Taste is heavy sweet and light bitter. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft.
Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle. Dark brown with off white head. Sweet and malty aroma of cocoa and licorice. Flavour is very sweet and malty with loads of licorice.
Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;Clear brown with a beige head. Aroma is very sweet malty - like rye bread - and caramel. Flavor is very sweet and so is the finish. Lightbodied, sticky and without any bitterness. Essentially a strong hvidtøl, and that’s not a good thing. It looks like a beer and that’s all this beer has going for it. 210310
Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle. Pours a blackish brown color with a frothy beige head. Aroma is of grains, liqourice, brown sugar and smells very sweet. Flavor is quite metallic and grainy with alot of sweetness, along with the brown sugar and liqourice. The body is light and watery. Overall a pretty bland and boring brew.
Harboe Siden 1883;Skælskør, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Harboes Bryggeri;0.5L bottle, gift from KnutAlbert. Many thanks! Sparkling, brilliant dark ruby colored body, topped by low coarse tan head. Smell of sweet plum marmelade, burnt sugar and English licorice. Sweet-flavored and succulent in the mouth. Taste is malt drops, English licorice and dark molasses/treacle. No hops to speak of, some spicy notes only. A vague tone of fruity acidity, too. Sugary sweet, malty fade. Appears as a powered up Hvidtøl/Vørterøl. A drinkable sweetheart.
Sarapul Porter;Sarapul, Republic of Udmurtia, Russia;Porter - Baltic;ZAO Sarapulskiy Drozhzhepivzavod;"Bottled. Reddish brown body with a beige ring making the ""head"". Roasted aroma with dried fruits and some grainy notes. Roasted flavor with dried fruits and caramel. Medium body and a finish with caramel and some roastiness. Porter only in the name, dunkel would be a more accurate name, even though it is a bit more roasted than most dunkels I’ve had. Thx KnutAlbert for this one, the second rare Russian this night. (070321)"
Sarapul Porter;Sarapul, Republic of Udmurtia, Russia;Porter - Baltic;ZAO Sarapulskiy Drozhzhepivzavod;0,5 l bottle. Dark amber, a little carbonation, rapidly disappearing small head.Some smoked malt and lots of dried fruit, raisins and prunes. Some liquorice, too. A little yeasty feeling on the tongue, not surprising since it comes from a yeast plant. Not a porter, despite the label, I call it a dunkel. This is not quite there, but it would be interesting to try other beers from this brewery 1250 kilometers from Moscow.
Sarapul Zhigulevskoe;Sarapul, Republic of Udmurtia, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;ZAO Sarapulskiy Drozhzhepivzavod;Bottle. Pale amber color, head is thin and fast disappearing. Aroma of malt, dirty. Taste is light sweet and wishy-washy. Very thin light bitterness in aftertaste. Watery texture. Nothing special. Usual Zhigulevskoe.
Sarapul Sarapulskoe Svetloe;Sarapul, Republic of Udmurtia, Russia;Kvass;ZAO Sarapulskiy Drozhzhepivzavod;Bottle. Pale amber color with medium fast-disappearing head. Aroma of malt with notes of caramel and some sor of bread. Taste is light sweet (sugar as ingredient). Texture is thin, aftertaste is light bitter. It’s more vienna lager than ordinary russian pale lager. But anyway nothing’s interesting.
Harrington's American Pale Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle from local Harringtons Bottle store. No b/before stamp? Slightly murky, pale golden, impressive white head. Faint citrus aroma but only very slight. Biting, full malt body, grapefruit, dry hop dominant finish. Probably not everyones cuppa and maybe not technically brilliant when judged against others but different enough to warrant merit.

Karmi Malinowa Pasja;Warszawa, Poland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Polska;Bottle. Dark red brown with an off white foam. Aromas are mixed berries with faeces and cheap fatty cola. Flavours are sweet berries with unidentifiable malts and horrible oily, fatty cola. I don’t know what the point of this beer is. Horrible.
Red Rose Target;Great Harwood, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rose Brewery;Handpuled cask at JDW St. Albans during summer 2008. Gold with a good white head. Fairly hoppy with floral notes. Ok.
Red Rose Target;Great Harwood, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rose Brewery;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Slightly hazy gold. Buttery aroma, sour milk taste. Slight bitterness. Either it’s a poor beer, or it’s past its best. Probably the latter.

Station House Beware The Ides;Frodsham, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Frodsham;(Cask at Ship & Mitre, Liverpool) Dark coppery colored, slightly cloudy appearance. Little yellow head. Buttery diacetyl dominates the aroma, maybe the tap again... Some biting hops come up also. Flavor is more lemony with slight hops, still not very much there. Watery aftertaste.
Station House Beware The Ides;Frodsham, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Frodsham;Cask handpull at Ship & Mitre, Liverpool. Copper/amber colour with thin disappearing beige head. Very buttery/watery bitter. Not a lot of depth. Possible diacetyl as there is a buttery aroma. Some minerally malts, faint fruit (peach, stone fruit) some dryness on finish. Diacetyl is a bit annoying.

Tring Pudding Porter;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Tring Brewery;13th October 2011 Crosse Keys Spoons. Clear dark red - brown beer. Residual suddy tan head. Insipid dark malts and insipid hops in a dry palate. A little soap. Finishes dry with a bitter aftertaste. Hard work!
Tring Pudding Porter;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Tring Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the Commercial Rooms (JDW), Bristol October 2011. Dark brown with a slight, off-white head. Sweet, chocolate aroma. Flavour had more chocolate, some coffee and a dry, roast finish. Ok.
Tring Pudding Porter;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Tring Brewery;Cask conditioned Handpump Red Well Wellingborough. A near black beer with a lasting off-white head. Milky and chocolatey aroma. Light roast in the mouth. A fair amount of bitterness. A bit short but the flavours are good.
Tring Pudding Porter;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Tring Brewery;Cask conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Dark brown with cream head. Quite a smoky aroma, which follows through into the beer, then some Raspberry, fruity notes. Full and fulfilling, really quite pleasant.
Tring Pudding Porter;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Tring Brewery;Cask at the Montagu Pyke London. Frfothy off-white good mostly lasting head. Dark red-amber colour. Moderate malty andlight hoppy aroma. Moderate bitter flavor. Nice chocolate and roast notes. Long moderate bitter finish. Creamy palate.
Tring Pudding Porter;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Tring Brewery;Gravity cask at J J Moons, Ruislip Manor. Ruby/brown with a loose bubbled off white head. Some chocolate and dried fruits help this beer live up to it’s title. Under hopped but OK.
Tring Pudding Porter;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Tring Brewery;Cask, JDW, Carlisle. Sweet chocolate aroma, with plenty of dried fruit. Has a soft and smooth palate, a ruby black appearance and a light tan head. The flavour develops nicely with progress, with the richness coming out nicely and the porter characteristics really becoming apparent. A dryness in the finish, along with some good smoky traces, to counter the initial sweet impressions. My first thoughts after finishing this were of the porter that Whitbread produced, way back around summer 1992. Impressive.
Burton Bridge Perry Power;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Half pint pulled at The Market Porter at London Bridge (London), a clear amber with a bubbly white head. Difficult to pick up any aroma, just a touch of malt. A roasted malt flavour with some definite chocolate notes. More hoppy through the swallow, with citrus flavours. A good smooth bitter.
Burton Bridge Perry Power;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask handpull at Ship & Mitre, Liverpool. Copper colour with lasting beige head. I expected a bit of pear fruit to be honest. Instead this is a pretty standard bitter, some caramel, some hop. Fine, it’s just that it’s a bitter and after an hour or so at this pub, I do get bored of bitters.
Battledown Nobodys Fool;Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Battledown Brewery;Cask handpull at Thomas Rigby’s, Liverpool. Pale chestnut colour with lasting beige head. Lovely malty beer with great depth. Dry malt. Some hop on end. Delivers a crisp finish. Good lacing down the glass shows the condition. Well put together beer.
Kolding Vaarbryg;Kolding, Denmark;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Kolding Bryghus;Bottle courtesy of thewolf: Poured a very light amber color ale with a medium foamy head with some limited retention. Aroma of light sweet fruit is quite weird and not that much enticing. Taste is sweet with some weird passion fruit like sweetness. Body is a bit thin for the style with some adequate carbonation. Interesting to try but not necessarily something I would want to try again.
Kolding Vaarbryg;Kolding, Denmark;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Kolding Bryghus;Bottled. An unclear orange beer with a thick light orange head. The aroma is sweet and quite spicy, while the flavor is sweet with an acidic edge and notes of spices, leading to a dry end. Get rid of the acidity - poor handling must be the problem in an 7% ABV beer.
Kolding Vaarbryg;Kolding, Denmark;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Kolding Bryghus;(Bottle 50 cl) Courtesy of Myrup. Unclear amber with a dense, off-white head. Lightly fruity nose. Quite full-bodied with fairly sweet and caramelish accents - and a whiff of smoke. The finish is sweet. 290407

Kolding Vaarbryg;Kolding, Denmark;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Kolding Bryghus;Bottled. Orange coloured. Unclear. Off white small hea. This beer is probably infected. Why do these breweries sell their shit. Notable fruits and grape in the aroma. Flavour of citrus and light caramel. Is light dry and thin bodied. Grapish and infected end. Boy oh boy.
Kolding Vaarbryg;Kolding, Denmark;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Kolding Bryghus;Bottle. Nice large fizzy off-white head that mostly lasted. Not much lacing going on in the glass. Colour was hazy orange like. The first sniff reviled lots of fruit, caramel, spice. First sip reviled somewhat sour notes. Medium bodied with a soft carbonation. Flavour was moderated sweet with again sour notes. Sour finish.
Kolding Vaarbryg;Kolding, Denmark;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Kolding Bryghus;Bottle. Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a small, fizzy-sounding and bubbly white head. Aroma is very sweet with a malty edge, and a lot of fruity yeastiness. Mouthfeel is very oily and low carbonated. Flavour is very spicy with a caramel background and a clear woody hop-taste at the end. Cannot quite find which spices... vanilla, ginger. Quite vinious as well.
Cains Dragon Heart (Cask);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Brown Ale;Cains;Tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in October 2001. Cask, handpump dispense. Ruby black in colour with a thin tan head. Nice aroma of berry fruit and caramel. Creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malt complex gives sweet malty notes of juicy bramble, raisins and milk chocolate. Slight prickle of hop resins in a very short bitter aftertaste. Finish is smooth with burnt butterscotch and dry vinous notes. This is a cracking example of an old ale and reminded me of Broughtons Black Douglas. The best from the Cains portfolio for me.
Cains Dragon Heart (Cask);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Brown Ale;Cains;3rd February 2011 Chelmsford Winter Beer Festival. Loads of beers shared with ChrisO and Harrisoni - Cheers! Dark brown beer, no head. A light touch of dark malt. A trace of fruit. Dry finish. Okay but really standard stuff.

Cains Dragon Heart (Cask);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Brown Ale;Cains;Cask (gravity) - The Fat Cat, Norwich. Clear though dark ruddy brown with a small, bubbly tan head. Some fruity sweetness & a bit of yeast on the nose. Quite dull and fairly watery body. Caramel, mid fruits and a delicate bitterness. Soft, light body with a short finish.
Cains Dragon Heart (Cask);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Brown Ale;Cains;Cask conditioned - handpump - Eagle and Child, Oxford. A dark amber headless beer. The aroma is light and fruity with some toffee notes. The taste is also sweet and fruity but underdeveloped. The barrel went while some of our party were ordering this beer. Not surprised.

Cains Dragon Heart (Cask);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Brown Ale;Cains;Cask conditioned at The eagle & Child, Oxford Ratebeerian day. Dark brown with red hue. Strong dark malty notes but a little sour perhaps due to being the last to be pulled through. Pretty uninteresting really.
Cains Dragon Heart (Cask);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Brown Ale;Cains;Cask in Tennents bar. Aroma is lacking somewhat, nutty, slight choc hint. Taste is typically brown ale malts, to be honest.
Cains Dragon Heart (Cask);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Brown Ale;Cains;2004 Cask Fresh @ The Rising Sun, East Malling, Kent - a Freehouse. A dark and almost roasty beer - surprisingly light tasting for a 5% ale. Attractive dark church pew colour. Absolutely no condition - completely flat and lifeless. Some fruity sweetness on the edge of red berries - perhaps a bit of raspberry. A very gentle bitterness. Not the sort of beer the colour, name and abv suggests - fairly limited, but pleasant enough. [3.0] Feb, 2008 Eagle & Child, Oxford A sweet toffee edged beer with a touch of tobacco and a handful of licorice. Quite characterless despite the mouthful of flavour. [2.7]

Marston's Pedigree Six (Bottle);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Sept 2007: from BA. Englands cricket team beat India today to win the series of one day internationals. To celebrate I drank this beer, which was brewed in support of the afore mentioned cricket team. The bottle was given to me after a party. I had commented on its finer points to the host and as there were a couple left over at the end, he palmed me this one. Best before 31st October 2007, drank 8th Sept 2007. Poured into a Corsendonk tulip. A good healthy colour, light brick red. The head which was off white soon left the glass leaving a collar and a central wispy covering. The aroma was of hops, yeast and barley, there was a splattering of ripe ’fruits of the forest’ too. The taste was half way between a good quality English Bitter and a fine Pale Ale. Bitter, but without any nastiness, full bodied without being overpowering, a well balanced beer. Very drinkable, this one was taken with a soft French cheese from Burgundy (Pie d’ Angloys) and salted biscuits, which is why the head legged it so quickly.

Cains Joseph Jones Strong Ale;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Strong Ale - English;Cains;Can from brother in lore. Looks great. Smells like the rain pattering on a Great Barr strasse. Tastes of not much really. A little bit of non-ferrous metal (like gnawing on a see saw at Wicksteed Park). Also has some rust, but I think that would indicate a ferrous metal, so the Wicksteed Park thing would be rendered redundant. I’m confused.

Cains Joseph Jones Strong Ale;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Strong Ale - English;Cains;One nitpick - this is definitely a premium bitter, not a strong ale. And a far better one than the price, and that Cains aren’t marketing this under their own name, would suggest. Cheesy can screaming 500ml around the top, contents much better than indicated thankfully - pours golden brown with nice creamy whitish head, disappears quickly with sud ring remaining and slight lacing. Aroma sweet, fruity and inviting. Flavour sweet, smooth malt, lively hops adding a little bitterness, plenty of fruit flavour. Finish drier, lingering and delicious - this is a nice session ale with a fairly light body, despite the 5% abv which is only evident by a slight tingly warmth on the swallow. Really very nice, especially at this price (8x500ml cans for £5.50) - if it were better packaged (and didn’t suggest you enjoy the contents ’well chilled’) they could certainly make more of this. Moreish.

Smells like a fresh pear - but a little too strong, to the point where you know it’s artificial. And then it dies...flavour is ghastly.

Foothills Red Ale;Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Foothills Brewing;Originally reviewed: 3/17/10. Had this on tap at the brewpub. Came out a clear dark amber/red with a thin white head on top. Little lace stuck to the glass. Scents of breads, some mild toffee, and sharp hops. The body is crisp and refreshing. Plenty of carbonation. This is a high-hopped Irish Red. Reminds me of a tamed-down Amber Ale. Some mild breadiness in the middle, but the sweeter side that I expect from the style, is absent. It’s bitter, bold, and good. Not a bad take on the style. Recommend.

Hazy gold, thick beige head. Is this a wheat beer I see before me? According to the Acorn website, no. Lemon citrus aroma, large in mouth, plenty of depth and wide mouthfeel, possibly from the addition of some other cereal. Then great hoppy lemon/grapefruit finish.

Wapping Baltic Gold;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wapping;Gold, very slightly hazy, with a white head. My first reaction to the aroma was ’fruity homebrew’, however a pleasant citric edge developed which was also present in the taste, together with the very slightest sweetness and some soapiness. Thenceforward it was all dry and hoppy.

There aren’t too many pubs where you’ll get a draught perry. Gold/green colour with bubbly off white head. Ooh, this is a bit weird. The pear juice on this is quite sweet I think, touch of the children’s fruit sweets. Pear, but sweeter. Quite full and juicy in mouth. Yes there is a puckering dryness on the end, but even still compared with most dry perries, this is a little syrupy sugar sweet. Mind you we are no where near the Kopparberg level of sweet here."

Cains IPA (Can/Keg);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cains;I drank it in a pub in Liverpool, after to visit this brewery. The color is a classical copper and orange, low carbonation for a I.P.A even British and I was disappointing about the taste watery, few hop, few malt, boring. It is one of the worst I.P.A that I drink in my life, in my opinion, of course.
Cains IPA (Can/Keg);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cains;The aroma is very anonymous, and reveals only a very small amount of hops. The taste is also very poor in malt, but hops are present and tastes of citrus and is really quite tasty. It is disappointing IPA, which does not have anything to offer, besides being a thirst quencher. There are certainly much better alternatives.
Cains IPA (Can/Keg);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cains;Can. Pale with little head. Perfectly drinkable but bland IPA. Tastes like a full flavoured beer that has been watered down. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Uberach Bière a la Châtaigne;Uberach, France;Flavored - Other;Uberach;Bottle purchased at La Cave à Bulles in Paris. I tried this one at the same time as the chestnut beer made by Brasserie Canardou. Interesting taste test. Poured a cloudy medium orange color. I noticed some floating flaky debris in the bottle after I poured it. There wasn’t really any head to speak of. I didn’t smell any nuts, but there was some burnt caramel and possibly some grassy hops. Medium bodied and slightly sweet. Tasted of light apple, grassy hops, and subdued clove. I didn’t taste anything resembling nuts.
Uberach Bière a la Châtaigne;Uberach, France;Flavored - Other;Uberach;Bottled. A hazy reddy brown coloured beer with no head. The aroma is dry and nutty. The taste definitely has a decent smackering of flavoursome chestnuts and has a marked sweetness also. A decent effort.

Clean, nutty, maybe bready, and somewhat grainy malt aroma. Notes of dusty hops and metal. Light malt body, not to sweet, with faint caramel, and again, some metallic notes. Noticable hop bitterness.

Crisp light malty flavours. Hints of caramel and sugar. Grassy hops do balance the sweetness nicely. The body is also rather light, but there is enough flavour and hops here to balance. Overall this is a quite nice drinkable beer given the alcohol content and the fact that it is heavily filtered. Thanks KnutAlbert.
Falcon Påskbrygd 3.5%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Carlsberg Sverige;Canned. Clear brown. Sweet, malty, nutty, corn flakes. Some body here, more than most diluted Swedish beers. But it is quite thin and watery - as expected.
Falcon Påskbrygd 3.5%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Carlsberg Sverige;From a can. Metallic aroma of grainy malts and dishwashing water. Perhaps a hint of caramel there. Slightly roasted flavour of malts with a hint of sweetness. A pedestrian beer but not as bad as I feared. Seeing I’m not particular to Viennas in general my final rating is rather surprising to me.

Wish distributors here brought more to our area. Light cloudy pour with white head and refreshing citrus aftertaste.
Leinenkugels Summer Shandy;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Radler / Shandy;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);This is a backlog rating from pre 2011 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are thin, lemony that seems artificial, floral, cleaner like, this is simply not good.
Leinenkugels Summer Shandy;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Radler / Shandy;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);It’s like the great value version of Sam Adams’s porch rocker (which is 100% better FYI) it’s like someone made a drink half natural light half watered down powdered lemonade... nasty

Leinenkugels Summer Shandy;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Radler / Shandy;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);"One of the first drunken at a pre-summer beer tasting party. Refreshing for the season. Starting to see these Shandys around. Never had a real one, but one of my buddies introduced me to them after trips to England (he had a British wife). I tried Shocktop's version last month. This one seemed more lemony....or more like lemonade. Decent enough to try again to get the real feel, but may prefer Shocktop's Shandy better. Will probably do a ""One after the other..side-by-side"" comparison later in the summer to be sure."

Leinenkugels Summer Shandy;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Radler / Shandy;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Perfect beer for summer. The taste of beer and lemonade are perfectly intertwined. A nice beer to sip on throughout the day.
Boon Faro;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Brouwerij F. Boon;Bursztynowa barwa. W zapachu trochę flandersowe, czyli trochę słodko, trochę dziko z nutami czerwonych owoców. W smaku kwaśność na bardzo niskim poziomie, trochę cukrowa słodyczka i akcenty owocowe. Dość niskie wysycenie. Końcówka lekko sciagajaca, choć pozostaje słodki posmak.

Boon Faro;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Brouwerij F. Boon;Aroma: orange peel, nectarine, funky note Appearance: clear amber color with a less-than-one-finger beige head. Taste: syrup, oak, funky note, lower orange peel, cloying high sweetness, low but noticeable bitterness, very low sourness. Sweetness is obviously out of balance. Palate: medium, oily texture, medium-low carbonation, low alcohol sensation, mild astringency, mild dryness Overall: The taste is quite different from what I expected from the aroma. I've never had this kind of combination in the taste before where sweetness and orange peel spicy fruitiness impart reminiscence of an ESB. Some more sourness would be great for its balance, but at least it has slightly more bitterness than other lambics do. Special.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Line Drive Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Rock Bottom Orland Park;On Tap. I only had this one because I was with some friends and we got the beer sampler...had it before, but never rated it. It was a brighter golden color with a decent sized head. Had good lacing for this thin beer. It really was their clone for the typical bud light/miller light drinkers. Though, it was slightly better than both of those. It had a much better flavor profile than those, with some rouind malty flavors balanced by a slight noble hops finish. Ok
Rock Bottom Orland Park Line Drive Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Weak sister Miller-Lite clone, and this is a case where weak and watery is the perfect way to nail the intended style!

Rock Bottom Orland Park Powerhouse Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Orland Park;"This APA is not bad at all! It has a beautiful head, thick, and frothy (off tap) and provides some nice aromas! The head does almost immediately dissapear. However, this beer falls short when it comes to their ""hoppiest"" beers in their core lineup. Rock Bottom is a great brewery, but comes up a little short in this APA. The finish is clean and dry, but it really lacks bitterness. I think the PNW hops are a great choice, but they balance it off too much with their pale malts...its a 5.2% abv, but seems like a light APA...which is weird to begin with. Decent enough though. I recommend their Hop Bomb! Great, Great Beer!"
Rock Bottom Orland Park Spiced American Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Rock Bottom Orland Park;This is an interesting drink, an American Wheat with Belgian Wit spicing. The body is a very slightly hazed yellow-gold with a bubbly white head that laces nicely. The aroma has soft grainy wheat at the base with a light scent of coriander and orange. It has more of a wheat flakes flavor, but the spices, with the addition of a powdery chamomile, perk up a bit in the flavor. This would go well on a hot Summer night.

Drank in honor of the GABF honor in the Red category. Pours a fairly transparent coppery red hue with small offwhite head. Aromas of caramel malt, some biscuity presence dominates with an inkling of hops. Taste is a lighter caramel, toffee, biscuity, toasty malt body but also light on the palate and sessionable. A bit of the bitterness on the backend is not a major player, but compliments well. A touch of lemon and spice. Delicate. A sessioner.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Dry Irish Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Draft on tap at the brewpub (Orland Park, IL). Pours a rich roasty blackish brown hue, hell hazed, essentially murky with a frothy nitro head that is dulled light brownish hue. Laces well and definitely sticks around. Aromas are roasty and dry, cocoa and coffee elements, roasty barley and irish soda bread, not sweet, with touches of coffee and roast sticking around inside. Initial is lighter bodied, a touch of girth, with creamy body overall. Roasty and lively up front, dry Irish soda bread, coffee, and some gentle bakers cocoa.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Dry Irish Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Another overly thin brew from this pub. This Guiness clone had hints of the dry coffee, chocolate, and burnt malt flavors, but tasted as if it had been then cut in half with water after brewing. Are we afraid of alienating the beer newbies in the south suburbs by releasing an actual full-bodied, flavorful beer. And if so, why be afraid of alienating people with a Guiness-taste-alike...it is already one of the most popular and widely enjoyed beers in the world? But they don’t need my advice, I had to wait an hour for a seat at the bar on a SUNDAY afternoon! What a goldmine!

Pours a nice brownish pour, hazed, with red edges and big brown head that starts to die and laces and remains fairly large. Aromas are typical, pushing malty toffee and caramel, light nut and biscuits, with just a touch of a floral hop. Initial is creamy, yet light bodied, pushing some toffee, vanilla, caramel, and lighter tobacco and nut qualities. Decent floral bitterness balances the sweet malt on the backend. This is considerably better than the 80 shilling of a couple months ago, preaching some defining flavors that are sustainable yet light and sessionable at a moderate 6.2 percent. Finishes with decent toast and toffee and light bitterness. Nothing palate breaking, but certainly enjoyable.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Naughty Scotch Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Rock Bottom Orland Park;This was my favorite at the new Rock bottom. The body’s a reddish chestnut in color and it’s capped with a small short-lived head. It smells of old caramel, a bit of toffee, a squirt of butterscotch, and a woody like bitterness. Light roasted malt and subdued juicy fruit are blended into the flavor. The finish was rather abrupt. Overall, a decent, warming ale. Rock Bottom Orland Park, Orland Park, IL

A major improvement from your other brews, keep it up. Hard to find, not sold in retail stores, only in cantinas (very cheap bars).

Great Dane Get Your Hops Off;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"FIRST TRIAL: I was not happy with this brew. It poured a brownish red with a reasonable head that stuck around for most of the beer. There was nice lacing, but the aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel were all very, very off. The aroma was a bit of clean hoppiness (reminiscent of the Uber APA, which I liked a lot) with a bit of maltiness. However, the taste was entirely ACRID! This beer was so acrid and raunchy that I thought I was drinking out of a dirty glass. The beer tasted like old dishwater (or as my friend describes it ""sour-hop""). I am usually a big fan of the Dane’s beers, but this was just awful, and I show no remorse in the rating that I’m giving it because it really does not deserve any better!"
Big Horn Sleigher;Lakewood, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);I love strong ales...and, this one is no different. Ran into this in Lincoln, MT and drank it like I was severely dehydrated. At 9% ABV, the dehydration does not last long. Drink this.
Big Horn Sleigher;Lakewood, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Had this today at the Northgate location. Was listed as Winter Ale, but at 9% alcohol and with a flavor profile similar to Oakes description, I did not want to add anything if I did not have too... Lazy. Hazy amberish pour with a thin lasting head. The aroma is very doughy with some floral and citrus hops in the background. Not a lot of sweetness, but one would say it is pretty malty. Flavors of doughy malts, lots of it really. After the dough comes the floral and citrus hops. Not bitter, but a nice hoppy presence rounds it out in the finish as does a little bit of alcohol warmth. Pretty decent.
Big Horn Sleigher;Lakewood, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);From one of the Seattle area Rams, at Hard Liver (I’ll try to find out which one). Chewy malts and bubblegum phenols on the nose. Colour is fairly light bronze...much lighter than usual for the style. Profile is kind of standard - moderate everything for the most part but with a pleasant alcoholic signature.

Quite a lot of carbonation at first but this seems to dissipate quickly. Almost no head. Grain and butterscotch dominate the aroma. The taste isn’t much improved: a sweet/savoury, buttery mess. Like eating one of those Japanese baked-potato candies. Worst Milton beer I’ve had by a country mile.

The flavour is along the same lines except the dog food is replaced with wheat until the finish where it makes an unwelcome return.

Heavy, nutty. roasted malt aroma. Beer delivers w/a serious malt flavor w/overtones of roasted nuts, caramel, & toffee. A classic bock style w/no trace of hops whatsoever, which figures as beer contains 7 different types of malt (according to the bartender). Very smooth, very drinkable, very enjoyable; doesn’t really taste like a 9% beer; alcohol is well hidden. Reminds you somewhat of their Zwaanend’ale. Try & get here & try this beer if you are a fan of this style, but you better hurry as it’s one of their brewpub specials & they usually come & go pretty quickly!! Went on tap 3/22!"

Spinnakers Titanic Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Spinnakers Brewpub;No head, very little carbonation. Sour is really the only taste here. Not sure what the heck’s going on with this beer, I figure they want it to taste like this or they wouldn’t keep selling it like so, but it ended up a drainpour. The third beer I’ve had by this brewery that was seriously off.

Spinnakers Titanic Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Spinnakers Brewpub;"Bottle from Central City Liquor Store, Surrey Black color, with small head. Moderate aroma of roasted malts, with very light notes of bread and acid. Good body structure; unfortunately a lingering acidity is immediately perceived and spoils the experience; besides that, there is some dry chocolate and roasted malt; all indicates this could be a good beer if not flawed. Note: the label has dents corresponding to the year (?) 02, the month 08 and the days 2 and 29; confusing"

Mill Street Distillery Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Wow, lots of foamy clingy head. Flowery scent. Rather bitter. Has some real bite.

Mill Street Distillery Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle. This beer feels stronger than it is. From the name to the taste. Big caramel and bread taste, with some hints of chocolate. You also taste the yeast too with some fruitiness in there. Has a good amount of carbonation a bit of bite. A nice surprise that comes in a 6 pack taster pack.

Penn Weizenbock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;On tap at Pennsylvania Brewing Company. Black with small off-white head. Aroma is banana, medium body, lower carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is banana and some chocolate. Dark compared to many weizenbocks.
Penn Weizenbock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;"Bomber from Liberty Beer on Liberty Ave. Nose sweet and lilting with malt, melanoidin, brown sugar, bubblegum and clove, alcohol, darker earth. Pour deep mahogany, lets through just a smidgen of light and ruby toward the bottom, head is large and foamy-rocky tan. Good deal of warmth from the alcohol and an occasional slash of heat; very obesely malty and dominated by brown sugar, but bits of hoppy grass, scorch, humus, autumn leaves. Picking up wood, plenty of spice, touch of vanilla, perhaps a touch of orange peel with very very minimal plastic in the spicy scratch in the throat (right next to that mildest peppery phenol). Seems halfway to dry in the early sips but there's enough accumulation over time that I'm comfortable calling this sweet. The cloves do persist, but my poor palate for IAA doesn't detect much in the way of banana. The wheat is evident mostly in that pleasant, slightly gritty end wash and long phenolic aftertaste. My biggest fear -- that this was going to be a sloppy, boozy mess -- did not obtain, so, generally, worth checking out. [2018.07.11: 3.5]"
Penn Weizenbock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Bomber bottle with Rick direct from the production line of Penn Brewery. Very foamy and plenty of yeast. Tastes of bitterness and honey. Quite good for a late summer night.

T: tons of plums, fig, raisins, and some light cherry flavors. huge amounts of clove and nutmeg in the flavor. M: medium bodied. slightly warming mouthfeel. nice, high carbonation level.

Penn Weizenbock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Consumed on 4/21/08 Appearance: Brown with a dark brown center and a off white crown 3 finger crown. Medium retention and lots of lacing decorate the glass. Smell: cloves, faint overripe banana, peppercorn, and wheat. Taste: same as nose. Starts with a slight bitterness and then the clove takes over. Soon a melding with overripe banana comes and the finish is slightly sweet. Palate: body is on the light side of medium, it’s slighty syrupy and the carbonation is just perfect. The abv has some legs but the mouthfeel is terrific!
Penn Weizenbock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Nothing shows Pandemonium-but this is a review of Penn’s bottled weizenbock. (as opposed to pennedomonium maibock) 750 ml bottle poured into my Weizen glass. Had this on-tap at Bocktown during my reviewing hiatus-but figured I should buy a bottle to review. A- Opaque (seriously) medium brown body with highlights of lighter brown throughout. Pours with a decent 2 finger head which eventually fades completely. No lacing is left behind in the glass. S-Chocolate comes out first, followed by a spiciness, then raisins and plum. A little bit of alcohol comes through too. T-Upfront is some spiciness with a solid yeast backbone. This is followed by a dominant presence of dark fruit (plum and raisins). Finish is consistent with the flavor mentioned (nothing weakens or intensifies) except a hint of chocolate emerges here. What is left to linger is remnants of dark fruit, spiciness and a slight alcohol heat. P-Medium carbonation ans medium-weight body. Initially smooth because of the yeast but the alcohol shines through in the mouthfeel for the finish taking away slightly from the smoothness. O- I like this brew-but honestly think that I should have chosen a different glass. It’s a very good, solid weizenbock-that confuses me even more on what the typical style profile is for this beer. Definitely worth a try. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 10-12-2008 03:02:42
Penn Weizenbock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Bottle shared by lukin013 on 8/29/08: Pours a hazy copper amber brown with a spotty-lacing light tan head.

North Country Kölsch 45;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;North Country Brewing Company;The best beer of the evening at the brewpub. Good friendly presentation tot he olfactory. Very little initial bitterness but that just hides the moderate finish. Yes, a bitter personality builds during the session. Decent co2 throughout. Slightly hazy pale yellow in color. Medium length bitter finish but it never goes over the top, tend to remain civilized thru till the end. Yes, good overall impressions for this well behaved beer.
North Country Kölsch 45;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;North Country Brewing Company;Pours clear and golden with a thin white head. Not much aroma.

North Country Wee Heavy Imp Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;North Country Brewing Company;Very dark red, looks like chili powder. Spices are hot and the high ABV comes through. There is spiced malt and overall a real robust ale.
North Country Wee Heavy Imp Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;North Country Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Sweet malt notes, with some molasses, licorice, toffee, and mild fruity notes. A bit of chocolate and tea, graham crackers. Dark murky brown with no head. Medium heavy body with medium carbonation, not quite oily. Starts sweet with brown sugar, light licorice, candi sugar, and mild chocolate. Fruity character too. Mild bitter notes at finish with sweet alcohol and nutty after. Light warming and roasty notes.
North Country Wee Heavy Imp Ale;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;North Country Brewing Company;This was my first beer from north country and it was pretty impressive. Aroma had a little peated malt that left some smokiness and had a lot of maltiness. Flavor was very smooth and rich but the alcohol was pretty well hidden. Pretty tasty beer. I wanted to take a growler to go but they ran out of growlers how does that happen!
North Country The Other One;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;North Country Brewing Company;Poured on draft at the source. Pours a semi hazy lighters copper color with a white head of foam. Aroma is musty and malty. Taste is sweeter and musty. Heavy on the palate. Alcohol is covered quite well.
North Country The Other One;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;North Country Brewing Company;Draft. Body is brownish with little head. Aromas are sweet caramel malt and a touch of pine. Flavor as the above with a lovely little bit of alcohol warmth. Could maybe have a little more malt stickiness, but nice enough as is.

North Country The Other One;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;North Country Brewing Company;Had this on cask at north country and I was a little dissapointed. I wish I would have tried it on tap. Aroma was malty but fairly weak. Flavor was really creamy and smooth and very malty also with not really any of the 8.4% noticable at all. This is worth a shot but I personally think it would be better on draft.
Mad Anthony Spring Fling;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On tap in FTW: Clean amber hue with a small fading head and good lace. The aroma has notes of vanilla, apple, pear esters along with caramel, biscuit, and grainy vapours. The taste has a smooth sweet malt flavor with a light acidic twang and herbal finish. The mouth feel is soft, light, and refreshing. Okay brew but wonder if it has been on tap too long considering it is a spring bock.
Mad Anthony Spring Fling;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Tap. Sweet malt aroma with a hint of cherry. Amber with a small head. Slightly sweet barley malt with a mild hops finish. Tasted more like a regular lager to me - nothing bad but didn’t really have many bock characteristics.
Mad Anthony Spring Fling;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This draft brew from the brewery was described as the Barr Street Bock recipe tweaked. It poured a large sized head of foamy off-white colored bubbles that were and left behind a uncarbonated orange brown colored body and a poor lacing. The mild aroma was malty and sweet. The mouth feel was weakly tingly and malty at the start mediumly tingly at the finish with a mild hoppy biting aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of mild hops sweet mild vinousness and dough. Not one that I would likely buy again.
Mad Anthony Spring Fling;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;"On tap at MABC. Small ivory head that mostly lasted, fair amount of lacing, no visible carbonation, transparent, and an orange hue. Nose was malty, some caramel notes, some hops, sweet, and some grapefruit notes as well. Flavor was sweet, thin, malty, mildly hoppy, some grapefruit, and some caramel. Smooth, thin mouthfeel. Light body. This brew was not ""very bock like"" in IMO, but then again this is MABC and like some of their other brews they don’t resemble the true style."
Mad Anthony Spring Fling;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;tap at the brewpub - Pours clear amber with a thin head. It smells very malty. The flavor is mostly sweet malt supported by a medium bodied, fairly softly carbonated palate. I don’t know what the ABV is, but it’s high enough that this brew provides a little warmth. I enjoyed this nice bock. Rerate: I have to knock this one down a bit because I had a second pint that struck me as on the weak and watery side.
Mad Anthony RyePA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Draft @ brewery. Buttery caramel malt, rye, and orange aroma. Hazy copper with a small off-white head.

Very impressed with this Rye version of an IPA, definitely will be back for more!
Mad Anthony RyePA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Half pint at the brewpub - Aroma of earthy piney hops, caramel and a touch of rye. Pours transparent gold/brown with a small head and good lacing. Flavor matches aroma with a bit of a rusty aftertaste. One of the best brews I’ve had at MA and I would drink a lot more of if I lived closer.
Mad Anthony RyePA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This draft brew from the brewery poured a large sized head of foamy finely sized off-white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a transparent softly carbonated orange brown colored body and an excellent lacing. The mild aroma was malty. The smooth mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The nice rye hop flavor contained notes of mild soft hops and well balanced amount of rye. I think the rye amount was perfect and made it very well balanced with the hoppiness. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Mad Anthony RyePA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On tap at MABC. Medium sized ivory head that was mostly lasting, no lacing, minimal carbonation, transparent, and an orange hue. Nose was lightly malty, caramel, very hoppy, some pine/grapefruit, and some rye notes. Flavor was some maltiness, caramel, hoppy and pine/grapefruit taste. Fairly smooth palate. Light-medium body. A lot more true to style than their Spring Fling brew IMO.
Mad Anthony RyePA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;tap at the brewpub - Pours copper with a medium sized, enduring head that left me some nice lacing. Citrus hops dominate the aroma as they do the flavor. This mostly just tastes like a good IPA. I think I’d have to have it next to MA’s regular IPA to really note the rye difference, but I think I detected a hint of rye under all that hops and the finish seemed more dry. I knew from experience that MA could brew a good IPA and this variation proves it again.

West Berkshire Grist to the Mill;Yattendon, Berkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;West Berkshire Brewery;Cask conditioned at Banbury Beer Fest 07. Tawny colour with white bubbly head. Nicely balanced bitter with a fruity orange like hop note and a richly roasted body. A decent beer indeed.
Tanglehead Coast Hills Pils;Albany, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tanglehead Brewing Company;Tried on tap at Tanglehead. Crisp medium bite at the start , golden body with a short head though some initial lacing, little thin in body which isn’t a fault for to me. I could drink several of these, light in aroma but overall enjoyable. Faint lemon on the finish.
Tanglehead Limeburners Stout;Albany, Australia;Stout - Dry;Tanglehead Brewing Company;On tap at the White Star Hotel (brewery site) Pitch black color. Light tan head. Good retention to head. Stayed above a thick collar through drinking. Good spotty lacing. Nose is mocha, chocolate, coffee, rolled oats, and coffee. Very creamy. Told it was on nitro. Taste had notes of caramel, vanilla, chocolate, mocha, coffee, roasted and burnt grain, and rolled oats. Very thick for a lower AVB beer. Quite heavy and filling as well. Dry toasty and chary finish with touches of licorice. Solid beer.
Tanglehead Limeburners Stout;Albany, Australia;Stout - Dry;Tanglehead Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours a thick black with a massive mocha head and a nice ashy dark choc aroma. The head is very creamy to taste which goes very well with the thick coffee/dark choc flavour. Wonderful beer overall.
Tanglehead Limeburners Stout;Albany, Australia;Stout - Dry;Tanglehead Brewing Company;Tried on tap at Tanglehead. Black body with a big beaded and short lasting head. Aroma stands out more than the other two previously tried, almost medium body with the malt showing tarry burnt grainy notes, toasted malt aroma, drinks alright it just hasn’t got too much complexity to keep me interested for too long.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Keg@nags head, peterchurch, Herefordshire. Amber beer with medium head. Aroma of malts. Taste is malts, some caramel and hop bittering. Ok beer.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);On tap at a pub in Windsor - can't remember which one. This was one more pint of flavorless swill. Pours golden with minimal head. No flavor at all. A medium bodied glass of yellow water.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);On draft at the Hilton (Warwickshire) With limited options to choose from this seemed the most appealing. Time permitting I would have loved to go back to Slaughterhouse but that’s life. The good news is that I have had far worse bitters. A run of the mill pub clip probably sells as good as it does because of the Shakespeare caricature. Don’t be fooled yourself unless it is a freebie. Aroma / Appearance - The caramel base is on the thin fluid side. A khaki head bubbles with a tease of carbonation below the surface. Butterscotch, caramel chews, and light malts stand out. If any hops were used in the brewing process they have faded away into the background. Flavor / Palate - Butterscotch and caramel notes slip past the tongue before anything shows up. Pretty routine it at least has some flavor to it before fading in the back of the throat. There are no glaring flaws. However if you’ve had enough bitters to understand the style you’ve had a number just like this one.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Draught @ hilton Bracknell. Dark amber to brown coloured beer with some medium carbonation and a small white head. Rather floral hoppy hinted aroma. Medium to full palate. Finish is bitter hoppy balanced. Not bad.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);(on tap @ Cino Lounge, Hilton Warwick) Pours a clear, dark amber with no head. Aroma is malt and urinal cake. Watery texture, light body, soft carbonation and a lightly bitter finish. Taste is bland.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Cask. Dark clear gold. Thick cream coloured bubbles. Surprising amount of carbonation. Very floral nose, with bags of malt too. Smells a little like a urinal cake. Taste is floral, though not as pungent as the taste. Like drinking a weak pot pourri. Not unpleasant though... Finish has just enough bitter to take the edge off it.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);On tap in London 04 aug11. Dark amber colour with a thick off white head. Mild malt and hoppy nose. Mild flavour but gives a nice mouthfeel. Medium sweet malt, light hoppy and a light roasted flavour in the background.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Tap @ Leopold Tavern, Southsea, UK. Pours dark amber with thick off white Head. Arma malts and hops. Dry hoppy flavor. Sweet, lean and still crisp on palate. Finishes bitter hoppy.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Cask. Amber with an off white medium head. Again, my nose is knackered so can’t smell fuck all. Flavour was a nice drinkable caramel with some light roasted malts and hop bitterness. I liked it.
Flowers Best Bitter (Keg);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Unexpected rate at a Brewer’s Fayre-type place. Tawny amber with a nitro slick. Copper penny aroma. Watery with notes of rust, biscuit, caramel, nibble of hop extract. Thin, metallic and painful. But I drank it.
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Canned, thanmks lgklotet! Near black, rich head. Strong, rather unpleaant dusty aroma. Now I understand why I was warned against this beer. Medicinal licorice and flavour with some coffee and fudge. Boldly malty with notes of syrup. Mineraly salty finish. I definitely prefer the non-Ginseng version of this.
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Been saving this one since the last time I went to Singapore, and a few hours before I leave again for Singapore - I figured I’d try this. Horrible aroma when the can opens - yep, its definitely ginseng. Deep black coloured body, about 90% opaque, with a nice frothy light brown head that leaves a nice lace on the side. Aroma of strong as hell Korean ginseng, oatmeal, alcohol, nuts and more ginseng - really overpowering stuff. Full-bodied; Very creamy, almost milk stout taste with only minor hints of the ginseng, some caramel and nuts to top off the beer and a dose of dry oak at the end. Aftertaste definitely has the ginseng, but not killing out everything else. Some alcohol and bitterness persists, but the maltiness prevails, along with that pesky ginseng. Overall, a pretty awful beer at first, but somehow it mellows out or I’m getting used to it or something? A decent beer - definitely an interesting one, and easily seen that this is a well crafted beer, even if you don’t like ginseng. Needless to say, I’ll probably cozy up to one of these at a hawker stall and bring some back to show other people. I sampled this 33 cL can purchased at a 7-11 (they are everywhere) near the Somerset SMRT station in Singapore in August 2007 sampled at home in Washington on 30-October-2009."
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);This is a terrible beer and should be avoided at all costs! The ginseng is so overpowering and gross that it totally kills this beer. Some things just should not be infused into beer!
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Can. A pitch black beer with a brown head. The aroma is earhty combined with roasted malt. The flavor is sweet and acidic with strong notes of roasted malt as well as medium notes of ginseng and earth.
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);(Can 33 cl) Courtesy of fiulijn. Pours an opaque black with a handsome, frothy and rather retentive light brown head. Weird aroma of burned malt, dust and dirt - guess that’s ginseng for you. Medium body with a low carbonation and a soft mouthfeel. Very burned malt accents coffee and ashes and a malt bitter finish. Admittedly an alternatively smelling beer, but them Aussie below are wussies for being THAT put off... :-) 030608
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);33 cL can. Pours dark brown with a creamy and dense tan head. Aroma of mouldy bark gone wet on a summersday. Dry roasted malt and spiced ginseng. Flavour is dry roasted malt with an earthy spice note. Ends with a smoth chocolate note with a diminished earthy spice note. Light acidic touch.
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);This beer nearly killed a group tasting. There were eight of us in Sully’s house when he opened two cans of this, and eight of us outside shortly after. The stench of rotting asparagus filled a room and lingered for hours. Just a sip or two of this ginseng-infused stout induced foul burps that tainted all the beers that followed. Weaker men would have quit. Correction, smarter men would have quit. Ginseng may well have life-enhancing medicinal qualities but it has no place in beer. If you ignored the smell long enough to concentrate, this stout looked promising - jet black with a thick lather of suds. But the smell... Green and vegetal. Jalapeno peppers, asparagus and charcoal with a heavy medicinal/mineral taint. It tastes better than it smells, but then so would my feet. Bitter chocolate malts, coffee grounds and an astringent finish. Herbal but not in a good way. All in all, about as much pleasure as a trip to the dentist. (Can courtesy of Sully at his Sydney RB Xmas 07 gathering)
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Sully opened up two cans of this science experiment gone wrong in his kitchen. I was looking outside to see what the neighbors were cooking as it smelled foul. Little did I know this pugnent smell was actually beer. Massive ginseng nose with a gritty roasted malt, thin body, but hardly anything is noticable outside of the ginseng. Blah. One of the worst beers I have ever had. Total drain pour.
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Can Black color, with a big rocky head, beige. The concotion of roasted malt and ginseng creates a dusty aroma, and coffee. Not much body as would be expected for a Foreign Stout, with too much roasted malt flavor and an unpleasant touch (the ginseng). The final as well has too much roasted malt.
ABC Extra Stout Ginseng;Singapore, Singapore;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Singapore Brewery (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);The ABC foreign stout is one of those Asian beers that is a real surprise in the sea of mediocrity. As a strong stout it really satisfies with its formidable presnece and enjoyable java kick. Ginseng is one of the Asian herbs that is meant to have magical qualities that encourage vigour, ward off illness and have anticarcinogenic and antioxidant properties. OK, if you want to be fit and healthy just buy some capsules of this ugly tasting herb. It needs to be encapsulated so you can swallow this foul tasting substance, but for God’s sake don’t infuse it into a beer. The overwhelming smoky herbal nature of this beer is eveidence of a brewer’s brain explosion.

Brouwcafe Donker Genoegen;Scheveningen, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij Scheveningen;Tap at Brouwcafe, Scheveningen: Dark brown colored brew with an sweet dry bitter taste and with hints of caramel and chocolate. Brew is improved within an year, according the ratings i think.
Brouwcafe Donker Genoegen;Scheveningen, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij Scheveningen;Bottle @ WWT. Aroma has caramel, cardboard, metal, swamp and a huge infection. A beer with an infection from brouwcafe?? How could it be else. Flavour is sweet and sour at the same time with big metal. Undrinkable.
Brouwcafe Donker Genoegen;Scheveningen, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij Scheveningen;Tasting at WWT lll. Taste and smell of wet sweet cardboard dog. Not nice. Won’t try again.
Brouwcafe Donker Genoegen;Scheveningen, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij Scheveningen;Bottle @ WWT III, courtesy of deanso. Pours a brownish pour with a tanned head that settles into a small layer above the beer. Aroma is wet clothes and cardboard. Flavour is thin, malty and medium sweet. Really not that good.
Brouwcafe Donker Genoegen;Scheveningen, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij Scheveningen;Bottle at WW3. Poured a hazy dark reddish brown with a broken white head. The aroma is weak dry yeast and malt. The flavour is big yeast and alcohol. Not bad at all from a small brewery.
Brouwcafe Donker Genoegen;Scheveningen, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij Scheveningen;Sampled from bottle @ WWT III. Hazy dark reddish color, small beige head. Smell and taste malts, cardboard, sweetish, overripe fruits. Average body and carbonation. Not nearly as good as the beers I’ve tried from them when I visited.

Flavour is moderate sweet and bitter. Some noticeable alcohol in the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
Matso's Hit The Toad Premium Lager;Broome, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Matso's Broome Brewery;Taster at Matso's Brewery, Broome. Pours clear pale gold with small white head that dissipates quickly. High carbonation. Aroma slightly citrus with some pils malt. Flavour is dominated by citrus hops, not particularly floral. Pilsner malt (biscuit etc.) character is also noticeable. Taste is more bitter than sweet but a good balance exists. Palate is light and refreshing. Some lingering bitterness but not strong. Overall a good larger. Malt and hops with a clean finish and no funky lager yeast esters. Decent.
Matso's Hit The Toad Premium Lager;Broome, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Matso's Broome Brewery;Apparently 'unretired' because here it is! 4.7% 330ml bottle into schooner glass. Deep golden colour with frothy white head and high carbonation. Nose is sweet malt. Medium body, slight malt taste . Some bitterness in the finish then a little more sweet malt and a distant hint of herbs/grass. Super easy-drinking lager.

Matso's Hit The Toad Premium Lager;Broome, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Matso's Broome Brewery;Tasting from July 2008. On draught @ the legendary Guildford hotel, Guildford, a month or so prior to it burning almost to the ground. Medium gold with good clarity and a fine, tight bead. Head went up then went down to just a ring of white on the meniscus. Initial aroma of pond water, water lillies and rockmoss wanes to reveal some spicy, weedy and herbal hops and light toasted grains. Quite fizzy in the mouth, a carbonic acid bite grips the tongue and sees it end harshly crisp. Rough pasty grain flavour, toasted white bread, a sweet front and honey like linger resides long after each swallow. Hops are subtle, herbal but add nothing to it. Very, very light body I found strange of a beer that’s as sweet as this. Really missed the mark for me as a Pilsner. Would love to see these guys brew this one again with a modern touch!!
Matso's Hit The Toad Premium Lager;Broome, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Matso's Broome Brewery;On tap @ Clancy’s Freo (infrequently). Clear pale almost golden body with a short white head. Aroma is not that inviting, mainly malts. Sweet inoffensive taste seem to pick up notes of corn.

Cuvée St. Antoine Blonde;Blehen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Artisanale et Didactique du Flo;A murky blonde ale with a thin white head. In aroma, nice fruity malt with light candy sugar and light Brett, light cork character, interesting. In mouth, a nice sweet fruity malt with Orval quality, light grainy character, light Brett, very nice and complex. Bottle at Cajun Café spring beer fest 2016.
Cuvée St. Antoine Blonde;Blehen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Artisanale et Didactique du Flo;Flo’s first, with a creamy, relatively thick, snow white head and darkish peach blonde colour with chestnut hue, cloudy. Aroma of peach, orange, pineapple, coriander, honey, candi, caramel. Sweetish taste with clear presence of candi sugar, flowery, light malty basis, finishing with too little hops and too much lactic acid, the regrettable result of an infection, ruining the whole tasting. I am convinced this young micro brewery is quietly doing a good job so I will certainly re-rate this hoping to find a bottle without bacterial infection.
Cuvée St. Antoine Blonde;Blehen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Artisanale et Didactique du Flo;Bottle shared thanks to Kant-Rauch! Pours a hazy golden yellow with fluffy white head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma is lemon, dusty farm yeast, hint of grass.

Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;2nd sample from this brewery. Liked the double stout better, but this is still solid brew. Medium brown appearance with light red tint. Balanced a bit towards the hops on this one. I'd call it one of those IPA-Red ale hybrids. Smooth mouthfeel with a slight creamy texture. Carbonation in the flavor, maybe from buildup in bottle from distribution. I would be curious to try this on draft.
Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;Best by 3/2014. Bottle. Pours a red color with small tan head. Mostly caramel malt aroma. Somewhat sweet with some piney hop notes. Not bad.
Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;"From Sept 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with russpowell. Thanks Russ! This pours a hazy red colour with close to a 2 finger head of foam. Nice lacing. The smell is a nice mix of sweet and bitter. Good caramel malt and pine and citrus hops. The taste follows the nose...strong flavours of both caramel malt sweetness and ample hoppiness with pine being primary and citrus being secondary and I notice some roastiness and some grain after the first couple of sips. Very close to being balanced but the pine just edges out the malt. The mouthfeel is solidly medium as is the carbonation, and it finishes with some roasted malt goodness and just a touch of pine. Nice. Nice and very drinkable. Btw, head retention is quite good as is the lacing. Bottom line: This is definitely one of the better Red/Amber Ales I've tasted to date. I'd like another please. ;^)"
Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;Bottles and draught from debut onwards, most recently 2010. Copper-amber body is clear and topped by a medium-sized, beige head with moderate to moderately low retention. Specialty malts and fruity hops are joined by a touch of pine and lots of pepper. Just enough caramel-like sweetness balances the beer gently and the alcohol is well-concealed. This used to be an amazing beer at the start of the brewery, as did most of their other beers. I assume it went downhill and is pretty mediocre now. Lots of fresh, juicy, fruity hops. Almost NE IPA juice levels, though with a stronger pine/grapefruit bitterness. Crunchy/hard specialty malts and light woodiness, with light yeastiness lingering and ample, engaging carbonation.
Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;Backlog, bottle pours a amber golden with 2 finger white head. Smell and taste are ashy and bitter hops, sticky malt, pine resin and dry wood. Medium bodied. I could drink one of these but would get tired of it after that.
Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;Pours a nice dark reddish amber color. Aromas of HOPS, and some other hints, maybe fruit, maybe coffee. Flavor is a bittersweet, malty, and hoppy as hell.
Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;From NOTES. A: pine up front with a superb combination of citrus and hops in the background. Some light maltiness does come out slightly. A: Pours a murky amber red with a nice 1finger offwhite head. Fair amount of lacing and retention. T: Follows the nose with a bit of the fruit, but dominated by biting hops. Not the balance I was hoping for. P: Medium bodied, appropriate carbonation.
Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;Pours a amber red with white head that lingers to lace. Aroma of floral and caramel. Moderate mouth feel and carb. Well balanced malt and hop profile. Finishes crisp with slight bitter after taste. Not a lot of complexity but a nice drinking IPA.
Green Flash Hop Head Red (-2013);San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;Green Flash Brewing Company;Júntese una belga tipo dubbel o similar y una IPA americana y el resultado es esto. Si lo haces bien, claro. Color marrón muy bonito. Espuma poco marcada. Aroma de IPA, claramente lupulado, resinoso, frutal. En boca estamos ante una cerveza diferente. Inicialmente se aprecia claramente una rica base acaramelada, tostada, dulce. Pero progresivamente se va envolviendo en una explosión lupulada que te lleva a pensar que estás tomando una IPA americana. Y de gran calidad. Porque realmente mezcla con efectividad dos mundos. Aunque gana por goleada el de IPA. Muy amarga, floral, frutal. Gran experimento ¿nuevo estilo?

Raasted Gl. Estrup Fyn;Randers, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Raasted Bryghus;Sampled at DØE Beerfestival 2007, Valby. Pours a clear amber beer with an offwhite head. The aroma is malt, caramel and some butterscotch. The flavor is caramel and hops. Palate is bitter. Overall a beer that is only good for comparison with the 2 other in this experiment (Jylland and Sjælland version)
Raasted Gl. Estrup Fyn;Randers, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Raasted Bryghus;Dark coppery colored with slightly cloudy appearance. Medium sized yellow head. Rich buttery aroma with again Danish vegetably yeastiness, mild toffee and some hoppy anis-tone. Interesting and complex aroma. Thin to medium bodied. Flavor is not as interesting, still toffee and some Danish hoppy vegetable also here. Aftertaste dries with some hops, yeast and toffee. Interesting raasted-brew.
Raasted Gl. Estrup Fyn;Randers, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Raasted Bryghus;Bottled. An amber beer with a huge orange head. The aroma is sweet with strong notes of phenol, as well as medium notes of malt and caramel. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of caramel, phenol, and some fruit, leading to a dry, bitter finish, with a strong note of phenol lingering. My least favorite among the three.

Raasted Gl. Estrup Fyn;Randers, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Raasted Bryghus;Bottle. Amber, slightly unclear body, with a beige head. The aroma feels a bit sweeter than the Jylland, more malty, but there’s still a nice hoppiness. The flavor is sweet and malty, with resin in the background, finishing bitter, but quite sweet. Medium body. There’s not that much separating the scores of the beers in this hop experiment, but this was the one I appreciated least. (070928)

Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;Sampled at the 2013 Heritage Festival. It poured a cloudy yellow color with a small white head. The aroma was of citrus, grass, stone fruit and earth. The taste was of citrus, brett, biscuit, yeast and lime with a soft mouthfeel. Nice.
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;[Tap] Pours a light, cloudy amber color. Not much head, although it was in a small sampler glass. Grains, soured fruits and sweet malts in the aroma. The taste was of spice, fruit, astringent grains, caramel and a Belgian yeast profile. I guess the palate was all right. Low carbonation. Nothing really stands out with this beer to me. It was OK, but seemed kinda far from a good Saison.
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;Draft as part of a sampler at the brewery. Pours a cloudy amber with a small off-white head. Notes of citrus (tangerine), apricot, yeast, caramel malts, light spices (pepper and clove). Medium-bodied, with a peppery, yeasty mouthfeel (though not like the yeast you’d expect in a saison), mild carbonation. Not a bad beer, just not quite what I look for in the style.
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;On tap at Square One Brewpub. Dark amber with a thin white head. Aroma of malt, fruity yeast, clove and black pepper. Taste is fruity with fruit rind, mild funk, clove, sweet malt and some tartness. Fruity and spicy finish.
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;Sample at the brewpub. Pours a hazed amber color with a medium thin off-white head that dissipates quickly. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. Fruity aroma with notes of spice and malt. Light, clean body with flavors of tart fruit, bready malt and yeast. The finish is fruity with a mild spice aftertaste. More or less average overall.
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;Tasted 7/19/09. Pint from the brewpub. Hazy with a dark amber honey hue. Speckled off-white head. Spicy and citrus aromas with hints of pepper and a touch perfumy. Good nose. Medium bodied with with flavors of cirtus and red esters. Peppery and tart. Tangy with a well built malt bill. Bitter dry finish. Doughy and perfumy yeast character. Good hop note that finishes grassy and spicy. Solid and fresh!
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;Enjoyed at the brewpub. An amber colored pour with a golden head atop. A very nice aroma of fruit, and yeast. Just a bit of funk. It was a sweet beer with fruit and yeast. No carbonation and somewhat flat in the mouth. I was a little disappointed by this Saison. It was like the Dubel with less zing.
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;Shaker @ brewpub. Pour is dark copper/brown color, hazy cannot see through it. The strong head never fully fades and leaves a sticky lacing. Aroma is very grainy yet sweet molasses and caramel. The taste has less graininess and more just sticky sweet. There is a little bit of iced tea at the end. It is decent stuff, also a bit undercarbonated. This and the Dubbel were pretty similar, not much difference in the recipe it seems.
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;Poured copper in color with an off white head. With a somewhat spicy aroma. Had hints of sour fruit and a bit of a bite on the finish
Square One Saison;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Square One Brewery;There is something strange going on at Square One brewery. For some reason all of their beers have similar profiles: They are either citrusy or otherwise strange-fruity, and many of them exhibit qualites of malting traditionally found in scotch ales. I am not sure what is going on here, but it is really different, and I am undecided on how much I like it. I guess it depends on their beer. If you want to read a rating that sums up how I feel about this beer, read vyvvy’s rating. Yes, the lazy way out, but seriously says everything about this beer.

Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;Draught in a flight at the brewery. Pours a clear brown color. Nose is slightly toasty with some slight grass elements and bits of rye in there as well. Taste is actually slightly sweet, with some subtle toffee bits coming through for me. Meh.
Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;"Draught at the brewery, 7.2% ABV Dark color, mahogany, with creamy head. Mild aroma, a bit cheesy. Good body strength; the malt flavor is nice, providing a mild sweetness; good hopping, not extreme, just in balance, with some hop resins and light fruity touch. This is a light version of American Strong Ales, a good balance of sweet malts and resiny hops, with a lean body and good drinkability."
Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;Cloudy amber, small beige head. Lightly sweet malt nose.Lots of hops, lots of malt. Well balanced
Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;Cloudy orange pour with aromas of floral and citrus hops with light caramel sweetness. Light sweetness with a nice long pepper, floral, and citrus bitterness in the finish. Enjoyable.

Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;Was called Skookum Strong Pale at The Dray in Seattle, so I am guessing this is it. Cloudy, peach amber haze with a crisp glaze of head. Mild aroma of candi malt and barely perceptible hops. Flavor tips in flavor of sweet candi malt with perhaps a touch of sulphur. Bittersweet with tannic bitterness. Decent, but unremarkable.
Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;little aroma hides the flavor thats to come. hazy brown. nutty toasted flavors. finishes bold and strong.
Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;Enjoyed a pint of this one on draught at the bar at Ivar’s Mukilteo Landing, in Mukilteo, WA. Pours to a hazy, deep caramel color, with a thick, creamy, off white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. Lots going on in the nose, with big flavors of toffee and caramel, paired with citus and piney hops. The palate is firm, with lots of big sweet malty/toffee, and bready malt, paired with some piney/cirtus hop tang, that balances the cloying malt character, and lifts the sweetness off the palate. This beer finishes with more really good sweet malty and tangy hop flavors up front, then ends with a zesty burst of piney hop bitterness that lingers. Excellent beer, with lots of malt and hop character. Mule has a kick, and it hides it 7% abv well, so beware. Very drinkable beer that makes an excellent after work beer to sip at the bar, and a great beer to relax and unwind with.
Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;Had this beer on draft @ Ivar’s in Mukilteo, WA. Nice darker amber color with a good creamy head. Has an almost candied like malt taste mixed with a nice strong hop flavor. This is very drinkable and has a great finish that has you ready for the next sip.
Skookum Mule;Arlington, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Skookum Brewery;Draft at Fred’s Rivertown. Pours deep murky amber with a thick moussy white head--looks like a nitro pour, in fact. Sweet floral and grassy notes on the nose, very mild. Fred’s lists this as an IPA, which took me by surprise a little bit, and now I see why--ASA makes a lot more sense. Not quite as many different flavor notes on the mid-palate as you might expect in an ASA, but the attack is firm: full-bodied, abundant carb, clear and strong flavors. Mild sweet finish. This is a pleasant drinkable beer I could pour all day and probably wouldn’t walk around the corner to get--it’s kind of in that middle ground of well-made but unexceptional.
Skookum Amber's Hot Friend;Arlington, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Skookum Brewery;Seeing this beer around for years, I always thought ur was a pepper beer. Always excited to try it, a little surprised to learn its just a plain amber, and less than what I have learned to expect from Smooth as of late. Not boring, just less than their other great offerings. A hoppy amber here for sure. Draft pint at Xfinity Arena, Everett. Tips. Hazy copper, amber pour with a lasting head. Caramel constant aroma. Hoppy more so in flavor than aroma. Creamy. Good for an amber. Alright overall.
Skookum Amber's Hot Friend;Arlington, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Skookum Brewery;Chuck’s 85th, Seattle. Creamy off-brown head, copper amber smooth malt body. Smooth orange malt nose. Creamy, wooden Amber malt body. Some citrusy notes cutting the amber some. Nice, but incongruous. Smooth, round body. Some metallic, cardboard bittering. Warm bready flavors. A bit odd, but alright.
Skookum Amber's Hot Friend;Arlington, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Skookum Brewery;On tap at Skookum, pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma is restrained, with some bready malt, not much else. Flavour is more pronounced, with a big dry hoppy punch and a biscuity malt backbone. Drier and hoppier than most ambers, but still not overly convincing. It’s solid for what it is.
Skookum Amber's Hot Friend;Arlington, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Skookum Brewery;Draft - Caramel and some earthy hops. Clear gold with a rich white head. Nice spicy hop notes, balanced bitterness and some caramel. Decent.

On the nose old lemon, ceder and citronella.

Tyranena BGW High-Class Broad Imperial Brown Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale - Imperial;Tyranena Brewing;12 ounce bottle from Ridgeview Liquors. Clear dark brown, thin fizzy head, poor retention. Aroma of brandy, oak, toffee, vanilla. Taste is nuts, oak, toffee, vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, raisin, chocolate. Medium bodied, mild bitterness, well balanced. Quite nice.
Tyranena BGW High-Class Broad Imperial Brown Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale - Imperial;Tyranena Brewing;In the spirit of accurate sampling (purely scientific, of course), I poured a shot of brandy alongside H-CB to match up similar and different influences. I found them in the aroma (a little) and the finish (the distant end of the ale’s finish with just the slightest of burning). H-CB’s aroma has much more chocolate and plums in it than brandy, though. Couldn’t detect any barrel oakiness. The pour is beautiful and the lacing adds to the attractiveness. Wonderful sweetness that does not overwhelm the taste.Tyranena makes so many great variations on its brown ale and this is yet another.
Tyranena BGW High-Class Broad Imperial Brown Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale - Imperial;Tyranena Brewing;Pale brown with orange hues. Boozy brandy with light toasted malt and cocoa. Flavor is light brandy with more toasted malt and light roast. Some lingering heat.
Tyranena BGW High-Class Broad Imperial Brown Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale - Imperial;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at Champps in Brookfield. Brown pour, little head.

Finishes sweetly with those great Tyranena malts lingering. 13.7

Tyranena BGW High-Class Broad Imperial Brown Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale - Imperial;Tyranena Brewing;Bottle [vintage 2010]... Poured dark brown with a thin forming, tan head. Nose had dark sugars, malt, woody oak, and a hint of oxidation. But that nice level of oxidation of an aged beer, before any wet cardboard came into play. Flavor wise and smooth, low alcohol presence and quite sweet. Dark fruits, candied sugars, liquor, wood, and charred oak. Overall quite sweet. Glad I shared it three ways.
Tyranena BGW High-Class Broad Imperial Brown Ale;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale - Imperial;Tyranena Brewing;thanks hbmason for setting up a killer trade with madvike–12oz bottle-pours a light brown head and cloudy brown color.

Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);From Aug 2008 I bought a sealed 6pack and low and behold, when I opened it, the bottles said best by 02/09/08. Here's hoping... It pours a clear medium amber brown with a small head of foam with some lacing. The smell has some graininess to it along with a faint clove and some earthiness. The taste has notes of wheat, lemon, some clove, a touch of banana, and it has an earthy finish. It has a light mouthfeel and the carbonation is high. Well, nothing special about this well past best by date sample but it's not all that bad so I might try revisiting it in the future. Most of Boulevard's offerings are *very* solid.
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);"Originally rated on 9/11/08. My second from the sampler 12 pack, Lunar pours a nice looking deep brown smiliar to slow brewed ice tea. A decent head, but small considering its bottle conditioned, hardly any lace. Aroma of banana and clove was nice. Flavor of malts and not much else. Mouthfeel was good. Overall not much to write home about."""
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12 oz bottle shared by me with Tmoney99 and shigadeyo from backlog notes 07. Pours a hazy amber color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor had wheat malt, banana, mild berry character, bready, light spice, yeast. Decent enough.
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);This was the only Boulevard beer that I saw people actively avoid. To call it a dunkelweizen is a affront to the style. A bit of dark fruit, some raisin, lots of bread with a hint of brown sugar, but mostly understated, too much so.
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Poured into a snifter. Copper color with a short white head. Smells like honey, malt and wet hay. Slight malt sweetness followed by some bitterness. Fairly plain and the carbonation hits the tongue from the beginning and dominates. Bubbly, thin body but still soft. The carbonation is too much IMHO. Drinkable but not memorable.
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Originally reviewed: 3/6/09. Big thanks to monsterfat (BA) for this brew in a recent trade! Pours a tawny, mahogany color with very little head. What is there, disappears rather quickly. No lacing whatsoever. Smells of bananas, bread, clove, lemon. Taste mirrors the scent, as it tastes sort of like banana bread with a slight tart zing to it. Not bad. I haven’t had much of this style, but I like it. Well done.
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12oz bottle. Deep amber pour, off-white head. Nose is nutty and roasted - flavor is the same with an off metallic note. Very odd Dunkel.
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Based on rating in old notebook: I was never really sure what Boulevard was going-for with this brew. Why was the marketing always so mysterious? I just noticed Ratebeer classified it as a Dunkelweizen, which sorta makes sense (dark wheat) but I never thought of it as such before. Tasted from bottle into standard pint glass. Poured a mostly clear light brown color with moderate foam, little lace. Aromas of bread, faint roasted grain, faint fruit, faint hops, faint spice (can’t tell if it’s from the hops, yeast, or both.) Flavor is balanced but bland malt-sweetness/hops-bitterness. Perhaps some subtle complexity, but not a multi-layered taste at all. Nothing bad, but nothing super either. Light-medium body, watery mouthfeel, quick finish. Boulevard makes so many splendid beers, I guess I’m not surprised this one was retired.
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle: &nbsp Deeper shade of caramel, a little dirty, thin sandy colored head, sparce lacing. &nbsp Pale bockish wheat like aroma on the nose. &nbsp I get this sweet popcorn kernal aroma as well... odd. &nbsp Dull wheatiness up front, semi sweet grassy maltiness on the back. &nbsp Pretty tame, but at least has some flavor. &nbsp Clean, well certainly not enough going on to be wonky. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Now it seems that it certainly isn’t wheaty enough. &nbsp Exit is a little flat, very little flavor lingers. &nbsp Could stand to be beefier.
Boulevard Lunar Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);bottle, redish amber brown tall frothy head. Smell of lightly roasted barley, almost barleywine-ish. Good mouth feel but i didn’t taste much wheat in here but it might explain some of the odd flavors. past the malt it has a green slightly herbal off flavor on the immediate back end but it smooths out after a drink to a smooth slightly dry lingering malty taste. i think the hops make it off or something but it is drinkable. Got some to revisit as i heard that Blvd. was going to cancel this brew and make space for something else.
Addis Tej;Orange, California, United States;Mead;Elsa Wine & Mead;Clean, moonlit blonde color. Warm honey aroma with distinct yeastiness. Strong honey, ethanol, and estery flavors. Sweet, sticky finish. This may mellow with age, but the elements are unrestrained and out of control, resulting in a product that’s too harsh to be enjoyable.
Addis Tej;Orange, California, United States;Mead;Elsa Wine & Mead;Very pale. Aroma is honey, rice, alcohol. Taste is honey, light alcohol, floral aspects, rice.
Addis Tej;Orange, California, United States;Mead;Elsa Wine & Mead;Golden color with a mild aroma of Wildflower and Orange Blossom honey and some assorted floral notes. Flavor is semi-sweet to sweet with some wildflower and sage honey and assorted sweet flavors - sweet and satisfying, but one deimensional. Good, sticky mouthfeel
Addis Tej;Orange, California, United States;Mead;Elsa Wine & Mead;Sampled at Abyssnia in Rochester. Light gold. Nose is floral honey, alcohol, vanilla. Flavor is vanilla, loads of honey, light must. Finish is honey, vanilla, light warming alcohol.
Addis Tej;Orange, California, United States;Mead;Elsa Wine & Mead;bought at Bottle Shoppe, BellinghamLight straw colour. Dry woody aroma with honeycomb notes. Quite sweet, honeyish with balsa wood and alcohol. Very much a straightahead mead.
Addis Tej;Orange, California, United States;Mead;Elsa Wine & Mead;(750ml yellow wine bottle) Sampled at CW3 in Victoria. Courtesy of Oakes. Great honey nose. Sweet yet not over-powering. Nice flavour and alcohol. Very good example of a mead - perhaps the standard as Guinness, Saxo and Pilsner Urquell are to beer styles.
Burford Cotswold Lad;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burford Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Community Centre, Frodsham 12/05/2007 Some hop aroma. Bronze golden coloured earthy and a little rich on the palate with a little dryness and bitterness in a crisp malt finish.
Burford Cotswold Lad;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burford Brewery;On gravity at Swindon BF 30/10/08. Deep amber with a slight, off-white head. Malty aroma with some caramel and plenty of yeasty spiciness. Flavour was also malty, with a hint of fruit and earthy hops followed by a decent bitter finish. Good.
Burford Cotswold Lad;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burford Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Amber gold with white lacing head. Its good to see this new Brewery rolling out a few more beers, this is a session boys bitter, malty, biscuity body with a restrained bitter hop finish, just as it should be. Refreshing finish.
Loddon Life of Riley;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Loddon Brewery;[Cask at the Monk’s Retreat, Reading] Pours a dirty amber with a moderate cream head. Slight carbonation. Initially malty with a growing bitterness. Rather watery texture, yet leaves a syrupy residue on your lips. Late bursts of sweet, fresh apple and a hint of orange fail to save what is the first below-par ale I’ve ever had from this brewery.
Loddon Life of Riley;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Loddon Brewery;"Cask at the Nags Head, Reading. Dull amber with a thin off-white head; silky texture with caramel malt flavours; dry nettley bitterness to finish with a hint of caramel sweetness. Not Loddon’s best."
Loddon Life of Riley;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Loddon Brewery;Half pint, on gravity at London Drinker 08. Red-brown body. Without head. A touch of malty fruits in aroma. Dried fruits in taste added by lightly roasted grain. Bitter and malty end (12.03.2008).

Loddon Life of Riley;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Loddon Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Crescent, Salford 16/03/2007 Some fruit aroma. Bronze coloured with some alcohol present. A little dryness in a crisp and bitter malt finish.
Loddon Life of Riley;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Loddon Brewery;Takeaway from Gravity Cask @ Bitter Virtue, Soton. Browny red with suprisingly resilient head for a beer racked into a plastic bottle. Sweet toffeish biscuity malt with a mild hint of buttery diacetyl which wasnt unpleasant but didnt add anything for me. Light earthy hops with a hint of citrus and a full slightly tannic bitter finish. This cleanses the mouth leaving you ready for another mouthful of sweet maltiness - lovely interplay between the flavours. This was billed by the brewer as an Irish Red ale and was perhaps slightly hoppier than traditional but not too much. Quite good but this is the sort of beer that feels autumnal to me, perhaps not quite the thing for when spring is in the air.
Yokohama Kita-Kamakura Megumi;Yokohama-shi, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Yokohama Brewery;Draught at the brewery. Very fine head on copper. Fruity, malty aroma, with chewy caramel. Ok but lacking something Malt-centered. Malty, fruity flavor. Earthy hops, caramel, cherry. British styled, ok. Smooth, with low to medium carbonation. Decent enough, not bad for trying to be British. A bit sweet, a bit boring, but it has a decent finish.
Yokohama Kita-Kamakura Megumi;Yokohama-shi, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Yokohama Brewery;Hazy deep amber color, less red than the regular alt. Again muted nose. Much more floral mouth than the Alt. Hoppy, bitter mouth with buscuity maltiness underneath.
Yokohama Kita-Kamakura Megumi;Yokohama-shi, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Yokohama Brewery;Poured a nice copper color with a large, creamy, off-white head.

Not all that bad, but nothing amazing.

Nez sur le caramel. En bouche c’est très doux et très léger avec des notes de caramel, toffee, pruneaux et fruits secs. Amertume très très faible.

Canaan Stout;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Stout;Canaan Brewery;Pappig süßer Geruch. Getreidig-plörriger Antrunk und weiteres Aroma, etwas nach Aschenbecher im Abgang, dzwischen etwas (mild) malzig. Eher mild, trinkbar. Kein besonders tolles Stout.

Canaan Stout;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Stout;Canaan Brewery;Big bottle with gorgeous label. Dark brown, opaque with fizzy but long-lasting head. The aroma is more of a craft cocoa creme soda than a beer. Light on the tongue, with fluffy palate. The flavors have a strange bit of cola nut, sassafrass, sasparilla, root beer. Certainly interesting, if not outright peculiar. Not as sexy as the label, and is not a particularly well-executed stout, but overall not bad.

Unbalanced like all the rest of the beers from this brewery.

Drakes Hopyard Pale;San Leandro, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Drakes Brewing Company;Draft. Pours a murky brownish color with an ivory head. Resiney pine aroma with tons of citrus. Very hop forward and somewhat thin in the body. This beer really has the bittering and dry-hopping of an American IPA- just without the malt charactor.

Medium body, roasted malt accents with a sweetish touch of vanilla sugar - actually the vanilla is quite prominent. The finish is dry.

W smaku wiodące są owoce i chmielowa trawiastość, tłem jest delikatnie rozgrzewający alkohol. Generalnie piwo jest słodkie ale nie ulepkowate, kontrowane jest trawiastą goryczką. Alkoholnieco rozgrzewa ale co ważne nie przeszkadza. Nasycenie średnie, sprawdza się idealnie. Piwo jest pełne i treściwe, ma fakturę gładką. Uwagi: Bardzo fajne piwo.
Lazy Boy Lager;Everett, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lazy Boy Brewing;Bubbly head on top of a gold brew. Aroma is sweet and bready.

Plenty of rising bubbles. Mild grass and big old buttery diacetyl on the nose. More of that grass and plenty more of the butter on the mid-palate. Tingly, crisp, smooth, refreshing, and buttery. The numbers are a bit generous in this rating, but if they clean up the diacetyl, this’ll rate a 3.2. So there.

Tunnel Jean (Cloudy) van Damme Belgian Style Wheat Beer;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);Bottled. (Sampled as ’Jean Cloudy Van Damme’ Belgian Style Wheat beer, 5%.) Authentic murk, but little carbonation and a head that recedes to a slick in seconds. Nose of orange, chocolate, vinegar, wet earth. Flavour-wise, this isn’t ticking the right boxes at all. Musty and overly malty, with no discernible citrus, sharpness or spice. Finishes with a disturbing, slightly smoky malt peatiness completely inappropriate to the style. Bonus points for taking the style on, but a bit of an ordeal.
Tunnel Jean (Cloudy) van Damme Belgian Style Wheat Beer;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);A pale, yellow, cloudy beer with a thick white head. A distinctive fruity nose, citrusy to start, with grapefruit and orange, then an odd, strawberry jam-like aroma, that is hard to miss! The taste starts off promising, dry, wheaty, then citrusy, grapefruit and orange again, plus a little spiciness appears too, but then that strawberry jam element comes through from the aroma, and is extremely off-putting!

Aroma is hard to define: I picked out pineapple and chocolate, not a very promising combination. Slightly citric taste with lots of carbonation and some bitterness. It’s a brave attempt at the style, but it seems that several of the required elements are missing.

A very dark brown pour with a 1 finger head of foam. It leaves some nice lacing and the head retention is ok. The smell has notes of chocolate, roasted malt, toffee, and some fruitiness. Nice nose. The taste is big! Lots of chocolate and roasted malt with some toffee and some hoppy goodness and I'm getting a nice sweet-bitter flavour that is very tasty. I notice a goodly amount of dark fruit as well that adds some of the sweet tones and yeah, the alcohol does give me some warming after the swallow but it's not *that* noticeable so I'll sip on. ;^) Medium mouthfeel here with medium light carbonation. It finishes slightly smokey with a good bitterish kick and maybe a touch of anise. Very tasty and very satisfying brew. I recommend it!"

Le nez offre des arômes d’oxydation, de sirop pour la toux aux cerises, fruités et une touche sauvage.

Svevo Stupor Mundi;Bari, Italy;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Birrificio Svevo;(Bouteille de 750 ml partagée avec rodenbach99) Le liquide est brun marécageux. La mousse foncée est bien solide et semble vouloir durer éternellement. Le nez présente un malt aux aspirations caramélisées recouvert de vapeurs fruitées douces et aigres. On peut même percevoir des odeurs de petites pastilles médicamenteuses à la cerise. L’alcool s’accroche aux narines comme des petites fleurs malhabiles. Les saveurs me semblent moins intéressantes: les pointes maltées et les fruits sont secoués par des agents aigres et par des accents éthyliques. En bouche, le liquide est en manque de corps avec une effervescence modérée et une texture douce. La finale est acerbe et caustique, peut-être même dérangeante.

Very sweet candy sugar nose, smells and tastes like some other Americanized version of an abbey tripel.

An ok beer, but I don’t think I’ve had any wheat wine that really impressed.

Fuzzy, pillowy, creamy head of about half an inch size over a barely hazy copper orange: very nice looking, but light for a dunkel; looks like what Newcastle *wants* to look like. Fruity-ish smell, crisp with some melony acidity; smells very ""fresh."" Flavor is very ""autumnal,"" seems almost octoberfest-ish: a smooth butternut squash sweetness, with a little brown sugar, accent an earthy, dirty-leaves impression; the biggest flavor push is in the finish toward the back of the tongue, where the squash elements blend with some lingering corn. Slightly salty. This finish has the best ""sustain"" of any Boscos beer I’ve had; almost seems chewy. Pretty solid."

Comment: I thought this would be as bad as the local San Miguel. Well, almost: it smell pretty offensive to start, plus weird rubber, apple juice and hidden sour taste to boost, yet, wet cardboard is minimal, and foul tastes isn’t overblown nor lasting.

Aroma is weak but has some promise of hops but also green apple. The palate is ok, goes down well. Balanced with some herbal hops in the finish trying to make an appearance.
Brück Lager;Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Golden colour. Some mushroom and maybe some sulphur on the nose. More sulphur on the palate. Maybe some toast. OK for a forty cent swill.
Knight Special Lager;Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Decent light beer available in south China. Best served cold and consumed on a beach. Very reasonably priced.
Knight Special Lager;Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;"330 ml can bought at ParkNShop Superstore in Fanling. Clear light blonde colour; One quarter finger head and residual soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Fair sticky lacing and very slight carbonation; Light pungent smell of malt, with corn, floral sugar, lemon and grass; Mid to light sweet taste of fairly light malt, with light corn, light floral, very light molasses, light lemon and light bitter grassy hops; Light body, thin palate; Mouth feel is pretty clean for a macro Pale, no off taste, just some touches of light corn. Tastable floral, light sweet, some lemon to round. Okay… Hoppiness is lemon and light grass in nose, and lighter in taste; Bitterness is low but notable for an abrupt, low astringent malty floral finish; Slightly dry after taste. Easy and light bitter to mouth. Comments: Not sure whether this one is made in China or Hong Kong, but for once, a Asian macro Pale without rice adjunct is a rarity, and slight corny element aside, its taste is clean and fairly malty as well. Bland but drinkable."
Knight Special Lager;Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;330ml can in HK. No idea on appearance as I drank it out of the can. Aroma is grass and wet straw. Taste is minimal but inoffensive. Pretty sure the one I had was brewed in HK but anywho...
Knight Special Lager;Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Pale beer. Very light-bodied, grassy and metallic, yet quite easy to drink.
Knight Special Lager;Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;"I now firmly believe that the tag ""export"" on a beer does not imply quality, but quite the opposite - essentially every ""export"" beer I’ve encountered has been on the lower end of the beer awesomeness spectrum. Would this one be any different? It has that macro-lager foamy disappearing head and gold body, with a grass and tin aroma pushed up by carbonation. The flavour is very weak caramel with an incredibly watery mouthfeel. Not offensive, just not there at all."
Knight Special Lager;Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Can. Purchased at local Hong Kong grocery store. Pours an incredible light transparent yellow with fluffy white head that quickly dissipates. Nose is light sugars. Body is very thin but sharply and finely carbonated. Some flavors of sugar and hop? One of the lightest and most flavorless beers I’ve ever had. But surprisingly endearing.
Knight Special Lager;Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Canned. Clear golden, ultra brief head. Fruity nose with crystallic hard mouthfeel. Light bodied, sharp and raw - yet thin and watery. Sugar instead of bitterness.
Wentworth Spring Thyme;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wentworth;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Gold. Pleasant sweet fruity aroma, but it’s all downhill from there: taste is dominated by herby thyme flavour, which isn’t appropriate in beer in my opinion. Some late bitterness cannot make amends. Thyme belongs in a bouquet garni, not in my pint.
Wentworth Spring Thyme;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wentworth;Cask Handpump at the Crescent, Salford 16/03/2007 Hop aroma. Clear golden coloured hoppy and a little spicy. Smooth on the palate. Some dryness and bitterness in a malt finish.
Wentworth Spring Thyme;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wentworth;A hazy golden yellow coloured beer with a weak white head. A light, slightly sour nose, with a hint of honey and a herbal, medicinal aroma. The taste is dry yet honeyed, a touch citrusy, then the medicinal, herbal, thyme-like flavour comes through. The finish is dry and slightly sour. An interesting, if a little odd, herb flavoured beer. (Cask - Easter Beer Festival @ The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Wentworth Spring Thyme;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wentworth;Cask handpull at Fly in the Loaf, Liverpool. Gold colour with thick off white head. Possible diacetyl on this, either that or really buttery. Rest is a soft citrus bitter/gold beer with some tangy zingy hop on finish. Otherwise the butterness spoils it.
Barum Firing Squad;Barnstaple, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barum Brewery;"Cask, Cow and Plough, Stougton. Amber brown with an off-white head. Aromas are malty and sweet with caramel/toffee and doughy cookies. Some chocolate, too. Flavours are malty with toffee, chocolate and some fruintess, especially spiced oranges. Pretty good, but a bit ""muddy""."
Barum Firing Squad;Barnstaple, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barum Brewery;Cask handpull at Fly in the Loaf, Liverpool. Amber colour with slight haze and thin beige head. Pale ESB style beer. Some yeast on aroma. Good rounded slightly sweet fruit. Like a sweet nectarine, followed by balancing tingly hop. Bit of alcohol sweetness with a touch of burn. Slightly sticky sweet palate. Nice enough.
City Steam P.V. Porter;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Porter;City Steam Brewery;Very good. Almost should be considered a smoked porter due to its slightly more than subtle smoky flavor. One of City Steams best, but not as good as CZARS. would def drink it again.
City Steam P.V. Porter;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Porter;City Steam Brewery;Pours dark brown with a tan thin head. Smells of cocoa, sweet malt, some fruit hints, spices. Tastes chocolatey with some hints of bitterness, a nice nutty touch and a semi-sweet finish.
City Steam P.V. Porter;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Porter;City Steam Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub on 3/21/07 Unlike usual, this one actually had a head (small, dark tan) and showed light lacing (slight ring at the top). Body is a very deep dark-brown mahogany but shows magenta highlights on the edges. Clarity is medium. Controlled roastiness nicely melds with layers of both dark and milk chocolate to create a very lovely complexity and ample malty aroma. Quite a high strength of aroma, as well, being served from a shaker at a crowded brewpub and quite cold to start. Light vanilla and just a hint of licorice-infused coffee dot the finish, adding a bit of poignancy. Soft, mossy/earthy hoppiness adds freshness and further complexity without any bitterness or acids. No alcohol or flaws in the nose. Deliciously rich body is surprising for its gravity. Strong, unfiltered mouthfeel with medium-low carbonation really accentuates the malt, and there’s lots of malt. Mostly chocolatey, but with a dry roasted edge to balance and just a pinch of char and coffee on the finish. Opens up very sweet, but pleasingly so, with light hop bitterness adding to the roast to further balance things. Very velvety, chocolatey and smooth with no alcohol or flaws apparent. Never gets syrupy, sticky or even very chewy, which helps keep the drinkability high. Drank this one down quickly. Nothing groundbreaking on the flavor or aroma, but one of the better balances between rich malt and easier drinkability I’ve come across recently.
City Steam P.V. Porter;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Porter;City Steam Brewery;on tap-pours a thick creamy/foamy light brown head and black color with red tint. Aroma is dark malt-licorice/chocolate. Taste is mark malt-too acidic licorice/chocolate, secondary hops bite. Medium body. Minimum carbonation.
City Steam Dominator Double Bock;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;City Steam Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub on 3/21/2007, about 3 hours after the previous 3 beers Dark beige-amber with some rusty-golden hues and a small, beige head that recedes to a ring. Clarity is high with moderate carbonation. Munich malt sweetness is strong, with plenty of breadiness and a high amount of melanoidins, creating a very boisterous fruitiness of golden raisins, prunes and nectarines. Moderate acidity can be felt from the nose. Basically it’s their modified bock, amped up a little and is right on the borderline between pale and dark. Careful lagering shows, as there is no flaw to be found, nor any alcohol present. Lots of breadiness and acidity though. Could use some stronger hoppiness to break things up and give a bit more lively nose. As is, there’s only a touch of earthy hops. Still, a very well-executed doppelbock that, despite the style demanding it, I still think goes a bit overboard on the maltiness. Gets a little sluggish/sloppy. Good strength to the aroma, however. Breadiness and melanoidins are most of the flavor profile, with heavy sweet/sourness from the munich malt and an undertone of very sweet, simple caramel. Interesting acidity on the finish dries things out to some extent, while pleasant yellow fruitiness (golden raisins and even a light citric element) provides more complexity. But the melanoidins and breadiness seem to overwhelm, and as this is just their house yeast at lager temperatures (ale yeast), there isnt any of the lager yeast crispness to be found. Hallertauer hops would be very welcome here. Instead it seems like it’s something like crystal or spalt/strusselspalt. Too much earthiness piled on to the breadiness. No flaws or alcohol noted. Moderate carbonation, smooth, malty texture.
City Steam Dominator Double Bock;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;City Steam Brewery;on tap-pours a tan head and copper/red color. Aroma is medium/dark fruit, medium malt-caramel, some sharpness. Taste is fermented medium/dark fruit, medium malt-caramel, some sharpness/alcohol. OK carbonation.
Elm City Irish Potato Ale;Keene, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elm City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a white head and hazy gold color. Aroma is sweet malt. Taste is sweet malt-toffee, secondary hops-bitterness and flatness. Grainy. Good carbonation.
Elm City Chocolate Stout;Keene, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Elm City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a light brown head and black color. Aroma is dark malt-licorice/coffee. Taste is acidic, dark malt-licorice/coffee, (bitterness from hops?) Mild carbonation.

Opa-Opa Steakhouse Dry Stout;Southampton, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Opa-Opa Brewing Company;A deep dark stout with a thin moka head. A pleasant lactaceous chocolate, with moka notes.

Opa-Opa Steakhouse Dry Stout;Southampton, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Opa-Opa Brewing Company;I liked this summer time stout. It has all of the nuances of a deep stout. Notes of coffee, chocolate, and toasted malts. The palate keeps the flavors but offer a lighter bersion of the overall mouthfeel. I like that idea when it is 90 degrees outside.
Opa-Opa Steakhouse Dry Stout;Southampton, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Opa-Opa Brewing Company;Bitter dry, some chocolate malt. Watery, a bit of aroma no head, coffee highlights.

North By Northwest Belgian Sour;Austin, Texas, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;(Draught) Pours a hazy golden body with a small white head. Aroma of herbs, cheese, horse blanket, cherry, caramel, mustiness, and sourdough bread. Flavor of cherries, oak, brett, and earthiness with a dry finish.

North By Northwest Belgian Sour;Austin, Texas, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;2nd barrel version. Pours a dirty tan-orange with a smooth off-white head. Aroma is definitely sour, but there’s a bit of cherry, wood, and horseradish. Pretty sweet flavor of cherry and caramel followed by some wood and sour hits of cherries and a light vinegar punch. Finished both dry and yet tastes sweet still. In retrospect, this was as good, if not better than something like Duchesse, but then again this style is not my forte. Pretty nice.
North By Northwest Belgian Sour;Austin, Texas, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;Wow...the best by far!!!! Pour is ruby read with light lacy looking small bubbles of carbonation floating slowly to the top...a small ring of a dense bubbled off white head clings to the side of the glass...the smell is funky and dotted with toasty malt sourdough flavors....some nice cobweb and blue cheese come out even more as it warms...the flavor is much much much drier than the first two...none of the residual sweetness that lies underneath the first two...light straw flavored sweetness comes out at first, but then a dry sour slowly emerges as it reaches the back of your tongue...finishes is delicate and sour and not nearly as aggressive as the other two...this beer is a world class beer. Wonderful!
Maypole Flanagans Extra Stout;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Stout - Dry;Maypole Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Sussex Beer Festival. You know on those all too rare occasions when a cask has been on just the right amount of time and it’s in perfect condition and just all round hitting the sweet spot? This was one of those moments. Excellent black and tan appearance. Creamy vanilla malt aroma with some dusty dark chocolate. Awesome smoky and earthy malt flavour with beautiful chocolate and a dusty dark bitterness at the edges. Almost chalky dark chocolate finish with a delicate balancing bitterness. Superb legnth, creeps around the sides of the palate and just keeps on going. Possibly just a little thin in the mouth but a damn fine drop over all.
Maypole Flanagans Extra Stout;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Stout - Dry;Maypole Brewery;(Cask at Ship & Mitre, Liverpool) Near black colored, slight red hints. Medium sized beige head. Strongly roasted coffee aroma with nice sweetness, some berries also come up. Flavor is also sweet with caramelly roastiness and some berries, aftertaste dries nicely with some chocolate. I like this.
Oliver's Waterlow Perry (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Oliver's Cider;750 ml bottle, from Hop Pocket Wines. A pale gold/straw coloured still Perry. The aroma has some woody notes and a touch of petrol but not much farmyard character. Rather wine-like. Not unlike a dry Riesling. That impression continues onto the palate. Bone dry. Highly attenuated, with not much residual fruit. Tart mouthfeel, with light tannins, finishing slightly acidic. Quite refined but not packed with traditional character. A Perry to drink with food.
Orso Verde BackDoorBitter;Busto Arsizio (VA), Italy;Pale Ale - English;Orso Verde;bel colore ambrato carico con schiuma fine e persistente. aroma caratterizzato da notte caramellate che ricordano la mou dettate dall’utilizzo di malti caramello e da note agrumate resinose e terrose date dall’importante luppolatura. ingresso in bocca inizialmente dominato dalle note carammellate che lascia subito dopo spazio ad un amaro fine e persistente
Orso Verde BackDoorBitter;Busto Arsizio (VA), Italy;Pale Ale - English;Orso Verde;Bottiglia, al pub. Colore ambra ramato, bella schiuma bianco panna di due dita, piuttosto persistente, fitta e quasi cremosa. Naso maltato, poco pronunciato. Carbonazione troppo elevata per il suo stile. Aroma dominato da un amarezza avvolgente, piena e soddisfacente, anche di luppolo fresco, ma c’è poco altro (malto parzialmente tostato, pane, biscotto, nota erbacea lontanamente caramellata di radicchio e rabarbaro, toffee). Sebbene piacevolmente beverina e scorrevole, risulta troppo sottile, ruvida, secca, corta ed avara di emozioni, finanche un po’ noiosa, con l’amarezza non controbilanciata dalle note dolci di una bitter. Se la si vuole considerare English pale Ale, risulta piuttosto naif, mancante di corpo sufficiente e troppo indulgente a note di lievito fresco e burrose. Al di sotto delle aspettative.

Kirishima Kirinokura Beer Blond;Miyakonojo-shi, Kyushu, Japan;Wheat Ale;Kirishima Shuzo Kirinokura Brewery;Tap at GJBF Osaka 2015. Underdone sweetish fruity nose. Sweet fruit initial... and doesn’t go much beyond that. Thick, a bit syrupy, and almost no hopping. Not much character to this one. Not well made at all.

Rock Bottom Colorado Springs Munich Dunkel;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rock Bottom Colorado Springs;Very dark beer with a thin beige head.

Olde Towne Pilsener;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Bottle - thanks bhk! - pours a cloudy orange with a white head. Aroma is pineapple. Taste is a little bitter, but god this is just blah. Seriously.
Olde Towne Pilsener;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Bottle from random liquor store. Smells like sticky sweet pineapple.

Olde Towne Pilsener;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olde Towne Brewing Company;"12oz bottle, big thanks to sommersb on BA for my first tick from Alabama, my 49th state ticked (including DC). Let me first give a shout-out to the brave beer advocates who recently freed the hops in this state, and my condolences to the guys who tried to keep those hops in their cage. It was a battle well fought, with your intelligent and well-spoken arguments: ""What’s wrong with the beeah we got? The beeah we got drink pretty good, don’t it? The Budweisah, Millah, Cooahs!"" Sorry that those hops got out. This beer pours cloudy yet lively, golden in color with a one-finger white head that fizzes down to thick foam. The aroma is interesting, very fruity and almost like a Belgian pale ale, with big green apple as well as sweet malty notes. On the flavor, there is definitely something interesting there. It’s the unmistakable taste of Belgium! Did they throw the wrong yeast into this beer? Either way, I sort of like it. Green apple and slight banana with sweet malt and caramel. Medium-bodied and a little less crisp and clean than I’d like on the mouthfeel. Not too shabby overall though, for a brewery from a state I didn’t expect much from. Maybe I should expect more from the home of the Crimson Tide."
Olde Towne Pilsener;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Golden orange-yellow, white foam. Drippy lacing. Aroma is heavy, toasty, lemony. Taste is very creamy, heavy malt, light grass, toast. Too heavy for my taste.
Olde Towne Pilsener;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Fairly creamy and full-bodied for a pils - light honey, bright floral notes, crisp, grassy hops - fairly crisp and refreshing - however, a light tangy/sour note indicates the early onset of infection - this adds a lemony character, but detracts from the balance, and the fact that it is an apparent flaw makes it hard to drink - oh well, at least I get an Alabama tick for this one.

The Brewery At Lake Tahoe Double Hopped IPA;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;IPA;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;sounds like Hopapotamus rebranded. a decent fairly fruity ipa. lacks the punch in the nose especially, but is solid enough, and goes good with their awesome pizza.
The Brewery At Lake Tahoe Double Hopped IPA;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;IPA;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear orange color. Head was was with decent retention and lacing. I tried this one side by side with the ’indian pale ale’. The aroma and flavor were pretty similar without the hop bitterness and flavor I had expected from a ’double hopped’ IPA. Eh.
The Brewery At Lake Tahoe Star Lake Stout;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;Dark brown. Smooth and slick feel, though way thinner than any 8% stout should be. Sweet and lightly bitter chocolate and roast and vanilla. Earthy. Meh.

The Brewery At Lake Tahoe Star Lake Stout;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;On tap at brewery. My first impression is that it is flat.

The Brewery At Lake Tahoe Star Lake Stout;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;Draft at the brewpub. Pours clear dark brown, pretty light for the style, with a small tan head. Aroma is roast, coffee, and anise. The anise and stronger coffee notes separate this from the porter. Flavor is also roasted malt, coffee, and anise, with just a touch of chocolate. Pretty tasty, but not quite as full-flavored as I’d like for the style. Medium body with a mouthfeel that falls a bit short of the mark. A little astringent without much oatmeal smoothness, despite the fact that oats were used. Pretty drinkable still though. An above-average but not great stout overall.
The Brewery At Lake Tahoe Star Lake Stout;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;The Brewery at Lake Tahoe;3oz sample. One of 7 samples tasted while having dinner at the brewpub. I found all 7 to be average or below average with no real standouts. (actual tasting was on 2/15)

Slightly sweet on the tongue with a bit of toffee lingering at the end.
Water Street Whiskey Stout;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Water Street Brewery;Dark brown to black pour with a dense tan head. Standard stout aged in Oak . The whisky barrel aging gives it a subtle whiskey Finish ( not over the top).
Water Street Whiskey Stout;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Water Street Brewery;On tap at Water Street Brewpub Milwaukee. Dark brown with a slowly fading brown crown and flare lacing. Aroma of mild whiskey, dark roasted malts, mild peat and light chocolate. Thin bodied brew is somewhat chalky and has the typical over carbonation of water streets brews. Flavors of dark roasted malts, light whiskey, light chocolate and not much else. Not very good.
Water Street Whiskey Stout;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Water Street Brewery;On nitro pour at the downtown Water Street Milwaukee location. Pours an opaque dark drown colored brew with a creamy tan head from the nitro charge. Aroma of chocolate malt, some Scottish caramel malt and a hint of vanilla. Taste is medium bodied, chocolate malt, with some tart berries and a hint of vanilla. Finish is light, slightly tart with a toasted dark malt and chocolate aftertaste. Any bourbon flavor is hidden.
Water Street Whiskey Stout;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Water Street Brewery;I had this as part of a sampler at the brewery (which I thought was one of the best brewpubs I’ve been to). Subtle smokiness and while the whiskey is ever present, it’s very smooth. This was the first one gone from my sampler pack.
Water Street Whiskey Stout;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Water Street Brewery;Had this the other day while not enjoying a very disappointing meal at the brewery. Poured a black color with minimal head. Aroma was very faint, virtually non-existent. I certainly didn’t get anything resembling whiskey out of it. Flavor offered some roastiness you’d expect from a stout along with a touch of smoke, but again, so sign of any whiskey being near this beer during its production. Mouthfeel was quite thin and watery. All-in-all, hardly something I’d rush out to get again. I had this on-tap at the brewery.
Water Street Whiskey Stout;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Water Street Brewery;On tap at Water Street downtown. Great aroma of whiskey. Very thin, true to style.
Water Street Whiskey Stout;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Dry;Water Street Brewery;I thought this beer had a really nice flavor of whiskey that helped attriubute the long finish. A cool effort.
Third Base Tilted Kilt Irish Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Ruddy brown colored brew with a thick khaki head. The nose is black walnuts and bread dough. The flavor is malty and nutty with some cola. The finish has black walnuts. The body is creamy and smooth. This is tasty.
Third Base Tilted Kilt Irish Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;I made the mistake of trying the Monster IPA first so my taste buds are in shock. Still a nice sweet malt flavor, very drinkable.
Third Base Tilted Kilt Irish Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a light reddish colored amber with the ubiquitous thin white head of all the beers served here. This has a displeasing harsh bitter taste that is more burnt than toasted. Horribly watery like most of the beers served here.
Third Base Tilted Kilt Irish Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Advertised as 22 IBU’s. Poured a clear amber color. Head was off white and reduced relatively quickly into a thin film. A nice curtain of lace was left on the glass at the end. Smelled of malty brown sugar with light sprucy hops in the background. Malt also dominated the flavor with subdued caramel and brown sugar notes. There was also a hint of black tea and a delicate cereal grain aftertaste. I didn’t taste or smell any peated malt in this one, but it was pretty good.
Triple fff Dirty Dealer;Alton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Triple fff Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Guide Dog, Soton. Deep mahogany colour. A little roastyness but this is more toasty with bready crsusts, molasses and a playful hint of rich buttery brioche. Light bodied with moderate sweetness and enough hoppy bitterness to balance. Not a usual Triple fff beer, the malt flavour aren’t quite interesting enough to be the main focus. A malty bitter on the verge of being a mild.
Old Capitol Right On Rye;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;IPA;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Had this last weekend. Poured a clear orange caramel with a one finger white head that had decent retention. Aroma of some spicy pine and citrus, some biscuity malts. Not complex, but clean and pretty good. Flavor of spicy pine, grapefruit, sweat, and more biscuity malts to help balance this, though it didn’t do a good job. I enjoy my bitter beers just fine (see Pliny the Younger), but this seemed a little overwhelming (8 on a 1-10 scale) mainly because the aroma and flavor of the hops didn’t come through, it was mainly just bitter. Moderate sharp carbonation, and a little thin on the body. The stupid bitterness detracted overall, though I am happy to see those guys can make decent beer when they want to.
Old Capitol Right On Rye;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;IPA;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Advertised as 100 IBU’s. Had it on tap at the brewpub. It poured a cloudy mustard-orange color. Head was thick and off white with good retention and lacing. Aroma was attractive resiny pine hops with a hint of grapefruit. Tastes of well balanced light malty caramel, grainy rye, and sprucy/resiny hops. There is light sweetness up front which is quickly overwhelmed by an assertive hop bitterness. Full bodied and finishes dry with lingering bitterness. One of the better beers I’ve had at OCBW.
Old Capitol Right On Rye;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;IPA;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;I had this recently and was pleasantly surprised. This was a decent effort depite Old Cap’s generally sliding quality. The body was cloudy amber with a slightly off white head. The aroma was strong grapefruit with some light notes of toffee. The taste was mostly IPA was pine, bread crust and some nice roast character. The rye was just a hint in the background. Decent.

L: Unfiltered appearance, pale yellowish golden with a compact white head of stiff, firm foam. A fair amount of splotchy lace clings to the sides of the glass making this overall a good looking witbier. S: Light scents of orange and lemon, touches of floral herbs, hints of sweet hard candy, everything is framed by scents of wheat grainy crackers. F&T: Firm moderate body, crisp and quite dry in the finish. A nice soft twang from the orange peel and coriander, tastes of lemon and mildly sour orange. Dry wheat cracker malts with a light herbal spiciness coming out in the finish. A pleasantly refreshing witbier, another delectably crafted beer from Flossmoor Station.

Flossmoor Station Blanche DuBois;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Flossmoor Station, May ’07, and served in a shaker. This witbier poured a slightly cloudy, golden color with a thin white head that slowly faded. Some faint lace was left around the glass. The aroma was made up of orange, coriander, and a touch of bread. The flavor was slightly spicy and yeasty, with the orange peel taking over towards the finish. The mouthfeel was light to medium-bodied with light carbonation. This was one of the best witbiers that I have had the pleasure of trying. Well done!
Flossmoor Station Blanche DuBois;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy and yellow in colour with a medium sized head. Kinda refreshing with notes of fruit, banana, yeast and bread - pretty standard.
Flossmoor Station Blanche DuBois;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draught. At the brewpub. Pale murky yellow with an average white head. Mild aroma, sweet grainy malt and mild coriander and other spices, lightly yeasty with some dry light hops. Taste - wheaty/grainy, not much yeast or spice character, a decent bit of sweet floral/herbal hops in the finish. Very weak and watery body - even for a wit - some astringency, oddly, mild carbonation and no alcohol presence at all - overall refreshing, but too watery and it needs some fruit character, as well as bolder spice and yeast presence.

Flossmoor Station Blanche DuBois;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Flossmoor. I have to give credit where credit is due when a brewer takes an unexciting style and creates a flawless rendition. Poured a hazy, paler golden with a deeper center.. full cap of creamy white head. Wonderful aroma as well!.. rich, peppery spices and orange peel accent sweet banana and doughy notes.. sweet, yet spicy.. warm and complex.. truly wonderful! Nice contrast between sweet and spicy again in the flavor... banana and bready notes with layers of white pepper, coriander, and orange zest surrounding.. mild diacetyl accents on the finish.. very, very tasty!

Flossmoor Station Blanche DuBois;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Pours a murky, amber-hued-wheat colored body under an average-sized white head. Lemony, spiced aroma with incense notes and the zesty orange rind coming through strong. (Although at times, in conjunction with esters, it comes across a little like nail polish remover.) Thick in the mouth with a pleasant balance of pulpy/tart/citrusy fruit, dry spice, stable wheat and bready yeasts. A tingly sourness lingers long afterwards. My wife and I both found this to be a pleasant, summery quaff. On tap and via growler from Flossmoor Station, Flossmoor, IL 60422
Yes i Beer;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Beer Company;My 50th Florida rating (half way to Degarth) and “Yes I” too think this is a fitting style that represents what the FL has to offer its residence. Comes in a clear glass 12oz bottle, uh oh. That’s trouble. As soon as the cap was removed I got a sense of the skunk aroma. Skunk aroma can really move quickly. Pours yellow with thin off white head. The aroma is skunk, sweet malts, a slight vague bitterness and corn flakes. The taste is sweet sugary malts, a hint of vague hop bitterness then more sugar sweetness. Deep in the background I can just detect pale malts.
Yes i Beer;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Beer Company;My 100th Florida rating and I think it very appropriate that it is a pale lager. The aroma is immediately and shockingly skunky with some sweet cereal grain notes beneath that. Never develops more than a white wisp of a head, but it is a decent gold color. Fore is lightly sweet with some muted grain notes and a very light floral hop note. It’s drinkable enough for what it is.
Yes i Beer;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Beer Company;The aroma is floral and sweet with some cereal grains but not very strong.

Martinsbräu Landbier Dunkel;Marktheidenfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Martinsbräu;Somewhere in the midst of a classic, malty Dunkel and some more fruity, red brew it delivers an interesting blend of flavors, yet lacking the balance or complexity that would make it stand out here. Good, though.
Martinsbräu Landbier Dunkel;Marktheidenfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Martinsbräu;Draft in Marktheidenfeld: Light chestnut with peach highlights. Unrefined aroma of marzipan, tomato, papery malt, metal, dog food, red licorice twists, cola and stale coffee. Pointy, discordant carbonation. Malt is notably limp from the commencement, with marzipan, wet paper and unsweetened chocolate along with wet leaves and and a pronounced metallic edge. Vegetal notes are here in legions, and unripe plum acidity only worsens things. No malty richness to be found. DMS its way into the mix, and I’m also getting some paint and plastic. Scant bitterness and flabby malt resembles wort and dog food in the dirty finish. A woefully unclean, muddled and aimless dunkel.

Beechams Crystal Wheat Beer;St Helens, Merseyside, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Beechams Bar & Brewery;Cask, The Crown, Nuneaton. Clear bronze domed with bathfoam. Weird looking for a wheat. Pleasing cask aroma dappled with light dusty spice and sickbowl citrus. Witbier in the Peeterman Artois sense. Vile at first, insinuating itself with vague peppery Belgiumness, actually very bitter bittering English hop. Alternately dull, a bit nasty and very drinkable.

Bia Saigon Lager;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sabeco - Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp. (ThaiBev);"Vietnamsk øl er som regel pale lager med masse ris og ikkeno smak. Her er oppskriften nærmest det samme, men med litt smak. Nærmeste du kommer europeisk pils i Vietnam uten å kjøpe en heineken. Tydeligvis er det to forskjellige typer Bia Saigon, hvor forskjellen er at den ene er ""Premium"" og har 4,9%. Ærlig talt så merket jeg ikke forskjell på smaken, for her er det ikke så veldig mye smak man kan skjenne forskjell på. Men skal man kåre en vinner, er nok Premium en vinner. 3,6/10"

Alhambra Especial Premium Lager;Granada, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervezas Alhambra (Mahou San Miguel);0.5litre stein of beer from tap. Cost €3.90. From Mad Grill. Great food and service. In appearance the beer is a medium straw to gold colour with lots and lots of micro bubble carbonation. A two and a half finger impressive head frothy with very good retention. Leaves a nice lacing all the way down. Prestige snow white. Nothing in aroma. Maybe light straw, lemon. Clean, not overly crisp, slightly sweet. Grass, straw, lemon, apple. A little fizzy in the mouth. No aftertaste or anything memorable on the palate. Refreshing and serves its purpose. In hot weather if served cold I would happily drink. There are far worse lagers in the world.

Wilkins Perry - Medium (Draught);Wedmore, Somerset, England;Perry;Wilkins Cider;From the barrel at London Drinker Beer Festival 2007. Roger Wilkins is better known for producing cider than perry but this is a very fine example of the latter. Hazy straw colour. Plenty of farmyard character in the aroma, coupled with bags of juicy fruit. More intense fruit on the palate with gentle, but insistent, tannins providing a solid backdrop. Slightly tart, refreshing mouthfeel. Excellent stuff. On this evidence, Wilkins should produce perry more often.
Wilkins Perry - Medium (Draught);Wedmore, Somerset, England;Perry;Wilkins Cider;Real Perry in Polypin at Banbury Beer Fest 07. Cloudy pale yellow with bubbly head. A champagne of a Perry, Naturally carbonated with a sweet Pear background and a dry acidic palate. Delicious.

Jensens Påskebryg;Juelsminde, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Jensens Bryghus;Bottle. An almost clear golden-orange beer with a white head. Slightly fruity nose with pale malt. Meaty flavor with pale malts and some fruits. The smoked supposed to be in the beer is either super weak or diminished after some months in the cellar. Medium body with a pleasant level of carbonation. Not easy to pin, this one, and not my cup of tea. (081003)

Jensens Påskebryg;Juelsminde, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Jensens Bryghus;50cl. Thanks, Maria! Poursa a cloudy-to-opaque darkish orange with a thick and fluffy white head. Falls quickly to film and leaves intermittent stringy lacing. Has a sourish, funky, footy nose. Comes on a little sweaty but it’s not diacetyl, it’s definitely a combination of the wheat and the yeast. It’s nice once you get used to it. Very creamy body on the high side of medium. Active carb, feels a little sharpish, but there isn’t overly much of it. Oranges, spice, and a candied fruit quality on the mid-palate. Doesn’t have a super dimensional flavor profile, but the body is just lovely--creamy and dense at first, but doesn’t cling to the tongue at all, just moves right along. Very satisfying and a bit offbeat. Could definitely make me appreciate the possibilities that come with lager yeast.
Jensens Påskebryg;Juelsminde, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Jensens Bryghus;Bottle. Average size creamy white head that’s diminishing fast. Spare lacing. Cloudy orange body. The aroma is dominated by a smoked malty profile and citrus and orange from the hops. The body is medium and has a oily texture and average/soft carbonation. The flavour is rather sweet and only light acidic and hoppy.
Jensens Påskebryg;Juelsminde, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Jensens Bryghus;Bottle. Hazy yellow colour with a medium creamy head. Here stops the fun. This one is clearly infected in every war.Very acidic and ugly aroma and taste. Did the head brewer from Samsø stop by?
Jensens Påskebryg;Juelsminde, Denmark;Bock - Weizenbock;Jensens Bryghus;Bottle.50cl. Aroma has a hit of infection, rotten eggs and soya. Taste was metalic and smoke. Watery in feel.

Schöfferhofer Grapefruit;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);"Radler de 2,5 % abv, qui est un mix à 50 % de l'excellente hefeweiss "" orangée "" de la brasserie avec 50 % d'un composé fruité pomélo/citron/orange.

La brasserie a pris la précaution d'appeler ceci un "" weiss mix "" ou encore en anglais un "" wheat beer mix "", ce qu'en français on appelle une "" mixture "" !! Mon exemplaire était à 11 mois avant sa date. Couleur orangé carotté, pour ne pas dire carotte orangée (ou arrangée ..). Bulles moyennes, éparses. Mousse blanche, en couronne à la paroi. Arômes de pamplemousse rose, pomélo, citrus. 1ère bouche agréable, un peu pétillante, assez équilibrée. Arrière-bouche qui nuance bien entre sucré et amérisé. 2ème bouche avec des agrumes doux, un rien de zeste. Arrière-bouche qui reste agrumique, mais un côté pomme rouge. Longueur qui perd assez fortement les qualités des 1ères bouches. Jambes lisses, courtes. Alcool inopérant dans ce genre de mixture. Finale de jus de fruits pour écoliers.

Skovlyst Ahornbryg Forårsbock;Værløse, Denmark;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bryggeri Skovlyst;Tried this due to my maple syrup love. If you like sweet beers, this ones for you. It’s got a light bitterness in its aftertaste. Nothing compared to many other beers. Carbonation is medium/low Pouring, it’s got a tiny off ivory coloured head which lasted less than 20 seconds. In general, too sweet, even for me, would I buy again? Probably not but nice to try. Slightly disappointed in this one overall

Skovlyst Barley Wine;Værløse, Denmark;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bryggeri Skovlyst;Bottle, bought @ the brewery. [vintage 2005] [bottle #1262] Pours beautyful amber with a big frothy/creamy offwhite head. Nice aroma of spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger... these spices are also apparent in the flavour, with cinnamon being the strongest. The mouthfeel is rich, creamy - prickles a bit on the tongue - it is vinious, but hides very well the 10% - has a hint of hops in the end. A very nice beer, with a christmas feel to it.

[vintage 2005] [bottle #1262] Pours coppery golden with a big, frothy/bubbly yellowish head. Fair amount of bubbles in the liquid. Complex aroma, lots of liquorice, some pepper, light cinnamon, quite a lot of nutmeg. Fine mouthfeel with medium mouthfeel. Some plummy malts as well. Impressive, powerful flavour. Light viniousness, some plums, grapes and oranges. Lots of ginger in the flavour and nutmeg has a clear place in the beer. Very sticky finish, where the spices play around in my mouth. Impressive, even though it is far too spiced for its own good.

Aroma of sweet malt and fruity apricot, though not overly sweet. Taste is lightly sweet and malty. Mouthfeel is very crisp and carbonated. Pretty nice!
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap at the Blind Tiger. Super sweet, fruity, apricot nose, with an ugly wheat beneath. Very regular fruit beer tasting -- a disappointment coming from these guys.
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Pale golden/straw colour with loads of apricot and a bit of wheaty spiciness. Simple and sweet without much in the way of complexity. A simple, quaffable wheat ale.
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"Draft. Pours a golden body with a white head. Dried apricots, with much residual sugars. Hint of lacto but just sweet overall. Eh not so good beer, but the name; well played."
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap at the Blind Tiger at their Kuhnhenn event. Pours a clear pale yellow with at very slight touch of a white head. Lots of fruit, apricots, pears, grapes. A bit thin, but gorgeous apricot flavor. Light sweet finish with some overlying apricot flavors.
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap at Blind Tiger: Light golden with a fading white head. The aroma is quite fruity- apparent apricot yet it’s very fructose ridden and one dimensional. The body is light with apparent apricot character in the flavor. Lacking body overall and the base beer isn’t very discernible. There is a touch of diacetyl in the middle followed by vague grains. Again, a natural fruit presence but lacking body and dimension.
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Clear, pale body with small white head. The aroma is apricot syrup, sweet and a bit medicinal. The flavor is apricot, fairly sweet with some caramels and floral. Medium/light body is a bit flimsy.
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;A couple of draught samples at the brewery on 4/8/07 Hazy peach-apricot-gold color, with a small, cascading head that is retained fairly well. Strong diacetyl, and chewy apricot skin in the aroma. Light caramel and gooey vanilla iced cream as well. Very light tartness on the end is a bit unsettling mixed with caramel and diacetyl. Medium strength, no alcohol and a very rich aroma from the malt Kind of like a british pale ale, the apricots didnt come out as well as Eric said he would have liked, leaving it almost like an extremely estery English bitter, replete with lots of diacetyl. Creamy, partially nitrogenated body it seems. Very sweet with only a light, light tartness and some vanilla-caramel lingering. I actually just thought of it as an English bitter and drank it pretty easily that way, though it’s still a bit sweet and lightly tart, giving it some similarities to Lindemans Peche
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Kuhnhenn Apricot P.D. 64 oz growler Moderate pour in an English pint Unknown brewing (recent?), enjoyed 2 days after the growler pour, 04/07 Poured a clear dark copper with a large fluffy slightly off white head with good lacing. Smelt of strong apricot and caramel. Taste was upfront moderate sweet and lightly sour apricot, light sweet caramel and faint bitter grassy hops followed by more of the same accompanied by a light bitter doughy yeast on an average length finish. Palate was light bodied, watery, softly carbonated. Overall, a tasty fruit forward beer. The latter part of the name works too...
Kuhnhenn Panty Dropper (PD) - Apricot;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"Yes, I know everyone’s thinking I was drinking the Peach Apricot PD, and not a new beer, but I wrote down what was printed on the drink list and it said Apricot Panty Dropper. Slightly cloudy orange with a thick white head. Light to medium in body. Taste is an interesting fruity flavor, interesting in that the taste is much more akin to the actual taste experience of an apricot or peach. The taste was slightlly acidic and tart along with some sweet, rather than a one-dimensional sweetness often described as ""fruity"". Aroma is mildly sweet, like melon or peach."
Castle Rock Hare;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Castle Rock Brewery;Cask @ The Dolphin. Decided to do the rounds of a few real ale pubs in the area to see what was on.. this pub has 3 on handpull so I picked this. It’s refreshing alright but just a bit boring and weak for my tastes. Bitter finish but tasted a dozen that taste just like this tonight. Yawn.

Krombacher Weizen;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;This was my first hefeweizen alongside Erdinger. I compared them, and it had a more direct taste. I still felt it lacked something. But both of them were well-balanced and maybe watery. Both had 5,3% ABV. Alright. But wheat was a bit stronger in this one, which gave it a character.

Rugby Egg Chaser;Claybrooke Magna, Leicestershire, England;Stout;Kendrick's;Cask, Leicester Fest 09. Dark brown with a beige head. Aromas are chocolate milkshake with some yeast.

Thornbridge Blessed;Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thornbridge Brewery;Bottled from Bakewell Farmers Market shop. Pale straw, blossoming head, loads of hops, plenty of lemon, but... just falls short in comparison to Kipling though it’s v close in style. Enjoyable.
Thornbridge Blessed;Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thornbridge Brewery;BCA part of a Christmas present from my dad was a selection of Thornbridge Hall beers. Poured a light golden colour with large white dominating head. This was a very fruity pale ale with good hops and easy drinking for a 5.8% beer.
Thornbridge Blessed;Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thornbridge Brewery;Bottled. Huge thanks to Haddonsman for this - I still owe you two!!. Pours a very pale straw colour with a huge rocky white head in spite of careful pouring. The aroma has a lot of hops. Lots of bitter lemon notes. The taste is very hoppy also. More lemony and grapefruit notes. Feels quite light in the mouth, especially considering its ABV. Needs more malt to enable it to develop the flavours. I like what Thornbridge are doing and they are attempting a good number of styles, but they need to throw more than just hops into this nype of beer.
Grand Union One Hop: Emerald;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask@London Drinker 07. Quite a green, peppery hop character, fairly grassy. Quite non-descript otherwise. Light, and crispish. Drinkable, but perhaps a little bit unexciting.
Grand Union One Hop: Emerald;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask gravity London Drinker BF 07. Gold colour with thin head. Bit of cat’s pee. Astringent. Bit farty. Typical One Hop series beer with pale malts in the mouth, some dryish finish. Not the best. Bit thin really on the hop.

Moonlight Late Afternoon Tart;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Draught, Flavor Bistro. Body is medium brown. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, caramel, nuts), with a note of plum. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. Not all that tart, but not too bad of a brown ale otherwise.
Moonlight Late Afternoon Tart;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Sampled with Brewer Brian Hunt at his brewery. I offered him some Duchesse de Bourgogne as we sampled his beers. We agreed the Late Afternoon is certainly not a tart...quite the misnomer. I suggested a hoppy ESB or English IPA. I brought a keg to Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach and it was suggested it is an American Brown. In any case it’s rich and tasty, but in no way a tart!
Moonlight Late Afternoon Tart;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);(On tap - Toronado) Fairly pale, amber golden with a small, off-white head. Fruity, somewhat berry-like aroma. Fairly light body with an unclean malt profile and then a distinct, bitter finish. A somewhat weird and unrefined beer, presumably a Belgian experiment of some sort. Just not really Belgian, nor tart. 290307
Moonlight Late Afternoon Tart;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);"Draft. Rich amber beer with a thin off-white head.

Cottage Jack & The Dragon;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cottage Brewing;Cask @ The Pakenham Arms. Clear light amber body with hardly any head to speak of.

Amber coloured with a slight white head. Sweet, butterscotch aroma. Flavour had a similar diacetyl edge, with a touch of floral hops lurking in the background. Not my kind of beer.

Cottage Jack & The Dragon;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cottage Brewing;Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. A gold coloured beer with a tightish off-white head. The aroma is a bit non-descript. Just a bit of maltiness. The taste is fairly sweet. A creamy texture and a note of alcohol. Disappointing to be fair.
Cottage Jack & The Dragon;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cottage Brewing;"Cask at The Market Porter. Light floral hop aroma. Very light amber color; very little head. Starts floral and lightly fruity. Not much hop. Very light hop finish. Very refreshing."
Cornerstone Tru Grit;Berea, Ohio, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Cornerstone Brewing Company;On tap at the Oakroom in Athens. Amber, with a sour aroma. Tastes a like bit like old cigarette butts. Way too smoky for me. Medium body and over powered by the smoke flavor.
Flying Bison Warbird IIPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Cask at Manhattan Cask Festival. Clear amber beer. Fairly nutty and caramelly. Flavour is very sweet with an unappealing sort of wet dog character. Bitter, but without being all that hoppy. Sticky and sweet palate that comes across as underattenuated, underhopped, or both. Meh.
Flying Bison Warbird IIPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;On tap 9/7/07. Murky orange in color with everlasting foam, no lacing though. Aroma is a mess, way too much malt and a very confused hop profile. Flavor is just as confused, very muddled, beat over the head with malt and yeast one second and then a mouth puckering bitterness pounds your taste buds. Very little hop flavor, just bitterness and a fairly thick mouthfeel.
Flying Bison Warbird IIPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;On tap at Ortinos Northside. Pours a lightly hazy deep golden amber with a medium off white creamy head that laced. Aroma was earthy, yeasty, some caramel and light citrus. Flavor of earthy, lightly spicy hops with a touch of citrus. Very grassy hop flavor not all that appealing. Some toffee and nuts as it warmed. Not what I like in my DIPAs. I will be sticking to the Pliny they have on tap tonight.

Aroma of vanilla, nuts, floral hops, citrus, and grainy malts. Taste of citrus fruits, some grapefruit, nuts, bread, toffee malts, and low bitterness in the finish.
Flying Bison Warbird IIPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Pours amber with a steady white head. Sweet but faint smell. Tastes malty, with notes of alcohol. This is followed by citrus hop flavor. I did not think this was hoppy enough to be a double IPA.
Flying Bison Warbird IIPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Headless medium brown without much aroma. Taste honey and vinegar, and light on hops. Carbonation is pretty good.
Flying Bison Warbird IIPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Draft at Grey Lodge - listed as Warbird. Caramel-amber color with a smallish head. Aroma had some citrus hop, but was overwhelmingly dominated by fruit and sweet malt aroma. Taste was malty and sweet, but a Double IPA? I think not. Drinkable, but I had to knock off another point for this beer’s attempt to masquerade as a Double IPA.
Flying Bison Warbird IIPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Draft at Capone’s. Deep copper pour with aroma of caramel malt, hops, black pepper, some bready anf spicy notes. Medium palate with bready caramel malt flavor coupled with solid hops, floral notes, and black pepper. I had 2 pints of this, and enjoyed it.

Flying Bison Warbird IIPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flying Bison Brewing;Growler, from Premier Gourmet. Sort of strawberry nose, but weak, amber body, fairly dense whitish head. Bitter, syrupy, some of that strawberry persists into the flavor, not very good. Perhaps the worst example of this style that I’ve tried.

Geltsdale Kings Forest;Brampton, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Geltsdale Brewery;"Bottle from Matkroken Natland, Bergen. Pours a light amber clear body with a small white head. Nose is caramel, biscuits, bread and smooth toffee-like grainy notes in the back. Taste is clean biscuity grain tones, hints of caramel, toffee and hints of bread. Smooth palate, mild carbonation. A bit watery, but weighing in at 3,6 % that tends to be an issue. Pretty high on drinkability though; I could down a liter of this stuff with no problems - it goes down like water. With no off-flavors around and such easy drinking, I’d say this is a pretty good session beer, but no more than...precisely that."
Geltsdale Kings Forest;Brampton, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Geltsdale Brewery;0.5l bottle. This is a crystal clear golden one with a small bubbly off-white top. Definitely a bit sweet and caramel lyrics on the nose with a good amount of fruity fruits. Some melon and melon zest, also with traces of something light herbal and tea like. Yeah, decent. It’s really watery in the mouth. The soft carbonation level is not to impressive either, but it’s scary lightdrinkable. Lots of sweet fruity flavors here. An apple-sweetness (the red kind), caramel and toffee. Low fruity bitterness before its leaving the mouth in a slightly dry way. It’s scary light drinkable and actually not all that bad. A bit dull in the long run perhaps, but a fine bitter. 22.04.2013
Geltsdale Kings Forest;Brampton, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Geltsdale Brewery;Partly clouded golden ale with an appealing tangy fruitiness in aroma and taste. There’s plenty of orange in the flavour and very little texture to suggest its a best bitter as the bottle advertises.

Capitol City Belgian Pale Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Capitol City Brewing Company;Draft Shirlington. Cloudy and murky semi-dark orange colored body with a white head. Crisp and doughy, tastes full of american ale yeast, coarse and prickly, not the spicy and estery yeast of Belgians. Full of biscuit and dough flavors, even some strange feta-like scents and some old moldy oranges as well. Overall it’s a pretty simple brew, even approaches bland after having a full pint. The faintness of the nose is probably the most damning thing.
Nádor Világos Sör;Pécs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pécsi Sörfözde;(Bottle) Pours yellow. The aroma and flavour holds wort, grain, herbs, bread and compost. The mouthfeel is watery. Light bodied.
Nádor Világos Sör;Pécs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pécsi Sörfözde;Bottle. The only reason for drinking this kind of beer is, that afterwards you’ll learn to appreciate the others...

Aroma of sourish yeast and a ton of maiza with sesame and straw. Plus boiled and rotten vegetables. Brrr. Straw dominates the unpleasant aroma with cardboard, paper and vinegar. And the rotted vegetables again. Terrible. Borzalmas, ki kell próbálni, de csak egyszer....

Another (cheap, but that’s really no problem) beer from my country, which contains maizecoarse, too, so when’s that case, you can’t count here for a good or min. good-kinded average beer. Pale golden colour, quickly collapseing froth, average carbonation. Watery smell of yeast and malt, sweetish and sharp taste. Aroma’s of a very light hops, grain and yeast, abrupt and watery finish, beside a thin body. Just this one for a taste, but no more...

Poured a pale golden colour with a small thick white head that went away at a medium pace. Malty, dusty and corny nose, some sulphur. The taste is sweet and yet sourish with distinct notes of cardboard. Some sulphur and a bite. Watery. Different than most, fuller than some but still crap. Ugh... A funny sidenote... while ""nádor"" means ""palatine"" in Hungarian, it means ""tumor"" in Czech. Tumor beer... now that’s a first."

Aroma is lightly spicy and toasty. A kiss of caramel as well. Falvour is decent. Soft caramelly maltiness and a very persistent lingering bready character on the back as well. Seems fairly hoppy for the style. As it warms, the hops fade and there is just a nice nutty/caramelly maltiness. A kiss of apple fruitiness and maybe a bit of berry as well. Some faint spiciness along with a bit of citrus on the back. The malts aren’t exactly right with an obviously North American malts rather than European ones, but it’s still pretty nice.

Hartwall 1836 Classic White Lager;Lahti, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hartwall (Royal Unibrew);Limonadimainen, sitruunainen, tuo mieleen Witbierin. ”Tehty pohjahiivamenetelmällä suomalaiseen makuun” – pintahiivalla tästäkin olisi saatu oikea Witbier.

Hurricane Insurance Adjustor Pale Ale;Mobile, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hurricane Brewing Company;Bright amber colour. There’s a lot of soft English bitterness (good) and herbal notes (also good) but way too much diacetyl (very bad) and on the whole it ruins the beer.
Hurricane Insurance Adjustor Pale Ale;Mobile, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hurricane Brewing Company;Clear copper with small but tight tan head. Buttery aroma detracts. Some apple sauce in there too. There is a good beer under all the butter, I detect herbal bitterness and lots of fruit.
Hurricane Insurance Adjustor Pale Ale;Mobile, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hurricane Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours pale amber with little head and no lacing. The aroma is mild with some bready malts and a hint of earthy hops. There is some caramel sweetness, but only faintly. Slightly toasted malts and earthy hops dominate, though they’re certainly not packing a lot of punch. Hop bitterness is present but faint – pretty thin bodied overall. Not terrible, but really nothing to stand out, especially as an IPA. It’s pretty fair as a standard pale ale.
Hurricane Insurance Adjustor Pale Ale;Mobile, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hurricane Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark amber orange with signs of white head.

Hurricane Projected Path Amber Ale;Mobile, Alabama, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hurricane Brewing Company;Amber colour. Nice toasted aroma. Very toasty palate with notes of rye (I don’t think they used any, though). There are subtle esters, no doubt a function of the English yeast (apple, pear). Nice beer for the style.

Mild fruity aroma, even has a touch of watermelon in it. Juicy body with low carbonation. The rye adds an interesting character. Body is mainly fruity, but has a nice bready quality too.

Aroma is pretty muted with some light grains and a faint light fruit sweetness. The taste is of toasted grains and light malts. The body is very thin and light carbonation.

Clear aroma of yeast, with malty and fruity notes and touches of hops. Bitter, hoppy onset, quickly giving way to estery and malty notes, with touches of fruit and rough hints of butter.

It poured a clear, light golden color with moderate white foam and a little lace. Typical, true-to-style pilsener. Light adjuncts, but not flawed.

Pours a clear, rich golden amber color with a small off-white head- Ray said true pilsners were allowed to be between 2 and 6 on the color scale and this was a 6 (speaking of which, why is this listed as a Pale Lager?). Nice aroma of sweet and pale malts, grassy hops, straw, crackers, and corn flakes. The flavor is a little more muted than the nose but offers up the same slate of notes. Light-bodied, with a malty mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Dry finish. Pretty nice pils, and a little unconventional.

J.T. Whitneys Dark Comedy Dubbel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;10 oz sample I have been avoiding JT Whitney’s for a while just because there has been nothing compelling on tap. Other than trying some old standbys this is the first tap that has interested me in a while. For a brewpub Belgian it was amazingly good. While I would not suggest it over many bottled dubbels it does satisfy. My advice is to let it sit for 20 minutes so the ice on the sides of the cold glass has time to melt. Aroma / Appearance - The color of dark iced tea was decorated with a thin offwhite head. The nose was clean and simple, consisting of nutty malts, light citrus tones, cocoa, cherries and an overall sweetness. Flavor / Palate - Chewy peanut butter cups, cherries and tea leaves form the initial impression. A strong vinous followup gets some attention before things settle down. This was a reasonably solid beer with some good qualities that make me want to pick up a growler. Check it out if you happen to be in the area though I would not make a special trip just to try it.

Spinnakers Iceberg Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Spinnakers Brewpub;0.65 l bottle at Stockholm Beer Festival 2007. Golden color. Sweet honeyish and perfumed aroma. The flavor is also sweet and honeyish with dry hoppiness, tobacco, pepper and apple.
Spinnakers Iceberg Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Spinnakers Brewpub;"Bottle at Stockholm Beer Festival, 2007-09-21, 6-4-6-3-11=30 Hazy golden color. Not full bodied. Hoppy, of course, dry, but the hop has been infused too much. Bottle at Stockholm Beer Festival, 2007-09-20, 7-4-6-4-13=34 Hazy blond color; creamy head. Quite nice hoppy aroma, a bit fruity. The flavor is less interesting than expected, the hop dominates, with some thin resins, but there is some yeast and some yeast off-flavors too (it’s a bit metallic). I like hops, so I don’t dislike it, but it’s a bit… controversial."
McKenzie Dunkelweizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;McKenzie Brew House;had on draft at pub. too much banana in aroma, and not much else. considering the aroma, I was surprised how thin tasting it was. Clean but no flavor. hazy amber, would try something else next time.
McKenzie Dunkelweizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;McKenzie Brew House;on tap-pours a light tan head and red/brown color. Aroma is lots of banana. Sweet medium fruit. Taste is lots of banana, yeast, sweet medium fruit, wheat, dark malt-chocolate, nut. Faint hops bite. OK effervescence.
McKenzie Dunkelweizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;McKenzie Brew House;Malty-sweet Dunkelweizen that looks nice with an amber-ish color. Lightly malty-wheatish aroma. but a bit too weak of a body to be all that tasty. OK brew.
McKenzie Chocolate Cherry Stout;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McKenzie Brew House;Husband Loves it. Had two pintson tap. At the Malvern location. Deep color. Rich stout flavor with chocolate cherries are light which is good
McKenzie Chocolate Cherry Stout;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McKenzie Brew House;Malvern location. Poured a dark but not completely opague brown body with a small brown head. The aroma is mostly dry, dark chocolate with some coffee notes. Flavor is mostly dark chocolate roast with some burnt notes and barely any cherry flavors until after the beer’s been sitting for a half hour or so. Even then, you really have to dig deep. Too thin.
McKenzie Chocolate Cherry Stout;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McKenzie Brew House;"First off, there are no hints of cherry or for that matter very much chocolate. Other than being misnamed, this should be their standard stout beer, by far and away better than their house stout beer. Nice and rich; the usual subtle hints of cocoa and dry flavors found in beers of this style. McKenzie’s beers mostly have a serious case of sourness in their batches. It may be the only beer that avoids this McKenzie’s curse"
McKenzie Chocolate Cherry Stout;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McKenzie Brew House;on tap-pours a diminishing light brown head and black color.

McKenzie Chocolate Cherry Stout;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McKenzie Brew House;"Sampled at the 2007 Brewers Plate; hearty sweet stout that’s roasted flavor dominated the cherry chocolate flavors. Poured rather flat....my first ""Dude-less"" beer from McKenzie’s."
McKenzie Chocolate Cherry Stout;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McKenzie Brew House;"Darker color with a sweet, cherry-chocolate aroma. Chewy-fruit flavor that lacks the ""Stout flavor"". Tastes a bit fake. An odd mix of flavors"
Deschutes Raspberry Wheat;Bend, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Deschutes Brewery;Draught @ Deschutes: Dirty amber, cloudy, moderate off-white foamy off-white head, sticky lacing. Rubbery nose, slight artificial fruitiness.   Tangy start, starchy, pale malts, low hop profile, high fake profile.   The fruitiness aspect of this beer does not translate well.   The fruit aspect seems immature, or picked too early.   Its dry and not as sweet as you would aspect.   Flavor is too artificial.   Underlying beer is questionable.   Is it a wheat or a pale?   Slight astringency on the finish.   Body and mouthfeel are bordering on the thin side.   Tacky finish.   Blech... Great pale ales but stay away from the fruit!

Harboe Danish Pilsner Premium;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;"330 ml can bought at Great Food Hall at Pacific Place, Admiralty. Pissy dull pale golden colour; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Good sticky lacing with quite fizzy small carbonation; Sweet aroma of light malt, with Light wet cardboard, grape juice, sugar, chemicals and faint grass; Close to light sweet taste of very light malt, with light metallic, soda, trace of molasses, shades of lemon and faint bitter grassy hops and faint grass; Light body. Watery palate; Mouth feel is very light malt, close to Happoshu-level, in a watery background. Soda-ish, not much to taste except slight metallic and bits of sweetness and slight grass. Poor!... Hoppiness is faint grass in nose, bits of lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is minimal and barely tastable, essentially soda finish; Wet after taste. Very easy to mouth. Comments: This is crap even by Euro Pale standard: from malt, hops to sweetness, every taste are close to minimal, topped with poor chemical aroma sure didn’t help. Drain pours!"
Harboe Danish Pilsner Premium;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;330 ml can. Found in a Jumbo supermarket in Chile. Grass smell and some malt in it. Golden color with low white head. Doesn’t look much carbonated. Very watered malty taste, citric as well, but decent for a supermarket lager. Not funky aftertaste neither. It isn’t the classical cheap lager, it is slightly better, but there’s just too much water taste in it. This beer is begging for a stronger taste.
Harboe Danish Pilsner Premium;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;Can @ home. Pours clear yellow. Sweet butter aroma with some grains ,corn, grass, and cardboard plus a bizzare note of sweet honey. Highly carbonated. Watery taste of wet cardboard, table sugar, corn, hay, hints of grass.

Aroma has roasted malts with cocoa and some more bittersweet chocolate. Flavor has a touch of light sweetness to balance the roasted malts and cocoa. Flavor is balanced with some lightly bitter coffee grinds and chocolate on top of the rich roasted malts. Slight bitter finish.

Sixpoint Black Market Porter (Carob Porter);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Hand-bottle courtesy of Shane poured into a pint glass. Pours dark, dark brown with light showing through the edges under a small off-white head that recedes to a ring leaving almost no lacing. Oddly enough, the most dominant aroma for me was the ctirus hops, grapefruits and lemons mainly. There is some hints of carob and dark malts, but the hops really stand out in a relatively subdued aroma. The taste starts out with a sweeter chocolate and malt base than the aroma. There is a little coffee bitterness in the middle before the hops come back to leave a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is creamy but lighter and with more bitterness than your typical porter. This is one very interesting porter and one that I certainly wasn’t expecting. I can’t put it up there with the better porters out there but it was very enjoyable.

Peters Schwarz (Black);Budapest, Hungary;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Er-Pé Serfozo;A színe szép vörösesbarna, de könnyedén át meg át lehet tekinteni rajta, amiből már látszik, hogy nem lesz egy igazán sűrű, anyagerős sör. Illata nincs, habja hamar és teljesen elmúlik, mint valami 14 hónapig tölgyfahordóban érlelt barley-wine-nak. Elsőre íze sincs. Lassan csak kibontakozik valamiféle fröccsös szódás savanyúság, ami csak szép lassan megy át gyenge karamelles, barnás ízbe, az utóíze pedig a nagy nyálkás semmi. Leginkább a Borsodi Borostyánra emlékeztet: rengeteg víz, rengeteg üresség, nem tragikus és nem undorító, de nem lehet tudni, mire jó. Mintha kisüzemi létére a nagyüzemi lágerek ürességét igyekezne újrateremteni - csak nem sikerült olyan jól az állag, a karbonáció. De más sem: az egész íz szétesett, a karamell oda van passzintva mesterségesen, itt némi kenyéríz, ott egy kis alkohol.
Peters Schwarz (Black);Budapest, Hungary;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Er-Pé Serfozo;PET-bottle. Dark copper colour with pale brown head. Honey nose, and really lacking in everything dark.

Roasty yet hoppy nose with some berries. More of the same in the flavour with plenty of milk chocolate and ground coffee. Hoppy finish gives it a nice balance. Interesting stout.
Bank Top Leprechaun Stout;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Stout;Bank Top Brewery;Gravity fed half pint at the London Drinker Beer Festival, black with a bubbly beige head. A strong blackcurrant presence in the lightly roasted and hopped aroma. The blackcurrant is mroe subtle in the flavour, which is quite sweet. Hop and roasted presence ismore notable in the finish.

North Peak SchWaler Weisse;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;North Peak Brewing Company;On tap at North Peak. I thought this was Sea Water Weisse, but our server wasn’t the brightest of diamonds like those in his Dolce sunglasses. Poured a murky yeasty yellow orange with a white ring of head. This really looks like the last centimeter of a homebrewed bottle. Yeast, wheat, lemon aromas with some banana. Watery body more lemons and banana. The banana carries through to the finish with a touch of clove spice. Meh. Nothing special, but not all that bad either.

Pours a translucent yellow with a smaller bubbly white head that left some lacing. Aroma of corn, grassy, some light grains, citrus and bready.

75th Street 2 Alarm Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;75th Street Brewery;"Pours a clear pale amber with a thin off-white head and wispy lace. The aroma is sweet and doughy with a light floral note. Light-bodied and thin with a soft slick mouthfeel and a mildly bitter finish. The flavor is of sweet, slightly bready and fruity malt with an ""off"" plastic note that finishes bitter. This started a fairly bland but decent mild quaffer and degraded from there. This is not the best pale that these guys have made."
75th Street 2 Alarm Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours clear copper with a nice full dense white head. The aroma has toasted malt with a bit of hops. Medium body that is slick with some gentle carbonation. The taste starts off with roasted malt that is lightly nutty with some sweetness. The finish has some earthy woody hops that leave a light resinous taste. An acceptable APA.
75th Street 2 Alarm Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;75th Street Brewery;A beer to commemerate the great fire of 07! What a damn mess. There is so much caramel malts in here that the hops don’t really stand a chance. The aroma is of honey or buttered buiscts. The flavor was cloying with an astrigant finish. Not a very good welcome back.

Wells Bombardier Satanic Mills;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Porter;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Dark brown 568ml (full English Pint) bottle. Best before 30th June 2008, drank a month earlier. Poured into a Westmalle Chalice. Jet black in colour, deep dark tan head, which sadly dispersed far to quickly for me. Chocolate and liquorice aroma, both very strong. The taste was also all about chocolate and liquorice. Watery for such a dark beer, very little substance or body. It looks like a Porter/Stout but doesn’t have the robustness to carry it off. The label claimed it was a Premium Bitter, it wasn’t one of those either in my eyes. An inbetween sort of beer, the brewer has produced an interesting product but failed to deliver something that really excited me.
Wells Bombardier Satanic Mills;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Porter;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);(Bottle) Pours near black with red highlight. Light brown head. The aroma holds dark bread, chocolate/coffee roast, dark fudge, blackberries, bubble-gum and light floral hops. The flavour is light sweet, light to medium bitter and light acidic Tones of dark berries, dark fruits, dark bread and coffee. The mouthfeel is soft at first but has a tar and astringent finish. Malty ending. Medium bodied.

Wells Bombardier Satanic Mills;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Porter;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Rating from an old notebook. Bottle. Black. Not exactly your typical porter, this is a little drier, less sweet and a touch thin and has a certain smokiness to it. Better than I expected really.
Wells Bombardier Satanic Mills;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Porter;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Bottle. Aroma is mainly dark chocolate and only little less coffee, quite a heavy taste and oily consistency. Didn’t like it but I’ve got a feeling I should resample this on the next occasion.
Wells Bombardier Satanic Mills;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Porter;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Bottle. Black with a creamy beige head. Chocolate, licorice, some roasted malts, some coffee. Medium-bodied, pretty smooth. Not bad, but from the name, you would expect a much heavier beer.
Pizzeria Uno Dark Mild;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Mild Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Pours a nice deep dark brown, moslty clear with auburn highlights- nice grayish tan head with awesome lace. Aroma at first is a bit chalky and light roast, but as it warms it gains a nice deep chocolate malt character with lots of toast and nut hints- light ester profile and slight tea and heerbal hops. Full flavor for a mild- lots of chocolate malts, some sweet caramel, herbal hops, and a clean lightly bitter finihs. Very smooht and easy to drink especially as it warmed.
Pizzeria Uno Dark Mild;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Mild Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;on tap-pours a retaining foamy tan head that laces and dark brown color with red tint. Aroma is roasty dark malt-chocolate. Taste is roasty dark malt-chocolate, coffee/caramel, secondary hops bitterness. Good carbonation.
Pizzeria Uno Dark Mild;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Mild Ale;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;"Dark auburn with a smallish quickly dissipating tan head, this mild ale had an earthy burnt toast aroma and flavor. Subdued hop profile with little bitterness, and a dry finish. Pretty boring though the style is rarely done in America. Easy drinking; like a porter lite."
Lost Duck Mallard Lite;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lost Duck Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a slightly hazy pale yellow color. Head was thin, white, and didn’t leave much lace behind. Pleasant aroma and flavor of subdued noble hops. There was also a light malty cereal grain flavor that lingered ever so slightly. This is better than most light beers.
Lost Duck Mallard Lite;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lost Duck Brewing Company;From the tap, served at a cooler cellar temperature in a pint glass. Poured a chill hazy bright yellowish golden with a foamy white head, pretty much exactly how you would expect a brewpub lite lager to look, a nice, sharp appearance. Aromas of powdery, dusty sweet pale malts with a little citric fruitiness. Good, even carbonation and a crisp, dry, quaffable light bodied mouthfeel, very smooth and easy to drink. For a lite beer, it was actually quite tasty, dry, sweet neutral pale malts, the right amount of citric fruitiness to balance with the sweet tasting malts, and a dry, bitter finish with a spicy leafiness that cleanses the palate, a lite beer that you know has hops in it, well made. I’m not a fan of lite lagers, but I don’t hate them either, and this was the best tasting lite beer I’ve ever had, all you can expect from a lite. Who would know that of all the new releases that the Duck has been introducing lately, that a lite lager would be the best of the lot. More hop flavor than their new APA, amazing, and in a way, kind of sad too.
Dr. Dremos Blackberry Weizen;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Draft at Dr. Dremos. Light in color. Pleasant aroma of blackberries. Flavor is a little tart, but I suppose I was expecing more of a berry flavor in this one. Decent, but I probably wouldn’t have this one again.

Twain's Cryptic Drifter Brown Ale;Decatur, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Twain's Billiards and Tap;Dark brown in color. Very full flavor. Lots of rich toffee and caramel. Takes a brown ale to the limit. Almost porter like.
Oggis Padre Porter;San Clemente, California, United States;Porter;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;On tap at Oggi’s Vista, pint glass: Deep brown with a nitro produced creamy tan head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of vanilla, chocolate, toasted malt, aromatic tobacco, and some herbal hops. The taste starts sweet with a major vanilla bean overtone that dominates the palate. Some chocolaty and toasty notes as well before leading to a minor quick hitting lactic twang. The mouth feel is soft and thin, got boring quickly. Sorry, this beer was a pain to finish as it displays way too much vanilla and not enough pure malt and/or nutty porter characteristics.
Angry Minnow Lynger Belgian Dubbel;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Angry Minnow;Growler thanks to Will from the Angry Minnow - pours cloudy orange with a heavy yeast and fruit aroma. Very little yeast in the flavor, but a strong sweet caramel malt flavor mixed with fruit and herb. Very delicious!
Angry Minnow Lynger Belgian Dubbel;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Angry Minnow;A strange fusion style beer. Cloudy orange appearance. Aroma of a tripel with yeast and light fruit. Medium sweet malt with bock carmelly flavor. Some herbal quality as well. Belgian Dopple? How strange.
Angry Minnow Lynger Belgian Dubbel;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Angry Minnow;Growler courtesy of Skyview. Copper color with no head. Aroma of caramel. Sweet malt taste with a slightly sour finish. Not sure it survived the trip in the growler.

Angry Minnow Lynger Belgian Dubbel;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Angry Minnow;"This is a real ""sleeper"" Belgian-style dubbel. Pours a clean reddish copper with a caramel creamy head. Aroma is definately a Belgian yeast but with a touch of honey. Taste caught me by surprise. It tastes more like a sweet dopplebock than a Belgian ale. Sweet barley malt, very slight yeast, and caramel. Finish sweet with the caramel. This is worth a trip to Hayward, WI and bring back a few growlers for your beer rating friends!"
Blue Point Spring Fling;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Pretty much an average spring ale (or slightly above)....bottle says copper ale which bests describes. Lighter brown or copper colored. Thinner caramel malt with decent hop finish. Grew on me by the last sample of the 6-pack, so upped the rating a bit.
Blue Point Spring Fling;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Sampled on draft at the 2016 Tanglefoot Brewfest, a deep orange amber colour with weak, off-white foam. Fairly true-to-style American hopped amber ale, but bland. Mushy malt, metallic, medium body, high carbonation. Flawed, boring.
Blue Point Spring Fling;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Pour is a clear copper with a large white head. Aroma is a nice bready malt with a bit of caramel and tobacco. Reminds me of a English ale so far. Flavor is a bt more sweet with a chewy caramel some old hops and a bit of vegetable aftertaste. This started off well but kind of went downhill with the flavor. This is a few months old so maybe more of the hops would show up if drank earlier in the year.
Blue Point Spring Fling;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Draft at sq1 in St Pete, FL. Looks and smells good but flavor is lacking. Too grainy. Wasn’t sure what a copper ale would be, but must say it tastes metallic. Some odd sweetness mixed in
Blue Point Spring Fling;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);On tap. Pours a dark amber color with a nice head and some lacing. Aroma is on the mild side with citrus, malt sweetness and grain. Taste of citrus, some caramel sweetness and grain. Moderate bitterness and a fairly dry finish.

Blue Point Spring Fling;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Sample at Waldo Hopfest 2016. Comes golden red with a decent beige head. Aroma of malt and caramel. Taste is malt, caramel, and a bit of fruit. Decent.

Angry Minnow Oakys Bourbon Barrel Oatmeal Stout;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Angry Minnow;Pours darker brown with light brown highlights. Thicker head that fades quickly. Aroma of caramel, chocolate, malt and a bit of coconut. Very smooth, no alcohol burn with this one (ABV was at 6.9.. up from the listed 4.7).
Angry Minnow Oakys Bourbon Barrel Oatmeal Stout;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Angry Minnow;On tap (cast drawn) only at the Angry Minnow Restaurant in Hayward WI. This is the first bourbon barrel, six-month aged, oatmeal stout the brewpub produced. Pours a very dark black color with light brown head that disappears in a couple minutes. Nice aroma and flavor of roasted coconut, maple, sweet barley malt, and milk chocolate. The finish is creamy sweet with hints of maple and vanilla. Owner informed me that only one 31 gallon batch was made and first tapped during the last week of Feb 07. For bourbon aged creamy stouts, this one is worth a trip to North Central Wisconsin.
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Found this in my fridge from one of my friends (clearly with zero taste) and decided to try it for kicks with my other beer snob friend. Poured from 355mL can. Clear pale yellow with foamy white head and huge carbonation. Corny skunk aroma. Grainy corn taste. No body. Not as terrible as I thought it would be, but pretty much what I expected.
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;355ml can pours a pale straw color with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is cereal grains with some faint hops. Taste is grainy malt sweetness with some grassy hop bitterness. Overall, just another horrible tasting beer.
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Dude! Where’s my beer? Not in this single can, purchased from Jimmy’s Liquor Store singles cooler... piss yellow and corny sweet industrial swill with no hop whatsoever, the marketing target must be immature white trash lagerboys with no disposable incomes and no tastebuds. Blech!
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Light yellow, approaching straw. Clean, somewhat bright pilsner malt aroma. OK, but bland. Gets a bit out of control in the end, leather finish.
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Pours clear yellow not much head. smells rancid. With notes of corn and other filler. flavour is weak, watery and dull. Not much to say here. Dude..... this beer sucks! it sucks soo bad I would have thought that it was made by minhas.
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Jon, thanks for the can Dude! I am going to keep this can as a collector’s item. Very pale yellow pour, with an active and noisy bleached white cap. Nose of corn, vegetables, some grains. Tastes the same.....lots of sweet-ish corn, grains. Sheesh, dude!!!!!!!!!
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;It has come to this. The dude beer rating. I have had a conversation with people who rationalized buying Mountain Crest over this. I poured this out from a 355ml Can, 5%. Pale yellow pour with a bubbly white foam. Aroma is carbonated smelly malts, and corn. Taste is absolutely more of the above. If this was my first beer, I’d switch to whiskey forever.
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Dude beer. One of the worst looking cans ever - solid black with giant vertical letters spelling DUDE. It is, however, brewed with pure spring water....which means that the water could have been pumped out of anyones backyard dugout. Beer is gold. There are bubbles. The cap is thin and white. There is a tiny bit of lacing. The aroma would’ve been pretty good if not for the smell of armpits...Sweet, cheap malts, corn, but it’s mostly armpits. Also has a warm smell to it...odd. Taste is grainy, wheaty and thankfully does not taste like armpits. But there is some nasty ass flavour that I haven’t nailed down yet. Slight note of alcohol, large on the grain....low quality hops. Cardboard? Some chemicals and a bit sour here and there. Huge foam up on the mouth swish. Light bodied and highly carbonated. Has a watery crummy hop finish. I get to pawn off the other two cans to my ’friends’......There was no attempt to make a quality beer here and they know it. Sucks balls. Get some now! You won’t be dissapointed!
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;"""DUDE BEER!!! This has to be one of the most blatant marketing schemes aimed at high school students to get them to buy beer ever, For who ells would by a beer called “DUDE” that sells for 4.50 a sixer. It’s sad to say but I kind of enjoy this can, it’s all black and just says dude in big block letters down the side, cheesier then hell but it makes me laugh. Beer appears to be at least in appearance to be not to bad sold gold body and a 1” fluffy cap that had retention, lots of carbonation is bubbling up from the bottom of my glass at it looks alright. Aroma is has the typical bargain lager smell, metallic, sour, grainy and over all stinky but not to over powering. Mouth feel is soft but still acceptable. Flavor is just like the aroma metallic, sour, grainy but this also has some alcohol and a random assortment of chemicals. The finish is very bready and a insanely sweet after taste lasts for hours at least the flavor is not over the top powerful this is the only thing keeping the beer drinkable. Dude beer is pure swill but strangely drinkable, if I was ever in the mode for a extremely cheap crappy beer I would chose this one but only because it is called DUDE beer."""
Pacific Western Dude;Prince George, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pacific Western Brewing Company;Dude it’s Dude and it’s not really that good, but its cheap and if you are going to buy something that is this cheap don’t bother. The name speaks for itself. Lacks even a real comment! DUDE!
White Winter Sweet Mead 2004 Reserve;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Sampled from the tap at GTMW 2017. Pours a clear like water with no head whatsoever. Aroma has a lot of sweet honey with a bit of flora coming through. Flavor has sweet honey throughout with orange blossom and light flora backing.
White Winter Sweet Mead 2004 Reserve;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;750ml bottle, courtesy hopscotch. Pours a clear, still, light golden-straw color with no visible legging. The aroma primarily shows notes of blonde honey with a slightly herbal hint, most notably basil. Flavors come through the same, initially quite sweet and honey laden, with a slight tinge of bright green, leafy herbaciousness for depth. Slick on the tongue, the palate is substantial, but not nearly what I would consider to be full bodied for a mead. Honey lingers on the finish. Overall, this is a solid, interesting little mead, but it’s not something I’m crazy to hunt down again.
White Winter Sweet Mead 2004 Reserve;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;@RLRL with Orlando group-thanks to hopscotch-750ml bottle-pours no head and clear straw color that sheets on glass.

White Winter Sweet Mead 2004 Reserve;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;"Bottle … Clear, light straw-colored mead. No legs. The deep, meaty aroma offers standout notes of fallen apples and tree nuts. Full-bodied with a crystallized mouthfeel – no carbonation. Sugary-sweet nectar bliss. Not necessarily big on apples; just big, bold, fruity and sweet. Lengthy, sugary finish."
White Winter Sweet Mead 2004 Reserve;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Light yellow of color without any head. An aroma of honey, sweets and spice. A flavor of fruits and spice.
White Winter Sweet Mead 2004 Reserve;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Bottled. A light golden mead with no head. The aroma is sweet with notes of honey and rather spicy combined with notes of roses. The flavor is sweet with noets of honey, flowers - especially roses, and lots of alcohol. The alcohol leaves a light burn in the mouth. Thanks Papsoe for sharing.
White Winter Sweet Mead 2004 Reserve;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;"(Bottled). Clear yellow color, no head. Flowers, tobacco, leather and orange marmalade in the nose.

White Winter Sweet Mead 2004 Reserve;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;White Winter Winery;Bottled (Thanks Papsoe!). Golden colour, no head. Aroma is white wine mixed with some sap, fruits and wooden notes. Very sweet. Flavour is about exactly the same. Semi dry, but sweet.

Møn Påskebryg (2007);Stege, Denmark;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bryghuset Møn;Bottled. A slightly hazy deep red beer with a medium bubbly orange head. The aroma is sweet malty, but also with a hint of acidity (brewing flaw or bottling flaw?), as well as notes of berries. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, berries, bread, and some herbs with a light underlying acidity - something is not 100% right. The body is quit light for a bock.

Everards Sly Fox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Draught (Crown, Oxford) Sweet malty bitter aroma and taste. Scarily boring. More like a straight Tiger, as there’s none of the hint of ginger at all. Dull, dull, dull.

Everards Sly Fox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask and handpump at the Bull’s Head, Strand on the Green. Light brown with a light white head. A bit of ginger on the nose, then a bit more on the palate, dry and malty too, and nicely balanced. It’s not a ginger beer, it’s a beer spiced with ginger. Another one good enough to go back for seconds.
Everards Sly Fox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask, Drum and Monkey, Glasgow. Pleasant pale ale, the ginger flavour is subtle. I like my ginger beers to have a bit more of a kick, this neither overpowers nor underwhelms. Touch of dryness, slighlty papery and a very thin head (pulled without sparkler)
Everards Sly Fox;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask handpull, The Olde Ship, Seahouses, Northumberland. Don’t you just love it when you drive 250 miles from home to drink something that’s brewed down the road? Clear gold with a slim white head. Fresh rub of root ginger aroma. Brazenly spiced without heat- more dunked gingernut than root ginger. Falls between two stools. Unbeery, unspicy, tasty and pointless.
Old Spot Beauty Spot;Bradford, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Spot Brewery;Cask@London Drinker 07. A little bit roasty and fairly toasty flavours come through. Looks like it should be a bitter, but ends up having the flavouor of a stout, all be it a fairly light one. Quite decent.
Old Spot Beauty Spot;Bradford, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Spot Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at London Drinker. The mostin interesting beer I had at the festival. Very stout like given its (very good) amber looks. It’s a bit of a contradiction but not at all in a negative way. Much darker in character than you would think to look at it. Lovely and roasty all round with heavy sweetish malt. Then all of a sudden dusty and dry with a great hit of hops for some finishing balance. Something a little different and I enjoyed it a lot.
Willoughby Cherry Red Ale;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Willoughby Brewing Co.;On tap at brewpub This was better than the Snowbelt and salvaged a downhill experience. On par or maybe even slightly better than the Railway Razz I hope this goes into regular rotation. It might not be a great beer but it for a basic drinker it is good enough. Aroma / Appearance - The cherry is hard to discern in the transparent reddish brown body. Chocolate and malts are stronger than the hops which still make themselves known after some reflection. Flavor / Palate - Cherries, brownies, and then a bright fruity aftertaste create a simple and predictable experience. It might not be the richest fruit beer but sometimes being low key is what you want. Sessionable at just under 5% ABV this is the standby wheat beer you expect to find at a brewpub.
Willoughby Cherry Red Ale;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Objectively speaking: The black sheep of their lineup. I like: The fruit seems genuine, but… I dislike: Clear orangey-red hue. Hugely medicinal taste, powdery and plain odd. The off-taste keeps on in mouth, being more powerful than ever as you swallow. Natural fruits perhaps, but not so cohesively extracted.
Willoughby Cherry Red Ale;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Draught at 69 Taps in Akron. Nice dark ruby color with small head and little lacing.

Osbier Porter Stout;Rancagua, Chile;Porter;Cerveza Artesanal Osbier;Has a brown reddish color. The head is big and abundant, but it diminishes rapidly. The aroma is malty and toasting cereals. In the palate, the flavor is very weak, with an aftertaste to masses (flour), something sweet and with very little bitterness. The body is very thin and watery. This one newly done?. It is not a bad beer, I believe that with more ripeness and a bit more of malt and hop this beer can be very good. Mauricio, thanks for the bottles.

La Gaumaise Blonde;Gérouville, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Gigi de l'Etoile;Rating is a composite from 2 tastings. (6-3-7-3-12=3.1) 330ml bottle (One Pint, Helsinki) Bold amber, tiny head. Massive and shocking initial aroma, some marmite, some butter, some herbs, some who-knows-what. Fruity - grapefruit, lemon, and apple. Actually, I get mustart too. Taste not quite as wild as the aroma, but has come features in common. A refreshing, light blond. Anna detects artichokes, but I think she’s a bit woo-woo. Rerate of (5-3-6-3-10=2.7) 330ml bottle (One Pint, Helsinki) Hazy marmalade, small head. Light swimming-pool aroma. Light and refreshing, but a bit incipid, about as far from assertive as it’s possible to get. Some swimming-pool taste. Wait a sec - this is only 5%, but I can clearly taste alcohol. That’s not good.

Light gold, hop nose, fresh hoppy flavours, snappy finish. The sourness that others have found sounds like the all-too-familiar Leek bottling effect.
Leek Leekenbrau;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Bottle conditioned from Open All Hours, Keswick. ’Leekenbrau’.

Leek Leekenbrau;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);"I had this as a bottle conditioned beer called Leekenbrau - a ""golden beer"" with the same alcohol % - assumed to be the same as Leek Lager. Golden in colour with a an off-white head. Aromas are hoppy, spicy with some fruitiness. Flavours are doft malts with hops and citrus yeast. Quite sour, perhaps due to bad bottling. Actually its not bad. Very Leek-like and if you drink the Leek bottled beers you know what I mean."

Basil Ts (Toms River) Doppelbock Lager;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Artisan's Brewery and Italian Grill;This one was way to sweet for me. Sugar, honey, caramel, malt. Hardly a hop to be found. The pour was nice reddish amber with a small head. The aroma was malt and sweetness. This brewery likes their beers watery it seems and this is no exception. Very, very thin.
Basil Ts (Toms River) Doppelbock Lager;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Artisan's Brewery and Italian Grill;Draft, obviously. Pours a nice deep red with only a small off white head. Aroma needed some time to warm up but once it did there was lots of malty sweetness, honey..molassess, some nut aromas, slightly chocolatey as well. Flavor is very malt based with some slikd sweetness, honey, dark fruits, and nuts and bread. Body is a little on the thin side but that seems to be commonplace for this brewpub. This is one rather solid offering from Basils.

Rittmayer Smokey George (5%);Hallerndorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Rittmayer Hallerndorf;Zapach: wędzonka torfowa, kojarzące się ze spalonymi kablami i szpitalnymi bandażami, dla miłośników klimatów zachęcający. Smak: dość wodnisty i płaski, słodowy, umiarkowanie-niskie wysycenie i niska goryczka. Piwa zachęca zapachem ale bardzo traci brakiem ciała i jednowymiarowym smakiem. Jest to tanie piwo więc fanom torfowym klimatów polecałbym spróbować ze względy na czysty profil aromatu.

Rittmayer Smokey George (5%);Hallerndorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Rittmayer Hallerndorf;(butelka, dp: 17.07.2015) Piwo ma bursztynową barwę, jest klarowne. Aromat to dominacja dymu - są typowe nuty torfowe: bandaż, szpital, palone kable, ale pojawia się także zapach dymu z mokrego drewna. W smaku piwo jest średnio-pełne i zaskakująco słodkie, co doskonale komponuje się z torfowymi posmakami. Ciało piwa stanowią posmaki słodkiego pieczywa, biszkoptu, a do tego pojawia się dym i torf. Na finiszu pojawia się melasa i miodowe akcenty (być może wynik utlenienia mojej butelki). Goryczka niska.
Rittmayer Smokey George (5%);Hallerndorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Rittmayer Hallerndorf;What an unusual beer. It tastes a bit like cask, whiskey and smoked ham: The thought of a smokey pub in Ireland comes to mind when drinking this. This beer grows on you if you allow yourself to be captured by the torfy taste. A beer that you will like if you are willing to explore.
Rittmayer Smokey George (5%);Hallerndorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Rittmayer Hallerndorf;Hazy orange-brown color with hardly any head. Intense peat aroma, burnt wood. Surprisingly fresh, light and sweet on the tongue. Smooth mouthfeel. Nice and interesting.
Rittmayer Smokey George (5%);Hallerndorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Rittmayer Hallerndorf;Kolor: Kolor złoty - piwo jest klarowne. Piana: Obfita, drobnopęcherzykowa, trwała. Bardzo ładnie koronkuje. Aromat: Mocna wędzonka torfowa. Trochę dymna, ale bardziej przypominająca zapach asfaltu albo spalonych kabli. Smak: Piwo jest półsłodkie, pełnia niska (piwo jest trochę wodniste). Goryczka niska (praktycznie nieobecna). W smaku wędzonka jest nieco mniej intensywna, ale dalej przykrywająca wszystkie inne aromaty. Wysycenie: Średnie - mogłoby być nieco niższe. Opakowanie: Etykieta w niemieckim stylu - bardzo tradycyjna. Brak jakichkolwiek informacji na minus. Uwagi: Ciekawe, mocno wędzone piwo. Nie sądzę jednak, żebym sięgał po nie zbyt często. Wprawdzie moja tolerancja na wędzonkę torfową wzrosła i tu wędzonka mnie nie przytłacza, ale piwo jest bardzo jednowymiarowe. W Smokey Joe z AleBrowaru działo się dużo więcej. Smokey George jest też dla mnie trochę za słodki.

Moonshine Rebeccas Pleasured Pig;Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Moonshine Brewery;Bottle. Malty, with bready/cereally malt notes and a grainy mouthfeel. The alcohol shows way too much and it isn’t even that strong. Not a good one in my book. Needs more body and more hops.

St. Stans Napa Valley IPA;Modesto, California, United States;IPA;St. Stans Brewing Company;Herbal and grassy hop nose with more malt presence than I would expect. Ipa hell no, mildly malt forward on the palate with little hop presence.
St. Stans Napa Valley IPA;Modesto, California, United States;IPA;St. Stans Brewing Company;My first beer from these guys in years. The barley wine wasn’t on tap, so I went with their IPA. Aroma was really subdued with a light piney hop character, small malts and little else to note. Appearance was a nice deep orange color with a white one-finger head. Mouthfeel was slight harsh. Flavor was malt dominant with some piney hops coming out now and again. I’ve had IPA’s much worse, but it still was lacking. Perhaps if they were shooting for an English IPA maybe, but with a name Napa Valley IPA that screams West Coast to me, and if it’s gonna be WC IPA then it’d better be good. This one wasn’t bad, just forgettable.
Brockway Pumpkin Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Brockway Chophouse;This draft brew from the brew pub poured a large sized head of foamy with a frothy top off-white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated copper colored body. The nice aroma was spicy and pumpkin. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt cinnamon nutmeg and pumpkin. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Brockway Pumpkin Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Brockway Chophouse;On tap at Brockway (odd to see considering the season). Poured a clear medium brown with a short, dense white head. Aroma picked up fresh pumpkin with the necessary pie spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, and a little dough).. quite nice. Flavor didn’t handle itself as well... sticky spices were there, but not really any pumpkin.. some soapy notes.. left tacky spices on the short finish. Light-bodied and fleeting across the palate.
Brockway 13 Hour Imperial Stout;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brockway Chophouse;This draft brew from the brew pub on nitro tap poured a very small sized head of foamy finely sized light brown colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a semi-opaque except around the edges no visible carbonation dark ruby red brown colored body and an excellent lacing. The aroma was toasted malt. The smooth flat mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start mediumly tingly at the finish with a biting malty aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of roasted malt dark malt and coffee. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Brockway 13 Hour Imperial Stout;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brockway Chophouse;On tap at Brockway, nitro pour. Poured a slightly-hazy, very deep brown with an extremely well-retained yellowy-beige head. The aroma was muted by the nitro treatment, but still carried significant weight... toasted brown sugar, deeply-roasted dark chocolate, and some molassess in there... definitely carried some power behind it. The flavor was of deeply-roasted dark chocolate at the base.. coffee bitterness resonating outward with a rising booze factor.. heavy roasted dark chocolate again at the finish with a moderate bitterness and warmth. Smooth fore with building booze and bitterness toward the back.. very nice progression. Tasty brew!
Piece Tweedledee;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Sampled spring 2007. Clear amber body, big fluffy white head. Bright citrus aroma with caramelly undertones. Very dried-out flavor - plummy crystal malt base with orange flesh and floral fops on top - good flavor hopping. Not much to the mouthfeel but it compliments the dry flavor. A solid dry IPA.
Piece Tweedledee;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;tap at the repeal prohibition festival at Schalfly. bright orange with a soapy big off-white head. big floral nose with alot of green hop aromatics. light spicyness as well which was pleasant. i dig the nose here. Apollo hops are what they used here and im not that familiar with the strain. its pretty good and tasty. flavors of orange, green hops, resin, lite pine, spice, and some decent citric notes. lots of tropical notes on the finish-nice! i dont call this an ipa, but whatever it is, its a tasty hoppy ale.
Piece Tweedledee;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Sampled at Schlafly’s Repeal of Prohibition Fest along with Beerdrenched. Pours copper with a thick beige head. The aroma has fresh hops that are citric and tropical. Medium body with a good amount of soft carbonation. The flavor starts with lots of hops that are fairly tropical, musty and pineapple and a bit overly musty. The finish was along the same lines. A nicely done IPA.
Piece Tweedledee;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;"From the tap, sampled at the Schlafly ""Repeal Of Prohibition"" festival, Apollo hops, golden hued orange, grainy caramel, citric, juicy, smooth bitterness, easy drinkability, very in keeping with the APA style, I personally preferred this to Tweedledum. The representives and the program info list this as APA. (06/07, I was just at the Piece brewpub and this is listed as an APA."
Piece Tweedledee;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;"(draught at Schlafly Repeal of Prohibition Festival) one of the ""twin"" APAs (not IPAs) - Tweedledee has Apollo hops. Nice amber with off white head. Hops aroma. Flavor is citrus hops. Nice APA."
Piece Tweedledee;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;"On tap at the brewpub. This is one of two ""twin"" IPA’s that Piece is using to experiment with a couple of new hop varieties. The other will, surprisingly, be called Tweedledum. They have the exact same malt bill, but each uses one of these new hops. The body was hazy medium copper with a light kahki colored head. The aroma was strong grapefruit with hints of almonds. The taste was medium grapefruit with some breadcrust and walnuts. A nice citrusy hop in this one."
Roots Organic East Side Abbey Belgian Dubbel;Portland, Oregon, United States;Dubbel;Roots Organic Brewing;Not sure why the bartender and brewer are calling this a abbey dubbel. Tastes more like an normal Northwest amber ale. Hoppy all through without any distinctive belgian spice. I was really disapointed, I was looking for a nice Belgian style dubbel and ended up with a amber. Pours copper with a white head. Citrus floral hops in the aroma over a caramel malt base. Lacks any yeasty character and doesn’t have enough carbonation to liven up the palate. Even as an amber this would be subpar for Roots.
Roots Organic Wee Heavy;Portland, Oregon, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Roots Organic Brewing;2006 Reserve on tap at Roots Organic Brewing 12/21/07--Poured a deep dark mahogany-brown with a light tan-gray head. Nose of caramel malts and dark fruits. This beer aged quite nicely. Sweet alcohol finish buried in buttloads of hops. Very nice.
Roots Organic Wee Heavy;Portland, Oregon, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Roots Organic Brewing;On cask handpump system thingy. I’ll tell you, there’s nothing I hate more than cask handpumps that aren’t fresh, and I mean, tap it that day and sell it before sunrise. Too often a potentially great beer is ruined by these. This might be one. Pours dark mahogany with a soft bubbly khaki head. Nose of oxidation and caramel. Tastes like oxidation and faint hints of fruit and caramel. But this beer just tasted old and stale. Very watery on the palate and bitter in the finish. The alcohol couldn’t be detected, which was good, so I have hops that when they put this back on draught it might be a really nice beer. Leave the cask pumps to the Horse Brass, stick with your normal draught system.

Independence Cream Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Cream Ale;Independence Brew Pub;Sampled this one on draught at the brewpub in Philadelphia, PA. Brewed with corn sugar, I like the fact that Independence did a cream ale, and this beer is a good example of one. This beer pours to a bright, golden color, with a tall, white head, and a good bit of carbonation. Aromas of pale malt, and light hop aromas flood the nose. The palate is firm, with some good pale malt flavor, paried with some corn sweetness, and a touch of sourness. This beer finishes with more pale malt flavor up front with a touch of corn sweetness, and then ends slightly sour and refreshing. Very drinkable, enjoyable beer. I would enjoy drinking a few of these at the bar. Independence beers might not be the most exciting I have tasted, but this is a solid brewpub, with good beer, and worth a stop if you find yourself in City Center, Philadelphia.
Independence Cream Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Cream Ale;Independence Brew Pub;Indy’s Cream Ale had a chalky and spiced flavors (possibly from the hops). Not many breweries even attempt a Cream Ale so I’ll give Independence props for adding it to the line-up.

Olde Hickory Bison Bock;Hickory, North Carolina, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Olde Hickory Brewery;Draught during my NC brew tour. Pours a copper color with a fair white head. The aroma is sweet and very fruity with hints of banana bread, though no serious spiced character is here. The flavor is pretty sugary with more flavors of banana while the alcohol warms my nasal passages. The finish brings out some more wooden flavor like oak and apple peels. This is a fairly solid brew, just a touch on the sweet side with a modicum of artificialness.

Mash Brewing Bull Stout;Perth, Australia;Stout;Mash Brewing;"Near black pour with a thin tan head which quickly fades. Roasty, smoky, liquorice and dark chocolate aroma. Taste is dry, cocoa, liquorice, bitter roasty finish; seems a little thin but not bad. ** This may be a reissue of Mash Red Bull Stout (last rated 2007) - description and ABV are the same; site admins have been contacted to alias it"
Mash Brewing Bull Stout;Perth, Australia;Stout;Mash Brewing;From draught at the brewhouse. Loose fluffed, inch thick pad of tan atop a black as night body yielding just a little deep, brownish ruby on the extremities of the glass. Nitro-charged, unsure, but I guess there is a little inert gas in the mix as the head sustains and legs well, creamy as it looks. Minimal, rough, rusted car body and prominent burnt wood, damp ash nose. It prickles the tongue, certainly, served up way too cold and it is fizzy to digress from the premature ’nitro’ judged palate. Body ever so slowly develops, but starts off really light. Smoky, black patent hits in quick, some Cottee’s ™ chocolate syrup mid-palate and some rough woody notes. Bitter, coffee bean swallow, subtly astringent with lingering notes of oyster sauce and more of ol’ Cottee’s™. It doesn’t quite come together honestly, the oyster sauce turns into a full on broth by the end of the pint, the burnt malts fade. Oddly, it went down with considerable ease, but it sadly didn’t hit any of the right buttons. A half-way there Stout.
Mash Brewing Bull Stout;Perth, Australia;Stout;Mash Brewing;Appearance looks good, tastes alright with some burnt notes but not much bitterness, some notes of cocoa and vegemite.
Stadin Celebration Ale;Helsinki, Finland;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stadin Panimo;(Draught at Gallows Bird Kekri’09) Poured dirty dark brown and cloudy with small white head.

Stadin Celebration Ale;Helsinki, Finland;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stadin Panimo;2010 Recipe, again different from previous years’ - brewed by Tom Skog apparently Keg (Villi Waino, Helsinki) 7 big roasty arome 4 very dark murky brown, small keggy head. 7 Retronasals packed full Massive roastly body and huge bitter hop bite. some juniper and pine. 4 crisp carbonation. very full palate, but not sticky, maybe oily. tangy bitter and piney finish 15 Yes, oh, yes, this has nailed the big beer formula very well. Perhaps too big for my tastes, but not flawed in any way. According to the Gallows Bird tasting notes, this seems to have been brewed to celebrate the brewery’s anniversary, rather than the HBF anniversary, which was was the 2007 celebration ale was for. Also, it seems a slightly different recipe. Draught (Gallows Bird, Espoo, Kekri2009) Raw hoppy aroma - green hops. Murky red. Crisp tingly carbonation. Quite a homebrewy taste. Retronasals are green hops and green apples - very bold. Taste shadowed by the retronasals to be honest, as after that it’s quite a simple beer. Finish is more green apples. Earlier Rating: 6/10/2007 Total Score: 3.7 Draught (Helsinki Beer Festival 2007, Helsinki). Smells sweet and chocolatey, reminiscent of Young’s perhaps. Full bitter taste, sharp and crisp, slightly sticky. Long long bitterness, very tasty.
Stadin Celebration Ale;Helsinki, Finland;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stadin Panimo;Draught at Helsinki Beer Festival 2007. Dark reddish amber color with thick creamy head. Strong but dull, grassy and plastic hop aroma and flavor containing notes of mango and apricot. Notes of fruity esters, marmelade and yeast also. Dumping loads of hops into fermenter does not necessarily make a great beer.
Stadin Celebration Ale;Helsinki, Finland;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stadin Panimo;Big lasting head, deep red slightly hazy color. Big, hoppy, sweet, yeasty aroma. Very nice. Extremely bitter, harsh flavor. Need more maltiness. Good, but could’ve been phenominal.

Riverside Squirrelly Girl Nut Brown Ale;West Bend, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Riverside Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at Riverside Brewpub. Brown with next to no head. Aroma of toffee, nuts and mild hops. Taste is nutty and caramelly with toasted malts and a nutty finish. Amongst the myriad of mediocrity at Riverside, this one strives to be King Champion like Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything.
Riverside Squirrelly Girl Nut Brown Ale;West Bend, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Riverside Brewery & Restaurant;Pours too light for a brown ale. Lacks in aroma. Overwhelming hazelnut syrup flavor and lacking the bitterness to match.

Transparent mahogany, light brown lacings around glass. Little actual head save for murky web on top of beer in glass. Slight nutty aroma. Flavor was as malty as one would expect a brown ale to be, good roasty taste. More of an English style brown than an American brown, I can’t complain about this one. Definitely one of their better Brewmaster’s Choice ales lately.

Birra del Borgo ImperiAle;Borgorose (RI), Italy;Flavored - Other;Birra del Borgo (AB InBev);Premetto che sembra una stout, e dico anche che non ha quel sapore/odore metallico riscontrato in altre birre del birrificio del borgo! Detto questo non riesco proprio a capire perche ha un rating cosi’ basso e perche a molti sembra non piacere. Appena stappata si viene investiti da aromi di cioccolaro e noci, versata risultadi un bel colore scuro cioccolatoso, abbastanza densa e secca con una schiuma appena velata sulla supefice! Il sapore e’ secco di cioccolato e fave una punta di liquerizia, leggere noci e altro, molto complessa a mio avviso! Retrogusto delicato e persistente. Una cosa che mi ha lasciato favorevolmente colpito, e’ il fatto che i suoi 9,8% gradi non si sentono, ATENZIONE! Davvero molto molto buona!

Oksydert aroma og smak, men det var heller ikke annet å vente, ettersom denne flaske var fra 2009. Litt svisker og hint av citrus. Ikke udrikkelig, men dette var mest for kurositetens skyld.

Biržų 1686 Jubiliejinis Alus;Biržai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Biržų Alus;"Ett öl som enligt produktbeskrivningen har ""mognat i gamla kalla källare"". Tanken är väl att det ska alstra bilder av medeltida källarvalv, belägna utanför tiden, åtkomliga via spiraltrappor i ens fantasi, fläckvist upplysta av stormlyktor kring vilka skuggorna trängs i huttrande hoper. Det är en förhoppning som bäst beskrivs som fåfäng. Smakerna får en snarast att visualisera en källare i ett eftersatt bostadsområde, i vilken gamla damtrallor har tippat över dammiga flyttkartonger och pinaler som vittnar om avlägsna tider då livet faktiskt betydde något. Det här ölet är socialrealism som inte lämnar ens en marginal över för vackra illusioner."

Sigtuna Holiday Booster (Easter Edition -2008);Arlandastad, Sweden;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Sigtuna Brygghus;50 cL bottle. Pours clear and golden deep orange with a huge light and head. Mild yeasty and spiced aroma. Light caramel note and somewhat fruity acidic. Sweet fruity flavoured. Mild spiced and dense malty. Light acidic into a mild fruity finish. Has alight off-note and this could be a mild infection.
Sigtuna Holiday Booster (Easter Edition -2008);Arlandastad, Sweden;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Sigtuna Brygghus;Bottle, Stockholm, Sweden. Great appearence, a light orange with a full, creamy, lasting head of foam. Awfully aromatic, but not the nicest aromas, maybe some fruits, leather, polish and plastic. Flavor has a harshness that I don’t like, a lack of finesse. Sour fruits, light fruits, some sweetness and a bit of harsh alcohol on the finish. Not the best beer.
Sigtuna Holiday Booster (Easter Edition -2008);Arlandastad, Sweden;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Sigtuna Brygghus;Bottled (BB 09/2007) Hazy orange color, big cloudy off-white head, lace.

Sigtuna Holiday Booster (Easter Edition -2008);Arlandastad, Sweden;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Sigtuna Brygghus;A huge white foamy and active head covers the cloudy golden body. Serious lacing maintains its position over the liquid. Fairly yeasty, in a spicy way. Its soft malts procure gentle honey notes that match the floral flavours in unisson. More than fair alcohol accompanies the drinker, but an almost wheaty, very soft acidity compensate the loss in drinkability aptly. Phenolic and growingly bitter finish (leafy, floral), though still grainy a plenty. Almost excessive carbonation bites the tongue, but fits better a beer of that type than most,
Sigtuna Holiday Booster (Easter Edition -2008);Arlandastad, Sweden;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Sigtuna Brygghus;Bottled. A hazy orange beer with a lazing white head. The aroma is sweet and very spicy - especially coriander. The flavor is also sweet and very malty and with a more complex but still strong note of spices, leading to a dry spicy finish.
Sigtuna Holiday Booster (Easter Edition -2008);Arlandastad, Sweden;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Sigtuna Brygghus;Bottle. [thank you, omhper!] Pours a hazy yellow-golden with a fine staying medium and very creamy white head. It leaves lots of lacing. Aroma has oranges, lemons and weak caramel malts as well as a woody pine edge. Flavour is sourish but there is a wonderful creaminess to it! Oranges, barn, pineapple, pine-like bitterness. A little tart and sharp, but otherwise very nice.

Three Floyds Archangel MaiBock;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery Dark Lord Weekend. Clear gold body that supports a firm off-white head. Big malt nose that follows it up with clean malt flavors that are delivered lightly and smoothly. Hides it alcohol well. Well done.
Three Floyds Archangel MaiBock;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at 3F’s. A light amber pour with no head or lace. A dry aroma of light malt. A flavor of malt slightly sweet and conservatively bittered which makes it a real pleasure to drink. A bit fizzy and a tad light on the palate. The carbonation took a little away from this brew but does not keep it from being very good.
Three Floyds Archangel MaiBock;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"Draught. At the brewpub. Clear amber with a small white diminishing head. Middling light roast malt aroma, cereal grain richness, mild apricot and floral hops. Tasted followed the aroma, some interesting and unexpected salty green olive tartness mixed in, otherwise it seemed pretty appropriate to the style and I liked it. Light, slick body, only mild carbonation, with a hint of astringency and a fairly quick finish. My notes say ""very good Maibock"" and I they compliment TF on another keep-the-hops-in-check brew."
Three Floyds Archangel MaiBock;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. The menu has it at 7% abv, and I can pretty much feel every bit of it. Alcohol taste is not a usual component of a light bock, but there it is. Dark caramel color, letting through a little bar lighting. Taste is thick with caramel, but the texture is a little thinner than you’d want from that color.
Three Floyds Archangel MaiBock;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at 3F prewpub. Nothing particularly interesting or unique about this maibock. A little darker in color the typical maibock-- Spaten, etc. Didn’t taste quite as sweet on the palate as other examples either. Clean tasting, but nothing worth writing home about.
Three Floyds Archangel MaiBock;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the Three Floyds Brewpub. Deep orange pour with a small somewhat lasting head. Smells of sweet citrus and malts with a bit of hops. Light to medium body, very smooth. Worth a try, but not their best effort.
Three Floyds Archangel MaiBock;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Hmmm... I wonder why this is listed as a European Strong Lager? Sure looks like a Heller Bock, a brownish orange body with a substantial off-white head. The aroma is light, some sweet malts with a touch of caramel. Same with the flavor with the addition of some earthy, herbal bitterness to cut the sweetness. A bit watery, but quite quaffable. Three Floyds Brewing Company and Brewpub, Munster, IN
Three Floyds Archangel MaiBock;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Very light aroma of malts. Dark golden brown body. Medium palate. Caramel sweetness up front with a nice hint of alcohol. Good flavor.
Three Floyds Decepticon I.P.A.;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;A: Nice golden yellow color. Lots of bubbles and a little lacing left behind. S: Not much here. Very faint aroma. If I breathe in deeply I can detect a slight grapefruit aroma. T: If I had to rate it I would call it a distant cousin to Dreadnaught. It is not as forward or flavorful as Dreadnaught. But, it could pass as its half cousin. There is a little bit of grapefruit hops with a nice malty sweetness. I realize not all their beers can taste the same but 3 Floyd’s is known for big bold beers. This one is not that. M: Medium bodied beer, but very drinkable
Three Floyds Decepticon I.P.A.;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Notes from Dark Lord Day ’07. On tap at the brewpub. Hazy light golden with a 1/2 finger off-white head. There was some slight skunk that I picked up on, however I didn’t feel that this was bad. Pine, grass, hay and some herbal grapefruit are the hops to the biscuity malts. Flavor is much the same with a little more biscuity malts. Moderate bitterness in the finish. Medium body with low to moderate carbonation. Very good IPA, but not really like most others that I’ve had.

It was drier than most Three Floyd’s beers as it did not show much malt at all. While less IBU’s than the Dreadnaught (~75 vs. 100) it appeared more bitter and hoppy. Overall, a very nice beer though somewhat similar to many other top notch IPA’s.
Three Floyds Decepticon I.P.A.;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Yeah. Why not? It’s there when Dread Naught isn’t. A bit crisper than the Stone version, and less violently bitter than the AleSmith rendition. But mostly: why not?

Three Floyds Decepticon I.P.A.;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"On draft at the 3F brewpub. Poured an orange-gold with smallish white head. Aroma was not overly powerful, with citrus and floral elements. Pretty strong hop presence; but a decent malt backbone. Did not find it overly one dimensional, but not overly complex.

Not the best that I have sampled in Munster but that is a tough standard to live up to.
Three Floyds Decepticon I.P.A.;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a very hazy dark orange colored body. The mild aroma was hoppy and floral. The mouth feel was ""Oh My God! What an initial hop rush!"" very strongly tingly at the start and at the finish with a biting hoppy aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of malt hops and strong floral hop pineyness in a deep malt base. A wonderful best in class brew."

Poured clear, healthy medium brown with a swirly dusting of tan head. The aroma picked up a lovely blend of aged caramel, moderately-roasted espresso, chocolate, and earthy notes.. intermittent wafts of brown sugar and vanilla.. excellent! The flavor opened with lightly sour, blacker malts with charred espresso and caramel rolling in shortly afterward.. coffee bitterness played well with earthy bitters on the edges.. finished dry and a bit grainy with a warm impression. Medium-bodied with low carbonation that moved it well across the palate.. lengthy, memorable finish. I really dug this one.

Poured a clear dark cola brown into the glass with a whispy 2 finger off white cap. Aromas of toasty malts, bready, nutty and some dried fruit. Medium body, smooth bready drinkable charcater, silky mouth feel. Up front a wonderful chew on a thick mixture of toasty Munich and Vienna malts..nuts, sweet dough, toast..wunerbar! This mellows midpalate as the Hallertauer, Tettnanger and Perle hops lightly balance and provide a woody-herbal tone to the complex maltiness and leads into the finish which is wet, lightly sweet ( but not cloying), bready with nice herbal under tones and a bittering after taste...a very well constucted Dunkler Bock in the Bavarian fashon...spring is just as good as a time to quaff this dark Germanic elixer.

Canaan Pale Ale;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Canaan Brewery;"Bottle from a Jerusalem convenience store. Pours brown and very cloudy with a medium-light tan head. Aroma is ""beery"" sweet with some wine-like hints. If only the flavor followed through! Watery, very sweet, no bitterness to speak of, some yeastyness, and a very strange sour note, with a bread-like aftertaste. That sour taste was not very nice, poured the bottle out after about 2/3s of it. I guess Israel just isn’t a beer country:("
Canaan Pale Ale;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Canaan Brewery;"Re-rate 10/9/07: (Note: this beer is obviously very infected, but I’m rating it anyway, since I’ve heard a lot of fellow Israeli beer lovers who said their bottles of Canaan shared such infected ""qualities"" to some extent or another) Bottle. Cloudy amber with a medium off white head. Aroma with a bit of malt and a bit of spices, but mostly a really bad smell that I actually don’t really know how to define, but indicates something’s gone very wrong with this beer. Flavor has a tiny bit of malt sweetness in the beginning, and very quicly turns into, rotten, sour, infected yeast - YUCK. Medium-bodied (I had to struggle to take another sip to detect body). Disgusting. This is obviously a very different beer than the batch I had last time. 3/3/2/2/4=1.4 Bottle. Brown-red color with a medium off-white head. Nice aroma of malt, caramal, maybe some notes of dark fruits. Flavor is sweet - malt, caramel, alcohol, a bit of sourness. Medium-bodied, lots of carbonation (a bit too much). 7/4/6/3/13=3.3"

Flavour is fresh with a good very present fruity piney hoppiness, citrus, caramel and malt. Pleasant indeeed!
Ise Kadoya Pale Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ise Kadoya;Bottle @ Beer Bar Miyama 162, Kyoto. Pours orange with a white head. Aromas and flavours orange, peach, malt and caramel. Soft texture, fruity finish.
Ise Kadoya Pale Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ise Kadoya;"330 ml bottle bought at CitySuper in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui. Translucent amber golden colour with a very faint trace of yeast sediments; Half finger head with soapy off-white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Excellent sticky lacing with active carbonation; Very fragrant aroma of Ale malt, with strong orange, moderate candied fruits, light marmalade, light peaches, passion fruits, honey, strong floral, fructose, strong spice, pine, light resin, dough, lemon peels and strong fresh grass; Close to light sweet taste of moderate Ale malt, with grapefruits, very light caramel, floral, molasses notes, light pine, spices, earth, dry biscuits, lemon, mid to strong bitter hops and sharp grass; Close to medium body. Dry and slightly slick palate; Mouth feel is moderate Ale maltyness in a fairly solid background. Strong carbo and a bit poppy. Moderate, monotone grapefruit, with light caramel. Very flowery with low sweetness. Earthy spicy, biscuity with quite strong lemon to round. Simple but solid!... Hoppiness is strong orange, candied fruits, light marmalade, peaches, passion fruits, strong floral, strong spice, pine, light resin, lemon peels and fresh grass in nose. Grapefruits, floral, light pine, spices, earth, lemon and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness is fairly strong for a lasting, mid to high-astringent grassy malty finish. Dry after taste. Earthy grassy and quite bitter to mouth. Comments: Compare to Golden Dragon session pale ale, this one’s hoppiness is a lot more confident and assertive in Cascade citrus and perhaps Challenger’s jammy characters. Taste is more or less on par with most APA but has a better malty body and strong carbo to back it up. All in all an enjoyable APA, if not spectecular. Get it if it’s not expensive."
Ise Kadoya Pale Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ise Kadoya;Draught at TBE. Quite fruity with a juicy mouthfeel, orange and grape, light malt base, gentle hoppy finish. Better than I remember, very fruity and drinkable which tends to be how locals like their pale ales.
Ise Kadoya Pale Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ise Kadoya;On tap at CBM Jimbocho 2014. Hazy golden orange with a medium-sized off-white head.

Ise Kadoya Pale Ale;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ise Kadoya;On tap at the Craft Beer Picnic. A lovely copper gold with a filmy white head & a luscious juicy citrus & pine c-hop bouquet. The sharp tongue scraping carbonation I except from hoppy beers but the body is a bit light. The taste is ok but not as nice as the nose: earthy pine and light citrus. A solid though uninspiring pale ale. ----On tap at Brick Lane Mar. 2015---- Ise kadoya pale ale deep gold huge nose of pine with light fruit great soft body. The taste is prickly hop bitterness with good sweetness to it. Well balanced.

Rock Bottom Bellevue OA Sour Stout;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Rock Bottom Bellevue;"My server described the beer as a ""Bourbon Cherry Stout"" but I didn’t pick up anything in the way of bourbon or cherry. And it’s not particularly sour. It tastes like the oaked version of their oatmeal stout. I picked up plenty of oak that may have come from a bourbon barrel, but the bourbon was long gone. Pours an opaque blackish brown with a thin tan head. Coffee aroma with a touch of chocolate and vanilla behind it. Medium body and light carbonation. Sweet taste of chocolate, roasted nuts, vanilla and smoke. Bittersweet espresso and oaky vanilla finish."
Bright Brewery Razor Witbier;Bright, Victoria, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bright Brewery;Pours cloudy gold with faint bouquet of bread, lemonade and hints of banana and ester. Upfront delicate citrus extends that lemonade. Some green apple and breadiness come mid palate and the finish delivers some hoppy bitterness that lasts a fair while.
Bright Brewery Razor Witbier;Bright, Victoria, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bright Brewery;0,31l on tap, shared with wiosna @ The Local Taphouse. Pours hazy yellow with a medium head. Aroma is dry malts, citrus, wheat, coriander. Flavor is dry malts, citrus, wheat, coriander, hops. Quite tasty.
Bright Brewery Razor Witbier;Bright, Victoria, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bright Brewery;From bottle in Belgian ale glass. Pours a beautifully clear gold with wispy white head that faded quickly. Bready aroma with hints of clove, fairly tasty and a bit fizzy on the palate.
Bright Brewery Razor Witbier;Bright, Victoria, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bright Brewery;Mellow wheat aroma, light citrus and herbs, has a hazy light yellow appearance, with a large white head, tangy finish feeling earthy, I found it to be crisp and refreshing.

Bright Brewery Razor Witbier;Bright, Victoria, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bright Brewery;Bottle- Pours a hazy light golden color with a decent head that fades to some lacing. Mild aroma of hops, with some grain and bit of malt sweetness. Taste is a bit crisp with a mild malt sweetness and some grian. There is a mild bitterness and a clean finish. Light body, crisp, smooth and refreshing. Decent balance. This is beer is not spcetacular, more middle of the road for the style. Good for a few.
Bright Brewery Razor Witbier;Bright, Victoria, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bright Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Nice and hoppy witbier. Aromas of coriander, grass, and citrus. Taste is sweet, with bitter notes, and long length. Palate is velvety, and medium bodied. Yellow, cloudy, with a frothy head.
Bright Brewery Razor Witbier;Bright, Victoria, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bright Brewery;Hazy orange with a large white head. Aroma of oranges and lemons, lemon delicious, coriander seed. Taste has sharp lemon - almost like a squeeze of juice, very light wheat sourness and a little grain sweetness. I’ve had this before (IIRC I bought some from the brewery) and it was nowhere near this good. I guess this is a really fresh one.
La Mare au Diable Beauvoir;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;La Mare au Diable;Enjoyed on tap at the brewub. Funky yeasty aromas and taste, a little wild. Peachy colour, some lace. Fresh and drinkable though not representative of the style.More yeasty than anything else, some spiciness in secondary. Some sweetness.A tad above average mouthfeel.

Hill Island Griffins Ruby Red;Durham, Durham, England;Red Ale - Irish;Hill Island Microbrewery;"Cask at the Hobgoblin, Reading. Reddish chestnut with a beige head; a slightly sour aroma; very much like a dry stout when first tasted, but developing cimplex fruity flavours, leading to a dry, smoky, licorice finish."
Twin Ports Simtennial Pale Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Amber Color witih White Head. Dry Hopped Aroma. Light Malted Foundation. Fair Amount of Hops Dominantly Flavoring This Brew. Nice Amount of Carbonation. Light Dry Aftertaste. Overall a Very Simple but Quite Drinkable Summer Pale Ale.
Great Waters Tipple and Tarrey Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;Fresh Growler: Dense amber color. Very slim cap of off white quickly slips to nothing and very little lace in which to speak of. Nice aroma of rounded and soft red malt breadyness and a scotch-like sweetness floating on top. Has nice little hints of chocolate and toasted malts as well with a bit cherry. Flavors are a bit short lived and weak-ended with a simple delicate tone of malty sweetness that carries some fruityness of cherry, fig, and dark berries. Has a light backing of breadyness thrown in with a bit of nuttyness. Slightly sticky return in the finish with a malty wall of jelly filling kinda lingering along with a slightly toasted edge. Feel is clean and quick, a bit shy, if not more so, of a medium body with a low carbonation and a mostly malty sense of application being rendered. A simple and delicate beer thats OK to have one or two of. A bit on the boring side and probably one of least favorite/likeable beers to have been brewed at GW.
Great Waters Tipple and Tarrey Irish Red;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Waters Brewing;Cloudy Brown with Orange Hue and Sandy Bubbly Head. Subtle Dry Malt Aroma. Light Bodied Ale..Smooth with a Clean Malty Taste...Continuously Dry on the Palate..bit of Wheat on the Aftertaste..Some Notes of Grainy Dry Malt Througout.
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;On Cask at the Brewpub: Big orangey browned color with a hefty head of lightly tanned frothy thick foam on top. Keeps a good amount always present. Lots of lacing in big patchy sheeting and broad strings. Aroma is biscuity dry with a piney resin and slight lemony/grapefruity tug of pithy bitterness which grows intensely as it sits. Taste is bit strange, mainly due the Golden Promise malts that are used well beyond their means. The balance isn’t what I’d like to see out of an IPA. Dry, biscuity flavors abound, crystal and pale maltyness also seems overly evident. Woody, cardboard acsents grow as it sits and don’t develop to help the balance. Hop wise, its pretty beefy and dry, but seems hard to get much profile as it fights with the dry malt too much. The cardboardish flavors didn’t help either. Kinda leans more like a bigger version of an English ESB or pale than anything. Again, the dryness mixing with the semi high sweet promise malting, fevered hop bite, and cardboardish chalkishness surmount to a weird messy tone of dryness and strange bitterness. Body is medium and broadly dry with a grainy creamy centered froth of smashed up cereal and warm thick ice cream. I had a hard time with this one. Something about the flavors did not sit well with me. Balance wasn’t there either. A strange IPA at best.
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Like many of the GW brews i have had ,its pretty good stuff, just not great. Good hop flavor, but not as much as i would like for an IPA, not the best on cask either
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Amber, light head. Flavor a bit thin, plenty of hops in nose but not much flavor going on, pretty weak stuff.
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;On cask. copper color with floral hop with a bit of bitterness in the flavor. There is some bitterness there, but not the hop flavor. Not bad.
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;I am spoiled by the Masala Mama on cask. Having said that, this is a nice subdued sipper of an IPA. Flowery hop and decent body.
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Served at the brewpub via cask. I’m starting to think that cask is just not meant for IPA. The hops become too subdued. I just prefer cask beers to be maltier, like a nice porter or stout, IPA or Pale Ale, not so much. Not bad, but I think i’d prefer the non cask version of this.
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Copper color with a thick head. Large orange aroma. Big, floral hop taste with a healthy dosage of orange and Cascade. A little malt sweetness. Incredibly smooth. Tasty!
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;From the growler shared at a Minnesota party. Promising hop aroma. Average hop profile. I really like GW’s cask ales--I think this brewpub is under-rated in Minnesota. This growler didn’t reflect the best of their cask properties, but it’s also a relatively tame, normal amber-hued IPA--coming from someone who is always critical of hoppy beers.
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Amber color. Very floral hop nose. Mellow hop body that let down after the nose. Not bad.
Great Waters Flying Circus Big Hop Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Like so many Great Waters beers, they get really close. This beer has an excellent, full hop aroma, very floral and some herbs. Sadly the flavor is very light, and quite the disappointment after the great aroma. The flavor is of hops and light bitterness. One of their better beers.
Great Waters 10th Anniversary Uber Maibock;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Waters Brewing;Fresh growler: Big time smeared pineapple yellow color and a soft glow within. Soft, delicate topping of whitish foam dawns for a brief stay eventually slipping to an always present collar ring. Lacing is minimal in a few spots. A heavy dripping drape sits on one side and a slight glare of oily residue covers all. Aroma is murky and malty with a broad yet dullish spice of old hops, old pear fruit, and a sweet delicate earthyness. Taste is immaculately balanced and easy to down in a hurry. Very nice dulled, paled sweetness of old citrus and some solid fruitishness and breadyness. Kinda like old pear and mango with a slight tone of wheat germ and the said breadyness of dough. Has a superbly placed hop note at the finish with a creative spicyness that eludes to earthy touches of dull grass and herb. Twist in more left over malts and hearty breadish sweetness and you’ve got a winner in a quick tasty treat the lasts on the palate and endures that want of more. Body isn’t as heavy as some of the bigger bodied, malt laden Maibocks out there. Its smoothness and quick to please attitude is its only real set back for the style. Other then that, this sucker is a real treat. The balance is nice, the taste is good, and with its lighter body and nicely rounded overall tone, this stuff floats right down. This growler won’t last the night. Already through three glasses...
Great Waters 10th Anniversary Uber Maibock;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Waters Brewing;Brewed to Celebrate Great Water’s 10th Anniversary. Cloudy Orange Color with White Head. Very Subtle Sweet Malt Aroma. Very Crisp Tasting...With a Bit of Heavy Mouthfeel to it. Caramel and Bitter Toasted Notes. Clean, and Lightly Dry Aftertaste. Bit Drying on the Palate Overall. Afterthoughts of Citrus.
Dubhlinn Paddy Flynn Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Dubh Linn Irish Brew Pub;Very tame coffee and chocolate roast scents, taste is similar with a lingering chocolate taste, preferred theirs over Carmody’s.
Dubhlinn Paddy Flynn Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Dubh Linn Irish Brew Pub;Sampled on draught at the Dubh-Linn Irish pub in downtown Duluth, MN. Pours a clear dark cola brown brew with a thin tan head that slowly dissolves and leaves behind a good sticky lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, some flowery hops and a little bit of sunflower seeds. Taste is smooth, creamy, medium to full bodied, no carbonation with a distinct dark toasted malt flavor. Finish is smooth slightly watery with a more dark malt flavor with little flowery hop character.
Dubhlinn Paddy Flynn Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Dubh Linn Irish Brew Pub;Contract Brew for the Dubhlinn Irish Pub. Black Color with Tan Head. Malted, Roast and Hickory Aroma. Clean Malted Taste..Light Malts and Bitter Roast Notes...Bitter Aftertaste. Overall a Thin Moutfheel. Nice Session Stout.
Fitgers Hombre Pepper Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;Those Fitgers Boys are Loco!! Gold Color with White Head. Hot Peppers Aroma. ALOT of Peppers Make up the Just Bearable Palate of this Beer. Actually Smells/Tastes Like a Good Hot Salsa Would. After the Initial Shock...The Pepper Flavor Starts to Seem Fairly Balanced and the Pepper Flavors are More Discernible. Becomes More Likeable the More You Drink, But Still a Beer You Dare Your Buds to Finish.
Red Star Quinners Irish Red;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Star Agave Grille;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a medium amber color with a small white head. The aroma was faint sweet malts. The flavor was tangy and lightly bitter with a not much else going one. No real hop presence. Rather bland overall.
Red Star Quinners Irish Red;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Red Star Agave Grille;Draught @ Red Star: This one pours a clear coppery color with a small off white head. The head drops off rather quickly. The aroma is a bit mild, but pleasant. Notes of floral, some grassiness, some malts and a hint of corn. This beer has a medium body. Has a touch of sweet malts to the taste, along with some fruitiness and maybe a hint of corn sweetness. Slightly dry finish. A good session beer.
Thirsty Pagan Double Weizenbock;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Cloudy Brown Color with No Head. Malty Sweet Aroma. Initially Carbonated and Very Sweet...Light Toasted Notes... Sweet Caramel Malt. Bittering Aftertaste. A Definite Attempt to Balance Out, but Not Quite There. Quite Drinkable...but a Session Version of the Style.
Growlers Belgian Blonde;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Growlers;Clear light amber body with off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, orange peel, floral. Taste is moderately sweet, orange peel, coriander, somewhat dry finish. Sticky medium-full body.
Growlers Belgian Blonde;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Growlers;Draft at the brewery. Clear bright orange with a white head. Everyone working at Growlers told me this was the best beer available, that it was ’smooth’ and ’sweet’ and whatever. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this beer tasted like licorice and cajun spices. It’s disgusting... sweet licorice and rum and black pepper and some sort of hot pepper? Gross. I have no idea what’s going on in this beer.
Growlers Craigs Espresso Stout;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Growlers;"Finally something that wasn’t infected or weird. Although it sure looks weird, looks like diluted chocolate milk, light brown with too much light through the glass to really be a stout. The coffee nose is certainly spot on, it’s actually really nice smelling, and doesn’t taste too bad, only there’s no resemblance to a STOUT at all. This is more of a coffee ""beer"", with a slightly creamy flavor to the coffee."
John Harvards Cervesa del Diablo;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;"Cask sample at the Wayne location called""Cervesa del Diablo"". Jalapeno pepper aroma, spicey. Golden body with nice head. Flavor is sweet malt with the Peppers being in the back ground. Medium heat and left a nice palate. Not a beer I could drink a pint of but this wasn’t bad considering the style."
John Harvards Abbey Dubbel;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dubbel;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;My favorite of the night. Dark brown pour with white head. Nutty, sweet arouma, sweet toffee, roasted malts and very smooth. Finishes with a nice light hoppy kick. Well balanced. Mixed some with the espresso cream stout for an interested effect.
John Harvards Abbey Dubbel;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dubbel;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap. Seems to me much improved over past ratings. Aroma of sweet chocolate, dark fruits, nuts. Flavor of rich malt, sweet-tart-tangy fruits, earthiness. Tart tingly sensation left on the tongue. Very good.
John Harvards Abbey Dubbel;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dubbel;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at JH. Pours a clear amber with no real head. Aroma of roasted nuts. Flavor of peanuts, roasted malt, coffee. Based on previous ratings, it seems that they improved this one! A little roasty for a dubbel perhaps but tasty nonetheless. Palate is slightly thin. I liked this one.
John Harvards Abbey Dubbel;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dubbel;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Deep brown beer. Aroma is fairly rich and molasses-like with a soft plumminess. Aroma is toasty and lightly fruity with just a hint of spice. Lightly sweet and fruity with a soft herbal bitterness. As it warms a fairly phenolic band-aidy character really starts to come to the fore. Aroma is okay but something went wrong in the process.
John Harvards Abbey Dubbel;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dubbel;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;[rating moved 4-5-07] An honest effort, but lacking in pretty much ever respect - quite thin and bland - after drinking it for a while it starts to taste like nothing but alcohol and water - slight sweetness, with a very subdued malt presence - I won’t be trying this one again.
John Harvards Abbey Dubbel;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Dubbel;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Old rating moved (will update soon). This is a good attempt at an Abbey Dubbel but lacks depth. No head nice dark body but not enough taste and little body. Still worth a try if you are there though. 6/3/6/3/14 Re-rate: just had the latest batch of the Lake Grove Dubbel. I believe this is the newest brewer’s 2nd batch and its greatly improved. Soft dark bread malts, lightly sweet and very easy to drink.7/3/7/3/15
Occy's Stout;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Stout;Occy's Brewery;Tried this way back in late 2008. Well held, creamy tan head atop an almost bright, midnight brown body with very fine, very sparse carbonation. Mocha-macchiato coffee notes and Vegemite predominately on the nose with just a touch of leather and smoke. Has all the right gear in the mouth, it just doesn’t come together as I’d hoped. Medium bodied, rounded and smooth. Very smoky, with buttery notes and burnt caramel, sweet fudge and hints of stewed rhubarb. Long, smoky, burnt wood swallow, a little sugary mess resides, quite bitter and drawing. Really preferred the Brown over this one, but it’s still an easy drinker. Just above the norm! (On draught @ Occy’s brewery, Dunsborough)
Occy's Stout;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Stout;Occy's Brewery;Part of the tasting line up at the brewery, which is no longer Wildwood in Perth, but Occy’s Brewery in the Margaret River region. Very dark brown, thin brown head. Assertive coffee aroma. Flavours of coffee and burnt malt. Rather thin mouthfeel, but nowhere near as thin as the brown. Mildly bitter finish.
Occy's Stout;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Stout;Occy's Brewery;Tried on tap @ the newly located brewery called Occys Brewery. Black in body with light tan head, good stout characters in the taste. Vegemite, milky coffee and liquorice.
Phillips Dubbel Surly;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Dubbel;Phillips Brewing Co.;Quite a disappointing brew from Phillips, but I don’t like the blonde Surley much either. Way too sweet and cloying both in nose and palate. Not much in the looks department either, with nary a head to be found. Sticky palate.
Phillips Dubbel Surly;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Dubbel;Phillips Brewing Co.;Bottle: Rather clear red-cola color with a very light cap that does not last long. Faint nose: wisps of dark candi sugar, caramel malts...very faint. Flavor profile...seems a tad sweet with the Candi sugar and thin on malts, hops are non existant...the yeast does produce some nutty tastes that offset the smokey molasses but overal this is a kind of thin uneventful dubbel. If you were expecting Bernardus Pater you will miss the value of this ale...it is a very approachable dubble for people who are not really used to the Belgians styles ...kind of like Leffe...it serves a purpose as a gateway dubbel but that’s about all.
Phillips Dubbel Surly;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Dubbel;Phillips Brewing Co.;Darker mudy brown with no head. Sugary and syrupy flavour with minimal nose. Perhaps it was off but something didn’t seem right.
Phillips Dubbel Surly;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Dubbel;Phillips Brewing Co.;Bright reddish-brown colour...looks nice. Sort of a light aroma with vague caramel, molasses and spent grains. Thin, hollow and gutless nuts/caramel taste. Sweet, bland and poorly executed. Malt flavours are too thin and simplistic. This yeast is useless. Gets worse as the glass goes, too.
Phillips Dubbel Surly;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Dubbel;Phillips Brewing Co.;(660ml bottle) Purchased at the Strath in Victoria for $4.95. Deep ruby body with a creamy tan head. Nose of roasted coffee grounds and a minor egg aroma. Roasted malt mixed sour milk. One of my least favourite Phillips brews.
Phillips Dubbel Surly;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Dubbel;Phillips Brewing Co.;Malt forward aroma is quite sweet with caramel, brown sugar, some fruity esters and a hint of butterscotch. Clear ruby brown body is topped by a fizzy, tan head that diminishes rapidly to ring. Sweet caramel flavour with some fruity esters, doughy yeast and a hint of peat and dark malt bitterness at the finish. Medium light body with fizzy carbonation. Tulip glass. Cellar temperature. Bottle (Brewery Creek, Apr-07).
Phillips Dubbel Surly;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Dubbel;Phillips Brewing Co.;Brown with small beige head.Malt,alcohol & brown sugar nose and palate.Small plentiful bead, but still seems undercarbonated No detectable hops
Phillips Dubbel Surly;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Dubbel;Phillips Brewing Co.;Very faint, almost undetectable dark fruit/malt aroma. Pours a rich dark red with a few bubbles and no head, not even a ring or lace. Tastes like Dr. Pepper with some hops. Low carbonation, light body, light peppery/hoppy aftertaste. A passable dubbel, and after tasting their regular Surly (tripel) I’d have to say this is a step in the right direction, but we’re not quite there yet.
Steamin' Billy Billy's Last Bark;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Steamin' Billy;Cask@London Drinker 07. Sweet grainy malt notes and not much else. Empty mouthfeel, with only the grainy malt doing anything. I guess theres some light citric hops in the finish if you look hard.
Steamin' Billy Billy's Last Bark;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Steamin' Billy;Cask gravity at London Drinker BF 07. Pale gold colour with thin off whtie head. Hay/grassy hop aroma. Quite thin malts in mouth. Not wonderful. Dullish hop on end is grassy.
Steamin' Billy Billy's Last Bark;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Steamin' Billy;Gravity Cask @ London Drinker. Hoppy lemon nose. Watery hop and lemongrass taste. Bitter swallow, but not so bad on the scale of British ales. Quite mellow in comparison to other golden ales. Surely not a fitting tribute to poor Billy. Was he was a bad dog? Maybe it was made with his wee. Maybe he had some this and it killed him. Ok, that was out of order. Enough fun. RIP Billy.
Steamin' Billy Billy's Last Bark;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Steamin' Billy;Cask, Cow and Plough, Stoughton. Clear gold with a white head.

Viborg Påske Bocken;Viborg, Denmark;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Viborg Bryghus;Bottle. Pours clear amber with airy but stable off-white head. Clear aroma of malt and caramel with a pronounced dusty note, possibly due to the fact that the bottle is 2 years past the BBD. The note is present the flavour, too, which is otherwise agreaable, sweet with clear notes of malt and caramel. Warming alcohol presence. Dusty aftertaste. Not bad but needs re-rating.

John Harvards Blueberry Wheat;Washington DC, Washington DC, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvards Brewhouse Washington DC;(DC, served with blueberries in the glass) Hazy copper body tinged with purple, topped with an off-white head. Aroma and taste are medium sweet and blueberry, but in no way is the fruit overwhelming. Light body, some effervescence. Overall, pleasantly genuine, but not distinguished -- then again, what blueberry beer is?
John Harvards Blueberry Wheat;Washington DC, Washington DC, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvards Brewhouse Washington DC;DC - nice bluerry wheat. Very drinkable and not overly done. Nice and smooth with a good suble blueberry flavor. They even through in a few blueberrys at the end to add a slight purple color to the beer. Something i’d get again.
John Harvards American Brown Ale;Springfield, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Springfield;"On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Listed on the beer menu as ""James Brown Ale"". Had the regular and cask version. Poured a deep brown color with an averaged sized off white head (cask had a huge head). I’ll stop on the cask version here as I found it to smell and taste like buttered popcorn. The regular had aromas of nuts, light chocolate, and roast. Taste of chocolate, nuts, very light roast and caramel. Tasted on 9/7/2006 and moved over as part of the John Harvard ’clean up’."

John Harvards Cristal Pilsner;Springfield, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Springfield;Springfield, PA. I've never had the Budvar Cristal but this is exactly what I imagined it to be. A clean and refreshing, hoppy beer, med bodied with plenty of flavor. This beer's only downfall is an unpleasant bitterness in the aftertaste.
John Harvards Grand Cru;Springfield, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;John Harvards Brewhouse Springfield;Sampled @ the Springfield, PA location.

John Harvards Grand Cru;Springfield, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;John Harvards Brewhouse Springfield;Springfield... Poured a hazy copper color with a medium sized, off white head that left spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of yeast, dried fruits, clove, banana, and cherries, with light roastiness. Aroma was very dubbelish. Herbal taste of dark fruits, yeast and alcohol was barely noticed. Slick mouthfeel. Could have been more flavorful.
John Harvards Grand Cru;Springfield, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;John Harvards Brewhouse Springfield;Springfield, PA. Darkish copper colored, with no head - probably poured like that on purpose. Served inappropriately at about 40 deg F. This beer was cold. It tasted fine at that temp but I had to let it warm up for awhile. It was worth the wait, as a very interesting and complex character developed. Very phenolic and funky - with a strong ester of bubblegum. Also a little clove or some kind of spice. Strong but not overwhelming at all. Surpisingly easy to drink.

Polar Ice (China);Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Can @ Hong Kong. Very thin, metallic, sour and strangely flavoured. Not again.
Polar Ice (China);Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Drank from the can in a Hong Kong soccer park. San Miguel seems to import this from across the border, probably cheaper to brew it over there and throw in some lead to enhance the flavour! Aroma is all tin and malt, it’s yellow and the head was okay when I poured it onto the ground (more on that later). Flavour is water, piss, and corn - this will go out the same flavour and colour it will go in! Very weak mouthfeel. Half of this can was enough for me, and that was only because I was thirsty.
Polar Ice (China);Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Blue can. Ugly yellow. Really rank smelling concoction. What is that nasty sulfuric, metallic...ah rotten eggs. And chemicals. The palate is thin and slippery. Tastes only slightly better than it smells. Hard to imagine liking this one.
Polar Ice (China);Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Can, HK. Yellow and smelly. Sulphur, veggies, tomato and hot dog water on the nose. Watery palate, but with a taste that reminds me of Kraft Dinner with ketchup. What? I was five when I liked that shit. Expletive, expletive, expletive this beer is bad.
Polar Ice (China);Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou San Miguel Brewery Company;Canned (has apparently no connection to the Venezuelan brand) Pale yellow, minimal head. Sweetish, fruty and over carbonated. Swift flavour of rice, paper and vegetables followed by off flavours of sweat and glue. Lousy!

Shoreline Sesh Wheat Ale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Shoreline Brewery;tap at the brewery - Pours mostly clear light amber with a small white head. The aroma is of citrus and hops with some subtle wheat. The flavor initially made me think of a pale ale because of the moderately strong hops and slightly darker color than most wheat ales, but the different malt profile comes through with elements of wheat. Good quaff.
Shoreline Sesh Wheat Ale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Shoreline Brewery;On tap at Shoreline Brewery. Small white head with poor retention, transparent yellow body, very little carbonation observed, and excellent lacing. The aroma was hoppy, citrus and a hint of pine. The flavor was Amarillo hops, bitter, grapefruit, some maltiness, crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel was slightly tingly and this beer is medium bodied. A little too hoppy tastying for the style, but tasty nonetheless.

Shoreline Sesh Wheat Ale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Shoreline Brewery;Sampler poured draft at the brewpub (Michigan City, IN). Pours a nice darker golden hue, slight haze, with bright white moderate head that sticks around and laces. Aromas are nearly non existent, light citrus but no real malt distinguished. Initial is more lively, citrusy lemon and grassy hops greet florals and wheat malt delicateness which doesn’t quite stand up. Citrus stays on the palate, and flowers and bitterness in the finish. Nice flavors but lacks balance. A bit doughy on the backend but by then it is too late. Cheers.
Sacramento Double Shot;Sacramento, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Sacramento Brewing Company;Draft. Dark brownish beer with a nice cream colored head. Huge coffee aroma that overpowers anything else (supposed to be coffee and chocolate in the beer). Coffee/expresso flavor with a bit of other malts, but coffee dominating. Lingering coffee. Too much coffee. Body is lighter than expected and nothing comes close to matching the huge coffee aroma - everything else is a bit weak.

New Belgium Lips of Faith - Chad's Blackberry Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"22oz bottle filled from the tap at NBB. Another brew from the ""Lips of Faith"" or ""Pilgrimage"" series, it’s brewed with 40% Marion blackberries with an ale yeast in the primary, and finished with a champagne yeast. Pours fizzy and incredibly murky. Almost the color of beet juice. Dark maroon with shades of purple, and thoroughly opaque. No light able to pass through the goblet, even when held directly in front of a light bulb. Unlike any beer I’ve ever seen. The cola-like fizz of head dissapeared in a snap, only being able to catch a glimpse of purple bubbles. Aromatics are mainly fruit juice with a hint of tartness. The Marion berry smells a lot like raspberries but more pungent, for sure, and there is some black raspberry presence as well. Mouthfeel is much lighter than expected for such a turbid brew. Fairly crisp and surprisingly dry considering the level of fruitiness. The pallet is basically fermented fruit juice, with a slight bitterness to help balance. Loads of black and red raspberries again, with a slightly tart, warming quality. Finishes barely puckering at best, with lingering marion berries. This would be a great beer to barrel age with bugs."

Occy's Brown Ale;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Brown Ale;Occy's Brewery;Tried this back in late 2008. Ruby tinged, sparkling chestnut with a nice sized creamy off-white pad atop that produced some exceptional lace. Red woodchips, chocolate biscuits and marmite on the nose with inklings of rust, toffee and burnt toast. Pasty, smooth mouthfeel with a medium-light body. Cola and choc bikkies, ash and smoke fill the mouth. Woody and earthy in back before a dry, dusty cocoa and smoky wood swallow that lingers long. Sweet like a good Brown ale balanced to a ’T’ by drying malt and hop. Rather refreshing and at 4.2% it could easily have been a bomber of a session ale! (On draught @ Occy’s brewery, Dunsborough)

This was very enjoyable.
Redstone Nectar of the Hops;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Redstone Meadery;Tastes to me like tupolo honey. Fruity hops. Barely a hint of bitterness, if that. Notes of apricot, but I think that comes from the base mead. (Tupelo?). The finish is ls very slightly ascorbic, and it lacks a little something unless you wait about thirty seconds then it kind of finiah finishes if you follow me. Damned drinkable overall, and that’s not easy to achieve with mead. (I know this because I’ve made a few myself). Could be stronger and I wouldn’t mind though.
Redstone Nectar of the Hops;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Redstone Meadery;Draft @ Pour Knoxville- Big lemony hops, to the point they overwhelm the base mead. Hides the alcohol well. Basically it’s a mead for folks who don’t like mead.

Redstone Nectar of the Hops;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Redstone Meadery;500ml can - $2.99 at Bullock’s Wine & Spirits in Marietta, Georgia. Appearance: Pours a clear, very lightly hued, pale yellow body. No head formation. Smell: A big splash of white wine garnished with a pair of wax lips and housing a hint of modeling putty. Very faint undercurrent of honey water. A hint of citrus, a nibble of orchard fruit. Taste: A very light, spectral touch of honey. Slightly sweet. Mild citrus, floral hints. Modestly bitter, aided, in part, by the carbonation. Feels a bit, at times, like a fairly dry white wine. Finishes with some warmth, fairly dry and, again, a bit white wine-like. Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Medium-light carbonation. Overall: Drinkable, yes, but not overly enjoyable. Didn’t hate it, though!
Redstone Nectar of the Hops;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Redstone Meadery;This bottled Mead from a beer bar poured a head of bubbles that were and left behind a very softly carbonated transparent weak yellow colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was cinnamon vanilla and honey. The off-tasting crisp mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering spicy aftertaste. The odd tasting flavor contained notes of mild spice and honey. Not one that I would likely drink again.

The nose is brilliant clover honey, with good hop character of orange peels and pine. Very sweet, with a fairly significant hop bitterness that gives it a good dry finish. This is a surprisingly balanced, aromatic, and delicious mead.

Aroma of sweet fruits, sweet malt, molasses, honey, and booze as it warms. Flavor of some bitter hops, but it doesn’t really have much flavor and as the beer warms the flavor becomes hot and an alcoholic mess.

John Harvards El Chupacabra Barley Wine;Lakegrove, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;"Snifter @ brewpub. This is the rating for batch 2. I remember batch 1 being better and having more evident hoppiness.. It pours so damn thick, quicksand-like, with a dark copper color. Again its really freaking thick looking. Has a small had that turns into a lacing that just wont go away. Aroma is pretty unoffensive; lightly thick caramel with un-descriptive, muted hop highlights. Its like the maltiness is flavorless but so thick that it absorbs the hop aromas and all we get are cries from the quicksand. Some faint alco-fruit mixed with hops. in the form of tangerines, coming through there as well. Taste is similar, there are strong hops but they are buried under a thick maltiness that doesn’t give off any flavor. The mouthfeel is very thick, almost like syrup, thickest I have had in a while, which I actually like. Leaves a short aftertaste with a low bitterness. the score is bumped up by appearance and mouthfeel but its not that impressive. I thick there is a good beer here getting muddied up a bit."

Mad Anthony Blackberry Porter;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This draft brew from the brewery poured a head of frothy finely sized light brown colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a opaque no visible carbonation dark black colored body. The mild aroma was blackberry. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt blackberry and sweet. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.
Mad Anthony Blackberry Porter;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Draft pour at the brewery. Beautiful looking beer, almost a purple-tinted black. Nothing much going on with this one. Dry, sweet smell, no mouthfeel, and average taste of blackberries and nothing else. I wouldn’t even classify this as a porter.
Mad Anthony Blackberry Porter;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Draft at MABC. Small tan head that mostly lasted, nice lacing, opaque, no visible carbonation, and a dark brown to near black hue. Nose was sweet and blackberries. Flavor was sweet, blackberries and semi-tart. Smooth, watery, thin, and dry mouthfeel. Light body. IMO the sweetness of this brew overpowers the flavor.
Mad Anthony Blackberry Porter;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;draft at the brewpub - Pours dark brown to black with a small head. The aroma is mild and fruity. The flavor is definitely led by the blackberries. It’s enjoyable, but I would have liked the dark roast malt character to be a little stronger. Medium bodied, this brew goes down easy and makes for a pretty good fruit beer.

Madison River Hopjuice IPA;Belgrade, Montana, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Madison River Brewing Company;"Poured from bottle into a snifter Appearance – The beer pours a clear red tinted orange amber color with a one finger head of foam. The head fades over a moderate level of time to leave a decent level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass. Smell- The aroma of the brew is heaviest of a sweeter fruity aroma being mainly of a melon and tangerine smell. Along with these smells comes some hoppy aromas being mostly a mix of grapefruit and an earthy smell, but also containing a faint floral hop aroma as well. With a bit of a musty smell and a bit of bread, a rather sweet and intriguing aroma is overall produced. Taste – The taste starts with a bready and sweeter fruit flavor with a nice tangerine sweetness upfront. Other sweeter flavors of caramel are upfront as well, being mixed with a good showing of a grapefruit hop. The grapefruit grows stronger in nature as the taste moves on to the end, being accompanied by some herbal and initially lighter pine hop tastes. While the grapefruit is the strongest at the end, the pine does get to a more moderate strength overall. Some slightly musty and a moderately melon taste comes more toward the end of the taste. With a loss of the caramel sweetness and a bit of a dwindling of the tangerine, one is left with a decently hopped, and still smooth and still rather fruity sweet flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the rather more syrupy side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. For the melon fruity flavors and the hoppy tastes the syrupy body is actually quite nice accentuating the hop and creating a sorta chewy feel for the melon. The thickness coupled with the lower carbonation level of the brew, makes of a nice slow sipping style overall. Overall – This was a very enjoyable double IPA overall. Not the standard citrus bomb that you often get; this one has nice blends of other fruity flavors and a nice blend of hops. Quite enjoyable overall."

Antares IPA;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;IPA;Antares;My first Argentine IPA. It was not too bad. Not as hoppy as I would expect, but it did have a bit of citrus and a back end pine resiny taste. A little amused that my friends called this a dark beer, but after having their traditional beers, it does make more sense. Bitter by their standards, but on the lower scale by mine. I think this was my second favorite beer in Argentina. It was a very drinkable and enjoyable IPA. If they sold in this area, I am unsure if I would buy it, as our selection is better...but if I am outside of the US and this is available, I can easily see me getting another.

Three Floyds Deuce;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Dark murky brown color with a nice head. Aroma is malt and yeast with some tones of fruitiness. They serve it quite cold, which makes the beer hit you as malty with some banana and yeast. As it warms it gets more character and has some more fruity tones and becomes lightly bitter. Very similar to the Schneider Aventitus. Though I have to say I think this is probably better, more malt and more yeasty fruit. Well worth the trip.
Three Floyds Deuce;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;@ 3F’s A hazed brown pour with a light brown head. A rich raisiny aroma and a lot of yeastiness as well. A nice malty taste wigh a yeast kicker and a slight bitter finish. A slightly thin finish but excellent carbonation. An excellent drinker, a beer that continues to expand on the palate as it nears the bottom of the glass.
Three Floyds Deuce;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Draught. At the brewpub. Murky opaque ruby-brown with a small head. Sweet bready yeast/malt aroma, plenty of banana, clove and chocolate - quite sweet, smelled more like a dessert than a brew. Mild, slightly burnt caramel malt flavour, incredibly restrained light perfumey hops for TF, mostly just a mishmash of clove/yeast/banana with some cocoa powder bitterness - odd, but actually not bad. Sugary, syrupy mouthfeel, only lightly carbonated, with a mouth-coating almost candied fruit sweetness that lasts a long time. Not really my thing, but nice enough, and an interesting change of pace from my experience of TF beers (but onward! bring on the hops!!!)
Three Floyds Deuce;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"Draft 22 0z. weizen at Floyds. That’s ""THE Deuce"" to you, pilgrim! Unexpected smoky nose (and taste). Seems more like a blended wheat beer with a bock, with the same complexity and contrast of characteristics. Banana taste indeed over a chocolate malt. Once I get my nose into the glass, I a distinct impression of river water. Kind of throws one off the enjoyment."
Three Floyds Deuce;Munster, Indiana, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Chicago Trip. Saturday 16:30. On tap at the brewery. Muddy dark brown. Enticing chocolate banana aroma. thick and heavy. Not as refreshing as the aroma hinted. Lots of yeast. Chewy banana and dry chocolate.

Aroma brings out bone dry apple skins, with a touch of citrus tartness. Flavour is both sweet and sour in good balance, with medium sweet apples balanced by a dry, almost citrusy tartness. Rather nice puckering quality on the finish that becomes more apparent with each sip. Not particularly complex but well put together and scarily drinkable. Very nice.
Elephant Island Crab Apple Fruit Wine;Naramata, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Elephant Island Orchard;Bottle @ Home. Thanks, Jake. Pale yellow color with just a slight pinkish hue. Good enough apple to it. Not quite as rich as you usually would expect or like. Somewhat like white wine. Some apple juice, a touch of melon, and a bunch of grape. Decent enough acidity. Just okay.

Nice aroma of stewed apples, with some citrusy sourness.

Big Dog's Mango Madness;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Dog's Brewing Company;Smells like mangos. Which is good if you like that fruit. Me? No. Taste definitely has mango characters throughout, which my wife is a fan of, but I think is quite gross. But this is one of my least favorite fruits, so if you get the chance, try for yourself.
Tenaya Creek Imperial Brown;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Brown Ale;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Only 1.4% higher in alcohol than their original, it’s not that much better either. Looks good, but is a lttle thin and unimpressive in flavor. A bit malty and hot hoppy at all. It seems like this could have been better, just isn’t.
Chicago Pineapple Jalepeno;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Chicago Brewing Company;No aroma (and that’s the best thing about this). I had one sip from my sampler and that was enough. The jalepenos are there, but I really don’t like the flavor of those. The spiciness is fine, just the flavor. Some latent pineapple is present as well, but this is just bad. Even the bartender was making faces when he was telling me about it and giving me the sample! Their worst beer by far.

Blue Frog Red Frog Ale;Fairfield, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Frog Brewery;Faint caramel aroma. Crimson red with massive foam. Taste is not very complex though it is interesting. Odd hop flavoring with a slight metallic background. Also odd caramel/syrup-like malts. Overall, it’s not very good quality. Something very funky about this one.

Aroma is sweet caramel malt, some cereal notes, and mild hops. Flavor is very mild with light maltiness up front followed by mild resinous hop flavors. Palate is light/medium bodied with a slightly astringent finish. Overall a decent brew that’s fairly well balanced but I prefer by ambers/reds to be more malty and sweet than this.

Bozeman Hopsimelia (Imperial IPA);Bozeman, Montana, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bozeman Brewing Company;Third stop during the ABA Beer Tour ’07 in Bozeman, Montana. Sampled at the Bozeman brewery brewpub on tap. Labeled as Bozeman Imperial IPA on chalkboard, pours cloudy coppery-amber brew with a thick off-white head with terrific retention. Excellent lacing that stays with the glass. Aroma of sweet pink grapefruit, cereal malt with a touch of sweet orange peel. Taste is full bodied, highly carbonated with sweet grapefruit flavor that lasts. Finish is bitter at first and then a clean and crisp finish. Very little aftertaste, just a hint of roasted malt.

Great Northern Going To The Sun Pale Ale;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Northern Brewing Company;A nice, medium-hop IPA, pale, simple, a bit pedestrian. Okay, but why does their Bitter have more IBUs? Decent hop character, just really toned-down.
Great Northern Going To The Sun Pale Ale;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Northern Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery in Whitefish. Pale yellow, foamy white head.

Pours a light clear golden pale brew with an average white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and spotty lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, bubblegum, sugar candi and some citrusy hops. Taste is slightly sweet, medium bodied, light carbonation with a roasted caramel malt flavor. Finish is light, crisp and clean with no bitterness. A very good thirst quencher.

Great Northern Going To The Sun Pale Ale;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Northern Brewing Company;Draft 6 oz’er at the taproom. Light amber and very active. Hardly much of an aroma. Gristy and grainy, with a light citrus affect. Flat. They had this written down as an IPA on their board, so I was perplexed. Still not sure this fits in the APA category, it’s bordering on an American wheat. (#2861, 5/12/2007)

Hukvaldsky Ležák Světly 12°;Hukvaldy, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Minipivovar Hukvaldy;My Bottom Line: Cinnamon-like spiciness(?!) leads to herbal hop flavors before mild citrusy tartness and a dusty, phenolic touch appear in the finish. Further Personal Perceptions: -A slice of foam tops the hazy bronze. -The soft effervescence and overall smooth mouthfeel increase drinkability. -This was quite different from all the Svetlys I’ve had. -Lightly honeyed malt flavors are found here and there. -Herbal hops provide balancing bitterness, which tends to clash with the timid tartness.

Reinberger;Bőcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);can @ supermarket. unpretending mass product with cheap price and softly beer-like taste notes. waterish piss. STAY AWAY FROM IT, IF YOU WANT GOOD FOR YOU!!
Reinberger;Bőcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);Can. Had it back then. It was a redundant one from the Borsodi Brewery. Nothing special, just another cheap, minimal one for the poor people.
Reinberger;Bőcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);0,5 l can. Poured clear yellow with a minimal froathy white head that diminishes quickly. Some sourish yeast and a weak malt in the aroma. The body is weak too with a veryvery meaningless malt character, some sourish-vinegar taste of nothing, no bitterness, except some grass. Redundant beer again...
Reinberger;Bőcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);Canned(500ml). -Courtesy of and shared with Doggythedog (thanks!). Just another Borsodi contract beer (for Metro Hungary). Also had this beer in my hotel room mini bar in Budapest (Classic Hotel). Yellow coloured, small white head that went away in a few seconds. Tastes like diluted lemon flavored dishwashing detergent. No bitterness at all.
Reinberger;Bőcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);0.5l can, found in some random store in Budapest. Poured a light golden body with a small white head that went away fast. The nose is as extremely faint as expected. A bit sourish too. Wow. Now, to the taste. Water. And some lemon. And then some more water. And then some light cardboard. And even though the lemon and the cardboard combine into something that could be called piney by someone missing a few screws, this simply isn’t a good beer. Not offensive? Yes I guess almost no taste means not offensive. Had worse? Oh yeah. Does that help Reinberger’s case? No. It’s as generic as its name (interestingly enough, a Reinberg does exist... a village in Vorpommern).
Reinberger;Bőcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);Canned. Pale golden. Sweet and fruity. Light bodied with clean mouthfeel. No bitterness. Free from flaws as well as all other types of flavour...
Reinberger;Bőcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);Canned. Pale golden with short, white head. Really thin and sour with the common notes of maize. Some maltiness to be found in the end, but absolutely no bitterness.
Fort Street Gentlemen, the Queen!;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort Street Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Pours a cloudy amber color with medium foamy head that lingers nicely. Aroma is dominated by fruity and herbal hops. Taste is slightly sweet with a moderate bitterness. Pine and herbs up front and citrus hops in the finish. Bready malt backbone. Pretty smooth, slightly creamy. Medium to thick body. Solid DIPA.
Fort Street Gentlemen, the Queen!;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort Street Brewery;Old notes, 4-5-07. Amber, minimal head. Big in your face, caramel, hop resin, light fruit zest. Flavor on par, as it warms malt backbone comes through a bit more, sweetens up a bit. Sticky mouthfeel. Decent overall.
Fort Street Gentlemen, the Queen!;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: The aroma is very fruity with moderate orange and citrus hops. It’s a transparent orange with a touch of haze with a small white head that leaves behind very good lacing. The flavor starts very fruity with moderate sweet orange. The finish has moderate some mild grapefruit hoppiness.
Fort Street The White Goat;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fort Street Brewery;Tap 3-29-07. Dark mahogany, average off white head. Huge fruit esters up front. Banana, fig, prune, faint toffee. Flavor much the same. Huge overripe banana, banana bread, up front. Chocolate malt sweetness through the middle. Light clove in the finish. Well attenuated. Very well done.
Fort Street The White Goat;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: The aroma has lots of banana, apple, raisin, carmamel, and a hint of alcohol. It’s a dark brown with some orange hilights and a small off-white head. The flavor starts with a very nice combination of banana, bubble gum, and chocolate. The finish has a hint of raisin and alcohol. Medium bodied with a mild carbonation.
The Livery Brandy Cask Aged Cherry Jubilee;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Livery;MBGF07. Murky reddish amber with a small beige head. The aroma is sour cherry, light acetic acid, toffee and caramel. The flavor is moderately tart with sour pie cherries, light cotton candy and caramel. Medium/full body is soft with moderate carbonation. Outstanding.
The Livery Brandy Cask Aged Cherry Jubilee;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Livery;On tap: Big cherry and oak aroma. It’s a dark reddish-orange with a small off-white head. The flavor is loaded with cherries. They start sweet but quickly turn tart in the finish. The middle is lightly vinuous along with some faint caramel. There is a light oakiness in the finish. Very tastey.
The Livery Brandy Cask Aged Cherry Jubilee;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Livery;MI Summer Beer Fest. Pours murky reddish brown color with a smallish tan colored head. Aroma is tart cherries, oak, vanilla, some citrus. Flavor is huge tart cherries, some floral notes, citrus, oak, yeast. Palate is medium to light bodied, high carbonation, finishes very tart. Awesome summer brew. Refreshing. Definite flemish sours characteristics. Fantastic, probably my biggest surprise of the fest.
The Livery Brandy Cask Aged Cherry Jubilee;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Livery;Draught sample at ABF on 6/16/07 Very foamy, resilient, faded-ivory head sits atop a hazy, deep tart cherry red body, with some lighter strawberry hints. Lacing is profuse. Something didn’t go quite right here, with a very tannic, dull, heavy barrel influence overshadowing much of the beer, but also heavy phenol and some solvent-like notes as well (more phenols, but different than the typical peppery, dry, Belgian/wild yeast phenol). It’s not aggressive, but certainly the cherries in the nose are no match for it. Dries things out immediately, beyond where it should, with little sweetness/malt comfort in reserve. Vanilla and an odd, plummy-brandy note that is very minimal. The barrel certainly wasnt a first (or second?) run on this beer, it would seem. Graininess and light dough sit on the finish, with a tart juiciness from the cherries failing rapidly. Alcohol is apparent, further stripping the aroma. The flavor simply does not have enough beer character. The malts are severely lacking, with only some honey and vanilla-creaminess, that is extremely short-lived. Graininess, tannic and yeast blandness all dull the cherry flavor to the point that you mostly just taste the citric acid. Combine this with some alcohol and solvent-like flavors and it goes from bland and overdried/attenuated, to sharp and astringent. Medicinal, on the end, you might say. Strange, chewy, yeast and tannin-heavy mouthfeel with lots of carbonation.
The Livery Brandy Cask Aged Cherry Jubilee;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Livery;"$10 snifter at the brewpub; ouch! I tried the regular version at the MBG Winter Beer Fest, so thought I’d give the barrel-enhanced version a shot. Murky red-brown body, medium buff head. Distinctly oaky nose with fruitskin and earth. Oaky, fruity body with dusty barrel and cherry pit, musty. I echo BBB63’s comments about this being close to a Flemish Brown Ale. My first impression was De Dolle Oerbier Reserva 2002, minus most of the tartness. A good combination of funk and fruit."
The Livery Brandy Cask Aged Cherry Jubilee;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Livery;From a growler and served in my NB worthy glass: A deep murky brownish red hue topped initially by a frothy off-white head which fades to a ring and left good lace. The aroma has a strong bourbon overtone of oak, booze, vanilla, and sugar along with fleshy cherries and the pits and some wild flowers. The taste starts sort of sweet with those bourbon woody notes along with simple sugar reduction before a rush of ripened cherry takes over providing both sweet and sour components. The finish has a earthy and yeasty nature that lends this beer to be close to a Flemish brown. The mouth feel is sticky and rich with a acidic twang which kept it in balance and a touch dry in the aftertaste. This beer rocks! While not as tart as NG Red or a few of the best Flemish Sour Browns, it is hardly a syrupy sweet American fruit beer. Brandy Barrel-Aged for 6 months, there is a define BA nature to the brew that adds a great depth of palate. Kudos to Steve for this is even better than his Cherry Wheat.
The Livery Brandy Cask Aged Cherry Jubilee;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Livery;On tap at the brewpub. Served in a snifter with a great big froathy tan head. The brandy character can through really nice with some under tones of the oak. The cherry that I loved it the regular version was pretty covered up though. Still a pretty wonderfull beer. $10 buck for a 10 ounce snifter though. Stop the madness.
Hoppy Evil Spock Lager;Sacramento, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Hoppy Brewing Company;10 ounce sample on tap at the brewpub. Sticky, sweet, caramelly aroma with some light buttery diacetyl notes present. Some faint metallic hop aromas also come through. Grogeous transparent mahogany body with a very light tan average sized head. A little sour astringency to start. This is kind of weird. Becomes sweet and very buttery. TONS of diacetyl present. Finishes with very roasted, burnt chocolate flavors and finally more diacetyl. If you don’t like diacetyl, this is NOT the beer for you.
Hoppy Evil Spock Lager;Sacramento, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Hoppy Brewing Company;Light aroma of roasted malts. Dark ruby color w/beige head. Creamy smooth, malty, balanced with a decent amount of hop. This has the characteristics of an ale. Finish is roasted malt. It laced. It was so much more tasty than the foregoing words reveal.
Hoppy OMani Paddy Hum Dry Stout;Sacramento, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Hoppy Brewing Company;Aroma of old time Guinness! Opaque black color with a beige head. Smooth, coffee start.

Bell's Black Note Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;It is rare. My cousin took it from mybeercollectibles from Chicago. It is not as extra-ordinary as the rating says. I think it is overrated. Pitch-black, sweet, coffee stout, just an original stout. Nothing special.

Bell's Black Note Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;Bottle from a New Braunfels HEB. Thanks to wombat23 for helping me track this one down. 2017 bottle listed at 11.2%. Shelf life listed as “unlimited”. Aged a year and a half in the cellar before giving into temptation. Big milk chocolate aroma with the oak and bourbon underneath, complementing nicely. It’s the big, creamy chocolate note that’s in charge though. Taste is bittersweet, leaning to the sweet side, full of fudge and prunes, ends in a warm and boozy finish. Full bodied and sticky with mild carbonation. Delicious, although a bit overpowering with its big ABV punch.

Silver Moon Spring Tripel;Bend, Oregon, United States;Tripel;Silver Moon Brewing;Pours amber, very poor for a tripel, very cloudy with a tiny white head. When you think tripel you think golden with a strong carbonation. This beer was overly sweet, too bitter in the finish, lacked carbonation, and wasn’t dry. Pretty much missed on everything a tripel should be. I’m still wondering if they didn’t grab a wrong keg by mistake. I’ll try not to rate by style, but I was really dissapointed, and I didn’t really care for what I got anyway.

Seidr O Sir Vilberie SV (Draught);Llandrindod Wells, Wales;Apple Cider;Seidr O Sir;Bag in a box at Planet Thanet BF 2007. Hazy gold colour with thin disappearing white head. Some nail polish remover on the aroma. Harsh, but cool cider apple flavour. Great puckering dryness on the end. Not sure if my teeth will be the same again. I love it. Just the flavour and intense experience were worth coming to the festival for. I agree with everything Mes says.
Seidr O Sir Vilberie SV (Draught);Llandrindod Wells, Wales;Apple Cider;Seidr O Sir;A Mes rate: Boxed stillage @ Planet Thanet. So dry I can only sniff at it for so long before I cough but DAMN it’s good. Very good looking for a cider. Flavour is absolute genius. Like a very dry Flemish sour is the best way I can describe it. Unreal balsamic puckery sourness with not too much apple to detect. Almost smoky, oak aged character. Finish is unbelieveably long, the apples all come rushing in at once in wave upon wave of tarty sourness. Superb palate. Incredible stuff. So dry I almost need some water with it. Glorious.

Struiselensis;Oostvleteren, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;De Struise Brouwers;This beer was a bit a disappointment. Maybe my bottle got bad. 75cl bottle. This beer poured nice yellowy in the glass with a moderate head that disappeared not too fast. The taste was kind of watered down gueuze. Lacked complexity. Did I store that bottle too long?

Struiselensis;Oostvleteren, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;De Struise Brouwers;"Struise’s tribute to the lambic culture, fermented with Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Pediococcus cerevisae, two of the most essential microbes ’used’ in lambic. A blonde, hazy beer with instable, loose head and an aroma which indeed strongly reminds of lambic, lemon, vinegar, soft bready malts, estery fruitiness; taste is somewhere in between a top-fermented blond Belgian and an authentic lambic or geuze, with funkiness, tartness and complexity, but also spicy and soft malty flavours, with a long and complex finish with drying sourishness. Very interesting and very thirst-quenching, great sour beer, but not quite an actual lambic."

Roosters Brewing Rhode Island Red;Locations in Ogden and Layton, Utah, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Roosters Brewing Co. (US);"On tap at the Bayou. Pours a dark red body with a thick off-white head. The aroma struck me as kinda funky; some caramel and malt, but also dirty socks. The taste initially had a meaty/smoke like quality followed by a more traditional caramel and toasted malt flavor. Quite sweet with some cherry flavors. I had a very bitter beer before I drank this one, so I suspect my palate was wrong, but it seemed like two different beers; one full of smoke and funk, and the other a toasted sweet malt. Either way I enjoyed it."

New Albanian Jasmine the Mastiff Sweet Stout;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;New Albanian Brewing Company;On tap at NABC. A black pour with almost no lace. An aroma of roasted malt with a chocolate and coffee kicker. A flavor of dark chocolate and a bitter that is close to the same choco. A very nice warmth all the way through is something I like in a beer. Good carbonation but a tad thin. A good beer that is what it says it is.

New Albanian Jasmine the Mastiff Sweet Stout;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;New Albanian Brewing Company;draught. Pours extra black with little to no head. The aroma is dense of burned brownies and coffee. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy on this one with a wall of bittersweet chocolate accompanied by light roasted coffee, Brazil nuts. The finish is overly hot on the first two sips, almost like vodka. This goes away about a 1/4 into the glass. Not sure what that was all about. It’s a pretty good stout, I really like the density. There is an underlying buttery character that was my only qualm near the end of the glass.
New Albanian Jasmine the Mastiff Sweet Stout;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft - a deep chocolate aroma with plenty of roast. This one looks much like Guinness, but with a much darker head. The bubbles are larger, as well, since it is not a nitro pour. The head did subside rather quickly. A quite full-bodied stout with a creamy mouthfeel. A nice, chocolate flavor with a bit of sourness that is common to the style. This is a very nice stout!

Town Hall Minnesota Mild;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Poured from nitro-tap into pint glass. Dark reddish-brown with nitro head. Not much aroma - some light dry (almost sour) malt, with a definite ""beer"" smell. Pleasant but similar to smell, in that there is not much there except light dry malts that are borderline sour. I have had a couple other Milds and they have more taste; this is like a nitro Bitter, but they forgot the hops and bitterness. Also, it has a ""beer"" aftertaste - an hour later, I felt like I had had a light macro. Light body with moderate carbonation from the nitro. Yeah, it’s easy to drink but may not be worth it. Besides for the appearance, I think the nitro ruined this beer. This should be a cask beer; if I see it as such, I will re-review."

Town Hall Minnesota Mild;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Thanks to Hellomynameis for sharing this from a growler during the DLD tasting. A thin, lasting tan head tops this clear, dark amber brew. Toasty caramel aroma. Malt forward flavor profile, with the bitterness coming in as an afterthought. A bit thin.
Town Hall Minnesota Mild;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;From DLD: Pours a ruddy brown hue with a minimal fading head. The aroma has notes of grainy maris otter malt, slight caramel and toffee, aromatic and husky hop with a dusty ale yeast ester. The flavor is mostly malt driven with moderate sweetness and a grainy background, a quick note of mocha as shows but is fleeting. A subdued hop bitterness does appear towards the finish. The mouth feel is lively and a tad thin. An okay session beer than is likely better on tap.

This is quite refreshing. Good complexity of the hop character, the malt aspect being a little lacking. Finishes super dry and slightly lingering bitterness. This is a great example of quality MO beer.

This brew is an orange-amber color with a medium pillowy off-white head that recedes slowly. Sheet of lacing on the glass. Nice citrus and hops aroma with a bit of malt. Medium body with flavors of citrusy hops, toasted malt and sweet fruit. The finish is hoppy with a lingering malt and fruit aftertaste. Pretty good overall.

Coast Range Farmhouse Kölsch Bier;Gilroy, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Coast Range Brewing Company;22oz bottle 4/12/09 (Woodmans-Green Bay)-Pours a hazy golden body with a small white covering. Aroma of hops, grains, and malt. Taste of the same with a bit of citrus and oldness. Agree with JPDIPSO about the age. I know Coast Range closed in ’07 but why is this beer still on shelves especially a year later. This light bodied brew is not bad but because of age not as crisp as it should be.
Coast Range Farmhouse Kölsch Bier;Gilroy, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Coast Range Brewing Company;Wow, this is strange - retired with two ratings? - I bought a bottle of this last week at a grocery store in Wisconsin and drank it in my hotel room - oh well, you folks out there aren’t missing much - hazy golden beer (an unfiltered kolsch?) with a minimal head - smells of honey and orange marmalade, with some grassy hops underneath - peppery hops up front, but the beer quickly becomes far too heavy and sweet for the style - some soft floral character mixed in as the bitterness fades - like JPDIPSO states, it’s just not clean and crisp like a kolsch should be.
Coast Range Farmhouse Kölsch Bier;Gilroy, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Coast Range Brewing Company;Retired?, Bottles are just hitting the shelves in the midwest, did they find an old lot and move them here? Between the bad Kilt Lifter and if this is also the case, some distributors are pulling some major crap! Golden color with a taller, but diminishing dark cream colored head. Looks ok. Light floral and pale malt aromas. Some hints of grain and husks. Stale malt sweetness and some chalk. Dusty floral hops in the middle. Mild cardboard. Some hints of apple and the finish. Not at crisp as I like.
Coast Range Farmhouse Kölsch Bier;Gilroy, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Coast Range Brewing Company;Very nice beer. It’s a shade darker than the brewery’s pils. which is a clear yellow gold. Nice foamy head with lots of lace. Spicy nose. Flavor’s a fruity bittersweet with pronounced hop on the tongue. Balanced. Good finish. Drinkable.

Moerlein Over-The-Rhine (OTR) Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - English;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Orangish looking brew, ironically from the same color can. Smells a little old euro and punctual. Big strong english aged feel to it. Difficult at first but then old euro thang gets tongy, I mean tangy, I mean...... Ends up being a little more than difficult if you can figger that out. Probably would not try again but glad to have had the chance.
Moerlein Over-The-Rhine (OTR) Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - English;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. Hazed golden / light brown. A smaller off white head. Aroma is tangerine, honey, and malts. A hint of pepper and yeast sediment. Fruit is pleasant and oranges are tasted late. That tangerine. Pleasant is a good word for this. Bitterness is barely noticed and hops are very soft. It drinks like a bitter. Kind of an oily feel.
Moerlein Over-The-Rhine (OTR) Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - English;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;From Aug 2008 I got this in a trade with zapata. Thanks Ben! It pours a clear dark amber with a finger head of foam that quickly shrinks to a fine layer. Good lacing. The smell has some caramel sweetness to it along with some slight floral hop notes. It's on the light side but it's good. The taste is nice! Good caramel sweetness with some biscuit and some grain and I find this is a malt based APA. A few more sips in and the Fuggles hops push some good semi bitterness into the mix. Result. A very tasty and very balanced Pale Ale indeed! Love it and I don't think that there are enough of these types around. Medium mouthfeel and lightish carbonation help to really bring out the flavours. It finishes on the bitter and dry side. And, drinkability is very good. It's 6%abv but I *know* I could drink 2 or 3 of these at a sitting. Here's another interesting and tasty brew from Christian Moerlein. I'm very happy that I decided to seek some out.

Moerlein Over-The-Rhine (OTR) Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - English;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Amber beer with a foamy light tan head that drops considerable lace. Nose of sour dough, caramel, and nuts. Flavor has a little fruity tang initially, which is surprising, followed by bread, nuts, and light caramel, all of which finishes with a slightly acidic bitterness that lingers. Many layers of flavor--pretty good beer.
Porterhouse Original Munchner Dunkel;Dublin, Ireland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Deep brown, server too cold. with lots of malt aroma, and a sweet malt (almost malt extract) flavour.
Ipswich Whiskey Barrel-aged Oatmeal Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Dark black beer with a thick dark brown head. Aroma is chocolately and toffeeish. Heavy chewy sweetness with light rummy character, black pepper, brown sugar, toffee and chocolate. Bourbony character with lots of oakiness. Medium bodied, dark malty flavour with loads of oak. Dryish dark chocolate. Complex and quite a tasty brew.
Ipswich Whiskey Barrel-aged Oatmeal Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Cask at the Brazen Head: Pours an opaque black, with a fading tan head. It’s a bit thin in body. The aroma is quite boozy, dominated by oak, with some peat-like character and bourbon. The flavor has a smooth boozyness, without being abrasive, which gives it a warming character. The finish shows the original stout profile with a late chocolatey coffee-like roastyness. Somewhat thin and simple, but still a well crafted barrel-aged stout.
Ipswich Whiskey Barrel-aged Oatmeal Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Cask at Brazen Head - despite my bad experience with the BA dark, I tried this anyway, and I’m glad I did because this stuff was pretty nice - thick, opaque pour - nice combination of roasted malts, wood, and bourbon in the aroma - the sweetness of the original brew is subdued, but the roasted qualities remain, combining well with flavors the barrel add to the beer - vanilla and bourbon were present, but not overpowering - I could have drank nothing but this beer at the cask fest and been happy - quite nice.
Ipswich Whiskey Barrel-aged Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;October 2007. Cask at the Mercury Brewery in Ipswich, MA. This is a fantastic brew. Smells of dark chocolate, alcohol, and heavy malts. Looks like deep, dark chocolate with a creamy brownish head. Feels thick in the mouth, light on the carbonation, and creamy like Guinness. Tastes of chocolate, some malt, and an aftertaste of alcohol. Very, very good, if you can get your hands on this at a Mercury Brewery function.
Ipswich Whiskey Barrel-aged Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Cask at Brazen Head. Hazy brown, very still. Aroma shows loads of oaky character, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a touch of toasted malts. The flavour is decent with a light cocoa, some toast, and lots of oaky tannins. The palate is quite thin though. Light dill-like herbaceousness that I sometimes get from barrel-aged stuff. Meh… sometimes putting stuff in a barrel doesn’t make it any better.
Ipswich Whiskey Barrel-aged Dark Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Cask at Brazen Head - this was the first beer of the afternoon for me, and it did NOT get me off on the right foot - semi-cloudy, rust-colored beer - faint aroma of damp wood, cheap whiskey and stale malts - very thin body, with nutty, slightly sweet caramel flavors from the brown ale that I could barely taste - the barrel beat all the life out of this beer - the flavor was dominated by wood, with tiny hints of booze - it pretty much tasted like I was, literally, sucking on the inside of a bourbon barrel - somewhat sour character in the finish that didn’t taste intentional, but actualy made the beer a little better - not good - not good at all.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;"Very large, big-bubbled head. It condenses into a tighter rocky that leaves a small amount of lace on the glass. Slight metalic smell? A touch of dry peach. This is lighter bodied brew, but the flavor is wonderful. The peach is up front and in the aftertaste. It reminds me of the sliced fresh peaches my Grandmother would give me, even though this is not a sweet beer. Very high carbonation--almost to the level of a soft drink. The flavor makes this a worthwhile purchase. I would love to see a similar version with less carbonation; I think that would be a homerun."
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;From notes clearly, if this was drank today I’d hate to even smell it. Very light hue, fleshy pink. Smells like peach to a certain extent, even a smidge tart, the carbonation is quite nice. This one is just too light on the palate, the peach isn’t vivid or fleshy, its thin with little finish. Maybe a summer time quaf, otherwise, meh.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;Had this fresh and with some age on it. Had bottles and on tap at the brewery.

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;good flavor hazy well balanced and refreshing notthing special though not one of harpoons best
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;Pours hazy gold with a massive, fluffy white head. Very promising appearance, but way overcarbonated if you’re shooting for anything Lambic-esque. Aromatics lead off with a whiff of peach skins and tart pits. An obtrusive, moldy, musty cardboard aroma takes hold and detracts throughout the glass. Very much like a moldy cardboard box from the cellar. Mouthfeel is soft and slightly tart. Pallet is fruity with a hint of sour. Hardly lactic or even leaning in the direction thereof. The musty cardboard is apparent in the finish as well.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;"Draught at Brickseller, Washington DC Cloudy blond color; big head. Aroma of peach syrup. The flavor reminds me more a watered peach drink than a beer, plus some bitterness. Drinkable, but useless as beer."
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;22oz bomber: I got a shot of foam out of the top of the bottle when I opened this one. It pours with a large, white frothy head. It is a clear, pale golden color with some constant fizziness. So far, not good. The aroma is a different story, however. Slightly sour peach aroma, with some mustiness to it. A definite improvement over the appearance. Somewhat of a peach flavor, with some carbonation lingering on the tongue. Slightly bready. A nice, lighter beer for a hot day.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;22oz Bottle. Pours hazy golden with a frothy off-white head. Earthy, musty peach aroma.

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;Cloudy Copper color with bubbles ,extremely large head, very fizzy. It took me forever to pour a pint. Peach aroma. Peach, earthy taste. Not a great beer. I read the bottles were exploding, but I had 3 bottles rolling around in my trunk all the way from Vermont to Maryland and I arrived home with them in tact.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #19 - Peche;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpoon Brewery;"Actually tried this at the brewery and in the now infamous 22 oz bomber. This beer is explosive(literally) but compared to similar styles like the dogfish peche, its quite mild and sweet. Easy to drink but won’t satisfy you if you want that ""beery"" taste... Also if you hate peach."

I would drink it if it were there but not reach for it. Notes: Decent, easy to drink beer. Nothing special about it, but just a simple beer that is well balanced.

Tree Rebel;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;341mL bottle which poured a clear amber color with moderate white head settling quite quickly to some very sporadic lacing.

This is a decent beer with some nice carbonation and a light to medium body and somewhat pleasing to the tastebuds.
Tree Rebel;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;***review from May 20, 2007*** First thing, I’m not sold on this beer and I don’t think it’s all that appealing, but, with that siad, this is a pretty good beer....probally doesn’t help that I drank 3 Fish Tales 10 Squared either. Average abmer colour, offwhite decent head with some spotty lacing, ok retension thoughout and persistant effervecence gets extra marks. Aroma is plentyful with some fruity sweetness blending in with the malts and some dry wheatness. Taste is just above average with ok malts (good ammount), a hint of citrus...maybe, a bit dusty, but it does have some european quality to it. Mouthfeel is good with a very nice carbonation feel. Light to medium bodied with a faint bitterness and a short-lived malt finish. I think this is possibly a sub-par beer for Tree, but, I did manage to drink most of it in about 2 minutes, so how dissapointed should I really be? They gotta do something about the packaging though - it’s horrible.
Tree Rebel;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;I love Tree brewing easily my favorite Canadian brewery but what the hell did they do for this new beer “Rebel lager” lamest name ever with a crap ass two tone grey and red label complete with the lamest description of the beer and the type of person who should drink it on the back what the hell where they thinking, oh I think I know what they where thinking they tried to market a craft beer to white trash that’s what they’re thinking, retards. But now to crack this mofo open and give it a review. Body looks crystal clear copper sitting in my glass with a minimal cap that reduces to only a few bubbles in a moment, very standard looking but some how looks better the average. The aroma has a very noticeable hop presence, toffee like malts and just a tinge of metal, hey for a lager this is not to bad. Taste is malty and starts off a touch bitter then turns sweet after about two seconds in your mouth, very lightly hoped but they are noticeable giving a slight citrus metallic taste, however the malts come through way stronger then and of the hops. Clean and refreshing beer and I can see the average swill drinker really digging this brew and that is what I think that is what Tree is going for but the name and marketing for the beer is an embarrassment to the good people of Tree brewing they got to change this.
Tree Rebel;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;Golden pour... an aggressive pour brought a full two finger head that likely would not have formed as heavy if poured more naturally. Recedes fairly quickly, leaving a full sheet of head over the brew and a thick lip of lace. A distinct noble hops aroma. Simple, subtle, and pleasant. These are the aromas that I appreciate in a modest lager. Noble hops, somewhat herbal. A gentle malt backbone. Somewhat light, but a full flavour. A good session brew, and a nice beer all around, though maybe not particularly extraordinary.
Tree Rebel;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;My least favourite of all Tree brews I have had. Came in the Tasters 8 pack. Pours a golden straw colour with a large foamy white head which dissapates slowly. Aroma of mild hops and grass. Taste is medium hoppyness and crisp taste, but is lacking anything unique and is a fairly run of the mill beer. I would drink this again simply to support a microbrewery in Canada which I really like.
Tree Rebel;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;Bottle. Golden, creamy layer. Light almondy nose. Straw malt base with a funny almond note to it, no significant counter, light metallic edge. `light body, quick finish.

Tree Rebel;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;"Pours with a nice thick foamy head. Slight aroma: metallic with some hop and fresh grain. Same with the taste. Quite bland overall but it’s crisp. There is nothing ""rebellious"" about this beer at all."

Great Lakes Brewery Orange Peel Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);Pours an average size off-white foamy head that dissipates slightly to a thin layer and leaves a ring around inside. Nice dirty lacing. Has a pale golden appearance. Aromas of wheats, malts, barley with herbal and weak citrus hops. Flavours are of oranges most definitely, along with notes of honey, barley. A bit yeasty, some grainy malts, resin and citrus hops. Has that sort of citrus tang, but fairly mild. Light bodied with a nice puckering mouthfeel, light creaminess and slightly sweet. Weak carbonation. Pretty good, easy to drink.
Great Lakes Brewery Orange Peel Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);650 ml bottle purchased at the LCBO in Hawkesbury (Ontario) on June 6, 2013. Honey orange, small head. Light aroma of malted barley with a touch of orange. The taste is quite the same, but very dry, it’s like eating dried oranges, and an unpleasant finish bitter barley. Not for orange lover!
Great Lakes Brewery Orange Peel Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);650 mL Bottle. Gold body with a foamy-rocky white head settling to a thin but tenacious layer leaving stringy lace. Oranges and orange peel are noticeable in the aroma along with light sweet malts, floral and earthy notes, and tangy hops. Orange peels make their presence in the flavor along with light sweet malts, citrus aftertaste, and an orange peel finish that gives it an astringent character. Nothing super sensational but different in its own interesting way.
Great Lakes Brewery Orange Peel Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);650ml bottle. Pours a clear, light amber colour with a short head. The nose is impressively fresh oranges with some grainy notes but not much else. The flavour really leaves a bit to be desired. The orange, hops and malt just don’t jive properly together.
Great Lakes Brewery Orange Peel Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);Not a particularly exceptional fruit beer. The orange peel comes across as astringent, not sweet, with very little aroma. Picked this up in Toronto in 2013.

Great Lakes Brewery Orange Peel Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);I like when citrus mingles with my liqour so why not in my beer? Two finger foam cap that descends into lake-like valley. Nothing much on the nose & subtle on the mouth. Got a bit of that funky skunky mud water after taste that so many southern Ontario brewers can’t seem to shake.
Great Lakes Brewery Orange Peel Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);Poured clear golden, nice small clean head. A small distinct citrus aroma. Not overbearing smell. Aeroma matches clean look. Taste is a bit of a disapointment as i was expecting a slightly stronger taste. Was a bit too weak. Beer might have been too cold. Overall, will drink this again!
Great Lakes Brewery Orange Peel Ale;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);Nasty artificial orange flavoring aroma, weak bodied, flavorless specialty ale. Not worth 4.95$ for a bomber. Don’t waste your time.

Schmohz John T. Pilsner;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Schmohz Brewing Co.;bottle. Pale golden with small head. Sweet grassy body, light hops, and a bit of the signature Schmohz blend of off flavors. You’ve got to give it to them for consistency.
Schmohz John T. Pilsner;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Schmohz Brewing Co.;I have to say this was not a god beer for me. aroma dirty ash tray and so was the taste
Schmohz John T. Pilsner;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Schmohz Brewing Co.;Bottle. Aroma has notes of toasted cereal malts, a little caramel, lemon and citrus fruits and lager yeast. Very nice for a Pilsener. Hazy medium golden hue with a slight orange tint. Average rocky white head that mostly diminished and left good lace. Flavor is medium sweet and bitter. Palate is medium/light bodied and watery with average carbonation. Overall a very nice Pilsener that I really enjoyed. Fantastic when fresh!!!!
Schmohz John T. Pilsner;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Schmohz Brewing Co.;It it smells like an ipa if it tastes like an ipa it probably is an ipa, well not in this case. It is a bit lighter than an ipa taste wise but still familiar like one. I am enjoying this beer
Schmohz John T. Pilsner;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Schmohz Brewing Co.;"Deep gold, clear, with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Strong aroma of herbal and slightly grassy hops. They have a lot of citrus and a bit of spice to them. Taste is fairly sweet, but this beer is definitely balanced towards bitterness. The aftertaste is citrus, malt, weedy, dusty. Fairly dry mouthfeel. This is more a pre-Prohibition American lager than a Czech pilsner (as the bottle advertises); but this is probably the best effort I’ve tasted yet from this generally mediocre brewery. It’s clean, flavorful, full of American hop character. Very good lawnmower beer for hopheads."
Schmohz John T. Pilsner;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Schmohz Brewing Co.;"If you like hops in your beer; lots and lots of hops... I mean LOTS of hops, you’ll love this one. Frankly, I don’t like that much hops in my beer, but I assure you, that first one always tastes GREAT. After that, it all depends on your hops tolerance."
Schmohz John T. Pilsner;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Schmohz Brewing Co.;Bottle . A hazy golden color pour with a big long lasting foamy offwhite head , medium carbonation , lots of jagged lacing . Aroma of toasted malts and strong lemongrass , slightly sour and zesty . Flavor is quite balanced with a biscuty toasty malt backbone , some tangy wheat like falvors , lemon and grassy earthy hops , nice level of bitterness , creamy mouthfeel , long hoppy finish , quite drinkable and intresting .
Schmohz John T. Pilsner;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Schmohz Brewing Co.;A wonderful locally made Pilsner. Nice flavor and aroma, the best beer to have right after mowing the lawn.
Uberach Clochette;Uberach, France;Flavored - Fruit;Uberach;bottle from Auchan Illkirch-Graffenstaden. Golden colour, small white head and a fruity nose. Beery with a pleasant fruity character.
Uberach Clochette;Uberach, France;Flavored - Fruit;Uberach;Bottle 50cl. A lightly red cloudy beer with an intense fruity nose. Aroma is medium sweet to low, notes of fruit, not acid but nothing exceptional. A basic beer slightly malted but with thin body, and yes again too much yeast flavor.
Uberach Clochette;Uberach, France;Flavored - Fruit;Uberach;Bottled. A muddy brown headless coloured beer. The bottle had lots of sediment which when poured away smelled heavily of chocolate. The beer itself doesn’t though. In fact, it doesn’t smell of much. A faint fruitiness which is more intense in the mouth. I didn’t get blueberries as such, but they are light berries. Quite yeasty tasting. It’s ok, but won’t be revisiting.
Uberach Clochette;Uberach, France;Flavored - Fruit;Uberach;Brewed with blueberries. Bottled. Notes of blueberries and other berries in the aroma and in the flavour, but unfortunately they are overpowered by a strong yeastiness, which is rather unpleasant. Quite sweet and light bodied.
Occy's Mexican;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Occy's Brewery;Part of the tasting line up at the brewery, which is no longer Wildwood in Perth, but Occy’s Brewery in the Margaret River region. Pale straw yellow, foamy white cap. Stale sulphorous aroma, with an honest-to-god pee smell (my wife agreed-- PEE). Flavour is pretty much the aroma. Really very bad, surpassed in badness only by the wheat. Infection? Oh yes I think so.
Occy's Mexican;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Occy's Brewery;Tried on tap at Occy’s Brewery. Clear golden body, short head some lacing. Lemon on the aroma, Citrus again in the taste, light in body, for a pale lager it is not offensive.
Tanglehead Beaus ESB;Albany, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tanglehead Brewing Company;Tried on tap at Tanglehead. Very pale red body with tight beaded head, rings of lacing. Dry in the taste with hops showing more than I was expecting though not dominating, preferred the pils more.
Occy's Wheat -2010;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Occy's Brewery;Tried this way back in late 2008. Pale straw yellow, effervescent and bright (?). A quickly diminishing head left a good trail of lace. Rubbery, phenolic nose with hints of sulphur, wheat malt, lemon and orange zest. Prickly carbonation elevates it on the palate. It’s quite watery and thin with a crisp, sour wheat finish. Phenols in back, a light herbal note joins in with a tinkling of citric bitterness to the swallow. Not much here and the aroma was a little troubling. (On draught @ Occy’s brewery, Dunsborough)
Occy's Wheat -2010;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Occy's Brewery;Part of the tasting line up at the brewery, which is no longer Wildwood in Perth, but Occy’s Brewery in the Margaret River region. Slightly hazy yellow, white cap. Overpowering eggy sulphorous aroma and flavour. Really awful. It’s like they took the infection from their Mexican lager and distilled it. Wow. Bad.
Occy's Wheat -2010;Dunsborough, WA, Australia;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Occy's Brewery;Tried at Occys Brewery. Pale clear golden body with average head. Very light in body, not quite watery. Faint orange aroma almost stands out. Not exactly Rheinhetsgebot.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);2008 Botle - Pours pale transparent yellow with a large frothy white head...aroma is grassy lager skunk and faint malt...flavour is all of the skunk, none of the malt...sour corn finish...this is just not good...
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Pours a clear, pale, yellow-gold color with a quickly fleeting, fizzy white head. Very little lacing noted. The aroma shows typical, skunky, pale lager notes of sweet corny malt, cardboard, dry grains, and faint floral hops. Flavors follow suit, proving to be equally unimpressive. Corny malts and distant, grassy hop notes are clouded with a stale, grainy, paper-like element. Light, weak body. Awful beer.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Bottled. A light golden beer with a thin white head. Both the aroma and flavor are sweet malty, but also with a cardboard note. Thanks ompher for sharing.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);A bit better than the majority of lagers here but you can find better. Minimal head hoppt aromas and taste/.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Bottle, Stockholm Beer Festival 2007 afterfestival at Per’s Light blond color. Light hay aroma. Light flavor, not even bitter. Very poor.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Draught at a wine expo in Thessaloniki. Pours pale yellow, small white head. Aroma is grassy with light hops and a bit of malt. Flavor is the same. Basically a generic Euro-lager, but decent for what it is.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Bottled Golden color, not much head. Dull hoppy aroma. Diacetylic and grassy. Short aftertaste. Booooring.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Bottled (thanks omhper!). Pale yellow colour, not much head. Aroma is grassy, malty, and some buttery notes. Flavour is grassy, malty and some hoppy hints. Not the most exciting thing.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Bottled. Pale golden, no head. Phenolic and lightly buttery. Medium sweet and fairly light bodied with rounded mouthfeel.No bitterness. A mere step up from the commercial lagers.
Genesis Premium Lager;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Bottle, poured a light gold with a filmy white head. A light grainy malt aroma. A strong flavour, malty with some good hoppiness, maybe a little skunkish.
Ysta Jubileum 2006;Tomelilla, Sweden;Pale Ale - English;Två Bryggare / Österlenbryggarna / Bryggeriet i Ystad;At Kalmar nation in Lund, 25kr. Best before date is March 07, which is strange because I’ve never seen it anywhere of heard news of the release. Anyway, to the beer... Pours a slightly hazed dark golden with a large head which dissipates into nothing awfully quickly. I was actually quite surprised that it seemed bottle conditioned. Aroma of seaweed, salty water, phenols, diacetyl, mango, earthy hops and some faint crystal malt sweetness, interesting... but to be blunt its a bit all over the place. Body is medium and the carbonation is quite low, perhaps its a bit sickly. Flavours are all fruity and wacky, more salt, peaches, ropiness, toffee, and a moderate bitterness. Finishes fruity and cloying. Overall its a bit of an oddball from this otherwise ordinary brewery, the beers not great and too complicated. Perhaps the bottle was past its date, although I’ve had about 5 bottles of this now and they’re all the same. Points to Ysta for at least producing something different(ish).
Buzzards Bay MaiBock;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Pours copper with a thin white head. Smells of honey, some caramel, sweet malt, flowers, earthy. Tastes of light spice with some earthiness to it. Decent.
Buzzards Bay MaiBock;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buzzards Bay Brewing;12oz bottle. Honey dipped cardboard on the nose. Perhaps a touch of diacetyl. Definite grassy and earthy hops. Grainy and slightly vegetal. Pours a fairly clear bright gold with a thin lasting white head producing spotty lacing. Flavor is almost like a hopped pale lager with some added corn syrup. Thin to medium bodied with an incredibly intense grainy finish. Thanks Nelson.
Buzzards Bay MaiBock;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buzzards Bay Brewing;This beer pours a clear pale orange, and amber color. there is not much of a head to it, but it does have some nice laceing around the glass. It has a honey and mildly earty aroma to it which is very hard to pick out since it is not that strong. this initial flavor is very bitter and hoppy. There is alsom a nice citrus after taste, but the palate is very weak not much to it the flavor tends to fade rather quickly. Although the flavor is rather spicy like pepper the palate is very weak.
Buzzards Bay MaiBock;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Pours out clear golden colour with a foamy off-white head with moderate retention and spotty lacing. The nose really pops with bright hoppy citrus notes, honey and slightly earthy caramel. The flavour is fruity, slightly bitter hops and a bit of peppery spice and even some smoke. The malt presence is more subdued than hidden. The dry hopping doesn’t seem intense enough to overcome what would have been a solid malt backbone, especially at a modest 28IBU’s. I can’t deny that it is refreshing and that the mouthfeel is effective in being quenching and relatively full for the style. A nice offering overall. Needs some eathiness.
Buzzards Bay MaiBock;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Golden translucent color, slighly hoppy smell but reminiscent of a macrobeer. peppery bite, mild bitterness somewhat soapy aftertaste-was looking for more maltiness
Buzzards Bay MaiBock;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buzzards Bay Brewing;"The guy pouring samples said, ""Not a traditional Maibock. We dry-hopped it - sort-of Americanized it"". I really like this brew and kudos to the guys at BBB for breaking out of their ""traditional styled"" brewskies. Plenty of up front lemony, citrus dry-hopped character with almost no malt aroma at all. On the palate, a sweetness of malt that is overbalanced by a pleasant hop-based resin-like flavor. I assume this is from the Liberty dry hopping. Finishes with a playful sweet/bitter/sweet flavor and ultimately ends dry with a lingering but pleasant bitterness. I’ll admit that I am a dry-hop brewsky fan and this is a great American Maibock!"
Buzzards Bay MaiBock;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buzzards Bay Brewing;I had the bottled version, as well as a sample of BBB’s MaiBock at the brewery. The aroma is delicious - hops are floral with light pine notes. Not overpowering for the style and mingle nicely with a light malty nose. Color is a crystal clear, deep straw yellow. The bright white head faded quickly, but left some nice lacing on the glass. This MaiBock’s flavor is intense, but not pleasantly so. The subtlety of this beer’s aromatics don’t translate to the flavors. This beer is way too bitter for a mai bock. Whatever maltiness exists in this beer is covered by a harsh hop bitterness that sits on the tongue. This beer is not gentle on the palate either. A grainy astringency combined with the hop bitterness overpowers any malt sweetness and body that this beer might have. This beer tastes more like a pilsner on steroids, rather than a traditional Mai Bock that highlights a delicate dance of malt sweetness and hop bitterness.

Moles Molennium;Melksham, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Moles Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the Robin Hoods Retreat, Bristol 3/9/08. Deep reddish amber in colour with a small but tight tan head. Aroma of tart fruit, bitter chocolate and a touch of sweetness. Flavour began slightly sweet before plums with a whiff of grassy hops took over. The finish was slightly dry and the alcohol was well concealed - well worth seeking out.

Rock Bottom Cincinnati Cézanne Saison;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Cincinnati;Draft at Cincinnati RB location from new brewmaster, Guy. Poured hazy yellow color with an average fizzy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate sour citrus and spice aroma. Light to medium body with lively carbonation.

Rock Bottom Cincinnati Cézanne Saison;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Cincinnati;"4/11/2007: Monthly Mug Club Keg Tapping Party for the new Cezanne Saison.... Cezanne Saison pours a hazy pale yellow color with a thin white crown. There is some musty/funky notes in the aroma along with lemon zest and a hint of vinegar. The flavor tastes like a blend between a typical Belgian Wit and a light Farmhouse-style Saison (e.g. Bam Biere). It is slightly sweet, slightly sour (like sour grapes), and has a delicate spice to it. The flavor is well-balanced overall. This beer has a light body and a nice amount of carbonation resulting in a beer that’s crisp on the palate and thirst quenching. 32 oz draught at Rock Bottom Cincinnati; compliments of Tmoney99. Thanks again Tom! Looks like I beat you to the first rating on this beer! :)"
Beach Chalet Bourbon Barrel Dark Belgian;San Francisco, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beach Chalet Brewery;Golden brown with a fizzy head. Sweet malty and alcohol aroma. Caramel and citrus and mildly roasty malt tastes with some nice bourbon notes. An interesting brew with the various flavors well balanced with each other.
Beach Chalet Bourbon Barrel Dark Belgian;San Francisco, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beach Chalet Brewery;Sampled at the second annual Bistro’s West Coast Barrel Aged Beer Fest as St Benedict Dark Belgian: Mostly transparent hazy copper bronze with a thin ring of white bubbles. Aroma of sweet caramel malt and mild bourbon oak with a touch of Belgian yeast. Starts with a fairly-full caramel malty sweetness drying some toward a doughy buttery oaky finish. Pretty well balanced and fairly complex, but I still don’t like the combination of Belgian yeast and bourbon oak that gives the buttery character.

This Belgian ale poured a medium brown amber color. Small to no head. Aroma is mildly fruity with a touch of bourbon and wood. A medium bodied Belgian Ale. Malts are fruity and sweet, Bourbon and wood noticeable, but not understated or overpowering. There is a very wine like feel to this one, it has a vinous like flavor, think red wine. Mouthfeel is a touch thin. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Kirin The Gold;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Rated Apr 2008. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is light to medium yellow. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (grain, husks), trace hops (herbs), with a note of DMS. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately bitter, husky. Medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation.
Kirin The Gold;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);“All malt pilsner.” Medium to darker gold color, high head. Nice malty aroma, rich, rather sweet, with a bit of fruit and a touch of hops. Like a Bavarian pils. Sweetish, rich malt flavor. Light on hops, but they are there. Finish is also rich malt, with noticeable hops but they are not strong. Slight bitterness lingers. Dry, but not “Dry.” The malt is tasty and welcome after too many “dry” beers.
Kirin The Gold;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Canned(350ml). -Trade with faroeviking (thanks Jacob!) Pale golden coloured, small white head, almost neutral nose. Lively carbonation. Surprisingly malty and slight acidic with notes of corn. Short bitterish finish. Drinkable.
Kirin The Gold;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Can courtesy of and shared with ogivlado who got it in a trade with faroeviking (thanks!) Poured a gold body with a medium-small white head that went away relatively fast. Sweetish malty nose. The taste is sweet and malty, slightly yoghurty, which is good but the hopiness is acidic and basically crap, ruining what otherwise might’ve been quite a solid lager. Not bad but just ok overall.
Kirin The Gold;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);01.21.09 Can, 500ml on the Shinkansen on the way to Kyoto. Pours clear gold, white head. Aroma is hoppy and malty. Flavor is mild, not as crisp or hoppy as the regular Kirin Ichiban.

Spanish Peaks American Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Bottle:   Fiery amber, sediment abounds, large frothy white head, so-so lacing.   Soft citrusy/rindish hops on the nose.   When I say soft, I mean soft.   Not terribly biting on the tongue, decent malt base.   Not lopsided, which is nice.   Not too bright either tho.   Moderate body and mouthfeel.   Fades somewhat quickly, but then again I am used to bruiser Pale Ales. &nbsp Probably truer to style than I am used to.   Better than I was expecting.
Spanish Peaks American Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Pour from a 12 oz bottle. Dark amber brew with decent head. Aroma dominated by malts - somewhat wirty. Taste is a little sweet malt at the start quickly transitioning to a blend of sour and bitter hops. Good hops presence though somewhat unrefined. A flavorful brew.
Spanish Peaks American Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Still more notes from the Great Midwest excursion. Damn, I bought a lot of beer... It’s a lightly hazy copper, yeast in suspension with a fluffy ivory head. Sweet, sweet hops in the nose, sweet pale malt too. The sweet hop aroma does not hint at the herbal biting bitterness the hops deliver. It’s like a turbo charged English style pale ale. Mouth is dryish lots of herbal hops in the finish and aftertaste. Something about this beer doesn’t mesh well, the hops (Crystal, Mt. Hood, Horizon) are not right for the malt profile or they overpower it too much. Whatever, it just doesn’t work for me. Only fair.
Spanish Peaks American Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;I’m having a hard time reading my notes. I don’t remember why I rated it so high. Pours apricot. Nose and taste is floral citrus. Rated 1/8/0

Spanish Peaks American Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;(bottle). Pours a cloudy, dark orange color with particles. Frothy, medium size off white head. Potent hop aroma (possibly fuggles?). Light hop flavor with light bitterness. Soft carbonation. Thin texture. Fair lacing.
Spanish Peaks American Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Pours a hazy golden orange with a frothy two-finger head that receded to a nice solid film and left plenty of thick lacing. Generous citrusy hops on the nose. Mildly bitter citrus and pine hops flavors with a solid maltiness that nicely balances the bitterness. Medium body, lively carbonation, and a clean crisp hops-dominated aftertaste.
Spanish Peaks American Pale Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Spanish Peaks Brewing Company;Pours a near clear orange amber with sustainable white head.

McMenamins Voltron IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On draft at Sherwood Pub location. Clear medium amber color, with a small white head leaving thin lace. Hop dominant aroma with citrus and floral notes. Hop dominant flavor as welll, with a decent toasty malt backbone to balance the brash citrus and grapefruit tastes, but seems to have a yeast character that’s a little unpleasant (which I noticed in some of the other McM beers as well). Medium body and gently tingly carbonation.

Beer Hunters Mufloni Stout (2007 version);Pori, Finland;Stout;Panimoravintola Beer Hunter's;Draught (Helsinki Beer Festival 2007, Helsinki). Full-bodied dry stout, but also sweet. Very tasty. Maybe young malty taste - perhaps better a little later.

Sweetish aroma: bun, yeast and toasted malts. Medium to full bodied. Berry-like notes (black currant), a bit sweetish and roasted malty. Long roasted-bitterish aftertaste. This batch was maybe not quite ready yet and this variety of Finnish hops is propably not the best one for this stout. (6/4/6/3/12 3.1) Re-rated@brewpub a week later As Beer Hunters’ new NZPA, this one is slightly better on the site. Less berry-like, but with very sticky mouthfeel. Nice hoppy roasted aftertaste.

Beer Hunters MufloN ZPA;Pori, Finland;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Panimoravintola Beer Hunter's;Hazy dark orange, big creamy head. Nose has sweet fruits (lots of carambola), some aniseed and parfumey notes. Overall aroma feels somehow raw and a bit homebrew-like. It’s like the beer has been kegged and served in too much of a hurry. Same goes for the flavor, which is dominated almost entirely by insipid hops, loosing the nice fruitiness and malts. Medium bodied with soft, a bit creamy mouthfeel. I was expecting something more crisp and malty. Maybe this was just a bad batch, since it definitely has potential. (8 3 6 3 12) [i]Re-rate, a few weeks further matured batch[/i] The raw yeastiness is gone, leaving a more balanced, quite solid APA. Nice creamy appearance, with the same exotic fruity aroma.

Bøgedal Nr. 0091 Lys #1;Vejle, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Bøgedal Bryghus;Rated on 4-11-2009 at Fort Wayne Gathering. Corked and caged bottle, Brewed 25/3/2008 and Bottled 7/4/2008. Label shows 6.4%ABV. When poured, it was a gusher. It has a white fizzy head that mostly diminished, and the body is somewhat murky. The Aroma is sweet, yeasty, malty, and grassy hops. The Taste is the same as the Aroma plus some spice notes. The Palate is lively and this beer is light-medium bodied. In the end, I did not care for the taste all that well as it seemed to be somewhat disjointed as the flavors just did not jive like they should have. This is not a beer that I would recommend.

Bøgedal Nr. 0091 Lys #1;Vejle, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Bøgedal Bryghus;Bottle, 75 cl. Comes af brew number 279, ABV 6,7. The wife of the brewer, who sold me this, told me that this is Bøgedals take on the original recipe of the now defunct Brøckhouse celebrated IPA. It pours a very cloudy, beautiful orange with quite a huge, foamy white head. Fruity nose with a spicy, slightly citric edge, notes of grapefruit, orangepeel, apples and caramel. Taste is sweet citruszest, medium to heavy bitter. Dry, medium long, slightly astringent finish. Wellbalanced with a minimal but recognisable subnote of barnyard. Easily the best, Bøgedal I’ve had.

Bøgedal Nr. 0091 Lys #1;Vejle, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Bøgedal Bryghus;0.75l corked bottle that has been cellared for about one year. DAMN! The cork really REALLY popped! Think I might have given the next door dog a heart attack. I sure as hell got spooked into a different dimension.. This beer start off as a light blurry glowing-amber beer, but as you get closer to the bottom it turned really hazy and in the finish it’s really really packed with tons of sediments and it’s actually on the border of being murky. It has a big fantastic looking fluffy off-white head. The aroma is lovely fruity with notes of apples, peach, pear, caramel and some suitable alcohol hints. The carbonation is average with these typical small-prickling bubbles and the mouthfeel is light sticky to oily. The flavors are rich, warming, fruity, caramel, extremely balanced with woody hints and a perfect little alcohol twitch towards finish. Really really good! 10.01.2012

Pours a murky orange-amber, not all that inviting in colour but the head is a gorgeous white foam with excellent lacing. It’s malt-forward in the aroma with a good whiff of apricots and peaches, not bright but lush. The flavour is similar but the fruitiness comes to the fore, apricot and peach skin, orange juice. The malts are solid and earthy, the feel is quite full for the style and it carries a nice bitterness. Nice work on this, one of the nicer English PAs I’ve had.

Capital Hopplebock;Middleton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Capital Brewery;"On tap the brewery--this was fun! The waitress serving the beer said that it was way too hoppy for her. My response was, ""OK, bring me a glass of that!"". Orangey-amber with a smallish white head. Very little lacing. Strong caramel malt in the nose. Good ol’ blonde doppleblock taste up front with lots of toffee and candy-corn. Fairly mild bittering in the follow-up, with a reasonably clean finish. The hops certainly weren’t over the top and in fact, they were pretty subtle. Velvety mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Quite yummy."
Capital Hopplebock;Middleton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Capital Brewery;On tap at brewery. This beer pours amber with a nice enough head. Looks identical to the maibock...which looks very much like the blonde dopple. Sweet malt nose, also sweet up front, but finishes with bitterness that few of Capital’s beers have. Very little in the way of hop character or flavor (but more than their other beers, except the pilsner. Since this is an experimental beer, I tried it side by side with the maibock and the blonde. It is third among those two fine beers. I like what Kirby was trying to do, but the hops just do not make it through. Maybe he should try dry-hopping or use a hop back. Not a bad first try (the first tries of Island Wheat weren’t so hot either) so keep it up Kirby...but we all want the dark dopple back!
Vermont Pub Maple Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub in Burlington, Vermont. Pours brown with auburn highlights, leaving a tiny creamy tan head and some residual lacing. Aroma: maple, brown sugar, chocolate. Flavor: malt-forward with maple, brown sugar, chocolate and caramel, following by dish soap and nuts. Mouthfeel: medium-bodied, slightly slick, and a boozy finish.
Vermont Pub Maple Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Pouured into a pint glass, the appearance was a dark red to brown color with a less than a finger?s worth of white head. Messy lace. The aroma had some burnt sugars, dried maple syrup, toast, and toffee. The flavor was basically the same adding some smoky peat, nuts, caramel and coffee. Sly blend of the flavors running into the aftertaste and sliding into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Good carbonation, mostly smooth. Overall, maple flavored scotch ale? Sure, I guess it works. I could see myself having again.
Vermont Pub Maple Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"Two or three draught glasses consumed from February to March, 2007. Burnished dark maple in color, smallish lasting ring of foam....maple certainly dominates the aroma, as others mention, but the alcoholic-raisiny notes and the light peatiness do for me compensate, and this is an attractive if sugary nose....mouthfeeel is a little more problematic, but again I found more in the malts than my Montreal buddies; maybe I just got lucky...it’s sugary, sure, a bit boozy (as much bourbon as Scotch) but really quite drinkable for its size and if you get it at just the right temperature it shows its mysteries nicely without getting too sticky. Not great, not really as good as the regular wee heavy to be sure, but not awful either."
Vermont Pub Maple Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Almost clear light brown body top by a little off-white ring of foam. Some may find this alcoholised-carbonated-maple-syrup interesting (I know of one) but to me this was a poor excuse for a beer. No body, barely any malt flavour, absolutely no hops. Just that maple syrup concentrate. I’m pretty sure that the end result is what they wanted to achieve but I could never drink a full pint of that stuff. Not sure who are the target customers for a beer like that. So syrupy-sweet that it could attracts bees and Yowies (although a Yowie is supposedly a made belief).
Vermont Pub Maple Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;En fût. Verre de 8 oz dégusté à la brasserie. Arôme: Forte odeur de tire d’érable avec une pointe d’alcool. Apparence: La couleur est ambrée avec une très faible densité de bulle. Présence d’un mince col mousseux avec une fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût prononcé de sirop d’érable. Durée moyenne de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture sirupeuse. Faible effervescence en arrière goût. Présence d’érable en arrière goût. (Rating #972)
Vermont Pub Maple Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"My Bottom Line: This maple-flavored Scotch ale screams ""tire d’érable"" (maple taffy?) all the way through, which is fun if you have a hankering for this sticky treat, but if you want a rich and malty scotch ale, you’ll be disappointed by this sugary, thin replacement. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam decorates the hazy amber. -Nose and flavor profile are nearly all maple, although alcohol does make a stiff showing. -Mouthfeel is very lean, but carbonation is appropriate for its size. -It feels like the base beer was an alcoholic amber ale, not a wee heavy. -When you’ve been spoiled by Dieu du Ciel’s Equinoxe du Printemps, you’re bound to shrug this one off. On tap at the brewpub."
Vermont Pub Maple Wee Heavy;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Deep amber in color. Aroma is maple sugar, bourbon, alcohol, caramel. Taste is very sweet- with maple sugar, caramel, and ethanol heat. Too sweet and hot for my tastes.

North Star Oatmeal Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;North Star Restaurant & Brewery;This creamy smooth oatmeal stout would be a dangerous one to have on tap at home. It was very smooth, pretty creamy, and just tasted delicious. Not much (if any) roasted barley noticeable. Plenty of creamy chocolaty flavors very prominent. Exactly what I’d look for on an oatmeal stout. It just felt spot on.
Piece Little White Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap @ the brewpub. Pale golden coloured with a medium sized white head. As far as I understood this is a pilsner brewed with cascade hops. Very well balanced. Right up my alley.

Clear copper with a thin quickly discipating foamy white head. Nose is faint jsut some grassy tones. Taste initially very hoppy. Surprisingly. Tangy and spicy then goeing to lots of barly and grains and oats. Not only very interesting but a lot of fun to drink. This may be one of the best pils I have had. If the nose would have been stronger this would be beyond awesome.
Piece Little White Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at Piece. Poured a clear brighter golden with a light dusting and ring of white head. Aroma took a while to develop... soft bready and pils malts emerge with a mild citrus accent... quite pleasant, but a tad too restrained. Very nice bready malt base in the flavor department.. drier herbal and citrus hoppage.. hint of lemon rounds it out.. quite tasty and very well-balanced. Dry on the palate with a lighter body.. lots of flavor and a great flow. Liked it much!
Brewpub København Sweet Wood Dubbel;Copenhagen, Denmark;Dubbel;Brewpub København;Opaque/cloudy dark orange beer, well carbonated and maintaining a fair sheet of lacing despite the small size of its foam. Not so much of a yeast influence to the flavours. It is rather a fruitily malty ale with citrus, peaches and red berries nuances over a hefty biscuity base. Heavily sweet palate punctuated by mellow carbonation that leaves an oily impression. A bit underwhelming.
Brewpub København Sweet Wood Dubbel;Copenhagen, Denmark;Dubbel;Brewpub København;Draught @ Brewpub, Copenhagen. Clear amber color with a average fizzy fair lacing mostly lasting off-white head.

Very intense taste, almost a bit too vivid. Bitter, full, some sweetness. Caramel is there. Nice smooth carb. I don’t know if this is a bit too intense, in a juice concentrate without enough water kind of way.
Huvila I.P.A.;Savonlinna, Finland;IPA;Panimoravintola Huvila (-2009);Cask (Gallows Bird, Espoo) Excellent immitation of the English style, better than many of the best English examples, and vastly better than the more modern bastardisations of the style.

Staropramen Sládkův Měšťan Triumf;Prague, Czech Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Odd 1.5l bottle shared with and courtesy of ozujsko. It was surprised to find out that this wasn’t on the site... It poured a bit darker golden colour with a big fluffy white head that went away relatively fast. Oily, empty nose maybe a touch of dust and hops. The taste isn’t far off either... a weak note of... erm, banana? and salt, some background bitterness. Yup, even Czech Republic, where most good beers are cheap has to have the really dirt cheap and crappy beers... guess to remind the people just how good their regular beers are.

Speedway The Flying Scot;Lacey, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;Nice nose of smoked malts, peat, barbecued meats. Some toffee and caramel as well as a little roast. Pours dark amber with a thin quickly dissipating head. Smoke initially, barbecue, campfire, then some decent underlying sweet malty notes that add a balance to the up front smokiness. A little dark fruit and roast. Lingering dry mouth feel. Smooth and pleasant to drink, Don’t know why this one was rated so poorly, perhaps they got their shit together recently?
Speedway The Flying Scot;Lacey, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;pours dark amber with nice bright soapy head. Tast is way off. I dont know but there is not that much flavor. I tast a little bit of sweet carmal I think. I think this place has a long way to go befor it makes some memeral beers.........come on guys go big
Speedway The Flying Scot;Lacey, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;On draught at the brewery. Aroma is dried dark fruit forward followed by caramel malt and no hop character. Appearance is clear dark brown with a low off-white head. Flavor is also dried dark fruit forward with caramel and roast malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carb bite. Overall, the fruit notes are interesting, but not quite to style at this high of a level.
Speedway The Flying Scot;Lacey, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;Bright dark brown. Buttery...tart apples...thin...huh? Malts are barely there amidst these off flavours. A brewpub should know better than to serve something like this to a paying customer. Unforgiveable.
Speedway The Flying Scot;Lacey, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;Tap – Speedway Brewery A dark amber color with a thick head. This was the best beer at the place. The beer was still thin in flavor but was closer to style than any of the others. Needed more hops and more deeper flavors but this was not bad and I would order again.
Speedway 426 Hemi-Weizen;Lacey, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;[straight from the keg at the brewery] What a treat, this beer is delicious/smooth/ and beautiful. Very faint aroma, flavor is one of the best american hefes I have had, palate is a little watery, but still thick enough to enjoy. Love this beer.
Speedway 426 Hemi-Weizen;Lacey, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;On draught at the brewery. Aroma is low with light wheat and citrus tones. Appearance is slightly cloudy yellow with a low white head. Flavor is solid wheat malt forward with a sweet, citrusy hop balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carb texture. Overall, not bad, but not interesting.
Speedway 426 Hemi-Weizen;Lacey, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;Very pale. Cloudy. Light, slighty fruity Am wheat. Slight tartness in the finish. A bit watery. A real quick knock-em-back sort of beer.
Speedway 426 Hemi-Weizen;Lacey, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Speedway Brewing Company;Tap – Speedway Brewery A hazy golden color with a thin head. This was a easy to drink American Hefe. The beer was good not to tart but lacked the banana and fruity essences these usually have. Need more malts and some better bitter hops.
Zero Gravity New Orleans Blues;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;"Draught pints at the brewpub, Februaty 2007, and a couple of later dates. Faintly hazy/oily gold with just a touch of head; appearance suffers as many beers do here from being poured too cold into a wet (and wrongly shaped) glass, but what can you do? It’s less important than the rest, which is.....biscuity malts and lightly spicy, earthy dry hops in the nose, subtle floral character showing up with some time....quite hoppy and bitter, light honey sweetness on the tongue, the bite at first is very strong but the malts are strong enough to keep it bery drinkable....spicy and grassy, lightly funky in a neverending finish....another finely-tuned pils from one of New England’s best lager brewers."
Zero Gravity New Orleans Blues;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;En fût. Verre de dégustation chez American Flatbread (Burlington, VT). Arôme: Odeur d’agrumes et de céréales. Apparence: La couleur est blonde avec une faible densité de bulle. Présence d’un mince col mousseux et d’une fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût d’agrumes et d’houblons herbacés. Courte durée de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps et la texture sont mince. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. Présence d’agrumes en arrière goût. (Rating #969)
Zero Gravity New Orleans Blues;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Clear blonde body topped by a small white head leaving good lacing. Nothing original, just an uncommonly tasty classic Pils standing head and shoulders above the competition in this over-crowded genre. Everything is crisp about this tasty pilsner. Crisp malted body with a touch of dried honey and dried caramel. Large amount of crisp hops providing a dry herbal bitterness. Long finish with a dry mouth-drying herbal/salty character that makes you wanna go right back at it. Lively carbonation. As crisp, dry and lively as New Orleans… before Katrina.
Zero Gravity New Orleans Blues;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;My Bottom Line: This outgoing Pilsener grabs the tastebuds with its biscuity, honeyed maltiness to better shower it with earthy, wooden, and citrusy hop gifts. A crunchy, intense pils experience whose lengthy herbal hop finish secures its position as a world-class quencher. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the clear(?) honey gold. -Carbonation is pillowy and serves the healthy mouthfeel adequately. -Hops proliferate and dazzle the senses with their complex personalities: orangey, resinous, wooden, earthy, citrusy, herbal, etc. -A German pils with German ingredients, but an Americanized punch. What a novel idea! On tap at the brewpub.
Zero Gravity New Orleans Blues;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;sampled at the brewpub. Golden in color. Aroma is a good amount of earthy/spicy hops for a pils with some grainy qualities. Taste is also dry, earthy hops, pretty hoppy and refreshing.

Gadds Dragons Blood ESB;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Cask at the Harbour Arms Margate - drunk on the harbour wall in the sun. Super tasty ESB here shipmates. Big caramel and that great tightrope between upfront sweet then lasting bitterness. All held by the malts. Delicious.
Gadds Dragons Blood ESB;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Cask@the hare and billet, Blackheath, SE London - Dark amber in colour with tan head. Lots of dark caramel malt with slight hoppy notes but with a exceedingly bitter taste, that was almost to much for me.
Gadds Dragons Blood ESB;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Cask: This is a really nice, hoppy malty ESB. Lots of caramel in the flavour. You’d never guess it’s strength. Couldn’t drink more than a couple though as it could become too cloying.
Gadds Dragons Blood ESB;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);A Mes rate: Gravicask at Planet Thanet. Amber coloured. Malty alcohol nose with plenty hops too. Some very unusual tary notes in the flavour. Hoppy finish. Bland but ok.
Gadds Dragons Blood ESB;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Cask gravity at The Chambers BF 07, Folkestone. I ended up talking to Eddie Gadd about this beer on the Saturday of the Planet Thanet BF. He said that when he put it in barrels, it was so bitter it made his eyes water but that he was really happy with how the hops had softened and how the beer finally turned out. It’s an amber beer with thin beige head. English hop aroma, little bit of cheddar cheese. Malts are reasonably juicy and then lovely floral hop gives a lasting finish.
Nelson Task Force 25;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nelson Brewing Co.;"Cask at the Gardeners Arms, Lewes, 12th April 2008. It appears that this has become part of Nelson’s regular range, as I sampled this a year after Ian and it was simply labelled as ""Task Force"". Clear, still, dark amber. Fruity aroma but luckily the sweetness is balanced on the tongue by the saltiness of the sulphates in the water. Smooth with a good finish. Nice stuff."
Nelson Task Force 25;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask gravity at The Chambers BF 07, Folkestone. I guess this is named after the Task Force sent to the Falkland Islands, 25 years ago. Slight haze on the copper colour with thin beige head. Earthy hop and some rich fruity malt aroma. Very fruity in mouth, fruit salad mix. Surprising fruit and hop finish. Tingly, but still muddy/earthy.
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;Draught at Helsinki Beer Festival 2007. Hazy amber color. Heavy smoke aroma with tar rubber. Sweet flavor with overpowering tar, wood and smoke. I usually like smoked beers but this is simply unbalaced, unclean and unpleasant.
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;"Draught at One Pint Pub, Helsinki Hazy amber color; thin head. Aroma of smoked sausages. The mouthfeel is not very strong, there is a caramel flavor and a strong smoked character, again reminding some Nordic smoked salame; also, salty and with a light metallic touch at the end. Controversial."
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;Draught at One Pint Pub, Helsinki. Hazy reddish amber, minimal head. Heavily smokey with tar, licorice and juniper. Dry with clean mouthfeel and fairly light body. Lightly metallic with notes of blood. Short salty finish. Interesting powerful smoke flavour, but with an unfortunate metallic edge.
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;Draught (Helsinki Beer Festival 2007, Helsinki). Heavily smokey nose. However, the taste is more smokey than any other beer I’ve tasted. Dry ashy oily taste, Very interesting and unusual, if perhaps a little over-the-top.
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;Draught. Hazy dark amber colour, small brown head. Aroma is tar, smoke, malts and some earth. Flavour is smoked fish, ashes and some malts. A Very pleasant really smoked beer. This was still smoother than the Schlenkerla’s...
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;Helsinki Beer Festival 2007. Smells sausage, smoke, tar. The smokiest beer around. Hazy dark red, with a small beige head. Nice.
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;(Draught) Dark coppery colored, little yellow head. Aroma is strong: smoke, ham, tar, not very traditional smoke beer still. Medium bodied. Flavor is over-smoked: tar and smoke dominate so strongly that this is hard to finish. Slightly dry aftertaste with only smoke.
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;Draught@HBF2007 Dark amber color, not much head. Strong nice aroma of smoke and tar, like in Finnish tar-licorice candies. Very malty, dry woody mouthfeel. Juniper and smoke dominate the flavor. Interesting rauchbier with kind of sahti influences.
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;(Draught@Helsinki Beer Festival 2007) Heavily tarry and smoky aroma. Red brown colour and average size, light brownish head with fair lacing. Heavily tarry and slightly smoky flavour. Medium-bodied, softly carbonated and dry palate. Way too smoky/tarry beer! 13/04/07
Stadin 1.6.2007;Helsinki, Finland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadin Panimo;(Draught@HBF 2007) Very hazy dark red-amber with no head. Very strongly smoky-tarry aroma with sweetish maltiness. The dryish flavor is smoke, tar, and ashy wood. Medium-bodied, slightly thin palate with low carbonation. Well, it is indeed smoky, and although not the most balanced brew, I’ll choose this over tobacco smoke any day :)

The aroma has notes of yeast, malt, light sweetness and fruit. The flavour has sweetness and notes of malt, yeast, spice, fruit, candy sugar and some citrus in the finish.
Scheldebrouwerij Jubileumbier 12,5 jaar;Meer (Hoogstraten), Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Scheldebrouwerij;Bottled. Cloudy pale amber, small head. Pineapple aroma. Sweet with custard and orange. Medium bodied with clean mouthfeel. Simple, but edgeless and quite enjoyable.
Back Street Austmarr Baltic Porter;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Porter - Baltic;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);On tap in Irvine. Dark brown, tannic colored pour with some ruddy mahogany hues and a thin layer of cream head. Aroma of dry chocolate powder and a touch of prune skins. Not overly fruity, but plenty of dry dark malts that aren’t overly roasty. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel. Dark caramelly malt flavor that again, is neither roasty or fruity (and I don’t mean that in the estery sense), just a lot of dry dark malts. Medium weight chocolate a faint hint of vanilla. Some dry, nutty coconut husks linger pleasantly in the final smack, along with some enjoyable minty hops.
Back Street Van Sants Belgian Blond;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);On tap in Irvine. Pours a very pale gold color with a thin layer of quickly dissipating white head. A very light phenolic banana odor seems to be emanting from this mess, but its mostly DMS that shines through for me. Lots of canned corn liquid, riesling grapes (although not sour), and confectioner’s sugar in the nose. Light bodied, thinly carbonated mouthfeel. Thin, pale malt character with a hint of bandagy phenol spice and some DMS left lingering on the palate. No hop presence detectable to my palate. To me, this beer tastes the way I would expect a cream ale to taste if it were accidentally fermented with a belgian yeast strain. Doesn’t work for me.
Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);From Hungary store, brewed in Hunvary- with corn :( A sör nem igazán érdemes tesztelésre. Borsodi sörgyár kukoricás, vízízű, kissé büdöskés terméke. Nem ajánlom senkinek sem. *** 2019 02 06: talán egy hangyafasznyit ha jobb, de nem érdemel több pontot, csak az a kicsi hab miatt, ami megmaradt.
Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);Average aroma, appearance, taste and palate. Decent, somewhat memorable. Rated in the past from the can.
Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);I’ve tasted it on a display. That was my luck. Because this beer was a really artifical one with its own empty and unpleasant characer. Beer for the fitness nation, or what the hell? At least it is retired!
Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);as a hungarian rater, i feel that i should say something good about this beer, but i can’t. i remember that i taste it few years ago, but it was really disguisting, it was like some stimulated nutritional supplements. so it’s a present that it has been withdrawn. Embarrese themselves the croatians, that they brewed it.:)))) (i think it was so bad for them and they export it to Hungary)
Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);because i love Stella Artois pivo i try this one but for me it is very different taste ... taste like shampoo ...very bad
Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);Bottled(500ml). -from Tesco somewhere in Budapest. This one is brewed by Zagrebačka Pivovara (Croatia), and bottled by Borsodi Sörgyár (Hungary). Clear golden coloured, small white airy head. Quite fizzy. Weak malty and faint hoppy aroma with notes of cereals and corn. Sweetish watery finish.
Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);Bottle shared with and courtesy of ozujsko who brought it from Hungary (thanks!) Golden colour, small white head. The nose is primarily soggy cornflakes and dust. Blah. The taste is cornflakes again, watery but a bit oily, weak hopiness. Not exactly offensive but still crap. And useless apparently, as it doesn’t seem to be all that popular in Hungary, the home of some of the most useless pale lagers around. What self-respecting beer would contain both fructose syrup and invert sugar anyway.
Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);Medium yellow and clear. Has a frothy and white head. Mostly lasting. Aroma of not defined citrus. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter. Light to medium body.

Stella Artois Légère (Hungary);Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors);Bottle. Pale yellow clear colour with a nice white head. Weak / weird aroma and taste
Berghoff Light;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Draught at Berhgoff Cafe, O’Hare Airport Blond color. Creamy. Simple, but not bad in its category.
Berghoff Light;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;On tap at O’Hare Airport. The bartender said that this was Berghoff Light, but I’m skeptical that she knew what the hell she was talking about. However, Matt the Braudog does know what he’s talking about, so I’ll rate it here. Pours pale yellow with a thin resisdual head of medium-sized white bubbles. A smell a faint straw-like aroma that also seems a bit like boiled vegetables. Lots of corn sugars abound and the beer has a mid palate blast of lemoney hop tartness. Very watery and quick.
Berghoff Light;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Draft pint at the Chicago-O’Hare Berghoff Cafe. Pretty much what you’d expect ... pale yellow with no head. Corn starchy and tangy. Not good at all. (#2795, 4/13/2007)
Valley Brew Decadence 12;Stockton, California, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Valley Brewing Company;Growler. A hazy amber beer with a yellowish head. The aroma has notes of malt, caramel, phenols, and fruit. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, alcohol, and fruit, leading to a lightly tart finish.
Valley Brew Decadence 12;Stockton, California, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Valley Brewing Company;12oz. brewers bottle, with thanks to AgentSteve! Pours a hazy iced tea color with a moderate off-white head and diminishes to a thin covering. Aroma is ripe and candied dark fruits, caramel, and spicy belgian yeast. Flavor is sweeter, with more ripe and candied dark fruits, caramel and spicy yeast. A nice blend of flavors and enough complexity to keep it interesting. Thanks again Steve!
Valley Brew Decadence 12;Stockton, California, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Valley Brewing Company;Bottle shared by Ted. Ours bright brown with some red hues. The nose is carmely with some oxidation and Belgian alcoholic spice. I get some nice toffee, nuttyness, chocolaty date character. Light carbonation. Slick with a dry finish. I’m told this is over the hill, but its still tasty.
Valley Brew Decadence 12;Stockton, California, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Valley Brewing Company;12oz bottle from KrausenJockey--thank you Steve! Clear copper penny with a 1/2 finger yellowish white head, fair retention. Lots of caramel, raisins, prunes up front in the aroma with leather and slightly tangy tobacco behind. There is also some light yeasty spice. The flavor is pretty well spot-on with the aroma with some light ripe banana notes as well as some lightly toasted bread. Semi-dry finish with minimal bitterness. Other than the dryness, I can’t pick out the alcohol. Big full body with light carbonation. Pretty good Quad, especially by U.S.-made standards.
Valley Brew Decadence 12;Stockton, California, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Valley Brewing Company;Tasted on tap at brewery. Thanks, Steve. A nice clear golden color with a fluffy white head. Sweet fruity Belgian yeast aroma and taste with some candy sugar notes and a silky smooth mouth feel. Excellent.
Valley Brew Decadence 12;Stockton, California, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Valley Brewing Company;Growler. Slightly hazy amber golden with a small, creamy off-white head. Aroma of caramel, fruit and licorice. Quite full-bodied, sweetish fruit - also overripe fruit - and caramel. Absolutely no bitterness. A bit on the sweet side. 110709

De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;1/VIII/15 - 33cl bottle from De Zytholoog / Bierloods (Adegem) @ holidays - BB: III/2010 (2015-1031) Clear deep blond beer, irregular fizzy off-white head, little stable, bit adhesive. Aroma: pretty oxidized, marzipan, sweet, orange peel, sherry. MF: ok carbon, medium to light body. Taste: lots of banana, bit sweet, oxidized, sugary, marzipan. Aftertaste: sugary, sweet, almonds, little bitter.
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Beer made for the Waregemse Bierfanaten since 2007. The name is a local dialect for the greenfinch but also means someone who talks nonsense (at least this is what these people made me believe, I’m not that familiar with their dialect). Thin but creamy, yellowish white, quickly opening head, colour a bright yellowish blond with low fizz. Aroma of apple, chamomille, lemon, honey, iron, leafy hops. Quite neutral onset, minerals, pretty strong carbo, smooth and weakish pale malt sweetness, limited citrus freshness, light spicy hops in the finish but rather thin mouthfeel. Lacks both body and personality.
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Bottle 330ml. Clear medium yellow orange color with small body particles, a average to large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white head. Aroma is moderate malty, spicy, perfume, moderate yeasty, coriander, ginger. Flavor is moderate to light light heavy sweet and moderate bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20091021]
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Cloudy golden with a medium white head. Sweet yeasty aroma with coriander and cardemum notes. Sweet yeasty flavour with cardemum and malty notes. Finished spicy.
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Bottle, 6.7%. Spicy and perfumy aroma, some pine and yeast. Cloudy yellow colour. Small white head. Good sweet flavour with the same spices as the aroma.
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Bottled. A hazy golden beer with a thin off-white head. The aroma has notes of malt, citrus, and straw. The flavor is sweet with notes of straw, citrus, and a bit of malt, leading to a lightly bitter finish. Thanks fonefan for sharing.
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Bottle 33 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours a cloudy yellow with impurities and a firm and lacing white head. Spicy, lightly gingery nose. Medium body, fruit, spices, yeast and phenols. Somewhat astringent finish. 211009
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;&#40Bottled, 1200th Belgian rating&#41 Hazy greenish golden with a smallish, firm and lacy, white head. Pear-fruity, honeyish aroma with strongly grainy pale maltiness in the Stille Nacht style. Flavor is pale-malty, grainy, pear-fruity, herby-grassy-aromatic-hoppy. Almost full-bodied with soft carbonation. Could be more fruity - yet I kinda liked the grainy feel, even as that makes the flavor a bit dull.
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;33cl, exclusive brew, from De Bierloods Adegem, complex brew, not balanced, cloudy, good head, nothing special
De Graal ne Gèsloetie;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Graal;Geproeft in de Heerlijkheid op de Biest Waregem. Zacht citoengeurig aroma, ook een beetje hopgeur ertussen. Zeer zachte maar frisse bitterheid in het mondgevoel. Heeft ook een fruitige moutsmaak tussenin. Een gezellige meerdrinker met aangename nadronk
Redoak Zest;Sydney, Australia;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Looks pretty good in the glass, clear gold with a large fluffy head. Strong lemon aroma that initially had me thinking lemonade ice blocks, but I refined that to lemon myrtle to show that my sophistication level has changed since I was eleven (and there was a spicier note thanks to the ginger). Not much flavour base behind the aromatic start, quite inert really. Thin in the mouth with the aroma dominating, although the carbonation aids pique it up a bit. It really is an easy drinking summer beer that probably should have been released a few months ago for full effect.
Redoak Zest;Sydney, Australia;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Pristine light amber with a perfectly formed whiter-than-white head. Ginger and spice on the nose, well defined, although not much else gets a look in. More very obvious ginger to taste, reminds me of whole pan-fried fish with a ginger and garlic garnish that you’d find in a decent Thai restaurant. Not a heap of substance behind the original ginger kick however, and it finishes dry and a bit thin. Good enough, but I don’t think the underlying beer is that great.
Redoak Zest;Sydney, Australia;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught at Redoak Beer Cafe. This was an odd one. Aroma reminded me of something between a brewed ginger beer and a lemon-lime soft drink, some sourness to it but not in a bad way. Pours a clean bubbly looking blonde body with fluffy white head. Body is quite spritzy, giving a quenching edge to the tart notes of citrus and spice I can taste throughout. Reasonably well made and drinkable, not too heavily flavoured but you wouldn’t want it to be.
Redoak Zest;Sydney, Australia;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;A light and summery thirst quencher, as simple and refreshing as a summer shower. It’s a Belgian blonde ale brewed with the addition of lemon, lime and ginger to create an ale fat with the citric zest implied in the name. It looks very good, clear gold with a tall, enduring head. Smells like summer - ripening wheatfields and lemon groves. Also faint ginger and lime cordial. Very clean and perhaps a bit simplistic for some tastes. Medium bodied and quite creamy. The dominant flavour is lemon-lime ice cream, an impression which is compounded by the brewpub’s icy serving temperature. The finish is tart and mouth-watering, with an interesting herbal note - lemon myrtle, Bridge reckoned and I can’t improve on that. If you were to be critical you might observe that the flavour strays dangerously close to lager shandy territory but there’s just enough going on here to avoid that fate. This is too clean and simple to rate well here but it has its place in the warmer months. (Draught at brewpub)
Billabong Mexican Lager;Myaree, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Billabong Brewing;Seems to be their most popular recipe at the ’do it yourself’ brewery in Myaree. Not that bad considering the recipe is supposed to be based on replicating Crown lager. Much better than Crown that’s for sure...still not great though
Billabong Mexican Lager;Myaree, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Billabong Brewing;Special promotion batch at the Beer Store Morley. It was all going so well until this. I won’t bag it, but I will judge it fairly and honestly, as I do. Extra points for appearance first up, in fact it looks obscenely good for a pale lager. The body a pale, sunny gold with fine, light effervescence. Magnificent, big, dense, rocky snow-white adorns it, retaining for the length a good inch thick, lacing intricately as it empties. Now if it could only stay in the glass! Burnt rubber and 2-stroke fuel on the nose, vapours burn the nostril hairs before, thankfully, fading off. The rubber/fuel mix plays now onto the palate like a very bad Sake. A little soapy in mouthfeel, very light bodied with dwindling carbonation. A touch of leafy hops in back gives evidence of where this beer should be. Not much malt evident in the mish mash of by-products present. Finish is just the same and it lingers unwelcome for a little too long. Not good, I hope this was bad batch. Another try, some time later! (0142, 33cL)
Billabong 4 Hop Ale;Myaree, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Billabong Brewing;Sweet candy malt slight sulphur aroma. Murky Amber colour over excited head great lacing. Sweet malt candy flavour with stale aftertaste. Smooth palate.
Billabong 4 Hop Ale;Myaree, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Billabong Brewing;Bottle. Copper with an inch of off-white head that’s well retained and laces well. Toffee aroma with unusual spices - ginger and mace - earth, grass dried fruit. Light bodied. Taste has sweet caramel, Christmas cake spices, a little appleish sourness. Interesting and very unusual. Very tasty and involving for 3.8%.
Billabong 4 Hop Ale;Myaree, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Billabong Brewing;330ml bottle. Deep copper almost ruby colour with a mild modest head that is very thin. No very clear with a caramel and malt aroma and a sweet backdrop. Strong metallic vinegar flavour that is tart and astringent and not very pleasant.
Billabong 4 Hop Ale;Myaree, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Billabong Brewing;A very American take on a Bitter. Copper color, lots of cotton candy and candy apples in the nose. The mouth is deceptively full bodied and stuff full of hops, but with sufficient backbone. Lingering hoppy finish. Unbelievable for 3.8% ABV. Definetely not shy on the hops and thouroghly enjoyable.
Billabong 4 Hop Ale;Myaree, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Billabong Brewing;Lovely, clear reddy body with an off-white head. Some good clumps of lacing. Good fruit notes on the nose, some apricot and a bit herbal. Citrus in the taste that is not overdone, pine, light to medium body and nice long finish.
Billabong 4 Hop Ale;Myaree, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Billabong Brewing;Special promotion batch at the Beer Store Morley. From the Mexican lager to this, they don’t even compare. Where did they pull this from, a wonderful beer hitting the mark straight off the bat with appearance which gets top marks. Into a tallboy at just on cold. the head is furious and expands straight up and out the lip to settle an inch atop the glass. It looks like a French chef’s hat, a beigish, dense soufflé that holds and needs to be bitten off in order to consume the beer (very bitter indeed!). Big, woody, herbal and floral nose with notes of toasted malts and pale, roasted nuts. Palate is all forest floor and raw, showcasing a complexity that belies it’s modest ABV. Juicy oranges, some aged, dried peaches and apricot dance amongst lots of heavily woody, earthy malt and hops, some gritty toasted grains, subtle hints of pine-nuts and cashews and other surprising, raw nibblies. There is no peak, but a bitterness does kick in late, earthy and herbal before it continues much the same into a long, complex swallow reminiscent of a good Düsseldorf Altbier. The body is firm, quite big and subtly carbonated making it smooth down the back. This was just pure enjoyment and I’m hoping this would be the flagship first beer to hit Perth’s shelves. Wonderfully crafted stuff, deserves two-thumbs up!!! (0509, 33cL)
Old Harbor Taina (Belgian Golden Ale);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Harbor Brewery;Draft at the brewpub in Old San Juan. Pours a pale hazy golden yellow color with a frothy one finger head that has very good retention, slowly fading into a lasting cap. Sporadic spots of lace left behind. Slightly earthy aroma with subtle spice as well as some bread/yeast character. Hints of coriander and pepper as well as some earthy grain. Smells more like an American adjunct lager. Medium bodied and fuller than expected with a subtle sweet citrus presence. There’s some faint hop bitterness up front as well as some peppery lemon zest spice. I’m also picking up some sweet citrus peel, especially lemon, and some bready yeast. Toward the end of the palate there is a really odd dry alcohol astringency and strong, earthy grain flavor. It tastes kind of like an adjunct lager with more of a hop and spice presence.
Old Harbor Taina (Belgian Golden Ale);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Harbor Brewery;Currently a Belgian Golden Ale (Taina is their seasonal brew which changes every so often). Dark golden color , semi murky. Peculiar aftertaste that reminded me of sulfur(?) .
Old Harbor Taina (Oktoberfest);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Harbor Brewery;Bottle@Stop&Go, San Juan. New country #152! Dark copper color, steady beige/off-white head. Aroma has caramalt, and bread. Medium-bodied. Caramel, bread, light earthy hoppyness, hints of alcohol. Quite nice German style beer.Perhaps more like a Märzen or even Vienna than a typical Oktoberfest.
Old Harbor Taina (Oktoberfest);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Harbor Brewery;It's Oktoberfest again. This is Old Harbor answer to the call. Just shy from a real German beer, need more robust flavor. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Old Harbor Taina (Oktoberfest);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Harbor Brewery;From notes, on tap at the brewery. Slightly cloudy color with light foamy head. Nice malt aromas. Flavour of sweet malts, caramel and slight hop bitter.
Old Harbor Taina (Oktoberfest);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Harbor Brewery;Draught @ the brewpub in San Juan. They served a five sample. We were told that this was the 2008 version of Oktoberfest beer. Average fizzy off-white head that mostly diminished. Fair display of lacework. Somewhat clear golden color. Aroma of toasted malt, mild buttery, light flower like dusty notes. Over the palate came mild malty notes with a hint of underlying floral hoppyness. Light bodied with an average carbonation and light dry texture. Light sweet flavor with mild bitterness. Light sweet and malty finish.
Old Harbor Taina (Oktoberfest);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Harbor Brewery;27 oct 07, on tap @ Old Harbor Brewery in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Rotating Seasonal Beer. Hazy, unfiltered, copper color. Light tan head. Unfiltered appearance is very nice. Aroma is sweet and candy like. Very floral. flavors are nutty with a hint of ripe banana and hints of tobacco. Finishes like a lighter colored DunkelWeisse. flavors are very similar to a wheat beer, though hoppier.
Old Harbor Taina (Oktoberfest);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Harbor Brewery;on tap at brewpub. It was an Octoberfest when I visited. 11/24/06. Ok aroma, sweet. Fruity, caramel, lite pumpkinish thing going on. Clean brownish orange color, Small head with ok lace. Sweet flavor. Like aroma. Minor roasty notes. I get a certain taste I associate with pale lagers. Medium body, lite creamy mouthfeel. Clean finish. Not bad, not quite a fruity as most of the Ofest I’ve had over the years.
Old Harbor Taina (Oktoberfest);Carolina, Puerto Rico;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Harbor Brewery;A foggy brown with a nice head. It’s almost like a German enfluenced brown... Pretty interesting. Taste is the lighy caramel, along with pale malts, and a bit of the yeastiness to it. Interesting beer, probably the best of the bunch.
Takao Takau Wit;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Takao Brewery;"Slightly hazy golden coloured body with a thinnish, two centimetre tall pure white head. Aroma of canned corn, light coriander seed, curacao, a touch of citrus and yeast and a dose of mellow sweetness. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong rich wheatie and sweet citrus flavour - just like curacao, along with a dose of bread, alcohol, tart lemons and a touch of grain as well. Aftertaste shows some good qualities and rich flavours, but is a bit mellow and understated. Not a bad beer, and in this heat - a fairly good option, actually. I sampled this 50 cL pure white bottle purchased as ’TK Witbier WHITE’ produced perhaps on 26-December-2016 (the cap shows 20171226) purchased a few minutes ago at Shin Kong Mitsukoshi in central Taipei, Taiwan on 26-July-2017 for NT$120 sampled in my hotel room here next door in central Taipei, Taiwan on 26-July-2017."
Takao Takau Wit;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Takao Brewery;Nearly flat, with fingernail-width white head that is quickly gone. Sweetish, slightly sickening aroma of orange and vanilla. Dull mouthfeel. Flavor is bland orange and a little yeastiness. Extremely watery. Not good at all. Points soley for being a creative beer that is not brewed by a macrobrewery.
Takao Takau Golden Ale;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Takao Brewery;Canned, thanks asedzie! Hazy amber, brief head. Concentrated tangerine aroma. Sweet and fairly light bodied with soft mouthfeel. Some grass and pine needles, but most of all tangerine. Drier salty finish. Like tangerine juice! Well balanced.
Takao Takau Golden Ale;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Takao Brewery;350 ml can. Pours a very attractive dark amber with a slight off-white head. Citric, piney hop aroma. Wow! Powerful hop flavors really surprised me. Flavor is hop bitterness, grapefruit and pine needles on top of a well-rounded maltiness. Very little carbonation. Palate is a little bit thin, but the spiciness of the hops more than makes up for it. Nice bitter, citrusy aftertaste. Definitely a british-style Amber, very close to an APA...Re-rate (4/20/07) These Takau beers seem to have a problem with carbonation. It’s all very inconsistent. One beer willl have an ordinary amount of carbonation, and the next will be almost completely flat. Maybe a canning problem. Anyway, it completely compromises the palate.
Takao Pils;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Takao Brewery;Can. Pours a very nice-looking, slightly dark amber, with an incredibly fat head. Lots of lacing. Smell of wholesome malt and a little prickly freshness of noble hops. Good, well-rounded pils. Doesn’t have the wateriness of the other Takau beers. Good floral hops provide a pleasing bitterness throughout. A very fresh, slightly bitter aftertaste. Very much to the pilsner style. Good job Takau! I hope this sells well in Taiwan, it would be nice to have first-class beer like this on the market here.
Indi Calypso;Mindarie, Australia;Flavored - Other;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;Pale, clear, almost salmon pink body with short lasting head. I don’t know what hibiscus tastes like but I guess this is what features mainly. Dry, almost crisp, thin body although the nose seems to be sweet and syrupy.
Jubilee Onder t schuim;Sint Ulriks-Kapelle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Girardin;Bottle 375ml. Clear medium to dark orange color with a small, fizzy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate twig, tobacco, wood, herbs. Flavor is moderate to heavy apple sweet and light acidic with a long duration, dry dry finsh, and a bit oxidide. Body is medium, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20091211]
Jubilee Onder t schuim;Sint Ulriks-Kapelle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Girardin;"Thanks Bart for keeping this beer for sooo long - Clear deep amber body, beautiful with a big bubbled white head; Very strange aroma, dark cane sugar sweet, at the same time having pilsner malt aromas, at the same time having a very green apple fruity fresh acidity but very little of it; Very very strange body, a mix of a very clear dark cane sugar sweetness and malic sharp acid, very little sharp small bubbled carbonation, very complex and very strange; Long finish with lots of aromas, very herbal dried spices like basil, thyme, oregano etc, again tons of cane sugar sweetness and some malic acid. A very strange beer with a very strange combination of lots of aromatic cane sugar sweetness and a very fine light malic acid. Thanks again!"

Billabong Apple Beer;Myaree, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Billabong Brewing;330ml bottle. Pours like champagne with a very pale colour . Two shades darker than water. Crisp granny smith apple aroma with a flat tart flavour that is dry and bitter on the palate.
Billabong Apple Beer;Myaree, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Billabong Brewing;Bottle (330ml). Poured extremely pale, clear yellow with a tiny, fizzy, white head which was full diminishing. A cider like aroma with sweet skunky apples, barnyard hay and notes of sulfur dioxide – no hops or malts present. Flavor was of sour green apples with watered down apple flavored cordial, a light acidity, straw and some notes of mineral water in the finish. Light bodied with fizzy carbonation, a thin somewhat watery texture and a short finish.
Billabong Apple Beer;Myaree, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Billabong Brewing;"Gluten-free samples now available mainstream at the Beer Store Morley. Fresh crushed ’Pink lady’ on the nose, some ’Majestic’ evident, this aroma is supple but full, fruity and distinctive, as well as sweet to go abridge product description. Cider in the glass: pale, lemon-toned yellow and sparkling. Carbonation is light, tight and fine, no head. Added hint of strawberries on the nose before I quaffed. You could ask what happened, the aroma was full, dense; the palate is heaving dry everything. So thin, effervescent. Apple here, but so dry, attenuated away - don’t think there is much else. Another mouthful, I am sure, apple or bust, it manages to add a tang as it warms - as indeed it did since I started to tire. Gluten free, an absolute gem space saver drink - again a life saver so close to a dry cider - but the monotone just didn’t grasp my attention. Not much here! (0866, 33cL)"
Bobcat Cafe Buels Gore Black Lager;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a black color with a thin white foamy head that dies off fairly quick. Light rings of lace try to stick to the glass. The aroma had some roasty coffee to chocolate malty notes flowing on into a bready mixture. The flavor blends the lager yeasty sweet breadiness to the coffee and chocolate. Flows nicely into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. ABV feels appropriate. Good expected smoothness. Overall, good schwarzbier that I could have again.
Bobcat Cafe Buels Gore Black Lager;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Black body topped by a little ring of tan foam. Pleasantly dry body with a medium carbonation. My main observations were grassiness, roastiness, resinous, a bit vinous and distant cacao. Very nice beer with nice earthy qualities. The best beer I had from this brewpub. Unlike Al, this Gore is a real winner.

Bobcat Cafe Buels Gore Black Lager;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;My Bottom Line: Chocolatey maltiness and its accompanying roastiness attain equilibrium with the help of a savvy herbal hop spiciness. A delicious pint of Schwarzbier which remains flavorful throughout. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam shields the browned blackness. -The lean mouthfeel is lively and crisp. -Malty sweetness sometimes evokes caramel, as well as that dark chocolate. -The hop selection fits the roasty grain bill perfectly. -I bet these guys can do a great German pils too. On tap at the brewpub.
Bobcat Cafe Maple Porter;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Porter;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;On tap at Bobcat Café. This was the Cellar series version aged in Whistle Pig Whiskey Casks.

Bobcat Cafe Maple Porter;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Porter;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;6 ounce draught sample at the Vermont Brewer’s Fest (July 2007). Translucent molasses with little head but some nice lacing.....maple and a bit of roast in the nose, seems like hints of tart wheat which may be out of place but help keep the maple sweetness in check....rather light, sweet but some fairly nice roasty graininess, light chocolate-maple flavors, darkly malty and somewhat chewy mouthfeel.

Bobcat Cafe Maple Porter;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Porter;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;My Bottom Line: A timid profile proffers roasting caramel and maple sweetness, but it is marred by floating oxidation. This pint was not in its best form, that’s for sure. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam crowns the browned black. -The body is relatively well fed. -Roastiness undermines the sweet flavor profile. -Roasted malt bitterness may be rendered more apparent by the prevalent oxidation. -This is really too bad, as the regular Mud Puddle Porter was an undoubtedly competent Porter. On tap at the brewpub.
Bobcat Cafe Mud Puddle Porter;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Porter;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a black color with a thin white foamy head that dies off immediately. Left no lacing. The aroma had some roasty coffee and subtle cocoa powder. Light vanilla tones underneath. The flavor yields to the roastiness first. Blended aftertaste of the coffee and cocoa. Subtle roasty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. Roastiness is there but keeps a good feel on my tongue. Overall, good porter worthy of coming back to.
Bobcat Cafe Mud Puddle Porter;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Porter;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Tap @ the brewpub. Poured a very dark brown-black color. The aroma and flavor were fairly roasty with some sweetness. Semi-dry finish and moderately bitter. Light to medium body. Not a whole lot going on.

Bobcat Cafe Mud Puddle Porter;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Porter;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;My Bottom Line: Crisp roastiness thrives in a healthy body, supported by vanilla notes and cereal humility. A Porter which won’t wow most, but which knows how to hit the right spots. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the brown-sleeved ebony. -The roasty finish soars by a hint of soy sweetness. -Carbonation is efficient for the body size. -This is very drinkable, and its gentle flavors won’t bother those who want a long session. On tap at the brewpub.
Bobcat Cafe Hogback Bock;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Clear copper body with almost no head. Very thin body with minimal malt extraction. Pretty much the opposite of what I expect from the genre. On top of being thin the body felt inert with its lifeless carbonation. Rather sweet and fruity. Some sweet cereals with plenty of fruit flavours, plums mainly but also berries and even distant cherries. Bobcat serves a mean spicy chicken. I recommend it.

Bobcat Cafe Hogback Bock;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;My Bottom Line: Honeyed grain and supporting herbal hops quietly unite in a serene mouthfeel. This Doppelbock fails to render the complexity expected from this style, but it still manages to offer a pleasant malty experience. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the reddish-amber clarity. -Vague fruitiness latches on the honeyed maltiness. -The finish does show some of those noble hops, but the sweet malts overshadow them. -Alcohol does not show up in the flavor profile. On tap at the brewpub.
Takao Black;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Takao Brewery;Canned, thanks asedzie! Very dark brown, brief head. Chocolate sauce features in both aroma and flavour. Sweet and light bodied with soft mouthfeel. The low hop rate gives all attention to the chocolatey malt, and there are some toffee. Finishes with fairly low bitterness. Interesting beer!
Takao Black;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Takao Brewery;Can 350 ml. Pours opaque brownish-black with tan head. Roasty, nutty aroma. Smokey, carmel, roasted flavor with lightly bitter hoppy undertones. Mouthfeel is a little fuller, chewier than the other Takau brews, but could still be a little fuller in the palate. Pretty good. Well-balanced.
Dick's Imperial Bitter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dick's Brewing Company;On tap at Concordia Ale House. An intersting concoction, i’ll start with that. While it did keep its heritage in subtle ways, toasty bready malts, lightly herbal hops, this thing really went for the ABV punch. I’m not sure what the alcohol content was, but it wasn’t hidden well, had a lot of excess alcohol taste and burn. The base beer was nice, the malt character had... well character, it didn’t taste like most american strong ales, building of that caramel malt flavor, this had a little more depth of flavor, getting earthy at times and warm and toasty at other times. The hops were strong, but not a blast of citrus, it had enough bitterness to balance, but didn’t distract from the beer. If the excess alcohol tastes could be reduced this would be exceptional.
Redwood Lodge Maple Porter;Flint, Michigan, United States;Porter;Redwood Lodge Brewery;Sample from the brewpub: Pours a nearly opaque dark brown color with a thin beige head that has good staying power. Spotty lacing. The aroma is Aunt Jemima all the way. Sweet sweet maple in the nose and nothing else. Light-bodied and sweet, with a maple character that is not as pronounced as in the aroma but it is still very strong. There is some brown sugar and malt in the flavor too, but this skews to the sweet side all the way. The finish is sweet and lingering. An interesting experiment but I would have trouble drinking a pint of this.
Brockway Belgian Pale Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brockway Chophouse;On tap @ Ale Fest. Yellow hazy color with a white soapy head.

Brockway Belgian Pale Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brockway Chophouse;This is a light golden ale, slightly hazed, with a respectable white head.

Flying Bison Espresso Stout;Buffalo, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flying Bison Brewing;On cask at Mr. Goodbar 4/13/07. The bartender was nice enough to give me a sample of this brew that, according to him, was specially brewed for the bar. Straight out of the cask, this beer was a rich dark brown and had a small tan head. The aroma was very chocolaty and had a good amount of malt and coffee as well. The flavor was overwhelmingly coffee centered and was very sweet. The beer was quite smooth and had a good mouth feel. I hope they have this on tap again.

Nice roasted malt and chocolate notes in the nose. Medium-low carbonation with a dry mouthfeel. Bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, and maybe a touch of sourness on the palate. A little bit of hops in the background as well. Finishes with a bit of lingering bitterness. Excellent lacing the whole way down. Overall I would say it is a little sweet for the style and a touch on the watery side, but it is still very good and very drinkable.

Flavor is mainly roasty with additional notes of burnt toast, no sweetness/caramel character (as appropriate for the style) and earthy Brit hops.

The Beer Joint Wee Heavy;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Got this years (Fall 2007) preview before it was due (about 3-4 early).

O'Malley's Emerald Lager;Weston, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Weston Brewing Company;From Strykzone via a trade. From the 12 oz bottle this lager poured yellow with small white head and little lacing. Nose of malts and some grassy hops. Light body and not much in the mouthfeel. Flavor is malts and lager, but overall this is pretty bland. Drinkable. Just.
O'Malley's Emerald Lager;Weston, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Weston Brewing Company;This lager has some cloudiness and is the color of honey. The off white head is a little bigger than a finger and it lasts a couple of minutes. The aroma is light malt with some honey. Feel has some decent zing. This beer has some dry hops and some soft malt up front. That soon fades leaving some honey. Soon, even that fades and the beer gets watery. It is unfortunate the beer couldn’t maintain the front end.
O'Malley's Emerald Lager;Weston, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Weston Brewing Company;Draught at the brewery. Yup, another pale lager for the pile. Enough character to make it tasty but nothing really exciting. Refreshing and better than the mass produced lagers out there but just not a lot going on here.
O'Malley's Emerald Lager;Weston, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Weston Brewing Company;(bottle) dark yellow with small white head. Faint malt aroma. Mild lager malt flavor. Middle of the road lager.
O'Malley's Emerald Lager;Weston, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Weston Brewing Company;Pour is a dark yellow with a small white head. Aroma is almost nothing. Maybe some grain. Flavor is a little more grain heavy but still weak and watery with no hop presence.

O'Malley's Emerald Lager;Weston, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Weston Brewing Company;"Pours a pale yellow with lots of ""floaties"" dancing amongst the rapidly rising bubbles and a loose, fizzy, white head that actually hangs around a bit. I’ve never seen another lager with sediment floating in it. The aroma is a muted, dusty blend of light, sour citrus, herbs and faint bread dough. Light, effervescent and quite tart, it finishes drier than any other pale lager that I’ve ever sampled. The flavor is more of the tart, sour, citrus and a light plastic note in the background. I have to believe that this bottle is infected, because it tastes more like a light Berliner weiss (minus the wiess) than a pale lager. If so, I think it may actually be benefiting from the affliction (based upon the other reviews on this page). These guys apparently have some serious bottling issues. I’ve tried 4 of their bottled beers and 3 of them have shown signs of infection."

Aroma picked up light smoke accenting some coffee and chocolate notes.. some darker alcohol sugars emerge as it warms up.. odd, yet intriguing. Alcohol was much more apparent in the flavor, which wasn’t so welcome.. spiked caramel and other dark sugars with some herbal bitterness.. decent. Medium-bodied with alcohol points the detract a bit. Warm finish.
Flatlanders Rendezvous Relic;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;This poured a nearly clear amber body with a respectable off-white head.

Wild Onion ReplicAle American Red Ale;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Onion Brewery;This one was had with a meal of BBQ at the Brewpub. It arrived with the remainder of a nice white head, and the aroma was slightly of malt with a little roast, followed by the piny/spruce hops tingle. The taste was similar except with the malt more pronounced. I recommend it as a cooler weather session brew.
Wild Onion ReplicAle American Red Ale;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Onion Brewery;Very clean and sparkling coppery pour with a decent white head that lingered and laced.

Very respectable entry in the replicale series.
Wild Onion ReplicAle American Red Ale;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Onion Brewery;Served as a honey-hazed, coppery amber under a slight, ecru head.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Hop Bomb;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Orland Park;On tap at Rock Bottom Orland Park. Pours amber with an off white head. Aroma is big on citrus, hops, pine, and caramel malt. Aroma is of citrus, pine, and hops. The hops are very muted, but still present. The hops are also very oily. The citrus is what carries this beer and keeps it drinkable. Backbone is of caramel malt with almost biscuity notes. Lingering citrus and oily hop presence. Alcohol is well hidden underneath all the citrus. Not much of a hop bomb, but a very tasty beer and worth drinking again.

Aroma is floral hops, citrus and pine. Flavor is hops, citrus, pine and caramel malts. A nice balanced IPA but is lacking in the hops department for """"Hop Bomb"""". More of a 3/4 IPA.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Hop Bomb;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Poured draft at Orland Park. The name left me expecting big things, and I wasn’t dissappointed being I half expected Orland to mess it up miserably. Poured a copper color with a nice soapy head. Nice hop aroma that was not so much flowery, but more citrus and piney. Tastes of hoppiness balanced with some caramel malts was a predictable taste, but an always enjoyable one. Great lingering finish that left me wanting another. Look forward to trying again.

The flavor of caramel malt balanced well with the pine and grapefruit flavors. The fact that is balanced so well made it seem less like a Hop Bomb I was hoping it was going to be. Still a very nice IPA though.

Previous rating was 4.2/5 overall (A=7, A=4, F=9, Palate=4, O=18) Poured a wonderful deep copper color, with a great 3 finger head, which lasted for a nice long time. The lacing just clings to the glass with this one. Aromas of pine and citrus with a soft caramel hint round this out. The flavor starts with the upfront hop explosion, but melded somewhere in there were layers of caramel malts, biscuit flavors, and bread dough. This blends excellently with the great amount of grapefruit, citrus and pine flavors. Typical American Style IPA, but has a wonderful uniqueness that doesn’t exactly taste like the rest; it seems a lot more ""fresh"" full of the wonderful resins and oils from the hops. It has something to do with their blend of grains and malts, but also has to be the ambience of the place. This is RB’s best beer...seems that its one of the bartender’s, waitresses, managers, and even the brewmasters favorite as well. They were all drinking there after their shifts while watching the MLB Postseason."
Rock Bottom Orland Park Beervarian Weiss;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Orland Park;cloudy yellow. minimal white head. aroma of bananas and sweetness. flavor is cloves, bananas, spices. spicy palate. light bodied. sparkly finish. one of my least favaorite styles. not the brewer’s fault.
Rock Bottom Orland Park Beervarian Weiss;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Orland Park;On tap at RB-Orland Park. Poured a very assertive cloudy orange-yellow hue with a pretty white head. Aromas are pretty good, largely banana and clove. Taste is similar, wheaty bready character leading into big banana and clove estery goodness. Finishes a touch bitter, but then smooths out. Just the right light bodied feel, with a touch more to the body. Refreshing but flavorful. Yum. I love me a good in-house Hefe with assertive banana fruitiness. This is no exception. Cheers!
Rock Bottom Orland Park Beervarian Weiss;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Orland Park;On draught in Orland Park over the weekend. Poured cloudy with minimal head for a weiss. Aroma of banana. Subdued flavor of banana and smoke. I didn’t think much of this one.
Rock Bottom Orland Park Beervarian Weiss;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park as part of a sampler flight. Decent. Poured a cloudy, medium yellow, served with a lemon. A little astringent at first, but plenty of banana, clove and corriander in this one. Finishes strong and sweet. A typical hefe, in the good sense.
Rock Bottom Orland Park Beervarian Weiss;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Orland Park;On Tap: The autumn version of their wheat beer...Bavarian Hefe Weiss. Pours a light yellow color with rediculous thickness on the head. Great lacing on this cloudy beer. Had immense aromas but even more immense flavors. It was a thicker more full-bodied hefeweizen, with emphasis on the banana and clove. I’m so glad this was unfiltered, it really kept it up there with the best hefeweizens out there.
Rock Bottom Orland Park Beervarian Weiss;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Orland Park;In my mug club mug (I don’t think RB has hefeweizen glasses) this has a cloudy, bright yellow body with a small creamy head. The aroma is rife with banana and clove and a good sprtizing of lemon. The lemon gets a bit strong in the flavor, but overall this is a good refreshing drink. Rock Bottom Orland Park, Orland Park, IL
Rock Bottom Orland Park Beervarian Weiss;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Very traditional hefe...banana and clove to the max...and pretty refreshing all the way around. This one was selling briskly on the Sunday afternoon visit I made, especially among the women I observed. Big cloudy golden pour, ans big long-lasting head. The aroma was all banana and clove. The flavors were banana, clove, cut grass, and vanilla. Pretty well recieved by my fellow bar patrons.
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;This has been the very cheapest beer/alcohol for the buck that I’m aware of in Calgary. I’m almost suspecting that they pour a little rubbing alcohol in the mix at the brewery. You can try to doctor it with pop or juice or whatever, and it still tastes like poison. In the same price range, one should absolutely switch to Brewhouse Prime 6% which tastes pleasantly like beer and leaves one with none of the I’m-killing-myself-for-the-buzz feelings that this crap does.
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;The beer looks like a beer, has a big name brewery behind it, but just tastes awful, why do they do this, nobody with taste buds left would find this drinkable, I’m puzzled why they would sell such a horrible product while promoting the company as a premium brewery. There is not a beer I know that compares to the taste, not one, it’s in a class all it’s own.
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;"Single 355 ml can from the ""ya takes a beer, ya takes ya chances"" ice chest at Park Lane Liquor Store, served in a footed pilsner glass. It’s a powerful (7% abv) super-cheap malt liquor, and while I wasn’t expecting a palatable beverage with a ghetto profile like that, well... ticks is ticks, right? Pours a highly-carbonated golden straw yellow with a pearly, crackling off-white head that evaporates without a trace. Nose is a nasty, dirty melange of straw, corn, green apple, veggies, metal filings, sour cereals, and dirt; flavor is even worse - akin to drinking vomited Campbell’s vegetable soup mopped from a damp drunk-tank floor with a filthy sweatsock into a kerosene pail. Oily texture only adds to the ick-factor. Three sips and ""no mas"" pour moi. I’m out and this sewage becomes my first recorded drainpour. Congrats, Big Rock/Pine Creek/Bow Valley Strong...you’ve managed to score rock-bottom, even lower than Minhas. I want to hurt this beer back..."
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;Big thanks to Homer321 for getting me a taste of this. Pours a clear, slightly dark golden appearance with a white head. Wet grain, hay, grass, and a bit of corn in the nose. A little watery. Unfermented wort flavor. Herbal, watery, and husky flavor. Not good.
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;Can thanks to Kbudd. Nose is corny. Pale yellow. Small white head that dies quickly. Taste is gawd awful sweet and apple like. Sort of like perfume mixed with gasoline. Not gud
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;Can share thanks to Homer321. Light adjunct aroma, doughy, corn. Brilliantly clear, golden yellow, small white head. Sweet, adjunct corny, not offensive.
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;Same flavor as the regular bow valley lager (cheap grain, like the bleached white rice you can buy for $2.50/lb)... Just slightly higher alcohol content.
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;355mL Can. Straight up. Unbridled and savagely disgusting. Alcohol unmasked. Points for colour.
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;355ml can pours a pale golden color with a minimal white head that leaves no lacing. Aroma is cereal grains and grass. Taste is malty sweet with some grassy hop bitterness that has some metallic notes. Please folks do not try this at home, in school or anywhere.
Bow Valley Strong;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Malt Liquor;Big Rock Brewery;Single can purchased from mom and pop store in Calgary, AB on 05/03/2012. Colour: Light and bright yellow with minimal white lacing. Nose: Big malt blast, then settles into fresh corn and finishes with stomach acid. Taste: Medium-high sweet, light bitter, medium-light sour. Typical traits for a low-class beer, even if it is brewed by big rock. Like the nose, pounds and pounds of sweet malt. Fades into a sticky light custard. Capitalizes on sugar addiction for attraction - but that is just not me.
Titletown Beam Me Up Scottysh Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Titletown Brewing Company;caramel, herbs, dough, smoke, red, hazy, tan foam, medium sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, medium body, creamy, soft carbonation,
Titletown Beam Me Up Scottysh Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Titletown Brewing Company;A midly sweet scotch style ale, rich in caramel and nutty character. The head is big and frothy and dark brown. And it stays in the glass for a while, it doesn’t dissipate quickly. the newest member in the family of Titletown brew.
Titletown Beam Me Up Scottysh Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Titletown Brewing Company;Appearance of a deep dark brown with light off-white head that fades quickly. Aroma of smoke, rich malt, and faint hops to prevent the beer from being so one-sided. Lightly carbonated and creamingly smooth it is an excellent representation of the style.
Titletown Beam Me Up Scottysh Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Titletown Brewing Company;The mystery growler at the Cellars tasting. This is a scotch ale done right, but perhaps a little too light. It has a nice smoky aroma, but not too much smoke, as well as sweet malt and rotting fruit. Flavor has a little more smoke and lots of malt sweetness, a fairly sweet beer overall. It could use more alcohol perhaps, and maybe more malt, but definitely a success. Black beer poured from a growler. Low carbonation.
Titletown Beam Me Up Scottysh Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Titletown Brewing Company;Thanks to skyview for sharing this growler. Nice dark brown body. Carob on the nose with a similar body. Smooth
Titletown Beam Me Up Scottysh Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Titletown Brewing Company;Second stop during Wisconsin Trip #2. Straight on tap at the brewpub, pours an opaque dark brown with an off-white head that fades slowly when near room temperature. Aroma picks up smoked grain, caramel, molasses, and a touch of chocolate. Taste has some light carbonation and smooth texture. Finish is smooth and has a slight apple aftertaste. This brew is quite a sleeper. Apr 23 Update: A growler of this brew was brought back to the Twin Cities and was shared among 17 guests on April 20. An unanimous thumbs UP vote by everyone attended.
Legends Founders Honey Weiss;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Draft at Legends Shawano. Another off piece of SHIT brew from Legends. Ill never return to this place based on how bad this beer was. An odd creature, it attempts to add lots of honey to cover up the putrid disgustingness that is this beer’s backbone. Vile. A miserable failure.
Legends Founders Honey Weiss;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;On tap at Legends Brewhouse & Eatery. Clear golden yellow with a thin white head and a lively disposition. Aroma of honey, spicy clove and light banana. Taste of lemon, clove, sweet malt and honey. Finished up a bit astringent.
Legends Founders Honey Weiss;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Possibly the best one i tried all day from these yo-yos. Bright, clear yellow colour, with a large white head. And- drum roll please....A honey aroma!! No way- finally a beer they brewed that actually does, sort of live up to its style. Taste is semi sweet, somewhat acidic. Not as dissapointing as the others, but still another sad brew.
Legends Founders Honey Weiss;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;This one was golden with a short lasting head. There was the feel of the wheat malt and the sweet hops, along with a slight clove. A little light weight even for a Honey Weiss.
Legends Founders Honey Weiss;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Third stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 at the Legends Brewhouse in DePere. This brew is available at all three locations. Straight on tap at the brewpub, it pours a light golden yellow brew with a lot of carbonation. I asked the bartender to NOT serve it with a slice of lemon as the drink is usually served. Aroma picks up light straw and a touch of hay with light sweet hops. Sweet clover honey is slightly detected. Taste is very carbonated with some slight saltiness. The lemon slice added more character to this honey weiss. Not much yeast or wheat aftertaste in the finish but still a very light American wheat beer.
Legends Longtail Light Lager;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;On tap at Legends Brewhouse & Eatery. Straw yellow with a thin white head that leaves minor lacing. Aroma of grassy hops and sweet malt. Thin and easy drinking brew tastes of sweet malt and mild hops with a dry finish. Just another light pale lager.
Legends Longtail Light Lager;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Pours a golden-orange colour with a thin white top. Aroma is hard to figure out, barely anything picked up but saaz hops and potatoes. Mouthfeel is relatively light, taste is light, watery and stale.
Legends Longtail Light Lager;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;LIght golden color with a smallish white head. Hints of dough and pale malt. Flavors of very light caramel and stale hops. Again I catch some earthy malt, or old malt extract parts. Quite dry in the finish and linger.
Legends Longtail Light Lager;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;N tap at the restaurant. Yellow color with little head. Aroma of faint hops and diacetyl. Taste is diacetyl, light stale hops, light malt. Why did I ask for the 22oz size? Blech.
Legends Longtail Light Lager;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Third stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 at the Legends Brewhouse in DePere. This brew is available at all three locations. Straight on tap at the brewpub, it pours a very light golden yellow brew with a lot of carbonation. The white head disappears quite quickly with good lacing. Aroma is very light with hint of white bread and some barley malt. Other faint scents picked up include bananas, toffee and butterscotch. Quite interesting for a light American lager. Taste is highly carbonated with a slight oily texture. An average light finish as most light lagers have.
Legends Ixtapa Blond;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;While I was told quite a couple times this beer was like a Corona- I really wouldn’t give it that much credit. Pours a translucent, bright golden colour with a medium size white head. Aroma is sort of grainy with a hint of grapefruit. Taste is watery, moderately malty on the palate with a corn like finish.
Legends Ixtapa Blond;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Light straw color with a somewhat fizzy head, even in the frosted mug. Mild grass, light dough and touch of chalk. Mild sweetness in front with a touch of malt and simple sugar. A touch grainy. A simple light brew.
Legends Ixtapa Blond;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Third stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 at the Legends Brewhouse in DePere. This brew is available at only the DePere location. Normally served with a slice of lime, I asked the bartender to hold the fruit. Straight on tap at the brewpub, it pours a light golden yellow brew with a lot of carbonation. The white head disappears quicky but gives a nice lacing. Aroma is very faint with characters of hay, light white enriched bread, and butter. Taste is very light with some toasted malt. Though a thin body, not very much finish to this one, some malted grain but nothing else that really stands out. Add the lime, ahhh, much better. Another above average light beer.
Legends Acme Amber Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;A putrid brew form a putrid brewery. This one is light bodied, tangy, and infected even when fresh on tap.
Legends Acme Amber Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;On tap at Legends Brewhouse & Eatery, Howard, WI. Amber with a medium white head and lively look. Aroma of caramel, lightly toasted malt and mild hops. Taste of over roasted malt, mild caramel, a touch of lemon and scant hops. Meh.
Legends Acme Amber Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;On tap at Legends in Hobart. Pours a clean amber color with a thin off-white head. Aroma is nutty grain, some hops, and caramel malts. Taste is about the same, with some nice medium hop taste. Very drinkable and I think it is more of an APA than an Amber.
Legends Acme Amber Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Rating this beer on style alone, i would have given it a 2 all the way through. But because it was drinkable, i rated it a little higher. Pours a clear, amber colour with a thin white head. Aroma is of stale hops, oak and perhaps a little almond. Mouthfeel is light, watered down. Taste is overly malty, with a barely noticeable hop finish.
Legends Acme Amber Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Umber copper color with a medium, light beige head. Light caramel and brown sugar scents. Light flavors with a old malt extract component. Lacks body, hops, and flavor.
Legends Acme Amber Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Dark amber brew with a lasting off-white head. Sampled at Ashwaubenan location. Some toasted grain, a little buttery (Bad?). A smooth finish. Nothing outstanding, but highly drinkable.
Legends Acme Amber Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Third stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 at the Legends Brewhouse in DePere. This brew is available at all three locations. Straight on tap at the brewpub, it pours a semi-clear amber brew with an off white head that slowly disappears. Nice lacing, maybe a little above average! Aroma picks up some nutty roasted grain, toffee, butter and a touch of chicken broth. Flavor is average with some hints of butter and a light smooth finish.
Legends Nicolet Nut Brown Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Draft at Legends Shawano. Unfiltered deep amber brown. Thin, oddly chunky beige head. Sweet buttery toffee aroma. Ridiculously off, this is the worst WI homebrew you can imagine. Disgustingly sweet with buttery offness pervadign the whole picture. Ringwood yeast gone absolutely wrong? SHIT SHIT SHIT.
Legends Nicolet Nut Brown Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Third stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 at the Legends Brewhouse in DePere. This brew is available at only the DePere location. Straight on tap at the brewpub, it pours a dark brown brew with an off-white head that disappears at average speed. It leaves a sparse but good lacing. Aroma picks up roasted barley malt, butty grain and some grain meal. Flavor is medium body with a fizzy and semi-smooth finish. One of Legends Brewhouse (DePere) better brews.
Aqula Hana;Akita, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Aqula;Slightly hoppy nose, some yogurt. Fizzy mouthfeel, full bodied. A little tart, more yogurt, flowers and a hoppy finish. Quite nice and a little unique.
Aqula Hana;Akita, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Aqula;Pretty sure this must have been the one, in Devil Craft Tokyo (sakura yeast lager). Slightly cloudy yellowish colour, more like a wheat beer. Taste is clean but has hints of yeastiness and some fruit in the flavour. For a non hoppy lager I thought this was really interesting.
Aqula Hana;Akita, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Aqula;On tap at Wachi Grill and Smoke, Kyoto. Cloudy yellow\orange colour with a small persistent head. Complex fruity aroma with hints of yeast. Fruity and bready flavours. Lightish body. Intersting beer made with cherry blossom yeast.
Aqula Hana;Akita, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Aqula;Not exactly a fruit beer, it is brewed with yeast gathered from cherry trees. Interesting idea. Very cloudy, orange-yellow color with lace. Muddy looking. Sweet malt aroma, yeasty, buttery, with a touch of caramel, a bit of citrus and some cherry. Sweet, creamy flavor with a bit of fruit and citrus. Yeasty too. Too sweet. Almost no hops recognizable. Thick and creamy palate, though, and an interesting yeast character. Original. Would be great if not so sweet.
Aqula Hana;Akita, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Aqula;Hazy amber color. Plum wine, grapes and flowers dominate the slightly sour nose. Sweet, soft, malty, musty mouth with white peaches. The nose and mouth are quit different. Dry peach finish. Unusual and interesting. Definitely worth a try.
Aqula Hana;Akita, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Aqula;"Sour fruit aroma; cherries and tangerine. Makes me think Lambic. Cloudy dark yellow. Powdery mouth feel, bubbly like baking soda. Not the sour fruit flavour I expected. Very soft and gentle. Grows on you after the first surprise. Could drink a few pitchers."
Peak Ales DPA (Derbyshire Pale Ale);Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peak Ales;Cask At Sheffield Tap. Brown with some white on top. Smells like beer. But sweet. *sorry, I’m being dismissive*. Not my kind of beer. My dad would like this. He likes brown beer from the countryside.

Peak Ales DPA (Derbyshire Pale Ale);Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peak Ales;Cask-conditioned at the Bag ONails, Bristol 22/12/08. Deep amber in colour with no head. fruity, sweet aroma with some grassy hops. Sweet flavour of caramel and red fruit, with a short bitter finish. Ok, but not hugely memorable.
Peak Ales DPA (Derbyshire Pale Ale);Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peak Ales;Cask, gravity, at Nottingham Beer Festival ’07. Orange amber. Pleasant fruity aroma. Sweet malty taste with some ash and low bitterness. Fair enough
Peak Ales DPA (Derbyshire Pale Ale);Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peak Ales;Cask conditioned at The Lathkil Hotel, Over Haddon, Derbys. Gold orange with white head. Thinnish fragrant bitter, a touch of peach skin I think. Dry and bitter, although some caramel, toffee boiled notes apparant. it’s ok but not brilliant.
Peak Ales DPA (Derbyshire Pale Ale);Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peak Ales;Cask (gravity) various beer festivals April-June 2007. Not too pale, fairly malty, good lingering dryness though.

(Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Ramsgate Gadds Cobbs Revival;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Cask: Lots and lots of yeast in both the aroma and flavour. Little malt, this one is weird. It’s nice enough but I wouldn’t really want to go back for more.
Ramsgate Gadds Cobbs Revival;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);A Mes rate: Gravicask at Planet Thanet. Malt, straw and heavy yeast. Just straw and hay really and very little else. Not great at all.

Made with the original Cobb’s yeast as a special for this festival. Gold colour with no head. Very yeasty distinctive beer. Quite minerally, but a lot of unbrewed malt I thought. Certainly interesting.
Potbelly Crazy Daze;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Potbelly Brewery;10/2/2019. Bottle from Bottle Mix, Kettering. Pours golden with a just off-white head. Aroma of hops, fruit, caramel, grass and straw. Medium sweetness and moderate bitterness. Moderate body, slight oily texture, soft carbonation. Quite an ok bittersweet finish. This for me was about the best of a disappointing set of Potbelly bottles that we got from Bottle Mix, and the only one that scraped a 3.
Potbelly Crazy Daze;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Bottle from Bottle Mix, Kettering. Nice head with good duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are grain, malt, hops and little fruits.

Aroma of honey, light toffee, caramel, boiled sweets, some fruit and subtle orange peel. Taste of honey, boiled sweets, light toffee, a hint of caramel, some fruit, slight orange and subtle grassy hops. Medium bodied and an oily texture. A bittersweet, fruity, grassy hop bitterness in the finish. A sweet, honeyed beer with slight boiled sweet and fruity aroma and flavour. Was expecting more from the ABV. Below average.
Potbelly Crazy Daze;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Aroma of lemon and grass. Hazy, golden, minimal white froth. Taste medium sweet with fruity flavours prominent. Slick texture soft but lasting on the palate. An Alco pop. Roll on winter.
Potbelly Crazy Daze;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Tried at the Threekingham Beer Festival. Hazy pale gold colour light fruit aroma. But the taste was weirdly sour.
Potbelly Crazy Daze;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Lamb & Flag, Oxford. Gold with white head. Boiled caramel flavours from the off, toffee, then a sicky, fruity flavour. Not for me this one.
Potbelly Crazy Daze;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Cask at Rushden Historical Transport Society Club. Hazy gold with a bit of white head. Considerable lacing. Aroma of lemon sherbet, a bit of fresh citrus and strawberry. Bittersweet taste with a hint of peppery hop. Passable beer but in all honesty I’d like more considering the ABV.
Potbelly Crazy Daze;Kettering, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Potbelly Brewery;Cask at the Merchants Inn, Rugby, 12/03/14. Very lightly hazed golden with a moderate off white head that retains well. Nose is straw, lemon rind, musty tones. Taste comprises orchard fruit, bready, musty fruit pangs. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, drying close. Very so so affair veering towards twiggy nonesense.
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Aroma of sweet malt, with some off aromas. Deep red amber clor, with a tan head that hangs a while. Off sweet initial taste. Not right. Sweet malt, that is off, with peppery notes at the end. Finishes sweet, like diet soda. Watery finish. Could not finish.
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);(drain pour and ticks’ night) pours clear golden, orange to red tint with a decent off-white head, little retention. some sugary caramel malts, faint cereals, hint of minerals, wet grass and bland herbal hops. almost aggressive carbonation, light body - watery. unimaginative but not horrid.
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);This one is quite bad. Even when living with friends in our late teens we disliked it. Cardboard aroma. Extreme chemical flavour. No head, but I’d really like to know why it’s red... if the government ever mandates ingredients on beer cans this brand will disappear overnight.
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);355ml can pours a pale amber color with a finger and a half of white head that settles quite quickly leaving no lacing behind. Aroma is light caramel and faint hops. Taste is light caramel malt sweetness and undesirable hop bitterness. Slightly below average macro lager.
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Originally rated October 2007. This one only comes in a 24 pack (if you want bottles). It is part of the dollar-a-beer brews. Pours a copper-red colour with a tanned head that leaves good lace all around. The nose is pretty decent at first, then kind of disappears. The mouthfeel has a nice wetness for refreshing purposes, but also sticks a bit too. The taste surprised me too, with some nice malts found in red beers, but then lands into the typical corn-based finish. Overall, was quite please with this one for the price and for a hot summer night.
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);6-packs of cans available at my local Beer Store. Was mildly interested in a cheap beer that might actually have some flavor to it. Unfortunately the flavor is highly artificial and sweet, and not very enjoyable. You can tell it’s a cheap beer, and a guaranteed hangover. caramel and malt scent and flavored. looks actually not bad, a ruby amber color with a white foamy head. Nothing else worth mentioning.
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);355ml can. Well, it’s better than any other Lakeport beer I’ve had, which is quite an honour of sorts. Colour is red with a large, almost pink head, and the flavour is basically brown-sugary soda water. It’s actually not as nauseating as you might fear it to be. But alas, it is still crap, but it gets you drunk, so you drink it because in the given situation you don’t know any better. What a strange and uncomfortable scene.
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Can-LCBO- Ruby red, huge off white head, not a bad looking beer at all. Musty-mown grass aroma, some artificial type scent coming through too. I think you needed to see my face for a true description of the taste--- have you ever gone to youtube and searched for kids eating lemons? Just foul, sour and sweet, carbonated, metallic finish, fookin hell, this is awful, only slightly better than lakeport ale,,,, shudder
Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);My gf hates beer but after 1 can of this her mind was changed, very drinkable, will not get you really drunk-see my profile for my motives, but for mixed company..the ladies seem to like it.

Lakeport Red;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Can 355 ml Appearance :Pours as clear darkened amber with hint of ruby red, medium large fizzy top (off tan). Fragmental lace. Nose :Sweet mineral , caramel like aroma , light hint of generic bitters. Flavor/Palate : Thin bodied , soft malty base with hint of caramel , soft grainy finish with industrial feel to it. Fizzy with out substance, very light. Shallow would describe this beer properly. Close your eyes and it will be hard to guess this brew is of dark tint. Artificial coloring? It is not horrible but middle of whole sale discount pack.
Stone Arch Lock Bock;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stone Arch Brewpub;Tapper served a very dark red with minimal head and lacing. Aroma was of sweet malts. Taste was of sweet malts with a strong vanilla hint there as well. Very lightly hopped. Mouth was good. Overall, a unique tasting bock but not a bad one.

Stone Arch Lock Bock;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stone Arch Brewpub;Pour of a dark brown with a nice creamy head. Palate was real smooth and had a slight taste of soy souce mixed in with the vast amount of malt. Not bad but not all that good. I probably wouldn’t buy this one again. Nothing that great.
Stone Arch Lock Bock;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stone Arch Brewpub;New in 2007, just tapped in late March and still available in April. Pours a clear medium brown brew with a large off-white head that diminishes to a good lacing. Aroma of roasted several barley malts, caramel, and a touch of vanilla. Flavor is quite interesting for a Dunkler Bock, long duration and quite sweet. Just barely touching a barley wine territory but not sweet enough. Finish is creamy and slick with soft carbonation.
Stone Arch What The Helles Bock;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Stone Arch Brewpub;I love the name of this Mai Bock style brew. Pours a deep amber brown with a large white head and average lace. The aroma hints of caramelized malts, overly ripe apricots, very aromatic hops, and a touch of yeast. The taste is very malty and wheat bread, with hints of sweet fruit and mild honey. A little bitterness towards end, but very hidden until I took a third taste. The palate is soft and medium-bodied. What the heck, one more for the road.

Slightly above average overall.
Le Trou du Diable Weizgripp Hefeweizen;Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Le Trou du Diable (Six Pints - Molson Coors);A hazed amber weizen with a thick frothy mocha head. In aroma, classic fruity malt with loads of cloves, bananas and berries. In mouth, a nice herbaceous weizen, bananas, cloves, wood extract. On tap at Vices et Versa, Nov. 3 2012.
Le Trou du Diable Weizgripp Hefeweizen;Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Le Trou du Diable (Six Pints - Molson Coors);On tap at TDD. Pour a amber brown with small offwhite head. Aroma is fruity (pears, banana), bread, vanilla, caramel. Taste is a little too sweet for a hefeweizen and lacks the strong wheat presence. Mouthfeel is a little too light. Although not bad at all, I don’t like the weizgrip series. They aren’t flavourfull nor refreshing.
Le Trou du Diable Weizgripp Hefeweizen;Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Le Trou du Diable (Six Pints - Molson Coors);"Ambrée et voilée, une mousse typique la coiffe alors qu’elle laisse une dentelle baveuse aux parois du verre. Les odeurs, qui ne sont pas très prononcées, sont de blé, de produit de bananes et quelque chose d’acidulé qui s’apparenterait aux agrumes et parfois, des effluves de phénol s’immiscent dans le décor. Le goût se ressemble, il y a du blé, c’est acidulé, des saveurs de pain aux bananes avec une touche épicée. Elle ""bouge"" bien en bouche, alors qu’une faible amertume est ressentie en arrière-goût. (411-251012)"
Le Trou du Diable Weizgripp Hefeweizen;Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Le Trou du Diable (Six Pints - Molson Coors);My Bottom Line: This chewy Hefeweizen develops mild caramel within talkative banana esters and clove phenols, but it is the sweetish cereal girth and its tight link with the doughy yeast which stands out in the long run. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the amber-golden. -It is a tad heavy and sweet for the style imho, steering it away from high drinkability. -The yeast is intensely doughy, and becomes a bit vegetal at times, as though it’s overworked. -Orange-like fruitiness stems from the union of light caramel sweetness and flourishing esters. On tap at the brewpub.
Le Trou du Diable Weizgripp Hefeweizen;Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Le Trou du Diable (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Muddy and opaque yellow, darkish. Lazy white head slowly diminishes. A very yeasty and rather sulphury nose. Not overly estery. Very active effervescence. Airy, medium mouthfeel with tight, but still rather agressive carbonation. Musty upon the finish. Little esters nor phenols. Just not terribly tasty really except for the overwhelming yeastiness that would benefit from being more expressive.

Gallo Ice;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Livelier carbonation and more substantive (compared to the paperthinness of its brandmates) than the other Gallos, this was a worthy beer in the evening heat of Peten

The Livery Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;The Livery;Barely legible notes from RBSG 2010 - I think this was poured on the bus to Dark Horse? Brown brew with a bit of rust colour and a white cap. It’s 9AM - let’s drink! Aromas that are sour and funky and unique - wood, cherry I think and caramel similar to Coke. Wha? Hot, sour burn and big yeasty flavour, leaf, sour red apple, apricot, dirt, hop heat. Quite bitter considering. This is very sour and very nice. Loses out when a bit warmer.. not sure how that happened with the endless amount of beer available.
The Livery Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;The Livery;Draft. Pours a deep copper brown color with a small whitish ring. The aroma was soft acidic sour/tart with some fruitiness. The flavor was more like a sour brown with tart cherries, acidic, some malt sweetness. Strange and interesting at the same time. Not like any other dopplebocks I’ve had. Although here it is not listed as a dopplebock. The 10% is well hidden.
The Livery Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;The Livery;A: The pour is a dark caramel color, perhaps light brown, with a white head. A bit on the light side for a doppelbock. S: The nose is quite tart with plenty of sour cherries and cola. A hint of chocolate and miscellaneous fruit notes, and undertones of toffee and malt. T: Plenty of sourness on the flavor as well. A fair bit of vinegar, but it works nicely with the cherries, cola, toffee, and caramel. This is sort of reminiscent of an oud bruin. M: The body is medium with a solid carbonation. D: Some other beer drinkers were not huge fans, but I liked the way this one turned out. Of course, I like almost anything that’s sour.

Flavor much the same, herbal/grassy, malt character rather lite. Mouthfeel is a chalky, drags the beer down.
Fort Street Vitamin Pils;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: The aroma is very grassy, floral, and earthy with a hint of grape.

River City ESB;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Tap at brewery. Pours a deep, cloudy cheddar orange. Aroma reminds me of a bathroom urinal minus the freshening mint. Hints of sewer water dangle from the nosehairs. Tastes like blunt and tangy sour rose hips with a weak buttery malt finish. Watery mouthfeel. This is a lackluster effort at best.

Le Saint-Bock Brown Ale Omega-3;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Le Saint-Bock - Brasserie Artisanale;Objectively speaking: A toasty and roasty ale of pretentious lineage and little character. I like: Malty approach. Gently roasty. Soft nutty tones. Smooth edges. I dislike: Generally bland. No head retention. Dull palate, very very low carbonation. This was initially served as their IPA - scary moment. Not very developed toasty side.

Nodding Head BoHo Pils;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Nodding Head Brewery;Medium yellow gold in color with a thin whitish head. An extremely dry pilsner that is fairly light, a tad bit hoppy, and perhaps a tad skunky. No malty sweetness here at all. Smooth with a nice crisp finish.
Nodding Head BoHo Pils;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Nodding Head Brewery;Golden with a nice head. Aroma is slightly malty with sold hops. Crisp. Clean. Tasty as hell. A touch of corn but that does not detract. Good pils.
Nodding Head BoHo Pils;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Nodding Head Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Note: I was really hoping to have their Berliner Weisse, but these wankers took it off to save it for f-in Philly Beer Week, so instead I had this. Aroma was crisp and a bit snappy, light lager-inflected alcohols. Pours a slightly hazed pale and bright golden. Flavors were rich and lightly nuanced with some delicate grassy notes. However, it didn’t quite have the complex pilsener malt depth I was looking for. Seemed a touch light for the style.
Nodding Head BoHo Pils;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Nodding Head Brewery;Tap at Nodding Head (beerofthebike).

Boring beer with nothing going on."

Flossmoor Station ReplicAle American Red Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draught. At the brewpub. It was pretty cool having this about 2 hours after having the Three Floyds version. Clear mahogany with a good-sized creamy beige head. Nutty sweet roast malt aroma, some dry resin hops, light herbal and chocolate notes kicking around in there somewhere. Taste is more carbonized and wheat/grain -y, bitter, almost burnt finish, but a little too mild for all that. Solid body, soft mouthfeel, light astringency and an alcohol presence that was only middling yet seemed a little much and tended to seem overpowering by the finish. I quite liked it, the TF version was IMO a better effort, but the fuggles came through more with this one and certainly made for an interesting taste.
Flossmoor Station ReplicAle American Red Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Chicago trip. Saturday 12:31. Sample tray. Mahogany colour. Malty nose. Some hops. A bit tired compared to the Panama. Some woody notes and hops. A bit thin.
Flossmoor Station ReplicAle American Red Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Flossmoor. Poured a clear, garnet-tinted amber with a short off-white head. Sweet, lightly-smoked caramel and rye give a nice first impression on the nose.. some darker, woodsy notes represented.. room temperature brought out dark chocolate.. good stuff! Chocolate hits first in the flavor with deeper floral hoppage surrounding.. caramel as well on the base with grainy chocolate sugars and pine bitterness toward the sides.. quite tasty. Almost creamy middle on the palate.. a bit too sharp at times with bitterness and scattered boozy notes at the edges.
5 Seasons North Haiku Belgian Tripel;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Tripel;5 Seasons North;Bottle at 5 Seasons North. Seems to have a bit more yellowishness than the standard tripel but it could be the light. A bit hazy. Flavor starts out full and sweet, nice big tripel flavors but the yeast is missing. Instead there is a taste of chardonnay (this must have been aged in chard barrels) that adds an element of tart/sour that i’ve never had in a tripel, also some nice oak flavor... i like it! It does seem a bit wrong to call this one of my favorite tripels when it lacks a key traditional characteristic and adds some abnormal ones, but i’ll do it anyway. Thinner and more dry on the finish, again uncharacteristically. Quite complex overall, which makes me love it more. One of the best and most unique tripels i’ve had.
5 Seasons North Haiku Belgian Tripel;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Tripel;5 Seasons North;Appearance: Pours out a lightly hazed, golden body with a thin layer of white foam that dissipated out fairly quickly. Smell: Sweetish nose of pils malt dipped in golden syrup and punctuated by some alcohol and fragrant white peach tones and fainter notes of spice and citrus. Taste: Sweet tastes of pilsner and pale malts boosted further by some candi sugar influences and a perceived taste of wildflower honey. In rolls a warming alcoholic quality and taste of peaches, giving it a taste of fine peach schnapps. Hint of lemony citrus. Spicy flavor reminiscent of dried coriander. No more than a tiny bit of bitterness. Continually drying and warming right up until the semi-dry finish with a last, final dose of spice and fruitiness. Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. There’s a definite stickiness to mouthfeel, but thankfully it’s amply carbonated to keep it from ever becoming cloying. Drinkability: A sweet, rich tripel that added a nice, complimentary counterbalance to the beer battered onion rings and its spicy curry dipping sauce.
5 Seasons North Haiku Belgian Tripel;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Tripel;5 Seasons North;Golden/orange color. A bit deeper in color than other tripels I’ve seen. The flavor is fruity and heavy on maltiness. The mouthfeel is oily and slick. Very nice.
5 Seasons North Haiku Belgian Tripel;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Tripel;5 Seasons North;Tap. Cloudy orange. Aroma of sweet malts. Slight aroma of that white stuff between the orange rind and the meat inside of an orange. Goes down light and refreshing. Lingering bitterness brings balance to the loveliness of the drink. Aging this for a year seems to have added to the character. Flavorful, calming, creamy mouthfeel. Medium Bodied.

5 Seasons North Haiku Belgian Tripel;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Tripel;5 Seasons North;On tap on 3/3/07: Pours a clouded hazy copper orange with a thin, wispy ring of white head. Sweet, bready, biscuity malty aroma has good authenticity and some peppery spice notes. Body starts with a sweet toasty caramel biscuit flavor, light fruity esters, nice carbonation and a smooth, bittersweet finish with a touch of tartness. A pretty good, and true to style abbey tripel.

5 Seasons North Crazy Ralphs Nut Brown Ale;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;5 Seasons North;On tap at the brewpub in Alpharetta. Dark amber pour, fluffy, thick off-white head. Strong chocolately/coffee aroma with hints of berries - had to ask the barkeep if he poured me the stout instead! Flavor has prominent chocolate notes, some coffee and a sweet fruity back end with a nutty finish. Thick enough mouthfeel. Solid brewpub brown
5 Seasons North Crazy Ralphs Nut Brown Ale;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;5 Seasons North;Appearance: Deep, dark brown body with a light beige head. Smell: Light, sweet-smelling over-toasted nuts. Taste: Rich maltiness, with more of those toasted nuts. Some chocolate flavors develop as it warms. A gentle roasted bitterness in the finish.

Belmont Belgian Strong Ale;Long Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Belmont Brewing Company;This is my second visit and I’m really starting to appreciate this beauty. Sort of a cross between a Van steenberg and a triple Karmeliet. Tasty, big candy sugar, cardamen, slight anise. Well balanced and very tasty.
Redoak Export Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Dry;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;On tap 01.17.09 at the Red Oak, thanks to kempicus for recommending this place. Black brown, tan head. Aroma is smoke, chocolate, coffee, pine, molasses. Flavor is the same but the body is on the thin side.
Redoak Export Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Dry;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;bottled. pretty black with a minimal beige head. aroma of choc mint and tobacco, pretty thick, quite simple flavour - just some burnt bitterness, drinkable anyway but could be much better
Redoak Export Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Dry;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;i’ve had maybe 50 stouts better than this. this could pass for sheaf stout. smell: strong, sweaty vegemite/tar/molasses. in the mouth: concentrated sweet syruppy salty vegemite with no real hops to speak of, just a rough, pinched roastiness at the finish. not far off two cans of coopers stout kit, honestly. raw and cheap tasting.
Redoak Export Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Dry;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Deep black with a minimalist dark beige head. Quite a lot licorice on the aroma, more the mass-market molasses driven variety though than the traditional. A little remote on tasting with the alcohol standing out. In comparison to the Holly Porter it suffers, being less complex. However in its own right it’s a decent drop. It’s a bit syrupy, although this does lend itself to providing it’s licoricey goodness right through to the last mouthfull.
Redoak Export Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Dry;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Another in the welcome deluge of heavy-duty stouts at this Sydney brewpub. This one ranks well above the oatmeal, Irish and twin chocolate stouts IMO, but doesn’t quite match the Baltic or Holly Porters and Russian Imperial. That said, I’d happily tuck a few of these away. Looks exactly as you’d expect, with a short head that endures well for a bottled stout. Oodles of molasses in the aroma - very sweet and sticky. Coffee creams, Milo and a nice roastiness. Only apparent flaw is a splash of stale piss - but I seem to be particularly prone to finding that in certain stouts, so the flaw may be mine. Lovely filling mouthfeel, thick and creamy. Full-bodied. Very lactic in feel. Good roasty flavours - cherry chocolates and dark malts in the mid-palate before a solidly btter coffee-ground finish. Very dry in the swallow. All in all, a good rich, flavoursome stout. Nice work. (Bottle at the brewpub)
Surly Cranberry One;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Surly Brewing Company;On tap at the Nile. Ruddy brown with no head. Aroma of cranberry and caramel. Interesting balance of tart and sweet.
Surly Cranberry One;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Surly Brewing Company;Tap at the Blue Nile. Reddened hue of oak brown. Roundly similar to the original with innovations present. Aroma of port, caramel malt and cranberry. Immense rich flavor, beginning with molasses and butterscotch which cap a tart, peppery shiraz-like body. Dark crystal sugars. The cranberries lend a quieted but bold acidity to the finish. Smoother and not quite as rich the original, very much a straighter shot at an after dinner drink.
Surly Cranberry One;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Surly Brewing Company;Reading Pigfoot’s posting on ratebeer.com, I had to make a trip to the Blue Nile in Minneapolis and try this before it was all gone. Oooh man, no one wasn’t kidding! Watching the bartender at a close distance, this brew poured like a thick motor oil density. Awesome! This brew appears like a dark cherry cola caramel brown with no head on top. Just a fine white film on top with little carbonation. Aroma is just as intense as Surly One with added scents of molasses, caramel and sweet cherries. Flavor finally revealed the cranberry taste but missing the tartness I am used to from sampling cranberries grown near Three Lakes, Wisconsin for Ocean Spray. But still, this is good! A true sipping style beer that is closer to a dark Belgian ale than an American dark lager. Happy to see Oakes changed this entry from an American dark lager to a Fruit Beer.
Surly Cranberry One;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Surly Brewing Company;On tap at the Blue Nile. Thoroughly darkened appearance, a solid brown, with a sturdy, if slim head of cocoa-tinged foam riding on top. Tart fruit starts the nose, then molasses, sweet caramel malt...the cranberries merge well the other great flavors found in One, and hold ground above. But there is no single dominant factor, instead, a brilliant blending. Taste: Yum. Just yum. Dark, sweet, and lightly tart, the better parts of a rich malty lager given an extra fruity zing. Or zang. Or zabbityzazz. Take your pick. Sip again, and it’s scrumptious once more. Full bodied in the mouth, long, sweet, fruity finish. Terribly smooth, no rough spots here at all. Tastiness all around. an excellent dessert beer, or an exquisite closer on a night’s imbibing. Any way you try it, please do. Another winner from Surly.
Cass Red;Seoul, South Korea;Malt Liquor;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);330ml can. Pours clear gold with a small white head. Aroma is malt, alcohol, some sort of fruit. Taste is medium sweet, corn, slightly alcoholic. I regretted drinking this the morning after.
Cass Red;Seoul, South Korea;Malt Liquor;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);Poured from 355mL can. Golden yellow with dissipating white head. Mildly sweet malt with slight metallic alcohol finish.
Cass Red;Seoul, South Korea;Malt Liquor;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);Can from supermarket in Shanghai. Nose is fruity, berry-like and soda-like, no particular barley malt character. Flavor is almost entirely composed of flaws - somewhat cloying, sweetish solvent flavors of fusel, light bubblegum and a hot finish. Very obviously meant to lead directly to inebriation, but why that can’t that be a fun and tasty road paved with barley and hop flavors I don’t know--i guess that just takes to long to ferment and rack.

Cass Red;Seoul, South Korea;Malt Liquor;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);an orange colour. smell is cereals, fruit-sugar smell. taste is pretty sweet, unpleasant yeast derived bits, tastes like crap ingredients were put in, output is a little like rotten fruit and beer. alcohol is slightly apparent. palate is slick and heavy. this beer is the only malt liquor made in south korea and just the fact that it has more alcohol and it clearly is what it is supposed to be. i like it better than other korean garbage beer.

Gambrinus Weiden Zwickelbier;Weiden, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Gambrinus-Brauerei Weiden;50 cl bottle @ Timo A, BBE 02/2013 Aroma is quite nothing – perhaps a hint of apricot or some other sweet fruit like pineapple. Flavour has fruity apricot, some grainy notes and nettles. Also some dry hayness typical to this style. Foamy palate. Quite fruity for a Zwickel, this could be a light pale ale too.

Bent River OShip ESB;Moline, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bent River Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear orange color. Head was thin, white, and didn’t leave much lace behind. Attractive aroma of biscuity malt, light resiny hops, and cereal grain. Dry on the tongue with mild hop bitterness. Body was on the lighter side. There were lots of different flavors, some of which changed as the beer warmed. There always seemed to be some malty caramel and tobacco, but occasionally I also noticed celery, butterscotch, and wet stone. Not bad.
Bent River OShip ESB;Moline, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bent River Brewing Company;The body’s a clear golden bronze and it sports a slender white head. The aroma has toffee, caramel, and light herbal and earthy hops. The ale is a bit thin but has enough malty flavors well balanced by the hop bitterness to make it an easy drinking, sessionable beer.

Grizzly Peak Ashen Goat;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;"Sample at the brewpub: On the board as an ""American Hellesbock"", this beer pours a clear orange/amber color with a medium thin bone white head with pretty good retention.

The finish is bubbly with zesty citrus and hops. Pretty good overall.
Half Pints Weizen Heimer;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Pours a hazy yellow color with a finger of thick white head. Aroma is banana and cloves. Taste is a little spicy but also a bout sweet. Maybe a little too carbonated for my liking

I just went reading reviews and nobody else mentions it, but I swear this has got a lightly salty finish - heck, it’s almost a gose! I like this a lot, and it’s the second one from this brewery that I’ve really enjoyed - which means they’re officially on my short list for checking out additional brews. (17/20)
Half Pints Weizen Heimer;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Half Pints Brewing Co.;65 cl bottle, Calgary, AB, Canada from Eric. Slightly hazy yellow gold, high carbonation. Resin banana aroma. Some lemon. Nice sharpness, then a mellow sweetness with bubblegum at the end.

Stadin St. Fisu;Helsinki, Finland;Red Ale - Irish;Stadin Panimo;Interesting, I’m sure I added the rating before, so does my notebook, but no entry found. Rated in April 2007 (on Sunday after Helsinki Beer Fest)@Black Door. Hazy reddish amber colour, mediumsized creamy white head. Aroma is flowery hops and some sweet grassyness and berries. Pretty much the same goes for the flavour. Rather hoppy and dry finish.
Stadin St. Fisu;Helsinki, Finland;Red Ale - Irish;Stadin Panimo;Draught@Black Door Ruby-amber red color, small lacey and creamy off-white head. Berry-like sweetish aroma, sugars, some hops and maybe hints of vinegar. Malty, a bit sticky flavors. Also some vinegar and English hops. Not the most balanced ale from Stadin Panimo.
Apollo Rose;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Bryggeriet Apollo;Draught @ the brewpub. Golden coloured. Unclear. Dense off white head. Herbal and flowery aroma. Some light spice notes.

Apollo Rose;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Bryggeriet Apollo;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy blond color. Aroma of sage and fruits, rosemary, peach; also flowery. Quite smooth texture, fresh, flowery, a bit herbal, light note of crispy malt. Weird but pleasant."
Apollo Rose;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Bryggeriet Apollo;Draught at the brewpub. Golden coloured. Bready aroma with notes of flowers. Sweetish and soft cookie malt flavour with soapy notes of roses. Inspired by Tuborg Blå and Hvid?
Apollo Rose;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Bryggeriet Apollo;(On tap) Slightly hazy golden with a dense, white head leaving laces. Somewhat sweet malty, nose. Medium body with extremely sweet malt - and perhaps I do sense the added roses. The finish is very soft without the usual brutal Apollo bittering hops. Actually this unusual beer leaves a somewhat soapy, sweet feel on my palate. 140407
Apollo Rose;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Bryggeriet Apollo;Draught at the brewpub. Yellow colour with a big white head. The aroma is heavy apollo yeast, and I just don´t like that apollo yeast. Spicy, hop. The taste is also of apollo yeast and mint, hops and spices. Medium body with a bitter dry finish.
Apollo Rose;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Bryggeriet Apollo;Draft. A hazy light golden beer with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet - at first with notes of brewmash, yeast, and esters, then comes notes of roses and honey. The esters is a draw back, but I like the rose note. The flavor is sweet and again to start off with notes of esters and citrus, but then the roses comes in abundance, leading to a spicy end. The carbonation is very soft. All in all a lovely refreshing and different summer beer. I like the innovation with the rose leaves.
Downton Apple Blossom Ale;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Downton Brewery;On cask at the Guildford Arms. Appearance - golden with a decent head. Nose - stewed apple and lemon.

Downton Apple Blossom Ale;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Downton Brewery;Cask at the Greyfriar, Reading. Clear gold with a thick white head. Caramel and vanilla at first with growing apple skin and honey and a touch of lemon. However the apple and lemon are very light meaning that it’s on the sweet side, although somehow not too sweet. Good body. Pleasant spring beer, just needs a little more oomph.
Downton Apple Blossom Ale;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Downton Brewery;Cask gravity at Reading Beer Festival 2015. Clear pale gold lasting white head. oddly paper on aroma. Some apple some fragrance. Pretty drinkable excellent condition. Some dryness on the finish. Good.

Pale straw in colour with a tight white head; sweet, floral aroma; the taste is also sweet an dfloral to start, with a grainy body, and some apple juice; then there is a building rounded bitterness, leading to a zingy, almost peppery finish. A delicate, understated, bitter that’s very drinkable."

John Harvards Manchester Phoenix Ale;Manchester, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;John Harvards Brewhouse Manchester;Tap at the brewpub. Cloudy amber with a small white head. Flowery citrus and sweet malt nose. Citrus bite, some tannic qualities, lightly sweet malt. OK.
John Harvards Manchester Phoenix Ale;Manchester, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;John Harvards Brewhouse Manchester;Fresh growler. Pours a hazy amber with a rocky white head. Smells of wildflowers, perfume, oranges and lots of sweet malt. Tastes of oranges, tea like hops, earthy malt and some tangy elements as the beer warms. Subdued, reserved and enjoyable as a session beer.
Shenandoah Schwarzbier;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Bottle. I’m no expert on Schwarzbier (I didn’t even know two of the beers I was drinking were of that style) so I can’t really say how good this one fits into the category. That being said the beer was a little roasty, caramel and chocolates. Taste was slightly bitter and pleasant, slight watery taste, but that could just mean the beer was light (I don’t know the alcohol content).
New Belgium Wood Aged Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Draft. Blackish beer with a nice off-white/tan head. Light dark malt, tart aroma. Big tart flavor with berry (cherry) fruit and earth. Lingering cherry and tartness. Medium body. Nice.
New Belgium Wood Aged Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tap @ Toronado 4/18/07. A dark brown to black color but not the typical solid black that one expects in a stout. A malty aroma sits just on top of an immense fruit base. This tasted more like a tame version of La Folie (which was also on tap) with a sour intense fruit flavor but cut with chocolate and roasted malts. Quite nice but also a one trick pony.
Farnham Mike Hawthorn;Farnham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Farnham Brewery;Cask@Reading Beer Festival 2012. Amber colour with a small off-white head. Aroma is sweet malts, some slight toasted notes along with mild zesty, citrusy and a bit toffeeish notes. Flavour is wooden, crystal and caramel malty with quite big floral and grassy bitterness. Nice bitter aftertaste.
Farnham Mike Hawthorn;Farnham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Farnham Brewery;"Cask at the Ball and Wicket, Farnham. Hazy amber with a tight cream head; apricot aroma; rich and thick in the mouth with soft malts and some pineapple fruit; then a dry biscuity finish. Satisfying."

Farnham Mike Hawthorn;Farnham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Farnham Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Reading Beer Festival. Bright golden brown with a thin white film. Aroma of ginger biscuits, pig farms and tea. Not really a winning combination. Flavour is more of the same with bigger biscuits. Slight bitterness on the finish then some sweet malt. So so at best.

Dry, hoppy flowery beer with a bitter dry flavour throughout. Perfumed malt in a light body but with enough bite in the alcohol to make it credible. A decent beer.

Formosa Bird Beer;Taoyuan County, Taiwan;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;North Taiwan Brewing;This beer is brewed specially by the North Taiwan brewery for a tapas bar that overlooks the Guandu bird sanctuary north of Taipei. It is only sold at that bar and a few other bars in the vicinity. 330 ml. bottle. Translucent reddish amber. Foamy off-white head, with some lacing. Some bits of yeast floating around in there. Very attractive beer. Doughy aroma of belgian yeast, also sweetish scent of carmel and spicy hop scent. Mouthfeel is full and malty, nicely carbonated. This is really an excellent beer! Flavor is concentrated, strong alcohol and yeast with a residual earthy, citrusy hoppiness. Orval-esque, but a little more pungent- perhaps only because it is really fresh. Strong, balanced, substantial. Best beer I’ve had from a Taiwan brewer. Hands down.
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;Loved this beer. Wonderfully complex with figs and dried cherries, finishing with a cranberry bite. Full bodied like a doppelbock. Fantastic.
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;"The bartender told me this was their ""sweet lager"" and it was exactly that. Brown head, brown translucent color with red hues. WAY too sugary and lightly malty. Might be alright for a pint, but too much for a session."
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;"From a growler from the Bowie location. At first taste, I drew back with an ""ew"" look on my face. My wife says, ""keep drinking it, it gets better."" lol. Red’ish brown in color (but not amber). Not much in the way of an aroma. Kind of smells a bit sweet. Tastes like a bock at first, but doesn’t really follow through. Kind of a copper-y aftertaste."
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;5/10/07: On Tap, Bowie. Mahogany – raisin colored body. No head – no lace. Light plum nose. Raisin flavor with molasses, caramel malt and a touch of hops. Slight sour finish. After taste is also a bit tin like.
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;From a growler thanks to LordMaynard. Clear amber body with small, fading, off-white head.

DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;On tap at Bowie. Poured out a bright dark cherry color, with a huge tan colored head. Aromas are of too much roasted malt, with an off aromas I can’t describe. flavors are of too much chocolate & too much roasted malts. Way too much for a Dopplebock. Not my cup of tea by far.
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;From a growler thanks to LordMaynard. Not much of an enigma, just a basic doppelbock that smelled and tasted darn good. Dark reddish, burgundy brown color, tremendous nose of smoky, dusty malts, hops are sure there, though, semi-bitter, non-grassy hops, overall very good. Full of sweet maple and caramel, the sweetness being pretty distinct from the bitterness of the hops, which is always nice. Dusty is a good word too... semi-smoky as well. After a full glass the sweetness seems a bit much, and at times it even had somewhat of a stenchy cannibus nose. Leaves a yellow/green residue on the glass, but that was probably just the effect of lighting.
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;"Growler from Bowie location (thanks to LordMaynard for picking it up!). Clear, cherry-orange color with yellow edges; fluffy orange-tinged head that quickly fades to nothing. Pleasant caramel and wet malts and dried dark fruits in the aroma. Light carbonation, medium mouthfeel: pleasant chewy caramel character; dried fruits and brown sugar and roasted malts; some light citrus hops. Medium, wet malt and caramel finish."
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;(Bowie) Minimal off-white head with clear mahogany body. Aroma is sweet, cherry, caramel, some chocolate, light smoke. Taste is sweet, chocolate, caramel, cherry, some smoke. Sticky medium-full body with low carbonation.
DuClaw Enigma;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;DuClaw Brewing Company;New Release on tap at Arundel Mills - Deep crimsony brown, thin tan creamy head. Malty rich nose of fig, plum brown sugar, and cherry. Warming adds a soft underlying sweet smokey tone and touch of leather. Flavor adds more malty complexity with dried dark fruits, light smoke, and caramel. In time, it fades into a light hop bitterness to smooth out the big malt. ABV as usual with DC beers was well hidden. Medium bodied and slick, light carbonation, soft sweet finish. Well done representation....
North Cotswold Honey Stout;Stretton on Fosse, Warwickshire, England;Stout;North Cotswold Brewery;"Gravity, Coventry 2011. Mahogany with a dirty ivory swirl. Boiled egg aroma. Good flavour; mildewed old books, dust of chocolate, mushroom and raisin. Agricultural, unstouty...but not without interest."
North Cotswold Honey Stout;Stretton on Fosse, Warwickshire, England;Stout;North Cotswold Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury, Oxon. Black with cream head. Looked good but in reality this is a very odd beer, there is a sweet and sour thing going on that works with Chinese cookery but not in beer. There is a honeyed, thickish sweetness, reminiscent of a golden beer, then there is a tart, bitterish, chewey body with a touch of coffee husk. Not one of my favourites.
Grizzly Peak Juniper Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;Cask sample at the brewpub: Pours a cloudy yellow/orange color with a medium rocky white head. Very little lacing is evident. Aroma of spices and floral hops. Light-bodied and smooth with a lightly spiced character, along with notes of flowers and yeast.

Devon Cider Old Moors Cider;Tiverton, Devon, England;Apple Cider;Devon Cider (Eclor-Agrial);This is a classic fudge. A blended cider packaged for old style effect. It fools no-one.

Dugges Pale Ale II;Landvetter, Sweden;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dugges Bryggeri;Perfect tall white head, big-bubbled, like avenyn, but hoppier, sandier with sweetish hay notes and far greener hops where grapefruit manages to peak in.

Square One Helles;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Square One Brewery;"Tasted at St. Louis BrewFest, May 12, 2007. A Munchner Helles is a rather simple beer, and many breweries either think it is synonomous with ""light"" beer or they over-do it with too much citris/spicy hops. I’ve been to Munich and had it straight from their breweries, and this brew from Square One seemed just right. Nice clean aroma and appearance, with the simple flavor that results from a good Helles. Above average."

Medium body with some semi-sharp carbonation. The flavor starts out with clean malt that is pale and very similar to a pils. There is also some light spice and some light sourness.

Notes of sugars (brown and toasted and Belgian candi), dates, earth, caramel, plums, and a kind of papery, cardboardy note. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel.

Square One Belgan Dubbel;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Dubbel;Square One Brewery;October 30, 2012 on tap at brewpub. Muddy brown pour with limited head. Malt, yeast, caramel and fruit in aroma and taste. Finishes dry with a slight bitterness.

Square One Belgan Dubbel;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Dubbel;Square One Brewery;Pint @ the brewpub. Has a completely murky, deep, dark brown color with no clarity at all. Aroma is a basic brown biscuit and light brown sugar. Taste is a bit emptier with a simple, watered down brown sugar. A bit of tea and a small hop kick at the end. Otherwise pretty easy drinking.

Silver Peak Rye Pale Ale;Reno, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Silver Peak Restaurant & Brewery;[Tap] Pours a dark golden color with a large cap of foamy white head. Generous amounts of rye are noticeable in the aroma. Crisp grassy and mild citrus hops also in the nose. Rye bread, even hop bitterness, cracker and lingering citrus flavor profile. Has a very nice palate that is quite creamy. Great looking lacing as well. More flavorful than just about any other rye pale ale I have tried. The rye really comes out here and that makes for a unique tasting brew.

McMenamins Belgian Style IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the John Barleycorn’s McMenamins. I got excited, then I thought about it, could they really pull off something with a noticable belgian yeast character? no. Just like most of their other IPAs, no yeast esters, what subtle spice there might have been was blown out by the bitterness. Nice IPA base, big citrus hops, strong bitter finish, but overpowered any Belgian character that this once might have had.

Dale Bros. Pomona Queen;Upland, California, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Last Name Brewing;Not a huge fan of this one. Light on flavor, with a complete absence of hop aroma. Kind of an odd yeasty flavor, with an unremarkable finish.

No lacing at all. A nice, clear amber color. Medium, well balanced lager. Soft carbonation, abrupt finish. I actually bought this to add to a chili recipe, but must say that I enjoyed drinking the other half. :)
Dale Bros. Pomona Queen;Upland, California, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Last Name Brewing;A very simple beer. Pours a nice amber color with a head that dissappates quickly. Sort of refreshing until you are hit with a strange doughy aftertaste. Like a good idea (California Common style) gone wrong. However, having said that, do not judge this brewery by this brew. They call this their transition beer and it is BY FAR the least interesting of the lot. Would be non-offensive to someone who appreciates mass marketed rice water. Try Dale Bros. Winter Haze or Califonia Black Beer if you can.

Prickly Moses Otway Pilsner;Barongarook, VIC, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Prickly Moses Handcrafted Beer;Having loved the PM Ale and not liked the PM Stout, I figured this one was going to colour my opinion of the brewery overall. Frankly, I struggled to get much out of it at all in terms of flavour. It is a fairly watery, low-carbonated beer with not much of a head and leaves only the slightest, somewhat bitter, taste at the end.
Prickly Moses Otway Pilsner;Barongarook, VIC, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Prickly Moses Handcrafted Beer;Bottle. Pours a very cloudy murky brown colour with soapy tan coloured head. Not very pilsner like and not that great looking. Very faint aromas of bisuity malt and floral hops. Flavours are somewhat better. Good malt sweetness and some nutiness initially and plenty of resiny hops near the end. Nice bitterness on the finish. Pretty light mouthfeel and minimal carbonation. An ok beer I guess.
Prickly Moses Otway Pilsner;Barongarook, VIC, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Prickly Moses Handcrafted Beer;Just an ok beer. Nothing offensive but really lacking body, i.e. an overall watery impression.

Prickly Moses Wheat Beer;Barongarook, VIC, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Prickly Moses Handcrafted Beer;Pours straw with a small rapidly fading head that somehow manages to look like floating bits of chalk. Aroma fails horribly. Seems to be a mix of cider and cheap white wine with some stale grainy malt in the background. In a partially redeeming note, there are some hints of orange peel and wheat. Flavours are totally dominated by the afore-mentioned stale grainy malt which, again, threatens to overwhelm the subtle wheat and orange peel. Very watery, with no where near enough carbonation.

Silly Royale Blonde;Silly, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie de Silly;"Slight gushing (! a nablab!) to very white, whipped eggwhite-like head over big-bubbled, pale straw-golden beer. Wet dog, dried herbs as dune woodruff, or dried ""straw""flowers, slightly honey-ish. Actually quite nice. Wry-bitterish flash, going over in a dull & watery mouthfeel and flavours of very petered-out meat aspic. As the fifth draw of the mash, metallic bitterness clashing. Dry & watery, if that can make sense? Each new sip again a whiff of honey, smeared over a cardboard biscuit. Weird."

John S. Rhodell Centennial Hop Head;Peoria, Illinois, United States;IPA;John S. Rhodell Brewery;"From the tap, served cool, but not cold, for me, the proper tasting temperature, in a pint glass. Poured a partly cloudy tarnished copper with a small foamy off-white head, decent retention, small amount of ringed sticking. Nice hop aroma, sweet sappy floral and candied citrus, and a light husky grain, a bit toasty. Good even carbonation and a crisp, nicely dry, hop slick, extremely smooth medium bodied mouthfeell. Pleasant and chewy taste, a nice hoppiness, lemon zest and citrus rind, hop oily, also a sweet sappy with a soft earthy bitterness, a slight numbing of the tongue, with the type of hop used, Centennial, I think the taste and balanced is close to perfect, in the background is a nice rough graininess, the hops provides the sweetness and the malts balance the overall taste, and a good crisp and dry finish with the hops and grains lingering in the palate. This is part of a series of single hop IPA’s that Mark, the owner/brewmaster is doing, I have to say that IPA’s and Pale Ales, whether English or American style is something that Rhodell’s does well. I tried this on Thursday before going next door to Kelleher’s for the ""Night Of The Barrels,"" and for me, over the entire weekend of brews I sampled at the 15th Peoria Beer Festival, Mark provided many of the highlights."
