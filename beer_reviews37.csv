Head is initially big and dynamically decreasing to a medium and pure white in its colour,gives surprisingly good lacing. Generally head and body carbonation are very positive when it comes to this beer. Aroma: Unripe apple,cabbage but a bit like sauerkraut                                   ,alcohol is present                                                                     ,some accent of sweet grainy malts,sour milk,chalk,dust,a kind of interesting aroma,especially for the fact of a compound aroma of a beer such a high alcohol content,cinamon is strongly present and manifesting it in its sweetness. Flavour: Shiver came down my spine! Nasty! Rusty,cold,wet,sweaty,greasy fur,a kind of nasty wale - fat,some medium carbonation,front was horrible,but noe is a bit better,of course not to mention the fact of haveing very unplesant aftertaste. Very unbalanced flavour,terrible aftertaste,poor palate,leaves your oral cavity dry and parched with unfresh,hangover like aftertaste,finish duration is average. Palate:Body is medium,textuer is wattery,carbonation on palate is medium,finish feel is dry,parched and all in all so terrible that I�ve decided to decrease its note and give finally 1 for flavour and 1 for palate,no more this beer! The problem is that this beer would be much better if it was brewed by German Brewery that brews Grafen Walder Pils.

Bitter End Farmhouse Brown Belgian Ale;Austin,Texas            ,United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Wow, this may be one of the finest Bitter End brews that I have had. Poured with a mughty head and was full malty goodness in the nose. That malty goodnes followed through in the mouth. A very ""firm"" and satifying brown ale. By no means is this a Flemish Sour- who the hell came up with that?"
Bitter End Farmhouse Brown Belgian Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;If this is a flemish soure ale I am retarded...completely retarded. Comes out looking like a porter. Dark opaque and bubbly. Zero head. Nose is subtley fruity. Not overpowering. Also detect a slight hazy roastiness. I really like this one and thought it was immensely drinkable. Flavors reflect the subtle fruity belgian yeast characteristics but with a lovely balance of grainy roasty goodness. G-rat
Bitter End Farmhouse Brown Belgian Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. Murky-brown w/minimal head. Served in a pint glass for some reason, which is odd, considering the style. It tastes more like either a weak dubbel or a strong brown ale than a F.S.A. to me. Nice woody-malty qualities that follow into the surprisingly crisp flavor. Some effervescence. The mouthfeel is a little bit on the thin side; I�d like to see this with a little more BITE, be it from alcohol or thickness."
Bitter End Farmhouse Brown Belgian Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Murky dark scarlet color. Great tan head with nice lacing. Sour malt, brown sugar and bready nose. Nice malt charater with some sour bread notes. Clean and creamy finish. I could drink a lot of this beer.
Yaletown Raspberry Wheat;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;On tap at Yaletown, pours a cloudy orange amber with a small white head. Aroma brings out fresh raspberries over a bed of crisp wheat. Flavour is what you�d expect - feint raspberries muted by the wheat. Nothing wrong with this, but it�s pretty tame and lacking character. Okay.
Yaletown Raspberry Wheat;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Nice dark red color, good head. Very fruity and nice wheat taste. Very efreshing, perfect for a hot summer day. ... I like it.
Yaletown Raspberry Wheat;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Very rich raspberry wheat that focuses more on the rich raspberry flavor and less on a fruitiness or sourness to speak of. The aftertaste is like 90% wheat and 10% berry. I really love the balance of this beer. Very unique raspberry wheat. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Yaletown Raspberry Wheat;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Pours a lucent purple color, almost plum with aroma of raspberry and other citrus notes. A tough tasting fruit beer, too much fruit taste for me. This beer has a mild spicy aftertaste that gives this beer a bitter ending. NOT a favorite of mine from this brewery.
Yaletown Raspberry Wheat;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Draught@brewpub, Vancouver, BC Hazy deep red color, steady, pinky head, lace. Dry rasberry stones aroma. Medium-bodied. Sweetish rasberry jam flavor. Astringent finish. Decent rasberry drink.
Yaletown Raspberry Wheat;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Nose is sweet and full of raspberries. Light base hefe aroma, but the raz is strong and like someone put hella syrup in the regular hefe. Pours red, with a pink head. The flavor is mostly raz, sweet, somewhat artificial but not that bad really - I love fruit beer - light banana and vanilla underneath. Lingering fruity raz notes with some dry wheatinesss too.
Yaletown Raspberry Wheat;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;At draught. Colour was a deep beautiful read with a small rose head that diminished after time. Smell of candy, berries and of course rasberries were there yet not to prevalent, also a upheaving of wheat. The taste was full of wheat and a bit of rasberry with a slight bitterness. Overall it is a refreshing beer for the hot summer days yet nothing spectacular.

Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;Excellent beer. Has an amazing smoky flavor like it came out of a wood fire. Very rich and tasty.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;Draught. Restrained aroma, doesn�t smell as smokey as it is. Full bodied flavour, the smoke prevents the malt from getting too sweet, odd as that may seem. Malty finish.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;A cloudy brown/red. Sweet applewood smoke faint on the nose. Sweet with hints of sour and mustard savoriness. Milky in texture with a light but definite smokiness throughout. Very mellow, wonderfully drinkable and excellent with the smoke from the cigar the guy at our table is smoking.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;Tap @ Fredfest... Poured clear amber with a tan head. Super smokey, campfire, peat, burning cigarettes. A touch of sweetness coming from the malt.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;I don�t know this was weird, but okay I guess. Billed as a Rauchbier tasted like rye with a sweet bitterness that also came through with the yeast. Really really smokey flavor, like bacon.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;Light dull amber colour, pouring bright. The aroma is smokey (beech) but with only a light caramel malt note to back it up. Simple palate - I like it but that�s only because I�m a smoke whore.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;22oz from Liquid Solutions. Bottle says the ABV is 7.3, but it�s certainly well hidden either way. Deep, slightly cloudy garnet pour, with a crisp head. There�s not a ton of smoke in the aroma, though there are some pleasant malts. But it�s definitely there in the taste, with some campfire, slight sweet notes, a bit of pine, and some sharp licorice. Not a bad variation on a German rauch, with a PNW twist in the strong hop finish.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;Hazy amber incolor with little head. Mild hickory aroma sits atop caramel sweetness. Crisp amber malt flavor is married with delicate smokiness. Some light hops balance the smokiness. This is a nice surprise and a real great beer.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;22oz bottle-pours a light tan head and hazy dark amber color. Aroma is dark/medium malt-molasses/some smoke, some dark fruit. Taste is dark/medium malt-molasses/some smoke, quickly transitions to some spice hops. Medium body. Good effervescence.
Oregon Trail Smoke Signal;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Oregon Trail Brewery;22oz Bomber A deep amber color with a tihck head. The beer had a smokey aroma and deep rich malts. The flavor was that of a good amber beer with smoked malts. The malts and flavors whee very deep and a good mild balance. This was a good over all beer to drink.

Weihenstephaner Xan Hefe-Weissbier;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;Bottle. Hazy orange with a massive creamy beige head, fluffing and lacing its way along. Smells strongly of wheat and yeast with some banana. Taste is wheaty with a little acidity and a small off-note. Not as tasty as the aroma would suggest, and there�s no spiciness here, for shame! Feel is creamy and soft but thin. Overall a little murky and depressing, my taste buds are still frowning. Quite a disappointment after the buildup.
Weihenstephaner Xan Hefe-Weissbier;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan;I shared a bottle with skortila, quite some time ago.

Lauterbacher Brotzeitbier;Lauterbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei Lauterbach L. Ehnle;Aroma vanilla, eggy. Large two finger head, clear straw colour, fizzy and yeasty. Light yet bitter taste. Clearly malty but very bitter for a helles and hoppy. Very different beer and an excellent one. Went down a treat and great lacing on the glass. Great bittter helles and packs a wallop for 4.7. Way underrated as most lagers on Rate Beer are! Beer Advocate contains better and fairer raters than this site unfortunately.

Lauterbacher Brotzeitbier;Lauterbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei Lauterbach L. Ehnle;Bottle from Dilo in Bochum.

Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;[cask] Green apple and toffee aroma that�s slightly medicinal. Clear orange-brown with white bubbles. Caramel and toffee flavour with some nutty and spicy notes. Tingly sweet with a touch of cinnamon. Light to medium body, very low carbonation, slightly bitter finish.
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;"<i>Cask Conditioned at The Castle, Furnival St., London</i><br />Amber color. Light aroma, the flavor is bolder; sweetish malt and caramel combination, lightly fruity (so far, positive), light earthy touch, possibly even smokey, but also a very light sourness (mostly in the aroma) that lets presume something may be going wrong with this beer. Not complex, but pleasant enough; a beer to try again in better conditions."
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;cask (handpump) @ some pub in Lyme Regis, of which I forgot to note down the name. Hazy copper-yellow-brownish colour, tiny head. Fruity nose. Light-bodied, fruity with some nice malty notes and some intensive aromatic hops.
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;"[on draught at The Retreat, Reading] Uncarbonated; malty, some citrus fruits, almost bordering on sweet and sticky at times but the hops come through at the end to take the edge off. A decent pint, this, and different enough to stand out from the crowd."
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;Cask. Dark orange, basically no head. Aroma of citrus and orange peel. Taste ginger, pear, grapefruit and lemon. Simple, but does the job.
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;Cask (O�Connell�s, Tampere), pint glass. Begins with a light haze to the medium brown-red hue, capped by a tight, off-white head. The aroma is quite bold, full of toffee, cherries, chocolate/coffee and cookies. Overall it comes across sweet with some dark fruit acidity. The flavour is much more reserved by comparison, starting with light toffee / biscuits and finishing with cherries and apples. Soft roasted overtone. Light bodied with a watery / silky texture and soft carbonation. Banana and apple skins crop up with warmth. Big nose, but a little flat on the tongue.
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;Cask (Kitty�s, Helsinki) Very dark orange, small spongy head. Aroma of sweet roasted malt and dusty hops. Mouthfeel is sharp and pleasantly refreshing, not quite watery. hints of brown almost sourness. Slightly drying, not quite resiny, hops give it a pleasant bitteness which stays for quite a long finish. For 3.8% this is a superb creation.
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;[i] Cask at The Woolpack, Banbury, 30-12-07 [/i] Mid amber, fruty with some caramel, but there is also a nice tang, little bit nutty. Fresh and full flavoured with a good bitterness, very nice.
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Gold with white head. Really fully flavoured for such a light ABV. Plenty of malt flavours with a good fruity background, a little spiciness then a big hoppy flavour. Plenty of bite with a lasting bitterness. A really decent beer.
Hidden Pint;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hidden Brewery;(Cask at O�Connels Tampere) Light coppery colored, little lasting yellow head. Surprisingly rich aroma with sweet caramel and fruits, even some chocolate comes up. Also this standard real-ale lemon touch can be found. Thin to medium bodied, misses carbonation. Flavor is still nice with mild and sweet chocolate, lemon and hops come up in bitter aftertaste. Nicely balanced bitter, with some more carbonation this would be excellent.
Elysian Avatar Jasmine IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA - Flavored;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);12oz bottle in 2012. Deep golden with a light haze and a white head. Aroma of floral hops, dried fruit, resin, malt and pine. Resinous bitterness in the flavour with tinned fruit sweetness.
Elysian Avatar Jasmine IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA - Flavored;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Purchase a 22 oz bottle from my local liquor store. Thick white head on top of a hazy golden body. It smells of floral hops but I also believe the smell of the Jasmine also comes through. The Taste is actually smooth & Mild and the IPA palate Destroyer doesn't occur as much as it does with the usual IPA but I think that might be because the Jasmine because it definitely has an aftertaste of Jasmine. I think this would be a great beer for people who find themselves stuck in a rut about what beers to drink. As much as I like this beer I don't like that after Taste of Jasmine though
Elysian Avatar Jasmine IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA - Flavored;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);From the bottle. It was good not strong hops like ally of IPA�s so I�m pleased with this brew. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Elysian Avatar Jasmine IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA - Flavored;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Interesting flavor, just a hint of jasmine, but enough to give it an odd flavor. Nice citrus hop flavor though. Good beer, fairly light. Refreshing summer ale.
Elysian Gris Gris Blackened Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Clear dark brown body, light tan head.

Elliott Bay Anniversary Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Clear dark orange. Flavor begins empty, then a rush of tart berries and wood. Some sweet lemon peel and coriander, with a sharp dryness throughout. Spicy, though a little cloying in the finsih... a wet finish. Spiced brown-ale-like malts in the nose with a Belgian yeast flavor.
Elliott Bay Anniversary Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Clear sparkling amber body topped by a light tan head.

Pacific Rim Puget Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;This is a nice black porter, big and bold, very rich with lots of chocolate, roasted coffee maltiness and hints of cherries and citrus, perhaps a little to hoppy, but mellows out as it warms. Not bad
Pacific Rim Puget Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Looks like an IPA or an amber ale, it�s so light... has a color of rusty toast. Head has trouble standing up for long. Scotch and toffee nose, with some grainy coffee flavors over a fizzy and thin palate, reminds me of soda.
Pacific Rim Puget Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Brown-red body toppped by a tan head. Not that dark. Roasted malt with some light hops in the aroma.

K Plus Svijetlo Pivo (-2011);Buzet, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Istarska Pivovara;Forgot to add the rating for this one. Poured a clear golden, topped with a medium frothy white head and no retention. Slightly smelly grainy aroma. Taste was sweet and a bit watery, malty and with just a hint of bitterness in the finish. Wouldn�t have it again.
K Plus Svijetlo Pivo (-2011);Buzet, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Istarska Pivovara;King of all bad beers, just about everything about it is bad but what really stands out is horrible sandy aftertaste. Avoid like a plague!
K Plus Svijetlo Pivo (-2011);Buzet, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Istarska Pivovara;Plastic bottle, 0.50l. Clear pale golden color with large frothy white head and sparkling appearance. Aroma of corn, cooked vegetables, grass with notes of rubber. Taste starts light sweet and sour grainy, follows by vegetably and buttery sweetness with crisp and dry mouthfeel and mild bitter finish. Light body, watery texture and lively carbonation in palate. Would certainly rather call it K Minus Beer...
K Plus Svijetlo Pivo (-2011);Buzet, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Istarska Pivovara;Average aroma, appearance, taste and palate. Decent, somewhat memorable. Rated in the past from the can.

K Plus Svijetlo Pivo (-2011);Buzet, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Istarska Pivovara;2L bottle for a hair over a euro at the Konzum chain. This seems to be their own branded beer ... bottle says something about being from Grudska Pivara in Hrvatska. Pours a very pale gold with foamy, soapy head. Nose is cheap, corny lager. Sips like hugely undercarbonated corn flake water. Kvas made from corn not rye bread... Incredibly light body, quite bitter and metallic. Pretty awful.
K Plus Svijetlo Pivo (-2011);Buzet, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Istarska Pivovara;500ml in a plastic bottle. Yellow-straw body. White edge around the rim of the glass. The smell brings notes of sour grass and vegetables. Carbonic acid flavoured beer added some sweetness. Watery palate (room 810 at Dubrovnik Palace, 27.08.2008).
K Plus Svijetlo Pivo (-2011);Buzet, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Istarska Pivovara;0,5 l PET in Croatia. Pale lager, rather thin, a little sweetness and some hoppy dryness. Lightweight, but not bad, either.
K Plus Svijetlo Pivo (-2011);Buzet, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Istarska Pivovara;Another lost rate? Apparently not. I�m astounded that all these excruciating Croatian supermarket lagers in plastic screwtops have been tracked down to source and entered onto the website. Good. SOMEBODY MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. Actually, this one was quite drinkable. Deeper gold than some, with a sickly halo of froth persisting beyond the first sip. Nose sulphuric, sweet and metallic. Faint marzipan and buttery malts. Drinkable blend of anaemic herbal hop, hay and cereal notes. Mealy Digestive aftertaste. Very buttery and watery, but safe from a plugholing. Just.

Rocky River Summer Solstice;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Large draught sample at the brewpub, June 26 2007. Opaque yellow-gold with a fair bit of lasting creamy foam, ok lacing....nose is more spice (ginger, coriander, lemonpeel) dominated than most, with less overt fruitiness, perhaps a bit of chocolate with warmth....body is rather lemon-lime-soda-like, dry and somewhat mineralic-chalky to finish, rather heavy carbonation, just a bit on the thin side. Ehh, ok, reasonably refreshing, forgettable.

Super white head that left lots of lacing. Corriander is just huge in the nose, backed by a light touch of orange. Nice overall mouthfeel, with tons of corriander and the ghost of bitter orange present throughout. The finish was dry, spicy, and clean. If you�re into corriander, this is right up your alley, but I thought it was overblown in this.

Camerons Long Leg;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);From Jun 2007 Purchased at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins as part of 2 make my own 6 packs. Pours from 12oz bottle(best by Jan 31 2006) a hazy straw gold with a very large head of foam that lingers on for the entire session and it has some very good lacing. The smell, well, is *very* nice. I get notes of caramel malt and some hops in the background. If I were blindfolded, I could tell that this brew was from the UK. The taste is a very finely balanced flavour of caramel malt and those yummy Fuggles hops which impart just the slightest hint of citrus. Yummy.(again) It's very flavourful and only sags right at the finish where I'd describe it as very dry. Damn. This is a very easy drinker and I'm already down to my last 2 or 3 ounces. I'd certainly buy this one again. Bottom line: This is a very tasty English Pale Ale, even though it's almost a year and a half past its best by date. I'd love to sample a fresh bottle.

Mount Rushmore Washington Wheat;Hill City, South Dakota, United States;Wheat Ale;Mount Rushmore Brewing Company;This beer was great. It was clear yellow with a nice head to it. It had a clean, crisp wheaty taste and it had a smooth finish. I had this beer after riding motorcycle in the Black Hills on a hot day and it hit the spot like a shang hai hooker on a saturday night. I had to quickly remove the slice of lemon they serve with it to avoid looking like a daisy but the beer was out of this world. This is the best wheat beer I have ever had at a brew pub.
Mount Rushmore Lincoln Logger;Hill City, South Dakota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mount Rushmore Brewing Company;nice amber color,small head that faded slowly leaving little behind.The armoa was slightly malty with a mild hop presence.The flavor was pretty decent mlaty lightly hoppy with a slight maybe caramel in there hard to say and a decent not overly bitter finish.over all decent enough to have a few more i think.
Mount Rushmore Lincoln Logger;Hill City, South Dakota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mount Rushmore Brewing Company;This was a darker lager with a nice malty taste. I liked it a lot but not near as much as the Washington Wheat which was very good. Most brew pubs that brew their own beer I have been to don�t have much for head but the Mount Rushmore Brewing Company�s beers have a nice head.
Mount Rushmore Roughrider Red;Hill City, South Dakota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mount Rushmore Brewing Company;I was fairly impressed by this stuff. It was a nice amber color with a slightly tan colored head. It was very smooth with no aftertaste. I would rather drink the Washington Wheat. If you go to this brew pub ask the employees about the ghosts. Apparently this place used to be a morgue.
Watch City Tylers Clavic Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Watch City Brewing Co.;"2004 draught at the brewery. Billed as a German Hefe, this one seemed a bit too citrusy, hoppy and dry. It had the spicing, but that seemed a bit too powerful. The wheat was a bit too thin for my liking, giving only a medium body at best. Appearance wise, it had a dull bronze color, moderately cloudy with a fleeting white head. Lots of lemon on this one, watery palate; need more yeast, sweet malt and esters."
Watch City Tylers Clavic Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Watch City Brewing Co.;Cloudy light golden in colorwith a small white head.Aroma of lemons and bananas . Fruity and spicy flavor with a tart/acidic character.
Mount Rushmore Dirty Politics Double Black;Hill City, South Dakota, United States;Stout;Mount Rushmore Brewing Company;This was a very attractive beer. Very dark with a creamy head. It was very stout with sort of a rough aftertaste. I was still impressed that they know how to serve their beers cold unlike the Firehouse Brewing Company in Rapid City. I liked the Washington Wheat better than this beer but it wasn�t too bad that I wouldn�t drink it again.
Rock Bottom Cincinnati Porter;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Cincinnati;Draft at the brewpub from backlog notes. Pours dark brown in color with a medium sized beige head.

Rock Bottom Cincinnati Porter;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Cincinnati;Had this at the location at Fountain Square in Cincinnati before the holidays. Review from notes. Received in a pint glass. 5.0 A: Black. Super creamy light brown head with insane retention and lacing. 4.5 S: Despite the nitrogen sucking the life out of this beer (and every beer), it still smells wonderful. Dry, but with lots of sweet chocolate and a heavy roastiness. Seems like there is some lactose or something in here, but I don�t think there actually is. Not super complex, but infinitely inviting. 4.0 T: Taste is like the nose, but is less intense. 3.5 M: Nitro gives a good creaminess, but the beer has a lighter body anyway. Good enough I guess. 4.0 D: Probably my favorite RB brew thus far despite my eternal hatred for nitro. Serving type: nitro-tap Reviewed on: 01-21-2012 03:29:46

Poured a small tan head that was mostly lasting, fair amount of lacing, transparent, no visible carbonation, and a reddish brown hue. Nose was roasty, burnt and coffee. Ditto for the flavor but it was overly roasty and burnt tasting. Tingly mouthfeel. Light-medium body. Due to the amount of roastiness and burnt taste that this beer has, this is a disappointing brew. Over the top with roastiness and burnt tastes.
Rock Bottom Cincinnati Porter;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Cincinnati;A very drinkable beer for an American beer drinker. In comparison to other porters this one is very thin and weak. It was disappointing in that respect. Not much in the way of flavor and when the expected zing finally arrived it was very late and weak.

Widmer Brothers Muscat Love;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);OBF 2004. Very punchy and chemical-like... has some spices in the nose with a vivid hop note... but the flavor is a weird hop, honey, curry and plant-like concoction. Leafy.
Widmer Brothers Muscat Love;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Light orange color. Aroma is grape sweet, honey and spices. A medium bodied �ale�. Malts are sweet and fruity. Muscat grape flavors are very evident and there are many wine like qualities and flavors here. Yet it still retains that malt/hop beer like balance. Nicely balanced. Very smooth taste. Light and refreshing, but it�s way to sweet to want to drink a lot of this beer. Hides the 9.8% alcohol very well. Another interesting and unique beer from Widmer for the OBF. Thanks Guys. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and sweet. Aftertaste is sweet.

Pours a light orange with a white head that leaves decent lacing. Strong floral aroma. Taste is very citrusy, almost grapefruity, with a big hint that this will be a strong brew, very malty, and the brew ends with almost no bitterness but a faint sourness. The alcohol taste didn�t take over this beer, and in fact was very well hidden. Strong tasting brew, but very drinkable and enjoyable.
K�nigsberg Dunkel;Kaliningrad, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kompaniya PIT (Heineken);Bottled as K�nigsberg Dark. Poured clear medium copper with a taller, well-retained off-white head. The aroma picked up a whole great deal of sweetness that I�ve come to expect from Eastern-European lagers.. toasty caramel, some chocolate, and sweet floral.. I really enjoyed it. The flavor was a bit too sweet, lacking a bit of substance.. caramel and light, sweet chocolate at the core with light herbal and coffee bitterness fairly well-integrated in there.. very sweet and short finish. Lighter-bodied and sweet on the palate.. dry and a little tacky on the finish. Solid stuff.

Very odd. I�m sure it�s not meant to be like this. Let�s put it down to poor beer festival conditioning and give it another go if the opportunity arises. The score has been shaded up accordingly.

Bittings Bierstrasse Hefeweizen;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Pretty decent hefe.

Liberty Myrtle Beach Raspberry Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;Great Beer. I found this at a local brewery near my college. Don�t let the name fool you, it doesn�t taste fruity. If it�s on tap when you stop by you will not be disappointed.
Liberty Myrtle Beach Raspberry Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;"Draught. Why do I do this to myself? Pours a cloudy straw color, thankfully not pink, with good head retention. The aroma is of crackers, grains, light raspberry. Taking a sip reveals much of the same with a ""dirty"" finish. Thankfully, the raspberry is not overdone. That said, this is still not a favorite of mine. It�s a combination of an American wheat and raspberry which, in my book, is tantamount to a combination of a root canal on Tax Day."
Liberty Myrtle Beach Raspberry Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;"On tap at Liberty... brewed under the alias of ""Very Jerry Wheat"". Pours reddish-amber and clear, with a diminished head and the slightest ring lace of suds follows the brew down the glass. There are some fruit notes (nondescript, but we�ll say raspberry), and nothing to write home about. As the beer warms, wheat does come through more prominently, though. Tart citrus accompanies light wheat notes, with an unfortunate plastic finish. This seems to be the result of hopping. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp, cutting heavy meal flavors on the palate. By itself, however, it�s not a standalone standout."

Flagstaff Summer Wheat;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Flagstaff Brewing Company;"Had this @ brewery, though I thought it was called ""Flagstaff Hefeweizen"" - Light yellow appearance. Lemonade, spiced orange, lemon, coriander, Belgian-like yeast flavors... a little spicy, but just a regular hefe with a great flavor."
Big Buck Bass Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Buck Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance had a decent looking amber color with a one finger white foamy head. The smell had a glossed over slightly piney hoppy aroma. The taste was sweet and bitter at different times as it never showed enough potential to be bittersweet, that�s okay to me. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Overall, this one actually goes great with food. This was another beer I�ve had with their reuben and it made a spectacular meal.
Big Buck Bass Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Buck Brewery;Tap @ Brewpub with Nuffield. Rating from 2004 notes. A toasted malt base with a nice layer of hops. English style with relatively sharp flavors.
Big Buck Bass Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Buck Brewery;"Seasonal offering. I�m not sure how much this varies from some of the other beers they�ve had in the past, though it seemed more pleasant than many. Amber color, some head production. Rich aroma, decently hopped. Not a West Coast IPA to be sure, but interesting. Nice, restrained flavors, bitter finish, in a standard cold, moderately fizzy palate. They named it after the Bass Pro Shops, with whom they have a joint venture (located right next door) but I wonder if the lawyers advised them of the hazard of naming a beer ""Bass Ale""....? (at Grapevine, TX location)"

Prescott Willow Wheat;Prescott, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Prescott Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub in Prescott where it pours with a gold body that has a slight haze and supports a near white head of foam that leaves behind sheet lacing. The aroma offers up mild wheat notes and a faint sense of banana. The taste has sweet malts pulling into grainy to wheated malts. Not bad. This is even, smooth and a bit thin and lacking in flavor somehow. Seems this will be a good session brew for a hot AZ day.
Prescott Willow Wheat;Prescott, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Prescott Brewing Company;Just OK wheat beer, not a hefeweizen. Lemony, smooth. Not much flavor otherwise. This didn�t need a lemon. On draft at the brewery. For this place I recommend the IPA, chocolate beer (Achocolypse), and a porter. Pale ale is also OK.

Johnsons Kingston Black SV (Draught);Isle of Sheppey, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Johnsons Farmhouse Cider;Canterbury Beer Festival, with Silk Tork.

Scuttlebutt Tripel 7;Everett, Washington, United States;Tripel;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;A clear warm amber colour. Alcohol contributes some sweetness, but it doesn't taste as boozy as the high abv would suggest
Scuttlebutt Tripel 7;Everett, Washington, United States;Tripel;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;A different type of taste for a Belgian beer, not as much spice and more of an orange tinge. very good beer and does not taste like 9% ABV.
Scuttlebutt Tripel 7;Everett, Washington, United States;Tripel;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;12 oz can poured. Finally getting around to trying the regular version, after going straight for the jalapeno version before. A semi cloudy, oily golden orange pour. Sticky head and lacing. Floral taste up front, cool and gentle palate for a stronger brew. Soft banana like fruit character in the background. A pretty good brew here. Can't believe I like it better than the jalapeno version. Almost never works out that way.
Scuttlebutt Tripel 7;Everett, Washington, United States;Tripel;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Cloudy copper-orange color with a medium off-white head that diminishes gradually to an outer ring. Partial rings of lace. Aroma of fruit, yeast and malt. Medium body with flavors of earthy yeast, fruit and caramel malt. The finish is banana and malt. Decent overall.

Scuttlebutt Tripel 7;Everett, Washington, United States;Tripel;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;The aroma doesn�t belie the sourness of the beer. But it shouldn�t be, so this is either very old or just bad. I�m leaning just bad....i tried to drink more but this beer is just soured, it.must be - drain pour.

Scuttlebutt Tripel 7;Everett, Washington, United States;Tripel;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Hazy copper with a white head. Yeast and fruit notes with some grain and spice. Medium body with a slightly dry finish. This one doesn�t hold a lot of interest.
Scuttlebutt Tripel 7;Everett, Washington, United States;Tripel;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Following an afternoon of getting filthy and wet while chopping out caragana root balls and hiding from society 10ft away its time for even more beer. Instead of buying this it was smuggled inside a ducks uterus from the place south of us. Ultra clean beer with almost no head but what existed still holds on. Mellow aroma - soft fruit, yeast, grainy and a bit of dry field grass. The taste is pretty good but the level fades off to the side a touch near the back end. Decent fruit, moderate yeast that fades out, sweet grains, tarty dry finish. Pretty good. It�s not a fucked up attempt like some. Terrible coloured label that lacks depth just like the beer in the bottle. Is it really 2.7... not really but put it up against others and it is. I�m pretty sure I�ve had shittier versions of this style and rated them higher but the line is hard tonight. I guess that makes me realize that I need ot be more honest and really shit all over the plethora of wannabe pieces of shit that steal my money. Not bad, quite enjoyable but needs some complexity and is not up to par with basically anything from muigleB.
Cwmbran Double Hop;Cwmbran, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cwmbran;I have to be fair with this beer, I do not like the style, but ti was true, very bitter, and the prescence of extreme bittering Hops was evident. The colour is dark and a little amber. Bubbling foam.

Flying Pig Aces Amber;Everett, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flying Pig Brewing Co.;Clear amber body with white head. Aroma is medium sweet, lime, some caramel. Taste is medium sweet, evokes a cross between Coke & Sprite with its caramel and lime. Light-medium body with fairly high carbonation. Unusual, but not necessarily a problem with that.

Butford Farm Craft Dry Cider (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Butford Farm Cider;An orange/gold, still, organic cider from a farm in Herefordshire. There are some subtle apple notes in the aroma, together with hints of farmyard and wood. When they say dry, they mean it with this cider. Uncompromisingly dry and tannic on the palate. There are petrolly notes. The fruit has been almost entirely fermented out, although a faint vestige of apple appears towards the end, before disappearing into a crisp and tart finish. Although filtered, this is a serious hard cider, but refined rather than rustic. The overall impression is of austere classiness. Not for anyone who likes a bit of sweetness. 750ml bottle (filtered) from Hop Pocket Wine Co.
Green Flash Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Green Flash Brewing Company;Havent had this one in ages, but I recall liking it quite a bit. Clovey and fruity Bavarian Style Hefe by a quality brewer. Cant really go wrong.

Green Flash Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Green Flash Brewing Company;On tap at Del Mar microbrew fest. I�m glad i stayed towards the end of this event because this was the highlight of the evening. Poured a hazy glowing yellow and orange hef with a decent serving of head. Aroma boasted a huge presence of yeast of that classic stamp of banana, clove, and bubblegum. The flavor was just the same as the aroma but had spice added to it. Would love to have a growler of this or find a 22 oz bomber of this.
Green Flash Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Green Flash Brewing Company;i am not impressed by this beer at all. typically i am a hefeweizen fan and I don�t find this beer to have any tastes that are appealing on the palate.

Terminal Gravity Pale Ale;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Copper tones and biscuit malts and yet some sweetness. Very nice and not the usual APA .
Terminal Gravity Pale Ale;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance � The beer pours a super hazy orange color with a one finger head of off white foam. The head has a good level of retention maintaining strength for a long time before fading away to leave tons of thick foam on the sides of the glass. Smell � The aroma of the brew is massive of a bready and yeasty smell, taking on a drier bready aroma. Along with these strong aromas comes a little bit of a light herbal smell as well. Taste � The taste begins with a very bready taste mixed with a strong yeastiness as would have been anticipated from the nose. These tastes create the base flavor of the brew and are the dominant flavors throughout. There is a bit of lemon citrus upfront which fades a bit as the taste advances being replaced by some grapefruit and herbal hop tastes. A little bit of grassiness comes at the very end, leaving one with a lightly hopped but thick bready taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer is super thick and chewy for a brew for a pale with a carbonation level that is rather low. The chewy body was actually kind of good for the big yeasty bread tastes of the brew. Overall � A very thick and bready pale ale with a lighter overall hop hit. Not a bad brew overall, although a little more hop and a tad less thickness may have better suited the style

Zhujiang Golden Label;Guangzhou, Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou Zhujiang Brewery Group Co. Ltd;The foam is absent, carbonation is weak and the flavor is bland and uninspiring and contains little weak hops. The taste is usual for an industry lager, though perhaps a little more malt mellow than other Chinese lagers I�ve tasted. The alcohol content is 5.3%, so in terms of strength is shown also slightly stronger than the other Chinese lagers I know - and it may be part of the explanation. It tastes so far ok, but just like most other industrial lagers, boring and anonymous.
Zhujiang Golden Label;Guangzhou, Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou Zhujiang Brewery Group Co. Ltd;330ml green long-neck.

Grainy and citrusy aroma, reminds me of an unfermented brewing mash. Thin grainy and citrusy in the flavor with a vague hoppy bitterness. Uninteresting and a dissapointment from this brewer!

Wood, strong spirit, vanilla, young oak, (milk)chocolate. Chocolated, sharp peppery finish. Dark grapes, chocolate covered. Lots of fusels & esters.

Hair of the Dog Adam from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Fles gekocht tijdens Borefts in de shop bij Brouwerij De Molen. Uitgeschonken in een snifter glas. Diepe donkere roodbruine mahonie kleur, troebel met vrijwel geen schuimkraag. Slechts een lichte ring van beige schuim langs de rand van het glas. Overigens vrij typerend bij meer bieren van Hair of the Dog. De Aroma's zijn super complex, het eerste zijn de krachtige bourbon tonen uit de vaten. Bourbon, hout, vanille. Vervolgens veel donker fruit, rozijnen, vijgen, dadels, pruimen, gevolgd door kokos en daarna een getoast gerookt accent van gebrande of gerookte mout, en aardse tonen van pure cacao, leder en tabak. Maximale complexiteit in het aroma van dit bier, heeft veel raakvlakken met een barrel aged Barley Wine. Het smaakpallet vervolgt de aroma's, een zoet en complex bier, met een krachtige bourbon smaak van hout en vanille, gecombineerd met rozijnen en ander donker fruit, ook chocolade, karamel/toffee. Verder aardse complexe accenten van leder en tabak. Mondgevoel is medium, olieachtig, zeer zachte carbonatie, wat perfect past bij dit bier. Een geweldig bier, prijzig maar absoluut een van mijn favorieten, bijna net zo goed als de 1978 Heaven Hill Versie van Borefts 2015. Deze versie nu 2x geproefd, absoluut erg onder de indruk van deze brouwerij.
Hair of the Dog Fred from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;just a well rounded beautiful brew. Aged and oaked with so many usuals and that tobacco chew and hit. Great and hard to see these days.

Hair of the Dog Fred from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Draft at Tria Taproom. Having following the original Fred. Both look similar (cloudy dark gold) but this one has no head. Big booze in the aroma. Taste follows. The Bourbon smoothes out the small hop bite of the original and darkly sweetens the finish. Feels more about the barrel than its namesake. Less complex. Still very easy drinking for such a high ABV.
Hair of the Dog Fred from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;355ml bottle @ the source. 2008 Vintage, 10 years old. Pours an mildly clear amber brown colour with no head. Nose is candied sugar, wood notes, leather, and caramel malt. Flavour has lots of wood upfront, sweet caramel, rich toasted malt, raisins, and a touch of cardboard. Medium bodied, no carbonation, and a moderate to mild sweetness, rich, smooth, and complex in flavour. Delicious.

Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;2003 OBF. Light brown color. A medium bodied barleywine ale. Malty with a fairly strong alcohol overtone. Citrus and orange flavor. Complex undertones. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty. Interesting beer.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;No head. Body is dark amber. Aroma is moderately malty (burnt caramel), lightly hoppy (resin), with notes of sherry and apple. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Full body, syrupy texture, flat carbonation. Eeee, I like fresh Doggie Claws, but this one seemed to have lost a lot of its character and gained weirdness (apple smell from the cask and some oxidation) that isn�t fitting. Didn�t enjoy this.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;RBSG04: Dark and heavy on the tongue. Clean sweetness. Big notes of toffee, caramel, and a big blast of black licorice. Left a lingering sweetness on the lips. Hop bitterness blended wonderfully.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;RBSG 2004 on cask at the brewery: Clear dark orange with no head. Wood notes, rich malts and brown sugar in the aroma, starts and ends sweet, full bodied with a thick mouthfeel.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Sampled @ brewery, RBSG 2004. Strong maple nose, a little creamy note from the cask, some sweet bubble-gum, candy sugar notes as well, with some honey and butterscotch. Really exceptional, very fresh hops, strong for a cask ale, not very smooth at all, but very enjoyable.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;RBSG 04, thanks again to Alan Sprints for his generosity Pours deep reddish brown with virtually no head. The cask aging has made this barleywine smooth and drinkable. Very tasty.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Pours a deep amber with very little head. Aromas of oak, anise licorice, mango, and herbal something that I can�t put my finger on. While this is a young barleywine the oak has given it a depth that it would not normally have. Somewhat sweet and sour with some hoppiness right up front, rather sour in the middle, and finishing with a smooth bitterness followed by an alcohol burn. I can�t wait to get to try this in five years.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Tap @ HotD Tour for RBSG 04�2003 Vintage: The hops blend with the oak extremely well, light oak in the nose & the flavor is more focused on the hops and the sweet lingering brown sugar flavor that is typical of Doggie Claws.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Quite an amazing brew, tons of thanks to Alan Sprints for this one at the RBSG04. Poured right from the barrel with a deep red color and a soapy bubbled off-white head. Very sweet aroma, malty, woody, hoppy, and some spice to it. Taste starts strong and alcoholic with the wood taste elevating this already amazing brew.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws from the Wood;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Dark ruby with a small light tna head. The aroma is wood, caramel, and some toffee. The flavor is quite hoppy, though the wood is still there. The sweetness in the aroma is cut some by the hops. Full palate with some alcohol burn.
Piedboeuf Brune;Jupille-sur-Meuse, Belgium;Brown Ale;Brasserie Piedboeuf (AB InBev);Fles geprobeerd in Luxemburg. Het is een donkerbruin bier met een rode gloed. Het heeft weinig schuim. De geur is moutig en zoet. De smaak is zoet en caramel achtig.
Founders Cherry Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);another beer i had at the harvest celebration down at founders ales...beautiful cherry red color (similar to a raspberry tea appearance)..a tart cherry flavor, somewhat sour, maybe a hint of vinegar? quite appetizing
Founders Cherry Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bing, bing, bing, this was all cherry! Fresh cherries in the nose, but cherry syrup on the palate. One dimensional with little else to write about. Fun to sip on, though!
Founders Cherry Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. This beer didn�t come together for me. Fairly clear red-brown body, thin off-white head. Very light aroma (served too cold!) of grassy hops and cherry syrup. Flavor of cherry syrup, tart (and a touch woody) cherry skin, and underlying toasty malt with bitter hops. Had an acidic bite and just a hint of alcohol. The malt backbone wasn�t strong enough to support the cherry flavor. Syrupy aftertaste. At $4.50/pint this was an expensive mediocre beer!
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Growler... This beer rocks!� Pours clear and dark purple with flashes of crimson and a small, creamy, violet head. Smells like a blessed marriage of 100% blueberry juice and cookie dough. Full-bodied with a whole-milk mouthfeel and relaxed carbonation. Sweet blueberry juice and enough lightly bitter roastiness and mildly tart acidity to keep the residual sugar from becoming annoying and cloying. Lengthy, blueberry, sweet-tangy finish. I�m going against the grain here. Another world-class beer from Kuhnhenn - shared with the south Florida crew by biggsbowler!
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy blueberry pancake batter. It pours a dark orangish-brown with a one finger off-white head that eventually fades to a thin film. The flavor starts a quick dose of caramel and light grapes. The finish has moderate-heavy blueberries with a touch of cereal grains. It?s medium bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat soft mouthfeel. Overall, maybe nitpicking, but this makes me think more of blueberry Eggo waffles than pancakes.
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Growler shared by Randall. Purplish brown pour with a fleeting white head. Welch�s grape soda bouquet. Grape, blueberry, and biscuit notes. Average body and mouthfeel.
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Intense blueberries aroma. Taste resembles IHOP syrup. Very sweet bordering on saccharine. Uh. Well then, that sure was a beer.
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Next time order just a sample* Pours a dirty purple yogurt, purple head foam. Blueberry aroma. Thick blueberry syrup with a little chalkiness and little vanilla. Thick body light carbonation. Hard to put down a pint of this...
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Dark beer with a violet foam for a head. Blueberry and sugar nose. This is a blueberry forward beer with some maple syrup notes. It is reminiscent of the last bite of blueberry pancake when you sop up all the syrup.
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Smells like fresh blueberries. Taste is really creamy and full of blueberry. Sugary and sweet all the way down. Pretty drinkable for how sweet it is. Definitely interesting.
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tastes like breakfast in a glass. Bit too sweet for my liking, but still very good. Not much head.
Kuhnhenn Wild Blueberry Pancake Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kuhnhenn Brewing;[Growler / Spring 2013 Batch] Thanks, Jeff! Murky, pours like shit-colored swamp water... bottom of the barrel? Watery mud with black/blue specs floating around... What? Aroma smells like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles, blueberry perfume, faint maple, & a finish of something spicy & herbal... almost like tobacco but not as harsh. Earthy? A little sweet cocoa in the tail end, too. Taste is heavier blueberry syrup but still carries a fruity collage, again, much like Fruity Pebbles. Dense, juicy, syrupy. Brown sugar, light cocoa, & more of that ashy, herbal tobacco leaf character. Some crush black pepper notes as well. Wow, what a unique beer. I don�t know if Blueberry Pancake is the best name, but it was a pretty damn tasty brew. [Tap @ Kuhnhenn / Spring 2014 Batch] This time around, the brew was like a thicker, blue & indigo tinted syrup with a lavender head. Aroma was definitely more blueberry oriented, rather than a collage of fruits. Blueberry syrup all day! Taste was sweet blueberries, light syrupy tones with an almost potpourri like spice element hitting hard on the back-end. All in all, almost a completely different brew from last year�s batch, but still very tasty. I like them both!
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;The more I sampled this, the more I like it. At first I wanted to dislike it because of the price....if that makes sense? $1.99 for a 6-pack on clearance @ ABC liquor! I expected something barely drinkable, but this is half-way decent. Sort of reminds me of an Oktoberfest in style. Medium brown wheat ale. Aroma is a little sour, but these bottles are probably past their date. Not a beer I would normally recommend, but for this price it seems like was a steal.
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;"I don�t have a sophisticated palate like others on here. I enjoyed this beer. Not a top favorite, but it�s got a nice mild ""porter"" taste, but none of the heaviness of a typical porter or stout."
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;12oz bottle. Poured an amber color with a small sized off white head. Caramel and sweetness.
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;[7325-20150703] Tap. Sweet malty wet grains aroma has a light burlap nut note.

Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;2015-07-03. Dark amber body with a small beige head.3+ Aroma is odd, notes of lime and citrus, odd malt character. Flavour is similarly odd, strong mineral notes. Average to light bodied palate, soft carbonation. Did not care for this. On tap at the brewpub, Detroit.
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;Aroma is yeasty and fruity cherry with a touch of cereal malt. Appears blood orange red with nice white foam and lace. Tastes bitter up front of charred malt, mildly sweet apple fruitiness, a touch of cherry. Palate is slightly fizzy, but nearly ordinary. Overall, solid, tastes like a red.
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;Tap at brewery. Super dark reddish brown. Light head. Bready nose. Tastes a bit like a red, but is mostly yeasty, fruity, a bit heavy. Nice!
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pilsener glass. The appearance was a nice hazy amber to copper color with a half finger�s worth of white foamy head. When it started to dissipate, there was some stringy lacing. The smell had a roasty sort of nutty/fruitiness. The taste was nutty sweet. There was a creamy malty aftertaste with the pretty much the same kind of finish. On the palate, it sat fairly light to show a decent sessionability about it. Overall, hey, not a bad altbier. I could see myself having this again and possibly even having it with its respected food.
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;Aroma is strong, but reminds me of the amateur homebrewer - dank, earthy basement smells, not appealing. Taste was better, but average at best. Tried again in glass and let it breathe for a minute at a better temperature. Much better. I get the fruit notes in the beer much better.
Detroit Brewing Co. The Detroit Dwarf;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Detroit Brewing Co.;"Pours dark copper with a thin white head; lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is toasted malts and hop with a hint if grassiness. Taste is a bright pop of moderately bitter hops with a floral finish. Full bodied, lively carbonation. Nice brew! Way to go Motown! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Bos Amber Ice Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Tap: dark amber with only a ring of film for head. Had sweet fruity aroma and flavor. Lots of sugar in the flavor also. Had a slight warming to it. Decent brew overall.
Bos Amber Ice Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Tap. Copper colored beer with very little head and no lacing left behind. Ultra sweet sugar and honey in the aroma. Thick, syrupy liquid coats the tongue and palate. Burning alcohol is masked nicely with the amount of residual sugar left. You feel the presence but are not overwhelmed with it. Nice.
Bos Amber Ice Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Draught at MBG Summer fest. Pours a dark orange-amber with a light beige head. Smells of light fruits, tons of caramel, rich toffee and raisin/plum. Flavor is chocolatey, caramelly and very sweet. Not too much variation from sip to sip, and though I hoped for a big, complex treat, it was just a pretty drinkable, decently balanced eis. Maybe a hint of lightly astringent grapes, from the concentrated alcohol and hops, but nothing too easily discernable. Still, I�ve had much worse. Throw in some more interesting flavors and this one would be much better than the EKU eis. It certainly has the mouthfeel and restraint.
Bos Amber Ice Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Draft at 2004 MBG Summer Festival. Poured a large sized tan head with fine-small sized bubbles that were mostly diminishing. Transparent, uncarbonated and an orange-brown hue. Malty and hoppy aroma. Malt and alcohol in the flavor from start to finish. Tingly mouthfeel. The lacing was decent.
Bos Amber Ice Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival Saturday July 24, 2004. This draft brew poured a very large foamy head of mostly diminishing bubbles. The body was transparent uncarbonated and copper in color. The aroma was mild and bock like. The mouth feel was malty with a lingering malt bite in the finish. The flavor contained notes of strong malt hop and caramel flavoring with a very good vinous note. One of my favorites from the fest and at 13% it was kick ass!

Strangford Lough Barelegs;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;(Bottle from Northern Ireland) Nearly copper in color.

Strangford Lough Barelegs;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;Draught at The Hudson, Belfast. Clear amber, small head. Some sweaty hay up front. Sweetish with medium body and rounded mouthfeel. Some caramel, low bitterness. Does not stand out.
Strangford Lough Barelegs;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;bottle at home ... putting me briefly as the top rater of Northern Ireland ... copper ... thin off white head ... sweet light smokey toffee malts ... odd hop ... again smokeyness ... toffee hop .. woody ... odd
Strangford Lough Barelegs;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;"Immediately on opening the bottle an antiseptic chlorophenol (think TCP) aroma made itself known. My initial assumption was this was due to the inclusion of some peated malt in the brew. Peat being still commonly used as a fuel in Ireland this wasn�t surprising. However digging deeper in previous reviews and on the company website I found no mention of this; so unless the recipe has changed recently I think this is an off flavour. On to the tasting then: Burnt toffee and TCP on the nose with a complex smoked malt, sweet cured bacon and beech wood flavour. No bitterness noticeable but a slight tinny flavour present due to phenol interaction with malt. Soft fruit character becomes more prevalent down the glass with plenty of malt character as the phenol presence takes a back seat. The smoked wood flavour stays the duration though. If it is accidental then I think it would be worth releasing a beer with the inclusion of some peated malt because the complexity makes for a much more interesting drink than I assume the regular recipe would be."
Strangford Lough Barelegs;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;A smokey and peaty malty brew. Full bodies and full flavored. Some cookie notes. Very tasty
Strangford Lough Barelegs;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;Really enjoyed this beer. Slightly cloudy golden color, well balanced flavours and very refreshing. Overall a very god beer, would recommend.

Nethergate Azzarat;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask (St. Radegund, Cambridge) Reddy brown, small loose head. Black tea aroma - quite sweet. Sharpish taste. Lots of crazy stuff going on - fruity, sweet, tangy, and alas sour, sulfury, and messy.
Nethergate Azzarat;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask in the Duke of Hamilton NW3. Golden coloured bitter. This is a soft summery beer with a light fruity taste, perhaps a bit of peeach and some apple. Nothing dramatic but very pleasant to drink.
Nethergate Azzarat;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Gallas. Theres an appley sweetness, nutts, bazil nuts, floural hop and not much else. Not in the best condition i didnt think.

Nethergate Azzarat;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask. Down the hatc hwith this one and little stopping at the sides to see what is going on. Hardly worth it in theend.
Nethergate Azzarat;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask at the George Inn, London: Pours a deep golden with a thin off-white head. Aroma has some light citrus and pale malt. Body is somewhat full, lightly tart and malty with some light fruit. Finishes semi-tart and bittersweet.
Nethergate Azzarat;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask@Chelmsford BF. Some nice hoppy aromatics, lemon, toffee, clean and balanced, a nice easy drinker.
Nethergate Azzarat;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Beer #17 at Chelmsford Beer Festival, with Duff. Nethergate�s rendition of a golden summer ale, although it only seems to be brewed on an occasional basis. Clear straw/gold colour. A really pleasant clean, refreshing beer, with lots of juicy tangy hops and a touch of malt. Crisp, dry finish. Not the most complex of beers but drinks very nicely indeed. Cask (gravity dispense).
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Bottle from Hi-Time Wine. Baffled that I am the only bottle rating. Even more baffled I havent entered it yet as this was Spring 08. That this is based on a Tripel is the most incomprehensible. Cherry Rose is full, mellow and warming and might be cloying if not for the supreme balance.
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Pours a nice reddish/purple? color. Very nice pinkish/purple head forms and last for quite a bit. Good lacing. Medium bodied with good carbonation levels. Sourish cherry aroma with a bit of woodiness. A bit tart initially although not tremendously so. Big woody/nutty presence from the pits left in the fruit. NIcely done!
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;"(Draft: Hair Of The Dog Brewery in Portland, OR) Different from the ""regular"" Rose in that there is no use of beets, hibiscus or red peppercorns, but no matter, this is about as red as any beer I�ve seen. The cherry flavor is unique in that it is not sweet, so it�s more realistic in that sugars apparently aren�t added to create a more ""palatable"" sweetness. There�s also a gentle spicy character from the yeast. The pinkish white head maintains a thin layer, but leaves lots of foam on the glass. I only wish I could have had a few minutes to comtemplate this beer without trying to carry on a conversation with Alan. Gotta try this again."
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;RBSG 2004, on cask at the brewery: Hazy red with a small white head. Like Rose but with a huge sour cherry component to it. Some additional sweetness comes up front and then it ends fairly dry.
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;RBSG 2004 Thanks again to Alan Sprints for providing the RB crew w/ some HoTD rarities. On tap, reddish color, the cherry flavor is very nice. This is a very nice fruit beer.
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Sampled @ brewery, RBSG 2004. Bright murky red, wonderful appearance with a small white head. The nose and flavor are dominated by the cherries, with a nise tartness that is kriek-like... a little wood or pit in there, nice bubbly semi-sweet cherry fruit. Thanks Alan.
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Cloudy, chunky amber-red body, topped by an ever so slighlty red hued head. The aroma is sweet and very cherry infused. The flavor almost works, sweet cherry, with some almost lambic like qualities but there is a slight bit of astringency that develops, probably jus tneeds to age a little more and it will be spectatcular. Dry finish, medium body.
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;On tap at the RBSG �04: Pours a deep pink with a lightly pink frothy head. Aromas of cherries and that�s about it. Starts of very tart with a little sweetness. Very easy drinking with the cherries and the oaky sourness playing scenter stage but the malts do a nice job of keeping up. A slight bitterness at the end. The best fruit beer I have had.
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Rose that has 20 pounds of cherries in the cask. Light reddish color. Aroma is cherry, tart and sweet. A medium bodied ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Cherry flavor is tart and slightly sweet, which balances the malts well. Hops are slightly spicy. Nice beer, very subtle flavors. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Hair of the Dog Cherry Rose;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;(RBSG04) Hazy red-amber body with off-white head.

Mahrs Br�u Lager 2010;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Mahrs Br�u;Very golden. Really lacks distinct flavor or aroma. Light citrus pretty sweet. Not my favorite.
Mahrs Br�u Lager 2010;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Mahrs Br�u;Orange gold, lightly hazy. Cereal aroma. Rather one-dimensional oaty cereal flavor - like the runoff from soupy oatmeal. Grain sweetness, underbittered. Finishes out lightly toasty with faint twinges of German hops. On tap, d.b.a, NYC.
Mahrs Br�u Lager 2010;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Mahrs Br�u;Pours a cloudy orange with quickly fading white head. Aroma of citrus hops and straw with a light sweetness. Flavor is a sweet hoppy with a slightly bitter hoppy finish.
Mahrs Br�u Lager 2010;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Mahrs Br�u;A hazy orange beer with a white head. The aroma is sweet with primary notes of straw, but also light caramel notes. The flavor is sweet hoppy with a dry bitter end, that mixes in light hoppy notes.
Mahrs Br�u Lager 2010;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Mahrs Br�u;"Draught. Not sure this is the same beer, drunk under the name Lager ""Fall-Bier"" Darker, clear ""old gold""; white head, dissipating. Sweet - and again! - diacethyl, even when rather faint. Yeasty. Very dull, faint-grassy flavour: some roasted malts impression. Maltsugar dissolved in springwater. Light to medium bodied. Dull to the point of dying. If one needs diacethyl to provide some flavour..."
Mahrs Br�u Lager 2010;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Mahrs Br�u;A cloudy yellow, sudsy, fluffy head and decent lace. Fine particals throughout. Malty nose with notes of herbs, hay and grass.. Medium light bodied, some diacetyl perhaps, fairly clean, well defined malt with herbal and bitter hopping, touch of metal. Passable lager.
Mahrs Br�u Lager 2010;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Mahrs Br�u;"Straw body with some rising carbonation, large head receding, weak nose with herbal and grassy notes. Buttery flavor - diacetyl in a German lager? This has a somewhat overcarbonated mouthfeel and is wrong, wrong, wrong! It leaves a rather lactic finish as well. Yummy metallic tinge too! I have no idea what the description that I typed in means, but perhaps this is supposed to be consumed in 2010? ;)"
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Not really good. Faint wheat and Belgian aroma. Flavor was bland and tasteless. Color was very pale and quite unattractive. Too watery. Not much character to this one.
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Pale, light yellow and cloudy appearance with a lacy white head. Aroma of orange peel, coriander, toasted grains, floral notes, herbal hops, light bready malts and light spicy hops. Similar flavor. Not bad, the spices are overdone though.
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Sampler at Brewers Rendezvous 7/9/11. Pours a thin white head, over a hazy yellow (SRM 3) body....nose is light banana, bubblegum....taste is light banana, bubblegum, touch of cereal...mouth feel light, carbonation medium. This meets the major points of the style, but is otherwise not particularly distinguished. BJCP 6/3/10/4/6
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Hazyish yellow with a light white head. Aroma is noticeably spicier than other wittes. Lots of coriander, orange peel, and peppery floralness. Taste was good, but not as exciting as the aroma. Citrusy wheat, dry Belgian spice, grain, and yeast. A little too carbonated, but it is firm and assertive and a touch different. Points for that.
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;On tap @ brewpub. Very cloudy, luther yellow orange appearance with a white head. Sweet, coriander, orange peel, light wheat malty nose. Lots of coriander and orange peel over a light bodied wheat ale. Coriander, orange peel aftertaste. Easy drinking witbier but the added spices seem a little overdone.
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Pour is a bright cloudy yellow with a large with head. Aroma is not much but some citrus zest. Flavor is kinda weak and watery with a little citrus at the end. The least liked at coopersmiths.
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;This one has a really interesting nose, the chamomile is really apparent, with some spicy white pepper and mustard seed notes. Yeasty spice dominates the palate, but this is still very light and refreshing with lively carbonation. Great on a hot day like this.
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;On tap at the brew pub. Poured a hazy golden-orange color with a frothy white head. Aroma of orange and coriander among other spices. Pretty average wit taste, orange peel, coriander, wheat, and other yeasty spices dominate the taste. Nice, lively carbonation that bites the palate and keeps you coming back for more. It isn�t an out of this world wit, but it is solid and nice on a hot day.
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;On tap at the brewpub on 10/14/07: Pale golden pour has a wispy-lacing froth of white head. Citrusy coriander nose has a pale malty sweetness and authentic lightly doughy Belgian yeast. Body starts with a refreshing light sweetness and crisp, mild orange and lemon citrus balance. A nice witbier, although it could use a little more body.
CooperSmiths Biere Blanche du Fort;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Tap @ CooperSmiths: Poured a hazy light pale yellow color with a small white head. Wheaty citrus aroma with a hint of clove. the wheaty flavor had lemons and oranges. Light spice and a hint of banana. Semi-dry with a lively mouthfeel. Light body and very refreshing.
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss (Honey & Lemon);Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Cask, under the moniker Honey Lemon Weiss. Yes a cask weiss! Cloudy straw color with a moderate cream cask type head. Aroma of lemon grass and bubblegum. Creamy feel. Lemon butter and bubble gum flavors hints of sweet wheat beneath. Different, not a big fan of wheats that are not at least somewhat chilled to begin with. Even the germans serve their weiss cold. Unless they were going after an english wheat in which the yeast is off. All in all, not bad stuff, in a different package. Alert! I forgot the main flavor ingredient, wasabi. Yes, Wasabi. This stuff would be awesome with sushi.
Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;(Draught) Pours a hazy pale yellow body with a small creamy off-white head. Aroma of clove, grass, lemon, and white pepper. Flavor of tobacco, lemon peel, wheat, and coriander.
Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pours a lightly hazy golden orange color. A small, quick head of snow white foam leaves behind minimal, soapy spotting. Aromas include fresh wheat, candied orange peel, crisp floral hop notes, and just a touch of coriander. The malt background is uniquely pilsner like, a hint of creaminess joining the wheat. Flavors are very light and crisp, the freshness of the wheat and the juicy oranges coming through nicely. A floral hop bite is there for balance, exuding freshness in its own right. Light in body but balanced on the tongue, this is a nice little session brew that I wish I had an endless supply of for the hot summer months. Great representation of the style.
Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;On draft at the brewpub. Poured a cloudy tan/gold with a thin white head. The aroma was spicy with citrus. The flavor though - not so much. It tasted like there may have been some cumin in the beer. The coriander was evident, but the bitter orange peel flavor was disappointingly mild. The rest of the flavor consisted of wheat malt with some notes of estery yeasty character. The finish was somewhat dry. The mouthfeel was well-carbonated but not spritzy. Overall, a decent, drinkable brew, but not a great Belgian Wit - Half-wit is an adequate description in this respect...

Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;Cloudy yellow topped by a very small white head. Lifeless body with dead carbonation. A bit stinky with old wet hay aroma. The wrong kind of wild aroma. Taste of wet straw/hay and chewy plain cookies. Not crisp, not refreshing. Lacked aromatic flavours. Feeling of old weizen left on the counter for too long. Half wit, Half good.
Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;I sampled this and thought it was a pretty good belgian wit. a good amount tartness and a little coriander. we thought about getting a pitcher of this but then didn�t. i don�t now what my point is.
Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;Hazy medium yellow color with a white, fizzy head. No lacing. Aroma is strong with hints citrus and lemon, as well as spices and yeast. Initial taste is moderately sweet, mellowing to a light sweet/acidic finish with an average duration. Light bodied, it has a watery texture with active carbonation. Reviewed on January 20th, 2007.
Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;on tap- pours a thin white head and cloudy yellow color. Aroma is sweet, musty wheat/raw wheat, fruit, yeast. Taste is sweet, musty wheat/raw wheat, lemon-fruit, coriander/spices, clove, nutmeg, yeast. OK effervescence.
Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;"Draught pilsner-ish glass at the brewpub on 1/19/07. Kind of an odd glass to serve it in. Or actually, the narrow body makes sense to highlight the bubbly effervescence, but the blossoming, highly convex mouth neither holds the head, nor the delicate aroma. Oh well. Small, bubbly white head immediately fizzles to a ring and then nothing, thereafter. Head can hardly be coaxed with swirling. No lacing. Medium-high clarity, certainly transparent, but with a slight haziness from some unflocced yeast. Soft straw-brass body. Dry grains in the nose show a light huskiness from the base two-row malt. Definite phenols (white pepper, very light plastics) give a distinct and authentic feel to it, while light orange peel adds livliness while not being overdone. Very dry, all the way through, with no soft, comforting honey malt tones that would seem to support my thoughts that there is little/no pils malt in this. But that�s ok because the graininess is very dry and refreshing and the spritziness from the light citrus tang adds substance/complexity in place of pils malt. Don�t get much coriander, which is a good thing, as it�s done very cautiously here. Just a bit of leafy spiciness I suppose. Medium strength of aroma, more dry fruitiness emerges with warming. Hay, straw, light biscuits and baquette notes all create a very dry beginning. Some sweetness combines with citrus (soft orange and tangerine) notes to produce a more round flavor but the brisk carbonation never allows it to get truly ""sweet"". Light coriander dryness on the finish with a bit of sweatiness from the yeast (minerals, phenols) gives it unique character making it not just another hoegaarden. Sort of halfway between hogaarden and Ommegang�s ultra-dry, almost saison-like wit. I think more breweries need to experiment with very minimal spicing and see what they can do with this yeast. It�s quite refreshing, with the moderate amounts of acids it puts out and the manageable, reserved esters. Very light body, some wateriness, no alcohol."
Cambridge Half Wit;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Cambridge Brewing Company;Haven�t had this for a long time, but vivdly remember the experience! on tap at redbones, somerville ma. cloudy golden color. pungent fragrance of citrus with a hint of spice. excellent full bodied flavor. Would go out of my way to sample again.
Cambridge Blueberry Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Cambridge Brewing Company;Purple in color with no head. Aroma of blueberries yet with a slight cranberry-like tartness. Mild woody flavor with a dry, tart blueberry character.
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Corner Pit bar and restaurant Taipei. Clean and crisp wheat beer with no overriding features beyond that. Perhaps I am being harsh as it was 250nt from the Corner Pit restaurant as opposed to say 90nt in a 7-11 which is more the price range of a decent if unspectacular American beer.
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Fruity, wheat and hoppy. Good flavor for low Abv. Not bad for the style. Had this from a 12oz bottle at no name saloon in park city
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Aroma of wheat and hops. Pours a clear light gold with no head. The taste is pleasingly sheath with a nice balance of hops. Medium body and medium carbonation - crisp mouthfeel. Overall, very refreshing - especially at 11:30 am on a Labor Day Friday.
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Draft to taster at brew pub pour hazy light yellow with thin white head. Nose sweet malt, hint of banana but muted. Taste initial sweet, light banana, minimal spice. Overall a very fruit predominate profile. Minimal to no grainy malt.
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Bottle, orange pour, small white head, nose is bread, taste is citrus, decent wheat.
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub in San Antonio. Appearance: Pours hazy golden-amber with a creamy and durable head. Feel: Excellent soft carbonation in a near medium body. Approaches 4.5 Flavor: very good balance. Fine, light-roasted grain flavor with some complexity. Excellent bready finish, with some sheat, and aftertaste. O: a superb hefe.
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;On tap at the Crunkleton, nice gold color, not much head, very little nose, great floral taste, with honey, like drinking a bouquet of wildflowers
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Bottle poured cloudy yellow with little head or lacing. Aroma is crisp, malty, and a bit of citrus. Flavor is very light malt, creamy and just a touch of hops on the finish. Even better when I added a touch of lemon. Good stuff.
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;Tasting - Gulf Brew 2010 - golden yellow, white head. Lemony, hay, notes, with some citrus inthe flavor, some hops presence in the after, but not much to the aroma for this tasting. still a decent wheat.
Blue Star Wheathead;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Star Brewing Co.;This wasn�t a bad wheat, but nothing special. Had some nice grass, wheat, floral notes, but just not quite enough. You can guess this is going to happen when you look at it, because it�s not cloudy enough to be a great wheat. Decent though.
Blue Star Summer Bock;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blue Star Brewing Co.;"Lots of caramel and toffee malt (H); floral hops (L); prune, plum, figs, red grapes. Hazy peach-caramel body. Moderately sweet, moderately acidic (tart) flavor becomes a lightly sweet, lightly acidic (tart), lightly bitter finish. Medium body, creamy/watery texture, soft carbonation. The bottom line is: there�s a tasty fruitiness upfront which fades to a raw, yet smooth, floral finish."
Crippledick Medium Cider;Faversham, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Crippledick Cider;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Kent Beer Festival. Very pale colour. SLight haze. Very sweet nose with some dryness underneath and some creosote creeping in. Flavour is very very sweet initially but then mellows to straight forward apple juice with a dryish finish.
Crippledick Medium Cider;Faversham, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Crippledick Cider;Canterbury Beer Festival, with Silk Tork. I thought this was a very well made cider. Not as austerely dry (obviously) as some of the ciders we had tried earlier, but still has an authentic farmyard aroma and plenty of backbone. Drinks easily.
Kuhnhenn Maple Lager;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"2004 draught at Michigan brewers fest. Pours a dark golden-brown with some lighter yellow tinges around the edges, moderately hazy with a good sized white head. Aroma of lightly sweet caramel, hints of maple and a dose of hops. Maple flavor takes a while to develop and does not overpower. Though it�s a sweet beer, the body is smooth and there�s a crisp bite at the end; good lager yeast and some earthy hops. Well-balanced, not terribly complex, but does what it�s supposed to do: provides a great tasting maple beer."
CJs Old Crusty Old Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;CJs Brewing Company;"Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a semi-dark copper/auburn color with a finger�s worth of white foamy head. Super light stringy lace. The aroma had some rugged and roasty dark malts, some nuts/pecans, light vanilla, some black cherries and a touch of some earthy/grassy hops. Some herbal/basement-like danky breadiness comes in to balance as it warmed. The flavor seemed to blend most of this together somewhat nicely in a refined sort of semi-sweet malty manner. All seemed to ride together into the aftertaste and seemed to miss the point of finding it�s way to the finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a fair jumpy sort of sipping quality about it. Some dryness seemed to touch my tongue here and the ABV felt fine. Overall, some day I�ll probably be an ""old crusty"" man, when that happens and I�m probably not far off yet, I could see myself coming back to this. And maybe, just maybe, I�ll find my way back to Michigan and if I�m lucky, I�ll just fall off into Lake Huron and no one will miss me, probably the way I�d like it."
Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;Found out of bottle. Pours a dark purple with a medium white foam. Pleasant fruit aroma. Mild fruit flavor. Good early fall fruit beer.
Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;12 ounce can at Winking Lizard Copley Ohio. Smell cider and vinegar Not much head but film on glass berries. Four different berries in this beer. Light bodied. Blueberry a. Decent summer beer. Cheer
Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;12 oz. can. Pours a clear orange-amber color with a small white head and good retention. Decent lacing. Tart/sour aroma. Flavor is kinda weird. It's part cider, part beer and part light fruit juice. IMHO, it doesn't really succeed at any of them. Just a blah mix of flavors, more tart than sweet. Not bitter. Nothing bad, but I won't repeat. At least the 7.5% ABV is well hidden. Imperial fruit beer?
Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;Bottle. Too sweet. Caramel from this toasted malt ruins the effect. Berries are nice. This beer is begging for sour fermentation. Actually, has some properties of sour red without any sourness xd

Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;Am I ever glad I only got a single bottle from Total Wine. Actually, I really enjoyed the Soft Parade - - but only after I half filled the glass with frozen raspberries. Without that, it is a thin, faint whiff of fruit on a feeble frame.
Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;Pours cloudy deep amber with low white head. Aroma of cherries and red berries, light almond icing. Taste is a bit artificial, fruity sweet, light tart finish. Light and smooth body with soft carbonation.
Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;Really really surprised with this beer. They poured in a bunch of sugars with all of the fruit but they fermented all of those sugars. The picture of the person passed out on the label is fitting. 7.5 alcohol. This is dry and fruity. Raspberries and strawberries come through in a very natural and subtle way. There is a slight tannin bitterness to this that really balanced this out. Dry finish. Very pleased that this is not as sweet as I assumed it would be.
Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;12 oz single bottle from Whole Foods Market - Indianapolis (on 86th). Clear amber colored appearance with an off-white head. Aroma of berries, toasted malt, light esters and a touch of rye spice. Similar flavor, fruity, malty and moderately sweet with a light spicy bitterness. Medium body with a fresh fruity/berry finish. Solid.
Short's Soft Parade;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Short's Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle from the new Craft Beer Cellar in Pewaukee. Pours a brownish reddish color with a bit of spotty lacing. Looks very fruity. Aroma has a mix of different berries; certainly cranberry, cherry, and some raspberry appear. Taste is a mix of sweet and tart with a big berry presence. Perhaps some sweet malts in there as well. Quite fruity, quite tart, but with a nice sweetness mixed in as well Perhaps a bit thin. Less than medium-bodied The blend is good, and there is little alcohol presents. Finishes well blended between sweet and tart. This was enjoyable as a sweet tart mix with a lot of berry flavor and nose. 13.8"
Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;Draft to taster at Shorts from notes. Pours a yellow golden color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale malts, citrus and light grape fruity character, floral notes, mild overall, one and done for me.
Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;Pours thick orange amber with a big creamy light sandy white head. Aroma brings grapey straw malts and hops smooth in the nose. Couldn�t describe the flavor better than they did above, but the hops have maintained a delicious presence even with time on it! Also the grape fruity tone in the finish is described to a tee, so pleasant on the palate. The hops are definitely in the forefront with the low ABV.
Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;Malty aroma. Medium to light with some bitter finish. Malty, drying some toast and a touch yeasty. Decent.
Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a cloudy golden color. Aroma and taste are mostly grassy hops.
Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;Pours a hazy yellow with a white foam head. Aroma is very light grassy hops. Flavor is similar, though I�m having a hard time getting anything out of this. There�s a light bitterness that lends some body, but is also slightly off-putting. I had a difficult time enjoying this one.
Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;Wonderful hop and malt blend for a slightly sweet but hoppy brew. Solid body for only 4.5% ABV!
Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;Bottle. Cloudy light orange pour with very little head.

Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;Smells of light hop maybe citrus, starts as hop flavor very easy goin tho nothing shouts til the finish, this is when the bitter hop bite kicks in, nothing to rave about but drinkable
Short's The Village Reserve;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Short's Brewing Company;The Village Reserve pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow with an eggshell white head that lasts a good while.

Aroma is full of caramel malts, pine, floral hops, and light citrus. Taste is bitter at first and in the finish, but the big malty sweetness in the middle is what I'll remember most about this one.

Beowulf Stockbroker;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beowulf Brewing;Hand pulled at the Old Joint Stock, Birmingham. Orangey bitter, with a zesty pepper aroma. Pleasingly bitter flavour, with some orange content, porssibly orange peel. Feels almost agressive on the finish, which is nothing but good in my book. Quenching and satisfying for its ABV.
Bennetts Classic Black;Wellington, New Zealand;Porter;Island Bay Brewing Company;"330 ml bottle Aroma: yeasty, chocolate and a pungent earthiness; Appearance: dark brown and clear, good thick head and substantial lacing; Taste: slightly sweet, slightly bitter, no detectable sourness but it is fairly robust without being really rounded so there is something missing, possibly salt; Palate: medium bodied, thinnish, a tad bit sticky, slightly carbonated and a faintly astringent finish; Overall: Lot of coffee but just too thin for a porter."
Bennetts Classic Black;Wellington, New Zealand;Porter;Island Bay Brewing Company;Pours almost black, with ruby edges. Brown filmy head. Aroma is quite nice, burnt malt with some ester fruitiness. Can�t really get any hops which is disappointing. Watery texture, quite clean initially then some roasted malt shows up late. Somehow gets stronger, with a surprising astringent coffee finish. I actually said �wow� when the finish hit, as the flavour is somewhat weak. The coffee finish saved this beer from being very mediocre.
Bennetts Classic Black;Wellington, New Zealand;Porter;Island Bay Brewing Company;(Bottle 33 cl) Clear, brown with an orange hue and a beige head. Sweetish, hard roasted malt aroma. Medium body with sweetish, hard roasted malts, some bitter dark chocolate and an almost smoky touch. Very subdued bitterness.

Bennetts Classic Black;Wellington, New Zealand;Porter;Island Bay Brewing Company;Tasted 25/05/2005. 330ml bottle at Neil Miller�s Cellar-Vate tasting. Dark brown, almost black, with an airy, disappearing, tan head. Chocolate, coffee and sugar on the nose. Sweet, sugary, malt flavour up front with a roasty bitter finish. A bit of a carbonation tang and too light in weight. Didn�t stack up at all well against the Speights Porter, which followed.

Bennetts Ardenne Style Strong Ale;Wellington, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Island Bay Brewing Company;1.25 L bottle. BB 10/05. pale golden beer with a thin white head.

Nothing to write home about, probably go nice with a mild curry or Japanese sashimi and noddles. The notes here indicate it does not travel well or there may be quality control issues."
Bennetts 4 Seasons Ale;Wellington, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Island Bay Brewing Company;(Bottle 33 cl) Clear, pale golden with a tiny, white head. Distinct aroma of ginger. Medium body, lightly sweet notes of orange and again a distinct touch of ginger. Somewhat chemical. Absolutely no bitterness.

Bennetts 4 Seasons Ale;Wellington, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Island Bay Brewing Company;Tasted 01/01/2005. 330ml bottle from Paramount Theatre, Wellington. Gold. Bright. Off-white head, disappears quickly. Aroma is musty, not very fresh. Ginger dominates with brown sugar and a touch of pepper. There is another sweetness on the nose that I can�t place, more fruity than honey. Dry flavour, again musty, with some sugary sweetness and spice in the middle. Very short. Lightweight and spirtzy. Interesting beer but slightly missed the mark.
Bennetts 4 Seasons Ale;Wellington, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Island Bay Brewing Company;Two spicey beers in two days!!! Ginger aroma with big strong ginger tatse, but became quite confuse, many different flavours came through, honey, corriander, weird. Was amber in colour with small white head. Would be one of very few spice beers in New Zealand

Exactly what you�d expect: wheaty and fairly unobtrusive. Refreshing and a good pair with some wiener schnitzel, but nothing special.
Fischer Br�u Weisses;Wien, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fischer Br�u;Oct. �14. On tap at the brewpub. It poured hazy golden body with quite small head for the style. Lightly sour hop aroma, obviously unpasteurized with lot of herbal hop that overwhelmed wheat notes. Flavor was, accordingly, bitter. Not quite what you expect from a German wheat ale, not really malty and aromatic (estery) as they are. Thinner to medium body with pleasant, lightly herbal bitter finish. Some banana and chalk were more evident towards the end. Weird, even if they intended to make a hopped weizen, it missed body and real wheat notes to balance it out. Reading the other reviews make me think it was just the batch.

Aroma is a lot of grain, lightly sweet with honey. Taste is fairly light, surprisingly so with this strength. Pale malts are strong though. Not very sweet, some honey. Perhaps even a light lemon. Decent carbonation, rather full, perhaps lightly sticky in the mouth. Good, but not very drinkable again and stronger flavors are needed with this ABV.

Shiny black with an off tan head that never truely went away, and left lots of lacing, along with little ""islands""in the black, stormy water. The first thing you notice when the pint hits the table is vanilla. It just rolls off this like crazy. REally chewy and sweet, with a good dose of chocolate, vanilla, and crystal malt flavors. Long creamy finish. Everyone in my party, even the ""I don�t like dark beer"" girls we had with us really dug it. Would be a good desert."

Town Hall 1800 Old English IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewery.

Town Hall 1800 Old English IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a lovely hazy peach color. Aromas are great..

St Georges Jolly Jim;Callow End, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;St Georges Brewery;Cask@Chelmsford BF. Pale yellow/gold. Very bland aroma and flavour, not much happening at all, watery mouthfeel, grainy and thin, very boring.
St Georges Jolly Jim;Callow End, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;St Georges Brewery;Beer #21 at Chelmsford Beer Festival, with Duff. Very pale straw colour. Not much in the way of aroma. The colour hints that this will be a zingy, crisp summer beer but, in reality it comes over more as a basic session bitter. Not a bad one, just not that exciting. Cask (gravity dispense).
Delvin End Storm Cider;Halstead, Essex, England;Apple Cider;Delvin End Cider;500ml plastic bottle from Delvin End Cidery. Clear pale yellow colour, no head and light apple aroma.

Dutch Gold Imported;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);A delightful tipple for the discerning beer aficionado !! A lovely full bodied experience complemented by subtle flashbacks of aggression , added bonus is that it holds its taste on the morning after if left open , convenient for the bevvier on the go post house party !
Dutch Gold Imported;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Great value beer, average price in Ireland is around �1 per can, sold in packs of 4 or 8. Brewed in the Netherlands for exportation to Ireland and Ireland only. Would definitely recommend trying it when in Ireland as a bit of cultural enlightenment. Takes some getting used to, carries a lot of stigma due to its frequent association with bums, undesirables and down and outs, but will gain you some cool points if you are drinking it at a party as it is often disregarded by common people as being disgusting and a hard mans drink based solely on the association mentioned above. Taste will grow on you after the first can or two and goes down smoothly when left to rest to just below room temperature, goes down a bit watery if served chilled. Best drank from the can and drank quickly (in about 20 minutes) as the carbonation decreases soon after opening. Head is scummy and is therefore not best drank from a glass. Taste is no different from any other macro lagers when drank from the can, a blind taste test with other well known beers would not reveal any noticeable differences in terms of taste. Drink it and see for yourself, very budget friendly (coming from a student), goes down smooth, somewhat gassy but refreshing after a hard days work.
Dutch Gold Imported;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"Flavorsome flavor. Tastes of hops, beer. Pours yellowish with bubbles and white foam on top. Fizzy bubbles. Strong ""beer"" taste with mild alcoholic aftertaste. Good as a beverage. 10/10"
Dutch Gold Imported;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Anyone buying Dutch Gold should know by now they�re not buying quality beer. You get what you pay for. This is no more and no less than any other lager out there including any bottles of pilsner piss aldi/lidl import.... including big brand names like tennents (except miller) To be honest Tuborg is cheaper and just as good as this. DG does the job, you get pissed and that�s about it.
Dutch Gold Imported;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"Slightly ""worn"", borderline nauseating yeasty aroma. Light in colour, but with decent foam which has a texture similar to whipped cream. Uncomfortable hops-type in the aftertaste, which last a bit too long. Makes you burp. The taste itself has an OK sweetness. Tastes of tourist crap souvenirs, yellow grapes and supersaver deals. I can get used to this, but would prefer not to."
Greenes Gargoyle Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Custom Brewcrafters;At Alternative Brews. Creamy head, creamy mouthfeel, understated hops, drinkable for some more than others.
Greenes Gargoyle Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Custom Brewcrafters;Draft at Greene�s in Oswego. Red amber ale with a strong diacetyl aroma. Grassy sweet malt, barely hopped, oily mouthfeel. Watery and boring.
Greenes Gargoyle Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Custom Brewcrafters;[draft - Custom Brewcrafters - Honeoye Falls, NY] Very light aroma, mostly hops with hints of citrus, sap and other earthen notes. Very sweet smelling. Smooth sweet flavor with hints of toffee and brown sugar at the beginning, then going to a hoppy middle and a smooth, bitter hop and malt finish. Very well blended. [[400th Rating]]
Greenes Gargoyle Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Custom Brewcrafters;On draught at Old Toad: Light amber in color with a smallish thick, white, creamy head. Light hop aroma (pine, citrus), some toffee, and light malt hit the nose. This was on cask when I tried it, and was head and shoulders above anything else custom brewcrafters brews. Flavor has caramel, toffee, with a nice bitter burnt malt characteristic as well as some easy going pine/floral hops that give it great balance. I agree that this is probably an English Pale Ale. Great stuff.
Greenes Gargoyle Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Custom Brewcrafters;Had this a while back, but I wanted to rate it then, and have been waiting to rate it. Strange that Custom Brewcrafters dosent list this one on their website, but they definitely brew it. Had it on hand pull at the Old Toad. Pours a vibrant orange-amber with a good creamy white head. Smells hoppy, toasty and toffee like, but mostly hoppy (light pine, light light citrus). Flavor is plenty of caramel and toffee with a good dose of hops in the middle that linger on the finish. Terribly balanced stuff here and I believe this one is actually an English style India Pale Ale.
Greenes Gargoyle Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Custom Brewcrafters;Lighter amber color, thick creamy head. Light malt aroma, very faint hops. Predominantly malty flavor, light hops round it out. Shorter finish. Light to medium bodied. Decent, but typical of CB.
Far West Mango Tango;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Far West Brewing Company;Aroma: nail polish, acetone, hair salon chemicals Appearance: golden yellow, off-white head, some lacing Flavor: mangoes and other tropical flavors, some acetone and chemicals in the flavors Palate: sweet and fruity, smooth, slightly bubbly, sour milk mixed with fruit aftertaste
Far West Mango Tango;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Far West Brewing Company;OBF 2004. Hair-salon/nail polish nose with some fruit. Thick and syrupy fruit, lemons, oranges and banana. A little alcohol bite, or maybe that�s the chemical taste. Not as bad as the aroma, but still mediocre.
Far West Mango Tango;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Far West Brewing Company;(OBF04) Hazy golden body with off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, caetone, light mango. Taste is medium sweet, mango, astringency. Light body.
Far West Mango Tango;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Far West Brewing Company;Light gold color. Aroma is fruity with a touch of hairspray? I guess it could be banana, clove and honeysuckle. A medium bodied fruit beer. Malts are fruity and sweet. Mango flavor is there but sort of subtle. Hops are slightly bitter. Very mild fruit flavors. I am assuming that mango may NOT be the best fruit to make a fruit beer with, it may not have enough flavor to combat the hops and malts. A little chemical tasting as well. Light and refreshing though. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Golden Valley IPA VS Brut;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA - Brut;Golden Valley Brewery;This was a 750ml bottle that was four years old but was properly stored throughout. Aroma: Very subtle notes of citrus and resin characteristic of northwest hops, perhaps subdued by the thick and long standing head. Appearance: Amber-coppery color with that aforementioned long standing and off-white head. Very clear. Taste: Nice sweetness from malts balanced by hop bitterness. Caramel and oak notes that didn�t present in the initial aroma assessment. Palate: Medium-light body with medium carbonation. Somewhat creamy with a dry and clean finish. Some alcohol warmth, especially after it warmed up a bit in the glass. Overall: Doesn�t fit neatly into style category so hard to pass judgment on it, other than the facts that the champagne characteristics along with the barrel aging and big northwest hop profile all married together nicely. Very enjoyable and would most definitely have again and recommend as well. Not sure that any additional aging would have improved anything but four years doesn�t seem to have hurt it.
Golden Valley IPA VS Brut;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA - Brut;Golden Valley Brewery;Bottle shared by ShareANevada (BA). Pours a hazy amber color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma is floral and citrus hops, a touch of resin, yeast, and slightly fruity. The flavor is fruity with sweet caramel malts. The hops seem to have faded, but still provide some grapefruit-like bitterness. This shows signs of oxidation which begs the question of its age. Medium-full bodied with light carbonation. I am left with questions about this beer and don�t really know what to think.
Golden Valley IPA VS Brut;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA - Brut;Golden Valley Brewery;Bottle. Poured a clear copper color with an average frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy sour citrus, floral and wood aroma. Medium body with a slick smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a very drinkable beer and my expectations where met.
Golden Valley IPA VS Brut;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA - Brut;Golden Valley Brewery;12/15/2007: Golden Valley IPA VS Brut has a deep golden to nearly amber color and has a light beige-colored head. It has a soft floral and orangy citrus nose. The flavor has light caramel malt (subtle), citrusy bitterness, and a hint of dry oak. There is a mild to moderate bitterness through the finish. This beer has a surprisingly medium to medium-full body and is lightly carbonated, feels soft on the palate and even has a creamy texture! Overall this beer is well-balanced and has a good combination of malt and bitterness. It is really like a Pale Ale with more alcohol (that can�t be found in the taste anyways!)... 750 mL bottle shared by nvhall. Thank you! Rating #37 for this beer.
Golden Valley IPA VS Brut;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA - Brut;Golden Valley Brewery;Light amber in color with a decent sized cream colored head. Indestinct aroma, but there is some grapefruit, oak and smoke. Tastes like a belgian on hop steroids...grapefruit with a dry oak finish.
Golden Valley IPA VS Brut;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA - Brut;Golden Valley Brewery;Loved it! Sparkling IPA. Rich and yeasty with plenty of hops. Unfiltered, opaque. Deep golden, orange color. Belgian-esque texture. Sweet and fruity. Had it as the brewery as a suprise. Good stuff.
Golden Valley IPA VS Brut;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA - Brut;Golden Valley Brewery;Bottled. A hazy golden beer with a thin lazing off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of wine, spices, and hops. The flavor is sweet with strong ntoes of chardonnay and wood - very sweet and very complex, leading to a dry woody finish. Matured in an Argyle barrel.
Golden Valley IPA VS Brut;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA - Brut;Golden Valley Brewery;Orange color with an off-white head that quickly dissipates. Skunky aroma with bits of caramel. Taste was also skunky, but had a little bit of grass and pine to it. I think the clear bottle might have ruined this beer. Medium carbonation and medium body. Would try this again if not in a clear bottle.

Stadium Hefeweizen;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stadium Brewing Company;~4 oz pour as part of a sampler at the brewpub. Pour is a hazed yellow golden with a 1/2 inch white topping the glass. Aroma is clean grain, wheat, hint of lemon citrus and a nice soft clove yeast. Taste is the nose, but all more subdued - flavors integrate well, but are just not assertive at all. Palate is meduium bodied, crisp finish. Clean enough, just duller than I prefer. Certainly one of the most drinkable in the sampler.
Stadium Hefeweizen;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stadium Brewing Company;Draft. An unclear golden beer with a thin white head.

Stadium Hefeweizen;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stadium Brewing Company;Went to Stadium and got the sampler. This was by far their best beer. It actually was a reasonable Hefe. It had a nice banana nose, and crisp flavor, along w/ the standard hazy yellow color
Stadium Pale Ale;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stadium Brewing Company;~4 oz pour as part of a sampler at the brewpub. Pour is mostly clear orange brownish with an off white head. Aroma is resinous fresh leafy hops, some orange citrus and biscuit malt underneath. Fresh hoppy nose. Taste is the nose, with resinous and citrus hops balanced decently with the biscuit malt. Though balanced, the flavors were quite unintegrated. The palate continues this theme, with the hops lasting for awhile, then the malt passing through. The body is medium to thin, the carbonation is very low which leads this being a bit watery. These were good fresh hops, but almost came across as hop tea. This beer has potential, at least.
Stadium Pale Ale;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stadium Brewing Company;Draft. An amber beer with a thin beige head. The aroma has notes of malt, hops, grass, and grapefruit. The flavor is sweet with nots of malt, hops, citrus, and grass, leading to a dry and bitter finish.
Stadium Pale Ale;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stadium Brewing Company;Nose of sweet malt and round pear-like hops.

Stadium Pale Ale;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stadium Brewing Company;Tap at the brewery. Rating #5. This one used all fresh hops. Dark amber/brown pour with an off-white head. Very nice aroma, full of fresh hop goodness. Very nice flavor, resiny, also was just bursting with fresh hop flavor, very smooth and very nice. (1045)

Stadium Pale Ale;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stadium Brewing Company;They should throw these people in jail for making shit beer. My guess is they�re pitching a dry yeast. Flavour is lightly tainted with cidery flavours, there is no body or hop flavour to speak of. Complete shite.
Stadium Pale Ale;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stadium Brewing Company;dark yellow color, mildly hoppy aroma. slight hoppy flavor. After getting the sampler at stadium, this brew was like some of the others: mediocre. IMO, it needs some more hops & malt.
Stadium Chocolate Porter;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Porter;Stadium Brewing Company;On tap @ the brewpub. Dark brown brew with very little head. Not much going on aroma wise - roasted malt and a bit of chocolate. Goes down smooth but is a bit thin with some chocolate flavor.
Stadium Chocolate Porter;Aliso Viejo, California, United States;Porter;Stadium Brewing Company;~4 oz pour as part of a sampler at the brewpub. Pour is hazed black brown with a light tan head. Aroma is roast/char malt along with some pine hops. Under that is a mild sweetness. Taste is the sweetly char roasted malt followed by a minimal amount of the pine hops. The taste had sort of weird sensation of the roast being added as a flavoring after the brewing process, rather than seeming to be part of the beer. Odd statement, I know, but this beer really lacked cohesion. The flavors were all good, just put together in an off way. Palate is medium, clean and crisp finish. Like with the Pale Ale, I think this is headed down the right path.

Abbaye de Malonne Blonde;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;"Commissioned abbey-style beer with creamy, firm, pale yellowish, medium thick head and deep golden blonde, warm colour with nice sparkling, clear but marred by large, filmy protein flakes, which I have rarely encountered in beer but which I find utterly disgusting. Aroma of red apple, peach, grass, candi sugar, lots of coriander, pineapple, orange, brown rhum. Fresh fruit sweetish taste, subtle citrus, rather strong carbo, mellow maltiness in the middle, mild hop bitterness in the finish. In all, the taste is well-balanced, though clich�. I believe this has been replaced by Gribousine Blonde meanwhile so should this not be labelled as ""retired""?"

GAB Stout;Wasosz, Poland;Stout;Browar GAB;Recenzja 27 sierpnia 2011 W zapachu dominuj� nuty czekoladowe oraz kawowe, a w oddali lekko wyczuwalny jest dodatkowo karmel.

GAB Stout;Wasosz, Poland;Stout;Browar GAB;Bottle. A very dark beer, reddish brown, topped by a minimal beige head. Caramel-chocolate aroma with coffee, dried fruits and butterscotch. There�s some roasted bitterness in the flavor, both at first and in the end, else it�s the same butterscotch, chocolate and coffee found in the aroma. It�s medium bodied and quite dry. A decent beer, but too butterscotchy. Misses the style a bit too. 100521

Light roasted aroma of chocolate with roasted notes and notes of butterscotsch. Fruity flavour of chocolate with roasted notes and notes of hops. Light roasted finish.

GAB Stout;Wasosz, Poland;Stout;Browar GAB;"Rated:12.03.2008 Bottle brown, 500 ml, extract of wort 13% Appearance: Pours, deep, brownish red under the light, visually black, all in all very nice body colour, head is initially medium and slowly decraeses to small, frothy in texture (not creamy as in the original stout), head is off-white, cappuccino like in colour, carbonation of body is visually weak and all in all not clearly seen due to its darkness, no head lacing. Aroma:Yeasty, mild, creamy, aromatic hoppy nose on top that makes it different from earthy hoppy accent of Irish stout, deeper in some burned roastiness, cherry fruit, pulm, bock like aroma, not strong. Flavour:Texture is wattery with some roastines, ashy accents and slight bitterness, soltyness, tangy malt, a hint of smoke mixed with light hoppy nose, remanding a foreign stout more than original stout. I can�t agree with a lable message: "" a real Irish Stout"" starting from tha fact that texture is neither dry nor creamy, but simply wattery. Palate:Body is light to medium, texture is wattery mainly, carbonation is gentle on palate, finis feel is flat, a bit dull, not that fresh."
GAB Stout;Wasosz, Poland;Stout;Browar GAB;Near black colored with red hints. Sweet and roasted, even some berries and caramel in aroma, not the best stout aroma here. Medium bodied, watery palate. Flavor is also roasted but still boring with sweetness and slight caramel.
GAB Stout;Wasosz, Poland;Stout;Browar GAB;"Bottle. A rather dull interpretation of some other Polish ""stouts"". Medium-brown, small or no head. Aroma of butterscotch, like a dunkel. Taste...weak.

Faint citrus, juicy tangerine, perhaps a little peach. Somewhat floral...again subtle. A little watery for the style but it is kind of nice to not have something that is terribly sticky and syrupy. Quite drinkable, although the 13% is sneaky. Not a favorite but interesting.

Saimaan Luomuolut III;Mikkeli, Finland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saimaa Brewing Company (MBH Breweries Oy);"2005 bottle from Juha, labeled Saimaa Luomuolut II, as other have noted. Deep copper body, with a chill haze. White head has to be coaxed from the bottle while swirling the glass. White and bubbly, fully diminishing. Smells grassy, earthy, almost like artificial turf; plasticy, you might say, but in a good way, somehow. Little bit of honey in there too. Flavor starts out with lots of honey and hops flavor. Bitterness is high relative to the other Finnish pilseners I�ve had. Approaching Bohemian Pils-like levels. Grassy and minty, it provides good bitterness and flavor. Fniishes with honey and hints of cream. Very good malt extraction. A touch of wateriness to the medium body, with low carbonation."

Crabby Larrys Raspberry Wheat;Chalfont, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Crabby Larrys Brewpub;Not a very good stab at a fruity wheat beer, gold color, decent white head with good lacing, but that�s where the good qualities end, the bartender simply poured some raspberry syrup or extract into the glass & taped the regular German wheat beer, it gave the beer a decent raspberry flavor but nothing I would be writing home about, it also gave the beer a huge raspberry presence in the nose which was alright but too much, it overpowered the beer, not very well done

Endurance Pale Ale (Tom Crean's Ale);Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Overall this is not a bad pale ale. Nice aroma and appearance.

Endurance Pale Ale (Tom Crean's Ale);Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"A slightly cloudy blonde color. Very small amount of head with a little cask-fizz. The scent is a combo of fruits and hops, with a mild malt backing. Nice. There is a very sweet malt flavor here. The hops are an accent only. And though I am usually a bit put-off by the malts, this one is very appealing and pleasant. There is a fizzy, slightly bouncy feeling on the tongue. It stays very much alive on the palate. It is much heavier than I expected, and tastes darker than it looks. I could easily drink a couple of these in a row; very appealing and drinkable"

Cerveza Zaragozana;Zaragoza, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;La Zaragozana;I guess this beer has been revived. Bottle from Seiyu the Japanese Walmart for about 240 yen. 5% Served in a footed pilsner glass. It poors a clear gold with a foamy white head. The aroma starts off incredibly skunky then mellows into a sugary corn aroma. Light bodied with an ok mouthfeel. The taste is kind of bitter, grassy with a small hit of sugary sweetness.

Paulaner Hefeweissbier Alkoholfrei;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Low Alcohol - Wheat;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Aroma is just like regular paulaner, just weaker. Flavour is wheaty, watery, some cloves and bread. Yes, feels like paulaner, just with a weaker taste and watery. One of the best N/A beers to drink.
Paulaner Hefeweissbier Alkoholfrei;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Low Alcohol - Wheat;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Amber hazy with a frothy head. Strong smell of wheat. Taste sweet and wheaty with some bitterness and acidity. Lemon note. Low carbonation. This is a nice low alcohol Wei�bier.
Paulaner Hefeweissbier Alkoholfrei;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Low Alcohol - Wheat;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bottle from Waitrose. Poured properly into a correct wheatbeer glass, it behaved exactly like a �real� wheatbeer, revealing a hazy orange gold colour with a foaming white head. Aroma is fruit bread, and the taste is brown bread, caramel, brewer�s mash. Quite fruity with notes of lemon and banana. This gives a lift - it would be very sweet and boring otherwise. Carbonation is good, but the mouthfeel is watery - hardly surprising, given the 0.3% ABV. Some cloves and coriander in the aftertaste. Not bad for a N/A beer.

Ringneck Nitro Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;Draft at The Brew Kettle. Very small tan head and fine-small sized bubbles. Uncarbonated, opaque and black hue. Malt, chocolate and very light coffee notes. Malt and light coffee flavor. Hence, a very flat flavor. Smooth and watery-thin mouthfeel. Excellent lacing.
Ringneck Nitro Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;This draft brew poured a small brown colored head of fine to medium sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a most excellent lacing. The body was a nearly opaque dark ruby red brown color with no visible carbonation. The aroma was medium strength with with a few malty notes and no other. The mouth feel was smooth and nearly flat with no tingle and only a mild malt bite in the finish. As it warmed up, a lingering molasses note could be sensed. The flavor was flat for a porter with no other notable qualities which leads to its low rating.
Frog Island Summer Brew;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Frog Island Brewing;Draft at MBG Festival. Hazy dark amber with small white head that diminshed slowly. Moderate sweet spicy aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Full complex wheat flavor with moderate finish. Very refreshing summer brew.

Frog Island Summer Brew;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Frog Island Brewing;Draft at the Sidetrack Bar and Grill in Ypsilanti, Michigan before making my way to the 2004 MBG Summer Festival. Small white head and fine sized bubbles that fully dissipated. Uncarbonated, somewhat hazy and a dark yellow, butterscotch hue. Malty, sweet, banana, spicy and clove aroma. The flavor was sweet, slightly sour, and some hops. The mouthfeel was smooth. This was a medium bodied beer with fair lacing.
Frog Island Summer Brew;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Frog Island Brewing;At a bar before the Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Festival 2004. This draft brew poured a small head of finely sized white colored fully diminished bubbles that left a good lacing. The body was uncarbonated hazy and orange in color. It had a malt wheat aroma. The mouth feel was initially tingly and bubbly with an initial rush of wheat flavor and a tingly lingering wheat malt bite. It was a good example of the style with malt hops and wheat flavors in medium strength with a very good overall balance.
Mac's Hop Harvest;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pale gold brew, coarsely carbonated with a tight white head. Sweet malty aroma, with a dry, grassy hop in the background. Nice full body with a pleasent malt/hop balance. I tried one of these around amonth ago, and found it to be very dry and grassy, so maybe those few weeks in the fridge have mellowed it a bit.
Mac's Hop Harvest;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Yes! I thought this was a decent pils also. Lovely hop aroma, good white head and lacing, great taste of hops without being too much of it. Great body, balance and finish although I am still impressed by Emerson�s Pils.
Mac's Hop Harvest;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Beautiful looking beer - clear gold with a fluffy white head and a lovely trail of bubbles in my PU glass. Aroma didn�t really jump out and grab me as much as the other raters made me believe, but it certainly smells hoppy. The aroma really changed and developed (generally for the better) over the course of the glass. Initially it was very rough and grassy and woody, then came a more refined woody, raw hop aroma with a hint of raw broccoli. Initial flavour is grassy hop, then a nice tight maltiness comes through before a big, rough bitterness hits you. The only pils I�ve had which was more bitter was Jever. The malt does its job perfectly, just getting in there and out of the way quickly. There is a tiny bit of paw paw funkiness which I have found in a few NZ beers (I think it�s from the hops) but otherwise it�s bloody good. A lovely dry and kinda savoury finish which makes you want more immediately. I don�t think I�ve drunk any beer as quick as I did this one. Thanks beer_ledgend!!
Mac's Hop Harvest;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);(28 Aug 04) As the others have said before me, this beer hits you with a massive hop aroma as soon as you lift the cap. The most distinctive notes are citrus and pine. It is a lot more aromatic than any other Pilsner I have sampled. It is a clear and sparkling yellow with a diminishing creamy and rocky white head but no lacing. The body is light with a good bead, and is moderately bitter. It tastes slightly soapy but good nonetheless.
Mac's Hop Harvest;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Beer_Ledgend told me this one was a beauty. He said that the aroma of hop hit you got straight away after ripping off the cap (gotta love those retro rip tops) was a beauty. I agree totally. Then it pours like a good pils should, golden colour and clean fluffy head. The air is really redolent of this Pacific Jade which must be a clone of the noble Saaz. The nose is citrus with a resinous pine undertone, a common character of the Kiwi hops it seems. The mouthfeel has that distinctive character of a good pilsener as well, floral in character with the clean bitterness of the hop in concert with malt. In Australia Cascade have done a First Harvest Ale, but this attempt by the Kiwis is a corker. Odder still given that Macs to me was getting a bit tired as a mini brewer. They have pulled this one out of the box that�s for sure.
Mac's Hop Harvest;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Excellent golden colour with big white fluffy head. Big hoppy aroma, like all good pilsners should be. An even bigger hoppy tatste using a new hop variety (Pacific Jade). Would certainly be right up there with the best. Maybe even better than Emersons Pilsner.
Mac's Hop Harvest;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"My flatmate Clare and I rented ""Shade"" (a poker film) and sampled this as we watched. Pours a deep & clear golden hue with medium/big bubbles and dense foamy head. Lacing hung around too (though I don�t know much about this). The hoppy aroma was really inviting with a touch of yeast. I also detected a distant chemical hint. Rolls around nicely on the tongue - fresh and clean - it kinda zings across the palate emptying out a bit quick to leave a mild bitterness but with a lingering tingly after-feel(!) This is easy refreshing session drinking which I�m keen to sample again - and with food - it ain�t a royal flush but it�s still worth holding onto yer cards..."
Big Buck Lambic with Raspberry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Big Buck Brewery;by far the superior flavor of lambic. the sweetness to tartness ratio is just perfect when it comes to this raspberry lambic. You can taste a little alcohol, but for the most part, you are enjoying a refreshing raspberry flavor.
Big Buck Lambic with Raspberry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Big Buck Brewery;draft at MSBF 2004. hazy deep red color, no carbonation. alcohol and esters in the aroma and body, very one-dimensional. not a great beer, and i probably wouldn�t drink it again. worth a try though.
Big Buck Lambic with Raspberry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Big Buck Brewery;Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival Saturday July 24, 2004. This draft brew poured a small head of finely sized white colored mostly diminishing bubbles. The lacing was poor due in part to the glassware. It had a hazy purple hue to the uncarbonated body. The aroma was chocolaty and fruity. The mouth feel was smooth with a mild lambic bite that followed from its raspberry fruity lambic style flavoring.
Black Forest Brau Keller Honey Bee Wheat;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Black Forest Brau Keller;Oh good grief, I�m sorry for not getting this here sooner as the last review wasn�t since 2007. Uh...I had this in 2008, God, I hope it didn�t change or uh...er...well...here goes. The appearance was a decent cloudy yellow to orange color with a good two and a half finger white foamy head that mushroom capped and fell at a nice pace. There was some really nice looking strong lacing. The smell had some light banana esters with a fairly nice clove-like spice and even a tad of coriander trying to come through. The taste followed the nose. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with a pretty good sessionability about it. Overall, this was a pretty good hefeweizen, and as far as I know true to style, I�d have it again.
Black Forest Brau Keller Honey Bee Wheat;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Black Forest Brau Keller;On tap: Aroma is mostly banana with a touch of citrus. Cloudy pale yellow with a small white head. Lots of sweet banana in the flavor. Citrus is more in the background. Spice in the finish comes across a little light because of such a strong banana presence. Banana lingers a little in the aftertaste.
Black Forest Brau Keller Honey Bee Wheat;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Black Forest Brau Keller;Cloudy yellow pour with a thin white head.

Black Forest Brau Keller Honey Bee Wheat;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Black Forest Brau Keller;"Tap: world beer expo/Frankenmuth. Slightly hazy, dark yellow. Lots of banana and clove in aroma and flavor. Nice balance for a hefe, just the right amount of spice. Could be a little more ""chewy"" is the only drawback."
Black Forest Brau Keller Honey Bee Wheat;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Black Forest Brau Keller;Festival tap:Estery nose is strong, but nothing can hide the huge honey aroma lurking beneath. Deep yellow, unfiltered . Thick and full of the banana bread flavors I expected but followed by an huge sweet honey take-over. Finishes with honey, aftertaste of honey, etc...

Bos Grand Cru;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Tasted blind. 12oz unlabeled bottle (probably an 06 or 05 bottle). Surprising herbal nose. Smells like incense, sandalwood and wild wax. Indescribable. Impressive and complex. Light fruits. Pours a peachy blonde with a rim of white. Flavor is ridiculous. Tastes like Christmas. Full of orange and sage. Incense, perfume, Mexican candy, and waxy cactus flavor. Crazy pumpkin spice, Thanksgiving fruit. Apparently 14%, but tastes more like 4%. Complex savory character. Intensely flavored. Fuck, this is delicious. Amazing spice character, like I�ve never seen before. Fantastic spicing. Dry. Great amazing blend of spice and citrus on a mild malt character.Wow. This is amazing. Gingerbread and deliciousness. Complex, mature, well-aged. Thanks Sean!

Bos Grand Cru;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Draught sample at MBG 2006 Summer Festival. Reddish-amber with a faint haze. Aroma is quite boozy, with lots of caramel malt and some dark fruit and wood - I didn�t care for it right away, with it grew on me as I finished the sample. Flavour is quite sweet and hot, with some caramel and bourbon notes. Pretty well balanced for 14%, but still a bit too hot.
Bos Grand Cru;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Draught. At 2006 Michigan Brewers� Guild Festival. Clear orange with a small white head. Slightly woody, nutty sweet caramel malt aroma, juicy and spicy, there�s oak and alcohol in there too. Tastes just like it smells, plenty of citrus, wood character, spicy yeast and very strong in alcohol, very ear-warming. Thick body, syrupy and boozy, there�s plenty going on here - more like a fruity-sweet barleywine, no harshness at all, I liked it a lot.
Bos Grand Cru;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Michigan Brewers Festival 2006. Another purported alcohol monster from Bo�s, this one a bit less sleek than the stout. Copper amber body is essentially headless after it fades. Lightly herbal, sugar, boozey aroma with an ephemeral glimpse of something like candy cane. Flavour is pretty rough, sweet sugary caramel malt. Very nice at times but fairly discordant and abrasive as well. Medium palate (3+). 6-7/3/6-7/3+/13-14
Bos Grand Cru;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bos Brewery and Bistro;2001 bottle shared by the brewmaster at the brewpub on 4/27/06: Still viscous golden bronze pour has a thin ring of bubble atop. Sweet candy floral honey, lightly spiced, complex, rich malty aroma. Starts with a sweet floral candy-like honey flavor with saffron spice and well-dissolved carbonation that gives more body. A very unique brew that�s like drinking molten honey complexity.
Bos Grand Cru;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bos Brewery and Bistro;2001 Vintage: The brewer pulled this bottle out of his secret stash for us during our stop. Clear gold with nice legs. Very nice aroma. Sweet with candy, clove and other spices. Big honey nose as well. The flavor was sweet with honey and malt. The finish was spiced. After the malt stops the honey keeps going. It isn�t over powering though which to me makes it good since I am not a huge honey fan. Yet this was great. The mouthfeel was still lively with a medium to full body. Nicely warming with hints of alcohol pepper at the end. The brewer, Mr. Burns, said he uses honey, cardamom and saffron. Anyway I loved it. It aged great.
Bos Grand Cru;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bos Brewery and Bistro;(2003 Vintage) Floral, honey and alcohol aromas meld well in the nose. Opaque tan body with low, cream coloured head that recedes to leave a thick ring around the sides of the glass. Floral, doughy honey flavour with a moderate bitterness that keeps it from becoming cloying. Mustiness lingers on the tongue. Alcohol is very apparent but not unpleasant. Very hot but it seems to work well. Medium-full body and creamy texture with low carbonation. Complex and interesting without being over the top. Sampled at the Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival 2005.

Deep reddish amber/black colour, mediumsized white head. Aroma is very surprising for a dunkel, quite strong roasted malts with dark dry fruit and coffee. Flavour is is wood, roasted malts and quite strong biitterness. Really filling palate, and overall a nice thing. My dad said the bartenders had said ""It�s of the same style as Guinness, but much better"". Still not very stouty to me... but a really welldone dunkel, and yes, it beats Guinness."
Golfbrau Dunkel;Port el Kantaoui, Tunisia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Golfbr�u;0,3 l from keg. A nice dry bitter taste. I had it on our vacation in the Golf Brau Bar in Port el Kantaoui in Tunisia.
Golfbrau Dunkel;Port el Kantaoui, Tunisia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Golfbr�u;Superb deep red/black brew with a coffee aroma. Dryish flavour, full coffee and malt tastes, some sweet chocolate but all in balance. The finish turns more chocolatey with more coffee and a bitterness too.

Big Buck Barleywine;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Buck Brewery;Brandywine Barleywine. Nice aroma and color. You taste the alcohol immediately, but mouthfeel was very thin with little malt character. Sufficient hop bitterness for American style however no hop aroma or flavor. A very unimpressive barleywine.

The Brew Kettle Dunkel Bock;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;The Brew Kettle;22 oz. bottle - pours a deep mahogany with a light tan head that disapates quickly. malty bock flavor with a clean crisp flavor, not much to it. gets better as it warms. good mouthfeel and nice aftertaste. good beer, nothing special.
The Brew Kettle Dunkel Bock;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;The Brew Kettle;"Bottle: Deep amber w/ a lasting beige head. Plain malt aroma, very non distinct, no munich malt as I�d expected or hoped. Clean, but pretty much void of any real malt aroma. Although, as it warms it does show signs of life with hints of Munich malt, alcohol, and a light plum fruitiness that gets much heavier as it warms. Also hint of sanitizer in this beer. Lighly malty flavor, but more well balanced than it should be IMHO. Light toasted malt flavor along with a little hop in the aftertaste. Clean of most fruitiness but plum creeps in w/ a light bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is warming; lightly dry but not astringent m/f, higher carbonation w/ a medium body. Not a bad beer, but not a bock in my estimation. Somewhere between a bock and a plain old dunkel. Lacks any strong malty character in flavor or aroma for this type of beer."
The Brew Kettle Dunkel Bock;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;The Brew Kettle;Bottle. Poured a medium sized frothy ivory head. Carbonated, transparent and a reddish brown hue.

Groggs Porter;Helper, Utah, United States;Porter;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);"On tap at Groggs brewpub in Helper, Utah. My 600th rating, and why not choose a rare and local Utah beer. Pours a dark brown body with a nice thick beige head. The aroma was full of roasted chocolate and some coffee. The taste was quite nice; a good chocolate presence, some coffee, a bit of dark fruits, and a light malt that was too sweet for this beer. But overall, I enjoyed this one. They must have changed the brew significantly."
Groggs Porter;Helper, Utah, United States;Porter;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);[Colorado Road Trip � 2006] Dark in Color with a light porter aroma this had a nice flavor but was missing that umph that would make it a good porter almost felt like it was watered down. Needs ore grains and better storage.
Groggs Porter;Helper, Utah, United States;Porter;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);More milky and putrid maple/licorice aroma... really bad stuff here. Difficult to drink... how can they brew it this bad? No flavors whatsoever resembling a porter, buttery maple and astringent licrorice... ugh. Nose of sweaty boot.
Groggs Raspberry Wheat;Helper, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);This beer has a nice aroma, full lively CO2 head and pink appearance, and a sweet attack. The body is a bit weaker, and leaves me wanting some more wheat characters and malt to balance the initial sweetness. Nice mouthfeel, with a bit of a sticky finish, again something I think that would be improved by a bigger body. A good first-beer choice in the area.
Groggs Raspberry Wheat;Helper, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a hazy orange with a thick white head. The aroma is mostly sweet sugars and wheat. The taste was quite surprising; tons of very sweet raspberry, and I mean very sweet. Some wheat and malt too, but man this was full of berry sweetness, kinda artificial, but not too bad either, Drinkable."
Groggs Raspberry Wheat;Helper, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);[Colorado Road Trip � 2006] A hazy deep amber colored brew. This was a unfiltered Wheat beer with a tad of raspberry flavoring added. The fruit flavor was so subtle that it was hard to get on the flavor scale. This was a poor attempt at making a good fruit beer. Needs more fruit and the wheat profile was off by a mile.
Groggs Raspberry Wheat;Helper, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);Orange, typical nose of sweet raspberry syrup, candy-like. Thin, watery, light semi-sweet fruit flavors... some honey even. It�s bad when the raspberry wheat is one of the better offerings.
Groggs Apricot Wheat;Helper, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);A good follow-up for Pinnacle�s Raspberry Wheat. This one is more balanced, less sweet with the same sort of thin wheat body. But with less initial sweetness, there was a less sticky finish. Good beer for fans of wheatbeers.

Accepted, a bit thin on the swallow, though (London, 01.08.2011).
North Yorkshire Best Bitter;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Bottle. Cloudy golden beer with a very light head. The aroma is sour, and the flavour is yeasty, sour and dry. Overall a disappointing beer.

Good earthy malt, light citric hoppage, some caramel and the hops give a nice bitter dry finish. Certainly not what I would call a best bitter but a nice drop all the same.

McKenzie Brandywine Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;McKenzie Brew House;Grainy, doughy, floral and minty aroma.

Sampled at the Kennet Square Brewfest 2005.
McKenzie Brandywine Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;McKenzie Brew House;Pours a hazy light golden color body with a small white head. Very faint hop nose. Pretty weak and boring in the flavor dept. Some mild grassy and citrus hops. One of the least exciting beers I�ve had in a while. Not undrinkable, just boring.
McKenzie Brandywine Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;McKenzie Brew House;A sweet, honey-molasses accented lager, thickish mouthfeel. Could use more crispness and less grassiness. Hops are off.
McKenzie Brandywine Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;McKenzie Brew House;White head quickly begs for departure. The body looks light gold, hazy and flat. Dulled out floral, leafy, minty and lemony hops offer more nuances than most, but all in an undefined manner, lost in an overdone candyish malt profile that is not the cleanest. Offers interesting bready undertones, but quickly develops lemon juicy nuances that lead into citric and grainy territory. Light-medium body, thin yet oily texture, rather flattish.
McKenzie Brandywine Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;McKenzie Brew House;Pours a clear straw color with a medium white head. The aroma is sweet and malty. Ordinary and bland flavor of malt with lingering sweetness. The body is light and the carbonation is medium. A forgettable experience from a brewery that ususally provides goosebumps.
McKenzie Brandywine Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;McKenzie Brew House;The Lure: Faint citrusy and spicy hops under a sweet malt base. I thought I was going to get a crafty and crisp lager, but this appears to be their house blond bore. The Festivities: Sweet malts recall plantanes and pears, as pleasant carbonation offer easy quaffing. Too sweet and not hoppy enough for what I like in the style, the clean finish leaving nothing to hang on to. Well-brewed yes, but horribly boring. Transcendence: There is no purpose in smelling and tasting your slice of white bread.
McKenzie Brandywine Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;McKenzie Brew House;Yay, a super-boring lager. Maybe I�m an idiot, but I can�t tell much of a difference between a Helles or Kolsch compared to a light lager at most brewpubs. Faint aroma and flavor, watery body.

Brandywine Blue Rocks Lager;Greenville, Delaware, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brandywine Brewing Company;On tap at Blue Rocks game.

Kuhnhenn Doppel Bock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"2004 draught. Glad to see walleye added this one, as I couldnt remember the commercial description or the alcohol percent. I was pretty excited about this one; I generally enjoy most of their lagers here, and adding the extra gravity and alcohol tends to be a strong point of theirs. Pours a light chestnut brown with some dark yellow tinges, lightly hazed and transluscent. Small off-white head. Aroma has sharp hops, grainy and bitter, with hints of alcohol, dry nutty notes and a good even caramel smell as well. Flavor is surprisingly bitter and well-hopped at the beginning but then grows sweeter with a lightly dry caramelly/toffeeish malt. Medium-full body, a bit loose towards the end, but very smooth. This isn�t your classic German heavily malted, richly sweet doppel, but it�s a good americanized hoppier take."

Cosaco Negra;Mineral del Chico, Mexico;Porter;Cerveza Cosaco;Draft. Dark brown. Smells like it�s going to be sweet, but it�s more of a balanced chocolatey character. A bit watery in the finish....too macrobrewed for my tastes, restrained flavours.
Cosaco Negra;Mineral del Chico, Mexico;Porter;Cerveza Cosaco;"My Bottom Line: Tobacco and light roast meet caramel candy as earthen bitterness spoils part of the finish.

It has the right amount of balance between the smoke and rest of the components. Good stuff.
Flat Branch Steam Style Lager;Columbia, Missouri, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;My favorite beer from Flat Branch. Nice citrus flavor with a lot of hoppiness. Nice amber color. Compares favorably in my opinion to Anchor Steam.
Flat Branch Steam Style Lager;Columbia, Missouri, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Fruity, hoppy and malty aroma, some apple skin and faint apricot with sweet, grainy notes in the background. Lightly hazy orange-amber color with a lasting, creamy ivory head and plentiful lacing. Fruity, moderately bitter and refreshing flavor profile, the pleasantly toasty, swet malt flavors balanced nicely by the leafy, lightly herbal hops. Finishes with a burst of juicy hop flavors. Hints of citrus here and there. Medium bodied, exceedingly smooth palate. Flat Branch certainly seems to have nailed this style!

Crannog Pooka Cherry Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Crannog Ales;GCBF sample. Maybe I just like cherries but I like this beer, apparently more than others do. Pinky orange. Cloudy. No head. Light refreshing beer with a strong cherry finish. Lasting sourness which is another characteristic that I like.

Crannog Pooka Cherry Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Crannog Ales;Cloudy ruby, pink head. Lightly astringent fruit nose.Rather flat,sweet light cherry taste. Much sweeter than it should be
Crannog Pooka Cherry Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Crannog Ales;Draught, Railway ClubSlightly hazy light burgundy colour. The aroma is light, showing a contrast between cherry and diacetyl. Flavourwise, its like a LifeSaver - candyish fruits - with a harsh alcohol background.
Crannog Pooka Cherry Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Crannog Ales;RERATE: 2nd annual Vancouver Caskival. Not nearly as good as the first batch. Bright red beer, thin pink head. Light spicy aroma with a touch of yeast. Also a very distracting chemical and plastic aroma over a sweet cherry juice. Flavour is very artificial and chemical tasting. Very sweet cherry aroma. Sampled at the brewery in Sorrento, BC. A very pale pink colour with a thin pink head. Very delicate cherry fruit and floral aroma with a hint of sweetness. Very light body, but incredibly quaffable. Flavour is also quite subtle, shows light cherry, a nice acidic bite and a clean crisp finish. Very tasty. 6/4/7/2/13
Hoppers Mango Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;(Brooker Creek) Densely opaqu caramel body with off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, alcohol, mango, some astringrency. Taste is sweet, alcohol, mango, some caramel. Full body, alcohol evident. Too much alcohol presence for me to enjoy.
Hoppers Mango Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Had this on tap at the East Lake, FL (Tampa area) Hoppers. Boy, take a swig of this stuff----it WILL get your attention. No head to speak of on the pour. The look of reminds me of the sugary syrup that�s in a can of peaches, kinda hazy golden. It�s defnitely syrupy in the mouth with a medicinal edge. The effect is very similar to their other lambics like the berry flavor. It�s ok, but I can�t see drinking more than one glass.
Himmelberger Whitewater Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Wheat Ale;Himmelberger Brewing Company;Flat and slightly sweet with honey. The extremely low carb is hard to overcome for me. Body is decent and slightly bitter hop finish, but overall missing something.
Himmelberger Whitewater Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Wheat Ale;Himmelberger Brewing Company;On tap. Golden pour with a nice white head. Scent is wheat and some floral elements. Taste is wheat, some grass and fruit. Very nice

Himmelberger Whitewater Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Wheat Ale;Himmelberger Brewing Company;Draft at Brunos in Billings. Pours orangish with a thin white head. Aroma is fairly thin. Wheat beer with orange flavor. Smooth and drinkable. Not anything special.
Himmelberger Whitewater Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Wheat Ale;Himmelberger Brewing Company;My local favorite by far. Nothing i�ve had in billings comes close. It smells and tastes of fresh grapefruits, lemons, and sweet wheatfields, the palate is very agreable if you tap a fresh keg watch out the first few pours will be unvelievably thick with a cloudy suspension of wheat. I just wish more bars intown offered it.
Himmelberger Whitewater Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Wheat Ale;Himmelberger Brewing Company;Sampled on draught at the Rex in downtown Billings Montana. Pours a cloudy aged banana yellow brew with a thick and slow dissolving white head that leaves behind a good lacing. Aroma of light wheat bread, some citrus and flowery hops with a touch of corlander. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with flavors of sweet multi-grain, citrus peel with a touch of orange and lime flavors. Finish is slightly chalky with a thick wheat and flowery hop aftertaste. No need to add any lemon wedge to the glass. This beer has plenty of flavor to go around.
Himmelberger Whitewater Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Wheat Ale;Himmelberger Brewing Company;On draught at Jake�s Stakehouse in Billings. Pours a dense dark gold with a lasting light white lace. Light-bodied, with a soft mouthfeel and wheaty flavor. Slightly fruity notes with slight lemon-grass character.

Light sweet flavor with a light sweet short finish. Drinkable and solid for style.
Himmelberger Whitewater Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Wheat Ale;Himmelberger Brewing Company;Draught. Many times. Light golden�straw colored with a massive head of extremely fine bubbles that lasts for maybe five minutes or more before subsiding to a foamy layer around the edge of the glass. Sheets of Brussels lace along the glass each time I take a swallow. The nose is comlex for an American wheat because Himmelberger brews it more like a Belgian blonde in many respects. Nose is very malty/yeasty with a definite citrus nose and some spice (coriander). The mouthfeel is dense and solid for such a light beer. The flavor is crisp and sharp with good bittering and a malty smoothness. The lemon or lemongrass comes through clearly in the taste, as does some complexity to the yeast strain--maybe some banana and or clove character. The finish is balanced and clean. I�ve had this beer many times. Dennis Himmelberger is a friend, but don�t think that I�d jack up his ratings even so(he wouldn�t appreciate it). He brews with honor and fierce commitment to his craft--sometimes chewing out bar managers for serving this beer with a lemon slice (like it need that!). A great beer, but only available in Billings and surrounding areas because he doesn�t bottle.
McMenamins Starry Night Cream Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Cream Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On Nitro. Pours amber with a silky smooth white head that leaves some nice lacing. Aroma was slightly fruity, wheaty, and a faint hop backing with a floral hop aroma. Taste was very smooth with a sweet start that almost immediatly faded to a wheaty and bitter end. Very dry tasting with a slight fruitiness in the malt.
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;Bittersweet porter with typical coffee and chocolate malts. Ends a bit on the bitter side, but starts sweet. Not bad, but nothing to shout about.

Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;On draught at the brewery taproom in Lake Mills, Wisconsin. Pours an opaque dark brown with a thick and creamy light tan head that disipates quickly to a fine film and ring. Aroma is complex with scents of dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon whiskey, slight coconut, and a touch of flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, smooth, creamy, with flavors of dark roasted malt, oaked bourbon, a touch of vanilla and chocolate. Finish is smooth, semi-sweet with a distinct bourbon flavor that more present than the dark malt. Definitely a decent sipping brew.
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;On Tap at brewery. Thanks LTJudge and Brewblackhole for telling me about this one. Pours dark with a decent tan head. Aroma is of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, and malts and hops. The first sip is the aroma with a smooth attitude, and coffee flavors as a finishing touch. The finish is of coffee, hops and bourbon and smooth. The bourbon is evident throughout, kicking in at the end. The feel on the mouth is a bit on the light side for a porter. Overall this is an excellent brew. One that I will be getting more of.
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Pours a nice dark color with a nice tan head. Wonderful aromas of burbon,chocolate,and vanilla. Great flavor of coffee with a nice and somewhat light bourbon overtone that transcendes into a vanilla tinged bitter ending. This is one of my favorite porters!
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;Near black with a moderate head of tight taupe bubbles. Thin vale of lace descends to the end of the pour. Mild pale malt quickly swept away with peat, light bourbon, chocolate, graham crackers and oak. The age really seems to have smoothed this one out. This has some true porter qualities with the pale malt and graham crackers and then followed by a black malt finish. The bourbon works its way in throughout the quaff. Hints of oak, vanilla, and peated barley. A very nice sit and relax type brew.
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;On tap on 11/11/07. Dark color. Smell of bourbon, vanilla, oak, coffee, malt, hops and some minor coco. Taste of the same. Very smooth and mellow. Nice balance between the bourbon and coffee. Its a great porter.
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;Aroma is the highlight here. Rich oaked bourbon, the ever present hints of vanilla ,choclate cake batter, and touches of coffee,almost deserves a ten. Taste is much thinner then you would expect,given that rich aroma, Subtle coffee and bourbon dominate the taste,a slight bitter fade nice enough. I suppose you have to remember this is a simple porter ,not an Imperial,but that rich aroma was such a tease. Time for Rob to stop avoiding the stouts,get down into the lab and come up with a Russian monster
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;"On tap at brewery. I�m told this isn�t the ""who�s your daddy imperial porter"" because the beer isn�t an imperial porter base. The beer pours to a transluscent dark brown body that can easily be seen through even in low light. No head whatsoever. The flavor has noticeable wood barrel qualities. Almost a ""tart"" barrel aging. Knob creek bourbon? Not as rich as ""who�s your daddy"". Mosly barrel and whiskey covered dark chocolatey malt (although not overpowering). The aroma is light. Dark semi-sweet chocolate, light cheese cakey brownie. Medium body that�s inviting, slightly alcoholic, good and lingering feel. A good beer but not as good as the imperial BA porter."
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Chief BlackHawk Porter;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Tyranena Brewing;"Sample tap @ brewery. Almost-opaque brown body under a thin light tan but ""lacy"" head. Strong woody-whisky aroma. There might be some coffee beans but it�s and anything else is kept down by the barrel notes. Dark chocoalte and cream in teh falvor which is quickly enveloped by woody bourbon and black batent. Medium mouthfeel. Small alcohol hit in the finish. For all its barrel-forwardness this beer is still really tasty. There�s just enough porter roast to keep it honest!"
Alchemist Blackout;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;The Alchemist;A deep dark stout with a thick receeding lacing dark brown head. Intense aroma of coffee grinds, earthy, chocolate, quite well perceived. In mouth, an intense yet pleasant bitter chocolate with light coffee grounds, well balanced and quaffable. On tap at brewpub, Jan. 11 2009.
Alchemist Blackout;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;The Alchemist;On tap at the Alchemist 02.05.10 Black in color with a light brown head. Strong aroma of coffee with roast, some caramel. Taste is nice and roasty, with alot of coffee...the coffee dries it out, but it does have enough body to back it up. Coffee bitterness and flavor lingers nicely in the finish. Very nice.

Alchemist Blackout;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;The Alchemist;In short: A tasty, very roasted, dry and bitter coffee stout. Very nice session beer. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Black body with a small tan head In long: I think the nose might have been medium roasted with medium coffee. It�s not totally impossible that the beer has a taste of very roasted coffee beans and light chocolate notes. There was probably not fruity flavours. I have been told there the beer is very very roasted and very dry. Possibly a strong bitterness in the finish. If all that is true than this beer is both very tasty and very sessionnable. But I�m not sure about all that really, I had a Blackout.
Alchemist Blackout;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;The Alchemist;Had this beer as part of Beer Quest 2010 with the guys. This was beer number 30. Great stout. Pours dark with lasting head. Aroma is roasted chocolate malts. Black as night. Great flavor which is very roasty.

Alchemist Blackout;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;The Alchemist;Tap at Blind Tiger. Best beer of the Vermont beer event. Strong bitter coffee aroma, lightly veregtal, cheese. Palate is a bit thin, tastes more like stale coffee and a bit of spoiled veggies. Still, while cold, this is a tasty and quenching beer. Just don�t let it get warm.
Alchemist Blackout;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;The Alchemist;Draft at the blind tiger. Black, tan head with nice lacing. Nose is toffee & coffee, roasty cocoa, light burnt malt. Flavor is bitter (but not quite burnt) coffee, roasted & burnt malts, tingly hops. Long bitter finish.

Alchemist Blackout;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;The Alchemist;Draft at the Blind Tiger. Black pour with a light brown ring of head. Aroma is roasted malt, slightly sweet black licorice. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and soft. The flavor has a nice balance of sweet chocolate and fruit and the bitter dryness of coffee / roasted malt. This stout was still good when I found the bottom of the glass.

Seidr O Sir Cider - Medium (Draught);Llandrindod Wells, Wales;Apple Cider;Seidr O Sir;Cask @ Piglet BF, listed as Barker�s Seidr O Sir 6.8%? Hazy gold with no head. Apple, pear and a bit of hay in the nose, slightly medicinal. Sweet, juicy and tart at first, like biting into an apple but ultimately quite dry. You can certainly tell there�s a few varieties of apple in there, some cinnamon hints also. Warms your belly like wine. Good stuff.
Seidr O Sir Cider - Medium (Draught);Llandrindod Wells, Wales;Apple Cider;Seidr O Sir;A Mes rate: Boxed stillage @ Planet Thanet. Very similar to the dry with just a little extra sweetness. Expect vintage barnyard character and puckery sourness. Excellent stuff.
Seidr O Sir Cider - Medium (Draught);Llandrindod Wells, Wales;Apple Cider;Seidr O Sir;Aroma is sweetish apples, with soem sourness. Taste doesnt have to much appkle character, not very dry either, seems to have some apple skin going on.
Seidr O Sir Cider - Medium (Draught);Llandrindod Wells, Wales;Apple Cider;Seidr O Sir;This was badged as Seidr O Sir Medium Cider, but it is not clear whether the producer makes any other version. Also at 7.7%, although the website says 8%. Hazy yellow colour. Medicinal, slightly phenolic aroma, to go with the usual farmyardy manure notes typical of an authentic farmhouse cider. The flavour is surprisingly fruity, but also has a good tart tannic grip. Certainly on the dry side of medium. From the barrel at GBBF 2004.
The Brew Kettle Short Phil's Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Cream Ale;The Brew Kettle;Mild grainy aroma, pours a slightly hazy amber with a thin white head.

Not a lot going on here, but nothing out of line either.
The Brew Kettle Short Phil's Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Cream Ale;The Brew Kettle;"A little thin-looking for a cream ale and doesn�t have the aroma either. This mostly tastes like a pale ale; way too hoppy for a cream ale. All that aside, still a fairly tasty beer."

Light biscuit like grain aroma, fairly crisp. Light crisp grain, very light dry earthy hops, but malty overall. Some off flavors in the finish. Simple. Fairly light, semi-dry body. Nothing exciting.
The Brew Kettle Short Phil's Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Cream Ale;The Brew Kettle;Short Phil apparently sells this for 25 cents at his cream ale stand (funny label). Medium gold body with a thick fluffy head. Aroma is sweet and a little fruity. Taste is light and refreshing - sweet malt and lemony citrus, slightly fizzy palate. Light spice/pepper bite in the finish. I bought this at the end of December, 2004 - It�d be better suited to summer drinking, but it�s a nice palate cleanser before moving on to more barleywines and imperial stouts!
The Brew Kettle Short Phil's Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Cream Ale;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Deep gold / a short lived white head. A little apple cidery and worty, dusty dry malt aroma. Very low fruitiness. I expected some corn/DMS, but it does not seem to be in the aroma. Very well balanced, but plain! A little grainy malt, light corn flavor, and fairly clean. Higher carbonation, light but not watery body, light biting m/f from carbonation. Good lawnmower beer, but that�s about it!
The Brew Kettle Short Phil's Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Cream Ale;The Brew Kettle;Bottle. Large fizzy white head and fine-medium sized bubbles that fully diminished. Carbonated, transparent and a gold hue. Malty, sweet and fruity aroma. Sweet, acidic, lightly bitter, and malt flavor from start to finish. Tingly, watery, thin mouthfeel.

Tindall Ditchingham Dam;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;GBBF, London, gravity (I think). Sampled with chris_o and ungstrup. Very odd beer, but pretty good stuff really.

Lido Gaisais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lido Group;Enjoyed a pint of this beer in Riga, Latvia at a restaurant. The beer had a rich amber color with a large foamy white head that had great retention along with good cling and lacing. Its aroma had notes of grainy and earthy hops along with barley and some light malt. The taste was mostly bitter and grainy with some barley malt notes as well.

U�avas Tum�ais;U�avas pagasts, Ventspils novads, Latvia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;U�avas Alus;On tap at Alus Seta, Riga Surprised I haven�t rated this one before, as it�s long been a firm favourite. Nose is mainly malts with undertones of toffee, honey and caramel. Pours a rich red brick brown with a small almost white head that soon dissipates. In the mouth is a lovely mixture of grains, fruit and nuts. Apples and cherries in the background. Finish is malts with just a hint of hops. A classic dunkel. Formerly the best beer in Latvia � but times have moved on.

U�avas Tum�ais;U�avas pagasts, Ventspils novads, Latvia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;U�avas Alus;I signed up in RateBeer just to vote for Uzavs Tumsais. My baseline is Guinness Foreign Extra.

U�avas Tum�ais;U�avas pagasts, Ventspils novads, Latvia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;U�avas Alus;Smell - medium strong, roast, caramel pleasant, but could be better. Foam - medium thick, soft, some acidic bitterness notes. medium large, cream color (brown, white milk chocolate, but more to the yellow side) Quickly disappears, only some large thin bubbles remain. Appearance - quite light, bit hazy, orange color, personally I think this is one of least appealing ones I have seen :) Looks a bit like blood piss or tea. Taste - some acidic sourness, some bitterness and then sweetness, tastes like it is off, something wrong with this one I think, dont like taste at all... Maybe I got bad batch or it is off, but this not good ...

Piebalgas Jubilejas Alus;Jaunpiebalga, Jaunpiebalgas novads, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Piebalgas Alus;Tap at Beer house no 1, Riga. Pours a pale yellow with small white head. A hoppy nose leads to a mouth full of fizz ! Overcarbonated. Once it has settled down, theres a nice balance of malts and hops, popcorn and apples. The hops win out in the end though. Inoffensive � drinkable.

Himmelberger Beavertail Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Himmelberger Brewing Company;Tap @ Brewpub. Chestnut brown pour with a creamy beige head. Good florals into a little cocoa smell. Taste is florals, toast, and chocolate. Each is distinct, yet the overall taste is seamless. Can�t remember chocolate malt in a APA before, but hey this is alright. Best of the day at Himmelberger.
Himmelberger Honeycot Festival;Billings, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Himmelberger Brewing Company;Draught. Deep golden color with good head and fine structure. Nose is fresh apricot--not overwhelmingly fruity. Behind that is a vinous edge of honey and malt. A bit of hop to the nose, but only just. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, the flavor is fairly complex with good malt offsetting the honey and the apricot fruitiness. Not overly sweet and not hugely fruity. A solid fruit beer that has balance and good flavor.
Himmelberger Beartooth Blonde;Billings, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Himmelberger Brewing Company;On tap. Golden pour with a white top. Sweet malts, honey and biscuit nose. Taste is grassy, honey and bready. Crisp. Very enjoyable golden ale

Soft aroma of grass and malty sweet. Honey is noticeable in the taste and compliments the Czech(?) hops. Light body and smooth. Really enjoyed the addition of honey; this and the overall balance of the ingrediants really make this nice for a style I usually don�t get into too much."
Hampshire Greece Lightning;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;500ml bottle (bottle conditioned), consumed August 2006. Gold/amber colour. Dryish, with some citrus but nothing too inspiring going on here. It was a rather old bottle, so I�ve made some allowances in the scoring.
Hampshire Greece Lightning;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;[Bottled, thanks chris_o!] Clear golden. Lightly flowery nose. Sweetish and medium bodied. Rather fruity with some sulphur. Low bitterness. Not an attention grabber.
Hampshire Greece Lightning;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;Hand pulled at the Goat and Tricycle, Bournemouth. Little aroma, some lacing compliments the golden colour. Excelelnt beginning: piney citrus and grapefruit, which then slides into a coventional Golden/Blond finish: tart lemon and specks of sweetness. On the whole, very good.
Hampshire Greece Lightning;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;Clear golden color, short to no head. Sharp bitter aroma. Moderately bitter taste and palate. Uninteresting.
Hampshire Greece Lightning;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;On tap. Clear orange coloured, weak aroma. Strong bitter flavour and finish. Strictly one-dimensional.

Fitgers Summer Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours a cloudy amber-straw color. Thin film of white head. Next to no lacing. Mild citrus and spice in the aroma. Prominent coriander and citrus (I taste mandarin orange) in the flavor. Mild wheat beer as the base. No perceptable hops. More citrus and spice in the aftertaste. even a little bit of clove. Lightly carbonated and quite drinkable. This one had more carbonation at the pub.

Fitgers Tugboat Irish Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Fitgers Brewhouse;"A decent little stout on offer. Smooth and rich, with a slightly chocolately flavor. I�m not a huge fan of the nitrogen in that it makes for a nice palate but the flavors get gassed out of it--it doesn�t taste very ""deep"". (on tap at brewpub)"
Fitgers Tugboat Irish Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Fitgers Brewhouse;Cask at GTMW. Poured medium-deep brown with a wispy beige head. The aroma picked up warm dark chocolate and black patent, with touches of ashy smoke around.. well-balanced. The flavor found syrupy molasses and chocolate, with a little honey too.. quite dry, with a milky kick at the end. Medium-bodied and dry as mentioned on the palate.. low carbonation.. OK flow.

Fitgers Tugboat Irish Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Fitgers Brewhouse;ABR 2008. Well, its an Irish stout, true to style, but I suppose this could almost qualify as a mild, given the low abv. Some oatmeal. Dry grain. A drinkable enough session beer. There is only so much that can be done with a style like this.
Fitgers Tugboat Irish Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Fitgers Brewhouse;Sampledvia cask drawn at the Fitger�s Brewhouse in Duluth, MN. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a creamy off-white head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark toasted black malt, some coffee, oatmeal and a touch of flowery hops.

Fitgers Tugboat Irish Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Fitgers Brewhouse;Draft at the Brewhouse. A serviceable dry stout which compares favorably to domestic (at least the inappropriately-aged Guinness we get here in the States). I agree with the other reviewer that it might be closer to a Beamish or a Murphy�s.
Fitgers Tugboat Irish Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Fitgers Brewhouse;Black color with a medium, creamy head. Aroma of a bitter, dark roast coffee. More of the same in the flavor with a good kick of malt. A bit watery to be excellent.
Fitgers Tugboat Irish Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Fitgers Brewhouse;Classic stout whiff. Very typical. Almost a little musty on the palate. Weaker version of their Big Boat Oatmeal Stout. Too watery for a dry stout. Don�t bother, go straight to the other.
Fitgers Tugboat Irish Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Fitgers Brewhouse;Black Coloring. Tan Head. Nice and Creamy. Roasts. More Bitter Then Guinness. Would Compare to Beamish... This one Sets a Good Standard For Stouts.
Brewster's Lola;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brewster's Brewery (UK);[Cask at GBBF 2004] An orange beer with no head. The aroma is light - what is there is sweet flowery combined with notes of caramel. The flavor is sweet and sticky - too much for me.
Brewster's Lola;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Weird flavour of boiled sweets and malt then fades to a gentle fructosey sweetness. Strange stuff. (Cask at Nottingham Beer Festival)
Brewster's Lola;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brewster's Brewery (UK);"Not much to choose between this and the previous two pale gold summer quaffers I had before - Downton Chimera Wheat and Gales Summer Hog. As I missed this at the Canterbury Beer Festival because it was tucked away on the ""pink girly bar"", I was pleased to get another crack at it. Crisp and refreshing, with plenty of aromatic hops and a clean dry finish. In other words, entirely fit for the purpose. The extra alcohol didn�t make much impact though. Rather nice. Cask (handpump), The Crosse Keys (JDW), City of London."

Fitgers Lundroski Wedding Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Light copper appearance with a light white head. Light sprucey nose. Good, balanced hoppy bitter flavor, not overwrought with citrus. Also detect some caramel and toffee. Leans more towards an English PA rather than an IPA. A bit too tart on the tongue in the aftertaste though.
Fitgers Lundroski Wedding Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Light Brown Coloring. No Head. Undistinctive IPA.. Some Hops There, Very Subdued.. Very Smooth, Easy to Drink Ale.

Pours a hazy golden color with a thin frothy white head. Fair head retention. Aroma of corn, toasted grain and a tart note. The taste is grainy malts and an acrid note. Almost no bitterness. Thin, watery. Is this beer? Ooh, upon warming it develops a canned tomato taste. Neat!
Rheingold Beer;Wilton, Connecticut, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rheingold Brewing Company;Bottle. Light yellow in color, fizzy white head. Aroma is grassy hops, flavor is pretty unremarkable, corny sweetness in the back, grassy hops and cereal grains in the front.
Rheingold Beer;Wilton, Connecticut, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rheingold Brewing Company;Not much going on here basic lager pours a bit on the light side. Crisp tasteless finish clean. Smooth drinking thats for sure. Basic watery pale lager works in that context certainlt ok for what it is but there are far better lagers such as gansett...
Rheingold Beer;Wilton, Connecticut, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rheingold Brewing Company;Aroma of straw and very mild, grassy hops -- which are not readily perceivable. The taste is slightly less boring, with shy, sweet notes of malts accompanying the timid hop bitterness. Although this is all on a very small scale, it makes the beer at the very least drinkable.
Rheingold Beer;Wilton, Connecticut, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rheingold Brewing Company;Bottle. Aroma has notes of sweet cereal malts, lager yeast and floral citrus hops. Medium gold hue with a small fully diminishing head that left no lace. Flavor is medium sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is light bodied and soft carbonation.

Rocky River Firefly;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Dark red color, not much head to speak of due to an overpour. Aromas of noble hops with a little more citrus to them shine through some nice sweet dark fruit aromas. All this with yeasty undertones. Full of plum flavor (probably from some darker German malts mixing it up with the yeast), this one gets off to a malty sweet start and finishes up crisp and hoppy, with a touch of citrus and grass. This reminded me of a really good sticke alt, moreso than this breweries version of a sticke. Very nice alt.
Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;Pours barely translucent chocolate brown with a nice beige head. Aroma offers roast malt, caramel and toffee tones. Flavor features roast malt, toffee and chocolate tones, rather delicious. Mouthfeel presents fair body and fair fizz. Happy any anniversary!

Aroma of malt, toffee, caramel, and nutty. Taste of malts, slight chocolate, and nutty. This full bodied brew is a pleasant surprise.
Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;"""4 years later can�t taste the influence of the oak anymore. it was a pretty drinkable beer, but as the years have mellowed the already lower than normal hop prescence, it was good but nothing really special. maybe a different story when it was fresher."
Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;Bottle from Aces and Ales. Pours a clear amber with no head. The aroma is faint wood and toast. Medium mouth with a sweet roast, light caramel, lingering sweetness, held up very well, very good.
Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;Bomber in trade. Not sure from who. Think I have had for a year or two. Oldest beer I have ever had.

Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;22 oz bottle (from notes 2008). Pours a clear deep amber color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have dark fruits, caramel, wood, vanilla, a hint of alcohol, honey, just a touch of roasted malt. Good mouthfeel, good flavor.
Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;Entering old ratings from notes. Draft sampler at Urge Gastropub for their Stone tap takeover back in mid-January 2014. Pours a cloudy auburn hue with big beige head with good retention (similar to the rye whiskey Arrogant Bastard in the next tasting glass, but much more cloudy). AROMA of ashy malts, some toffee, light hazelnut coffee, roasted nuts, and semi-burnt toast. FLAVOR has an interesting taste than I can only describe as �roasted butterscotch� along with other notes of caramel and roasty notes of chocolate and mild coffee. Still some hints of hop bitterness in there, even after all these years. Finishes with some booze (actually oaky bourbon�the oak chips did their job) and semi-sweet chocolaty malts. Interesting to have this almost decade-old beer on draft�makes me wonder what it was like originally. (494, 859)
Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;Very sweet! Almost like a very watered down scotch if you close your eyes. The boyfriend says it reminds him of coke. I amend that to flat coke.
Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;Pours hazy amber with a small beige head. Aroma and flavor bring sweet malts. Unfortunately, the hops and wood have all faded at this point. =
Stone 8th Anniversary Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Stone Brewing;Bottle thanks to djd07. Pours hazy dark brown. No head. Smoky, musty, nose. Taste is fairly, hints of chocolate, burnt malts. Body is a bit thin. Held up well I guess.
Brownings Bohemian Pilsner;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Brownings Brewery;Aroma of lemongrass, floral hops and biscuit. Appearance is gold with white head. Flavor of lemon, honey and orange peel. Palate is very bubbly. An actually good Pilsner not made in the Czech Republic.
Brownings Bohemian Pilsner;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Brownings Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Aroma of cereal/corn. Taste is fairly hoppy, and a little nutty. One of the best pilsners I�ve ever had actually. Nice and smooth, easy to drink, no adjunct flavor, and acceptable hop character.
Brownings Bohemian Pilsner;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Brownings Brewery;"On tap at the bar. I Ordered the ""Pilsner,"" so I guess it was this. Nice rich golden pour (not piss golden like a macro) with minimal head - but thats how they poured it. Very light aroma of pale malt and bitter hops. Refreshing and perfectly balanced flavor. Nearly perfect on the palate - perfect for the style. medium bodied with a nice texture and medium to low carbonation. Not an overly fizzy pilsner!!!"
Brownings Bohemian Pilsner;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Brownings Brewery;Draft at the brewery: poured yellow with a thin white head. Mild corn aroma. Slight fruitiness with hints of grape. Mild corn in the taste as well. Slightly dry with nice body. Moderately bitter in the finish. A good pilsener.
Brownings Bohemian Pilsner;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Brownings Brewery;Draft at Brownings. Poured clear pale color with an average fizzy white head that was mostly lasting with fair lacing. Moderate herb and citrus hoppy aroma. Light to medium body with a watery texture and lively carbonation. Light balanced flavor with a light sweet finish of short duration.
Brownings Bohemian Pilsner;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Brownings Brewery;"On tap: May 15, 2006 - Pours light yellow with a fully receding white head. Aroma of corn, cooked veggies, and some herbal hops. Taste is crisp and relatively clean with firm maltiness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with full carbonation. Refreshing. Ap4 Ar6 Ta6 Mf4 Ov13 On tap: November 21, 2007 - Listed as the ""pilsner"", don�t know if this should be separated from Bohemian Pilsner, I figure the recipe is probably similar enough not to justify a new listing. Pours bright golden with a mostly receding off-white head. Aromatic notes of grass, herbs, cookie, and lightly sweet malt. Tastes of resinous herbs and grassy, sweet cookie. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly resinous. Ap3 Ar5 Ta6 Mf4 Ov13"
Brownings Bohemian Pilsner;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Brownings Brewery;Draft - very pale gold. White head. Little aroma - slightly spicy. Fairly malty flavor with a touch spice. Saaz hops? Good, but not one of my favorite styles.
Ithaca Cascazilla;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;Bottle. Pours a dark copper brown color. Jam packed with nice floral and citrus hop. Toasted malt and caramel balance. Medium body. Creamy texture. Bitter finish. Good stuff.
Ithaca Cascazilla;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;"From Aug 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a clear reddish gold with a medium sized head of foam that settled down to about a 1"" layer and stayed the course that way. The smell is a very nice caramel malt, similiar to what I get from a JW Lees Harvest or Thomas Hardy Ale, with similar results... leaves me going ahh. The taste has that caramel flavour noted in the nose but there's definitely some biscuit and roasty goodness there as well and then the hops, in a pronounced grapefruit form, jump out at me but the finish returns to a fruity sweetness.... so there's a lot going on here in this Red Ale and I find that it's all working *extremely* well. Bottom line: This is a *superb* Red Ale! I recommend it!!! Thanks to Nutbrown for including this wonderful nectar in our trade!!"
Ithaca Cascazilla;Ithaca, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ithaca Beer Co.;"This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was, obviously a rugged malty dark red to embittered brown color with a thick finger and a half�s worth of white foamy head that roamed around the glass. Rich semi-thick foamy lace presented itself nicely around the glass. The aroma started with fresh bitter piney hop oils. Floral and herbal and earthy hops flow into a rugged malty arrangement. Definitely has that ""green"" hoppy bitterness about it, with leaves, somewhat dry. The flavor dryly keeps the hops over top of the malts, full and fueling a dry malty rich aftertaste. Quick dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Good level carbonation. Fulfilling dryness hits my tongue. Overall, pretty good amber ale with a bit more hops than expected."

MacGregor's Big Man Porter;Ithaca, New York, United States;Porter;Ithaca Beer Co.;On tap at the Ithaca Brewery. I understand from the folks at the brewery they will no longer be brewing this beer and only have a small supply left at the Ithaca Brewery. Pours a dark brown with some reddish highlights when held to a window. Small off-white head. Light aroma of roasted malt and caramel. Flavor was also a bit on the light side with caramel and roasted malt noted along with a touch of bitterness from the hops. I found this beer to be a bit light bodied, especially for a porter.

Malty aroma plus butterscotch, apples and background hops. Fruity malt flavor, less diacetyl than expected from the aroma, and just enough hops to round this beer out. A crisp, drinkable ale.
McMenamins Crows Feet IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Pours a darker amber with a nice fluffy white head. I was really pleased with this IPA from mcmenamins, most of their beers have recently let me down. Nice citrus hopped aroma. Taste started slightly sweet and malty then faded to a nice balanced bitterness toward the end. Very simple but tasty IPA, but like many mcmenamins beers it was a little on the thin side.
McMenamins Koi Pond Dreamin;Portland, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Crystal Ballroom. Murky yellow. Syrupy lacing with a thin, oily coating of white. Weird plastic or latex nose, with a smooth palate initially, then fizzy with yeast and lemons. Pasty finish.
McMenamins Koi Pond Dreamin;Portland, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Pours just like a golden should, nice transparent golden color, only problem was the lack of head on this beer. Aroma was grainy with a little floral hop scent hidding behind it. Taste was very simple and mostly dominated by a awkward bitterness throughout the taste, kinda one sided. Once again it was very thin and watery tasting, not too inspiring, maybe seasoned with koi?

Quay Street Eds Red;Port Huron, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Quay Street Brewing Company;On tap @ the brewpub in PH...Dark amber-red color with very little head at all. Very little aroma, and the flavor is suprisingly dominated by hops with a a bit of a caramel malt backbone. Almost more reminiscent of a pale ale. Not too bad.

Dark amber-bronze with a touch, a mere wisp of lasting head and some lacing....big diacetyl-full buttery nose with a faint whiff of smoke that helps out a bit....sour, dry, ashy body, very little malt and no hop character, at the finish grows vinegary and cardboardy. Oh yeah I want more.

Nose of wood, sweet caramel, vanilla, brandy. Chewy strong malts, roasted grain, caramel, dark fruit, oily, slick body, finishing with rich earthy undertones, some slight hop influence, and an alcoholic slap in the head. Well rounded and malty as hell.
Amherst Olde # 7 (Anniversary Ale);Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Amherst Brewing Company;[Cask at GBBF 2004] A dark amber beer with a brown head. The aroma is primarily hoppy. The flavor is sweet with notes of caramel, alcohol, chocolate, and coffee.

Gentle fleeting hop notes in the nose, low hop and caramel in the mouth with some roast barley roastiness apparent. Caramel sweet finish.
Amherst Olde # 7 (Anniversary Ale);Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Amherst Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Nice cloudy orangy color with a noticible alcohol flavor that sort of get in the way of the smooth fruity taste.
Amherst Olde # 7 (Anniversary Ale);Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Amherst Brewing Company;Despite the rare privilege of being able to try this cask conditioned, I can�t say I was too impressed. The colour was a darkish bronze. There was clearly a good ration of hops in this, but the aroma was clammy and sweaty rather than crisp and flowery. Very sweet palate and, without a sharper hop attack to cut through, the overall impression was mellow, but rather cloying. Not my cup of tea. Can�t say I�d call it as a barley wine. Cask (gravity), GBBF 2004.
Amherst Olde # 7 (Anniversary Ale);Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Amherst Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub: Clear dark orange with a thin white head. Sweet dark fruits in the aroma, thick mouthfeel and smooth, starts and ends sweet with a rich finish.

Some dog biscuits and also some sharp alcohol in the finish. A bit odd, it was sticky and sweet as i�d expect a barleywine to be, but it had nothing much else happening.

Amherst Olde # 7 (Anniversary Ale);Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Amherst Brewing Company;Gravity GBBF. My notes say 6%. A sweet beer with a lot of bittering hops. A heavy beer with a certain richness, but little of interest. Surprisingly bland mouthfeel for a cask ale - some people would call it smooth. This is not my thing.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Stopped at this nice little brewpub in long island. Unable to get good tasting notes because had to catch the ferry. Staff was very nice and the beers was enjoyable. Very nice food too. Would like to stop back sometime and get proper rating but numerical score will have to do now for the flight we got.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;An draft at the brewpub. Arrived to the table a lightly hazed gold with a ring for a head that left no lace. The aroma is very mild honey with equally mild malt. The flavor is an odd combination of lager yeast, German hops, and harsh grain that makes me think more of Heineken than a honey ale. Scant honey in the flavor and no detectable sweetness. Mild-moderate bitterness at the finish. Not a fan.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Brewfest NY 08. Man i wish i was able to write down notes at the fest, but it was pouring rain and I had an umbrella in one hand, and my drinking glass in the other. I remember this being pretty decent though. Obviously need to try it again.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Sampled at the NY Brewfest on 9/12. Not able to give a very accurate rating due to the sheer number of brews sampled. Seemed pretty average, but nice alcohol percentage.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. I actually thought this one was pretty interesting. Lots of wheat and honey in the aroma, and even more honey in the flavor. Rather toasted as well. Not terribly complex, and probably could be achieved with less alcohol, but still pretty good.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a light yellow/orange with a white head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma of light sweet malt. Flavor is super sweet, of wheat and honey. Just quite sweet. Somewhat drinkable though.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Yea, I have no clue why this is on tap this time of year, but their double pils still isn�t up, so I was stuck with this - somewhat hazy golden beer, with a fairly tenacious lacing around the sides - semi-skunky, european strong lager aroma, with potent honey sweetness behind it - a very sweet beer, with sugar and honey being most prevalent, along with some grainy/wheaty character underneath - grassy, herbal hops arrive late, along with some citrus pulp and rind, combining with the sweetness to create a flavor similar to sugar on grapefruit - the hops are a bit astringent, but the sweetness wins out in the end, though - kind of not very good.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;I have no clue what this is doing on tap at this time of the year. It seems to me that they skipped a season. Anyway, they had it listed at 18 OG and 8 ABV. It is possible that this is simply something they put on because they ran out of the Hurricane Kitty and Boys Red during a recent mechanical problem. I make a note that it may have been old because it had a very mild skunk to it. Slight bits of bitterness complement an overall grassy flavor. If you are there, I suggest having it, but it is not something you will want to seek out by itself.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;6.5% ABV in this year�s incarnation. Slightly hazy pale golden colour, thick tight head. Pretty nice looking beer actually. Sweet and honeyish aroma. A bit of toast and biscuity malt. Light citrusy aroma as well. Flavour is less impressive however. Light pale malt, a bit of honey but the same slightly nasty hops as are found in the Summer Ale. Slightly astringent woody character with a metallic finish. If they�d use something like Challenger in here it could have been special... alas, it�s barely even good.
Brick House Summer Buzz;Patchogue, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Tap. Golden orange color and off white head. Aroma and flavor of sweet malt, toasty, and a touch of honey. Light bitter finish. Slight warming sensation.
Rock Bottom Portland Righteous Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rock Bottom Portland;Light smelling nose, wheat and bread. Some strange fabric/blanket flavors, some strong rye, spiced bread. Pretty good tartness and a cloudy orange appearance makes it attractive.
Rock Bottom Portland Righteous Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rock Bottom Portland;Orange gold color. Aroma is caramel and spicy. A medium bodied �rye� American Strong Ale.

Ambr�usianum Hell;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Gasthausbrauerei Ambr�usianum;On-tap at the brewery on 11th Sep 2018. Slight haze to the golden body, nice lasting white crown.

Ambr�usianum Hell;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Gasthausbrauerei Ambr�usianum;"3 August 2018. At Ambr�usianum, Bamberg. Cheers to Anke! Sample. Pours clear golden with a lasting, small, frothy, white head; some lacing. Aroma of grain, citrus, honey, white bread, sugar, wort. It tastes light malty sweet, a bit bready & honeyish, and light grainy bitter, yeasty too. Short, dryish, grainy finish, faintly grassy with lingering yeast. Light body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation. Unnoted Helles, but somewhat 'artisan'."
Ambr�usianum Hell;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Gasthausbrauerei Ambr�usianum;Vom fass at the brauerei, Bamberg. Unfiltered gold. Hoppy aroma is noticeable over the honey cereal. Taste is bitter like a pils, even though it looks like a kellerbier it's basically a pils. Bitter and nice finish. Decent helles really drinkable.

Ambr�usianum Dunkel;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Gasthausbrauerei Ambr�usianum;Vom Fa� vor Ort in Bamberg - das Ambr�usianum war die letzte Bamberger Brauerei, die mir noch fehlte (von Sonderf�llen wie Weyermann abgesehen). - Sch�nes Rotbraun, tr�b, pr�chtiger Schaum. - In der Nase Hefe, Karamel und leichte s�uerliche und grasig-unreife Noten. - Antrunk glatt karamelmalzig und wenig s��.

Sarmat Mitsne (Krepkoe);Donetsk, Ukraine;Malt Liquor;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Golden color , thin head. Sweet and alcohol aroma. Why ukrainian brewers cant to do strong beer without alcohol smell and taste???? ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Sarmat Mitsne (Krepkoe);Donetsk, Ukraine;Malt Liquor;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Apples, paint thinner and alcohol aroma with some plastic. Dull gold and no head. The taste is only slightly less offensive than the aroma, emphasizing plastic and alcohol mostly.
Sarmat Mitsne (Krepkoe);Donetsk, Ukraine;Malt Liquor;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Bottle in sevastopol. Glassy brassy gold. The aroma is overwhelmingly candylike, with artificial watermelon and green apple hard candy dominant. Sweet, but the palate is not cloying. Wow is wonderfully foul and reminiscent of the malt liquor of yore. Brutal.
Sarmat Mitsne (Krepkoe);Donetsk, Ukraine;Malt Liquor;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Bottle, half liter. aroma is fine, a little bit better than any industrial lager. Amber, cloudy, with almost none yeast presence, sweet (caramel) and bitter. Minimal head. Medium body, creamy, lively carbonation with perfect bitterness.
Sarmat Mitsne (Krepkoe);Donetsk, Ukraine;Malt Liquor;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;0,7l Pet fles. Gekocht in Notdhorn (Dld) in een klein Russisch winkeltje. Het heeft zo�n gigantische alcohol smaak dat ik direkt dacht aan Grolsch Kanon. Ik heb ��n glas gedronken.

No discernible aroma. Taste is typical mitsne: deep sweetish caramel with some bitterness. Grassy, resiny notes. Aftertaste is dry, bitter grass. Not bad, but boring. (0.5l bottle.)
Sarmat Mitsne (Krepkoe);Donetsk, Ukraine;Malt Liquor;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Bottled. Ugly fizzy golden appearance. Alcohol is present in the nose. Syrupy sweet, but also rich with estery bubblegum. Salty with bold mouthfeel. Solid. A decent strong lager.

Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;Not one of my favorites from this brewery, on tap at World Beer Fest in Cleveland, decent strength, some sugar, nice finish.
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;Draft at Brew Kettle Tasting. Poured clear dark amber color with an average frothy white head that was mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted sweet malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium toasted sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. The beer goes well with my spicy hot dog.
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;"Sample at Brew Kettle on 10/7/11. Clear gold/amber pour with a medium off-white head. Nose is malty and sweet and definitely lager-ish; similar to Ayinger Oktoberfest Marzen. Malty flavor with a bit of fruit. Some grainy and earthy character in there too before a semi-sweet finish. Not as sweet as it smells."
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;10/30/2007: The knew that the pint of Amarillo ESB that I had would be tough to follow, but this Oktoberfest couldn�t even come close to being at least partially satisfying. This is a below average to average Oktoberfest beer at best. The amber/burnt orange color is okay for the style, but the aroma is nearly non-existent, the flavor is really grainy and lacking in depth, and the body is quite thin. A large majority of the Ringnect/Brew Kettle beers are quite solid and getting quite good over time, but the Oktoberfest definitely needs some work if not a full overhaul. 16 oz draught mug at The Brew Kettle in Strongsville, Ohio. Rating #8 for this beer.
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;Pours a clear orange-amber color with a medium light beige head that recedes steadily. Patchy lacing throughout. Sweet malt and caramel aroma. Medium, smooth body with a bready malt character. Sweet caramel flavor as well along with some grain and hops. The finish is sweet malt at first, with a bit of hops lingering on the back end. A decent rendition of the style.
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;Draft @ brewkettle: Clear orange/gold pour with a white head. Aroma, spice, yeast, and caramel. Flavor, sweet almost fruity, some crisp bitterness. Not bad.
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;On tap at the brewpub - Pours amber with a short white head... Aromas of caramel and german hops. Flavor is caramel, malty, toasted grains, and some light bitterness on the finish. Light carbonation and medium body.
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;22 oz. bottle. Pours a deep amber with a light beige medium head, settling to a thin layer that lasted throughout the glass, and left some fair lace. The appearance was actually quite appealing, leading me to beleive that this batch from 2006 was different than what was described by other reviewers in 2004. Grain based aroma, with just the slightest hint of some floral and piney hops. Mouthfeel is just a bit thin with lively carbonation. Flavor of caramel, toasty grain that is held in check by a light spicy bitterness. Hop character is well in the background here, quite appropriate for the style. This is a reasonably good Marzen, and if it had a little better body and mouthfeel, it might even be exceptional.
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;"Bottle: Thin but lasting light beige head, amber body. Heavy toasted & munich malt aroma, clean; caramel as it warms Hints of a bit of roast in this one up front, balanced just to bitter, sulphury yeast in the finish & aftertaste. Slightly tart and lactic throughout. Aftertaste is a little bitter herbal hop. Higher carbonation, dry, borderline astringent m/f. At least it�s a clean O�fest. Not terribly impressive, but drinkable."
Ringneck Oktoberfest;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Brew Kettle;Bottle. Large sized ivory head and fine-medium sized bubbles that mostly diminished. Fast rising carbonation, transparent and an orange hue. Malty, caramel and light hop aroma. Caramel and malt flavor from start to finish. Tingly palate, light-medium bodied beer with fair lacing.
The Brew Kettle Wheat Beer;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Lasting white head on a fairly clear deep golden body. Raspberry immediately in the nose. I�m guessing they used puree, but it smells like fresh crushed raspberries. Very light wheat malt aroma and very clean Am. wheat. Well balanced w/ a light raspberry flavor. Wheat malt and raspberry very well balanced with each other, also balanced well with hops. lIghtly tart. Clean finish is raspberry flavored as is aftertaste. Medium carbonation, lighter but not watery body, smooth m/f. Very good wheat with fruit, although I�m not wild about raspberries. They are not overpowering in the flavor & add a nice dimension to the beer. Only downfall is that is it only 2 dimensional, wheat malt and raspberries.
The Brew Kettle Wheat Beer;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Kettle;Bottle. Large sized creamy and smooth white head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly diminished. Fast rising carbonation, transparent and a yellow hue. Malty, light hops, sweet and some fruity notes in the aroma. Flavor was sweet, malty and some hops in the finish.

The mouth feel was initially mildly tingly and finished smoothly. The flavor contained smooth notes of malts and hops and was slightly astringent.
Apollo Altbier;Copenhagen, Denmark;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Bryggeriet Apollo;A clear red beer with a beutiful light brown head. The aroma is hoppy with notes of caramel, roasted bread, and Apollo yeast.

Apollo Altbier;Copenhagen, Denmark;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Bryggeriet Apollo;Draught at Bryggeriet Apollo. Served in small Apollo glass. Slightly hazy brownish red. Off-white head.

Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;Tap @ SPH. Pours that unmistakable cloudy golden-orange with a surprisingly small white head. Aroma is banana, clove, and slight vanilla characteristics as well. Flavor is spicy up front with noticeable cloves and a nice sweet finish with heavy notes of banana. Beer again remains smooth throughout, and while it did not exactly match the classic hefeweizen, it was more than worth the price of admission.
Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;On tap at SPH. Pours a cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma of spices and clove. Flavor is spices upfront with a nice fruity (banana) finish. Full-bodied palate. However, after a pint of this, the spices started to annoy me. Ok hefe though.
Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;On tap at the Publick House. Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy. Aroma of banana, reddish fruits, wheat, spices in the background. Flavor more of the same, maybe gets a bit tiring by the end. Full, creamy body. While a bit different from an authentic German Hefeweizen, a much more interesting attempt than I�ve come to expect from an American brewer. Sort of like wheat candy.
Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;Draft at SHPH. Pours a cloudy yellow hazy body with a creamy fluffy white head.

Spicy fruity aroma. Banana clove notes. Malty fruity flavor. Banana citrusy flavor. Smooth. Well balanced. Finish is spicy. Very nice beer.
Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;Tap at Hop Devil. Lovely pour, super hazy with a nice, bright white head. As cloudy as this was, though, it had little body, making both the aroma and the taste very watery. Some of the right pieces were there, but this really was lacking a distinctive yeast character that hefes should have. Really quite unexciting.
Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;From my long lost notes. On tap at the SPH August, 2003. Servied in a pint glass. Arrived at the table a hazy gold with a thin white head. Very pleasant aroma of bananas along with some spice. Flavor was definitely wheaty with bananas and yeast as well. A bit of spice in there as well. Fairly smooth and medium bodied. Very good summer brew.
Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;Poured a lightly hazy, golden color, with a medium sized, creamy white head that left light lacing on the glass.

Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;Tap at SPH. Hazy golden coloured beer. Sweet aroma of banana, some nice wheaty character in the nose. Not a lot of clove or spice. Seems a bit undercarbonated and sort of lifeless. Flavour is pretty good, medium bodied, banana and apple flavour. Lingering wheaty spice on the back. Malts seem a bit light, but it�s quite refreshing.
Southampton Bavarian Wheat;Southampton, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Southampton Publick House;On tap @ the Publick house, enjoyed while talking with JoeMcPhee. Poured cloudy yellow into a shaker. Aroma is faintly wheaty and taste was too watery. This was one of those unimpressive beers served at the Publick house. They must of changed the yeast because their are no complex flavors.

Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Melon/Rabarber;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Bottled. Bright pink/purple. Soda-like artificial perfumy fruit flavour. Not even remotely similar to beer. Too sweet even for lemonade...
Dragonmead Wench Water;Warren, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dragonmead Brewery;Not sure how I missed this beer. Nice head, yellow-gold color. Fantastic banana, citrus, spice and yeast character. Mild hop presence. Arguably the most Belgian-tasting beer there.

Dragonmead Wench Water;Warren, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dragonmead Brewery;Tap at brewery: Was told this was a run-off from one of their bigger beers (Armageddon maybe).

Dragonmead Wench Water;Warren, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dragonmead Brewery;Poured a nice highly carbonated copper color with a thick white head. Big Belgian estery aroma, sweet bubblegum and pear give way to a cola like aroma and cinnamin, as it warmed I picked a note of burnt popcorn (I might have been having a stroke though). The flavor is malt forward, biscuit and breadlike, some bitterness with a crisp finish. The body is light, good for a summer thirst quencher. This is a great addition to the summer line up, and a nice alternative to the witbiers everyone else is offering.

Dragonmead Wench Water;Warren, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dragonmead Brewery;A very delicious Belgian pale .. not that there are that many to compare it to. The yeast dominates this beer. Plenty of sugar, cotton candy, and bubble gum in the nose. And the flavor follows the aroma. A little sweet, but nice yeast bite and plenty of hops to off-set. A very satisfying brew!
Simeon Jones River Valley Amber Ale;Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Picaroons Traditional Ales;Decent foamy head and darker copper body with heavy carbonation.

Monterey Coast American Wheat;Salinas, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Monterey Coast Brewing Restaurant & Brewery;This is a very good American Wheat.

De Proef Cuvee Angelique;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle. [thanks after4ever] Clear red-brown pour with a small, creamy, off-white head that fizzes a little. Aroma has nuts, caramel, Belgian sugar, light red berries, some mild oxidation. Medium carbonation, fine creamy if a bit light mouthfeel. Flavour has firm milky chocolate, some raisins, esters, caramel. Centre feels slightly oxidized before the firmly bitter malty finish sets in. Simple but very nice anyways.
De Proef Cuvee Angelique;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Poured into a snifter. Angelique pours a rich mahogany, with a solid white head that retains at about a quarter of an inch, which leads to nice lacing. Aromas are of baked apples, nutmeg, clove, and some strong alcohol tones. Tastes are of fall fruits, apples, pears, figs, raisins, clove and nutmeg. High carbonation, with a smooth and clean mouthfeel. Very drinkable and enjoyable.

Sweet and sugary, rather mild and mellow carbonation. Somewhat watery for the style, simple and subdued. Funky Belgian yeast goes a long way in carrying this one.

Initially a large light brown head forms, but doesn�t stay very long. Aroma is quite sweet, with caramel, bananas, and esters. Flavours are bananas and caramel, estery and lightly spicy, with a bit of harsh alcohol in the finish. This came across more like a dunkelweizen than anything, and not a very good one at that.
De Proef Cuvee Angelique;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;750 ml bottle- Pours somewhere between muddy brown and ruby red with a thin white head, aroma is belgian yeast and some banana. The flavor is sweet and candy like, much better tasting than the mystique, I think this is the best tasting of the three I�ve tried so far ( euphorique mystique and now this). The body is a little thin and watery and there is really no lingering flavors, its like after you drink it, you immediately forget what it tastes like. Forgettable and drinkable!
De Proef Cuvee Angelique;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Pours a dark coppery mahogany with a lot of sediment and a decent pale tan head. Aroma is fruity and a little sweet with a malty underpinning. Fruity, slightly woody flavor has a malty undertone and a hint of caramel. Texture is quite smooth and just a little tingly. Overall, worthy of at least a try.
De Proef Cuvee Angelique;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Good full body. Fruit, cinnamon, sweet flavors. My first venture into a dubbel Belgian and at 3 bucks a bottle, it�s not bad. Great 750ml option.

Singha 70;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;This appears to be a specialty brew to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the brewery. As it is not the same ABV as any of its stablemates I have the great honour to introduce this new beer. It looks like all of the others of its ilk of course, a pale lager is exactly that. There is a fime bead in the glass with only a wisp of head. This is ok as there is ample lacing in the glass. The aroma is like its heavier big brother with an obvious aroma of the alcohol to come. For the climate this flavour is acceptable, just like in Manila a couple of days ago. It is all about context. Slightly metallic flavour and dryness to finish.

Aroma is a nice hop kick, German like is what I�m getting. Taste is bright, with nice floral hops. Not much sweetness. Really light and not super carbed.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Yellow/gold pour with creamy white head. Pale malt and perfumy hops aroma. Light pale malt, perfumy hops on the finish. Light medium bodied with good carbonation.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;(Draught) Pours a clear golden body with a medium cream head. Aroma of florals, soap, and grass. Flavor of grass, florals, herbs, and grass with a dry, mildly bitter finish.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On tap at Draught House during RBWG Clear golden with a big white head and good lacing. Aroma of hops and grains. Tastes of citrus, grainy and yeast. Not bad, smooth.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On tap at the Draught House. Light pour with a white head. Aroma is light and grainy with a similar taste. Sadly, after a few minutes of sitting on the Draught House porch, it was so badly skunked that you could smell it from a foot away.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On tap at Draught House. Pours a clear golden with small off white head leaving spotty lacing. The aroma is skunk corn malt. Thin moutjfeel with a sweet corn malt. Not much going on with this one.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;2/25/12. On tap at the brewery during RBWG 2012. Grainy blond ale aroma and a similarly plain flavor. Drinkable, I suppose.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewery. The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of Belgian yeast with some bread and citrus notes. There is a little bit of grass from the hops in the aroma as well. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of Belgian golden ale characteristics with some earth, grass and citrus notes from the hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;(draught) Clear copper, lasting thick soapy off white head. Nose is musty, funky citrus. Taste earth, piney bitter, citrus oils. Creamy, medium thick body.
Draught House Hop Gold;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On tap at Draught House (4-2-09)- poured transparent golden in color, creamy white head formed and stayed for awhile. Aroma of nuts, yeast, and hops. Hits the mouth with a low-medium body, hops very apparent from the start and the malt kind of gets lost in the translation, middle holds up well, finish kind of drops off. Nice, but a little too drinkable.
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;One of my favorites last summer. A dark brown color best served on cask (from the tap does not do this one justice). Lots of oak in the flavor with roasted malts.
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pulled from the cask, this a very dark, nearly black colored beer. Only a slight deep purple-red hue when held to the light prevents it from being all black. It is topped by an inch or so of the smoothest and creamiest head of light brown foam that you�re ever likely to see. Very good head retention, light lacing. You kinda have to look for the aroma, but it is there - of chocolate malt and red wine. Delicious beer, both the stout flavor and the wine flavor are plentiful. The stout is smooth and rich of bittersweet chocolate and roasted grain, with a hint of tang in the finish. The wine flavors come through - robust and fruity - with raspberry and sherry undertones. There is also a nice oak character to the beer, again most noticeable in the finish. The mouthfeel is sublime - smoother than smooth, with flavors that linger in the aftertaste.
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Recognizable as their oatmeal stout but softened a bit by some time in the cask. The beer was served not at cellar but warm room temperature; it works for this beer. Black and thick foam. Roasted malt, and lots of oak in the flavor. Actually oak is the dominant flavor. Just a hint of tannins, and only there because I was looking for some kind of wine quality. Very light port as well. Full bodied, but lacks the complexity I expected. Very smooth out of the cask, easy to drink. I wonder if the casks are worn out?"
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Aroma is sweet malt with woodiness. Black color is perfect with nice creamy cask head. Flavor is roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate with the wood coming through and a winelike fruitiness. The finish is dry, but the bitterness is not due to hops so much as tannins/burnt malts. Mouthful could be a tad thicker I think, and even for a cask beer this was quite warm. I would put this as the most interesting beer I�ve sampled from Town Hall, and I look forward to working through their numerous other brews.
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Cask. Vinious aroma, sweet malts and figs as well. Smooth cask mouthfeel. Deep and richly flavorful. Some tannins and roast give structure to the delicately sweet and deep malts. Not overly alcoholic, which I like, many wood-aged beers I find overly alcoholic. There is an alcoholic presence here, but its more felt in the mouth than tasted. Impressive.
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Rich aroma with hints of chocolate and containing bourbon barrell notes. Opaque body with decent lace. Small, off-white head that is mostly diminishing. Really nice bourbon barrell flavor with a winey finish. Outstanding. Another solid beer from the TH.
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"I really, truly rue that I cannot sip from a sample freshly poured off a growler right at this minute and put my thoughts into the keyboard as they come to me, for this is cask-only, and I didn�t take notes, merely tucked my memory away from the pint and a half I had a mere hour. Moreover, I wish it were growlerized, in that I could taste this sweet stuff more conveniently, but that�s how they get you, back to the brewpub I go... Pours out a nearly full black, with light crimson shining at the very edges, with a plump, creamy tan head atop. Aroma is sweet and fruity, with all grape character, virtually none of what you�d find in a ""normal"" stout. This continues in the taste, as well. Body is full, but thin compared to a traditional stout, though the rich, sweet fruit taste rides on high. There�s a tannic texture as well, slightly acid, grabby on the palate. A delicious stout, that truly reminds you of wine. Damned drinkable, you could gulp them down almost too quickly if you�re not careful...that is, if you�re like me. With luck, this will last more than a week, and you can get a chance to taste it..but, please do try, it�s a treat!"
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;I like this one over the Cab Stout Town Hall offers. The wine aspect isn�t cloying in tartness. It complements the stout existence perfectly, and on cask it is sublime. I have to keep myself from killing the pint when my lips reach it. Oops. I did it again. Fantastic beer.
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On-cask at the brewpub: Lovely pulled pour with the cascading effect of ochre yellow flying up the sides of the glass, reaching a final solid black with tiny slivers of ruby at the bottom and edges. The head on this is like a whole nother liquid! Firm, milky, rich, spongy, and thick, of a light sandy brown and about a finger high. Absolutely lovely to look at for a cask poured pint. Nose is softly robust of a supurb oaty sweetness decorated with a heavenly bakers chocolate on top. The sweetness is quite evident but never overly so. Taste is fantastic, smooth and sweet, rich and subdued in a tangy oaty sweetness. The merlot is there in a darker undertow mixed with bits of milk chocolate. Oh so nice, the sweetness is welcoming throughout the whole ride with a interesting tang of oats, milk, and dull cherryness. The chocolate darts and coats along the way with the sweetening factors while the merlot flavors paint a whisping hint of dark grape vinous and woodish-like nature underneath. Spectacularly smooth and sweet with a medium body feel and a great little tang inside. Texture is oh so nice from the cask pull, quite smooth and calming. This is really nice stuff, akin to the H2O oatmeal stout but with a certain flare of extra sweetness and touch of merlot to its flavors. Yum.
Town Hall Merlot Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark Brown/Black Coloring. Frothy Head. The Wine Added Some Sweetness to it... Otherwise it Still Tastes Very Much Like the H2O Stout but With Merlot Mash Added to It. Actually Not a Bad Offering...Balanced...I�ll Have Some More Please!
Goose Island Palisade IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Brouwer�s Cafe Hopfest �06. Clear light amber with a short, somewhat lacy white head. Light aroma of oranges, fruit and toffee. Taste starts sweet and also features oranges, fruit and toffee. Light, somewhat watery body with a dry finish.
Goose Island Palisade IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Draft at Brouwer�s Cafe Hopfest �06. Gold color. Some light white head, but not so overly much that you have to worry about wiping your lip or other inconveniences. Minimal lace. Fruity, almost berry-like nose--it�s a hop fragrance but absolutely fruit in nature. Just not citric. Smooth, mid-carb body. Light malt attack, crisp clean finish. Clean easy drinking. I�d drink this full-time; you wouldn�t even have to pay me."
Goose Island Palisade IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);One of those great beer moments. I was in Chicago and had a short while to run into Sam�s and stock up. On the way out I decided to stop in at GI since, like everest, it was there. I glanced at the impressive chalkboard listing of taps and siezed immediately on the Palisade. The bartender happily handed over a half pint of this aromatic IPA explaining that it was too limited for growlers. Sweet and full, this IPA is quite satisfying but runs a bit short on the finish which is dry with not quite enough of a malt blanket. Great brewpub- I will be back.
Goose Island Palisade IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Hazy golden body with an inch-thick white head. Piney hop nose with a sweet caramel base. Big, hoppy aroma dominated by pine, with light hints of citrus. Otherwise, not very fruity. Sweet caramel and lightly toasted grains give heft but don�t provide much depth. The body is fairly rounded and full, but could be creamier. The flavors show the harsh bitterness of the hops and the warmth of the 7.3% abv. The sweetness pokes through at times, but isn�t dominating by any stretch of the imagination. I�m not always a huge hophead, but this is tasty despite being fairly unbalanced. Hoppy, bitter and enjoyable. Far better than the Midway IPA its based on.
Goose Island Palisade IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);wow was I lucky. The website for GI said this wasn�t on tap, but it was. Smelled dreamy with the hops taking center stage. Pretty color of orange that suggested the I2PA, but not as hopped or alcoholic. Personally, I felt it was better than the IPA. Nice small head that quickly dissipated, like an I2PA. On first taste, did not get the bite that I expected, and taht�s a good thing. It was smooth and creamy, even a bit dreamy. Excellent citrus elements, with the malt poking through once and again. Quite a good beer to sit and sip. Every time I saw one delivered to another table, I envied the patron who was about to be served this rare treat.
Goose Island Palisade IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled on tap at the Goose Island Clyborne location This beer comes with a prodigious, thick, finely beaded, cream colored head. The beer itself is a hazy copper color. The aroma is quite interesting with notes that are earthy, citrusy, and something I can only describe as ganja-like. There is no malt found here, the funky ganja hops rule the day. The taste is quite smooth and creamy with a bit more citrus character than the nose suggests. There is of course a solid bitterness in the finish. The stinky ganja that is in the aroma is only subtly in the taste, but it still is enough to add a really interesting component to this beer. There is a subtle malt backbone here that is just enough to hold up the hops, but not be noticeable itself. As the beer warms up a bit I get notes of grapefruit, pine-tar, and a malty sweetness, which is the only malt note noticeable above all of the hop character. This beer is really quite different in character from your typical American IPA, it is much more earthy and not nearly as citrusy as nose. I really like when brewers do single hop beers, it really helps to define the character of individual hop varietals for me. Sampled on Cask at the Goose Island Clyborne location Much smoother than the tap version (lower carbonation). This one is also quite clear (perhaps a hint of haze) and a pretty copper color and a pale cream colored head. There is still the funky ganja notes from the hops, but the hops have mellowed considerably and meld in a much more balanced way with the malt. I get some creamy notes of vanilla that I did not notice in the tap version. There is still a solid bitterness in the finish, and I get notes of citrus (more specifically grapefruit), and pine in the flavor. There is a lasting, lingering hop character here, the bitterness sticks around from sip to sip. This is most definitely what I expect from a cask beer, still the base beer, yet noticeably different from the tap version. Hard to say though which one I like better.

Etienne Dupont Organic Cidre Bouch� Brut de Normandie;Victot-Pontfol, France;Apple Cider;Domaine Famille Dupont;2015 vintage. 750mL bottle, pours a hazy golden with a small, quickly-dissipating white head.

Etienne Dupont Organic Cidre Bouch� Brut de Normandie;Victot-Pontfol, France;Apple Cider;Domaine Famille Dupont;"Initially acrid notes of baby urine softening into a mildly astringent bouquet of putrefying verbena on dampened stone; yeasty afterglow and a pleasing finish."
Etienne Dupont Organic Cidre Bouch� Brut de Normandie;Victot-Pontfol, France;Apple Cider;Domaine Famille Dupont;2011 bottle drank Nov 10, 2016. We bought this bottle, sort of forgot about it, moved overseas, left it in a dark basement for a few years, found it, moved it to a fridge, etc, drinking it today. I figure it has gone south since it�s only 4.5%. Annnnd, I�m totally wrong. This is really great. Clear medium orange golden. Sweet, apple, light suffer, a very faint smoke note. Nice dry apple finish. The flavor is complex but very well blended. Such an enjoyable cider. Great.
Etienne Dupont Organic Cidre Bouch� Brut de Normandie;Victot-Pontfol, France;Apple Cider;Domaine Famille Dupont;Very similar to the non-organic version (3.7) - perhaps a little more musty and the apple seemed a little more dramatic/fresher, though I could have been imagining that. Slightly preferred.

Taste is sweet grassy, apple skin, oak, yellow apples, sugar, overripe crowberries, hay, grass, weeds, cheese. Slightly dry funky mouthfeel. Fair enough, kind of interesting.

Some diacetyl. Flavor a little tart (!) and quite malty with again some butter. Finishes softly bitter. Mouthfeel medium bodied with strong carbonation. The faint sourness makes this one actually quite refreshing, though the diacetyl suggests of a bad batch. (3 3 5 3 8 = 2.2) Re-rate: A fresh batch. Sweetish malty nose, bubblegum, banana and grain. Mentholey and grassy flavor, good fresh hops, little banana malts, nicely drinkable pale lager.

Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;Indifferent bottled ale, ruby coloured with a thin head, aroma of berry fruit and bitter hop. Dominant hop flavour with a bitter aftertaste.
Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;Bottle. A standard strong bitter. Amber coloured with little head. Red fruit and grassy hop aroma. Flavour had some biscuit malt and fruit, before a decent bitter finish. Ok.
Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;Scotland August 2005, the last evening... Amber with a nice head and good lace. The aroma has aroma hops and the flavour has even more of it, and it also has notes of fruits and caramel. the finish has a nice bitterness. It was a nice surprise and I liked it...
Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;Bottled. Dark amber. Papery aroma. Dry and ashy with some crystal amlt and clean, hard mouthfeel, low hop rate. Short, empty finish. Simplistic and uninspired. British beer? I guess so. Great? No way!
Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;Golden with no head upon pouring.Bitterness dominates although there are other flavours present-its just hard to find them.A bitter that lives up to its name.
Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;Poured from the bottle, a light brown, slightly cloudy but with a brilliant big rocky head. The aroma was a good blend of hops, malt and fruits which was reflected in the flavours. On the palate, a nice hoppiness was left in the mouth. I certainly got a lot more from this beer than I was expecting, will be a regular in my house I think.
Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;Initially very little aroma, but after a few minutes it opens up into lovely mix of malt & hops. Lovely mid-gold colour and a good botte-conditioned head that lasts. Not the best, but well worth a sup.
Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;This beer is Threshers own brand beer and despite working for them I have to report that it is distinctively average. The beer has a copper hue with a small foamy white head. Rich toffee and woody nose. Nutty roasted malt flavours with rusty hints and a slightly watery feel. A very short after taste of nuts any hoppy character.
Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;"Bottle. Very clear amber coloured beer with thin white head. Aroma is oaky, fruity, malty.

Firebrand Great British Beer;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;500 ml bottle brewed by Hopback. Dark amber colour, rocky, fast-fading off-white head. Aroma is very woodsy and oaky with a bit of orange/blackberry fruitiness. Flavour is slightly malty, a bit fruity and shows some woodsiness. Gets cloyingly sweet. Yeast seems to have thrown off some nastiness as well, a bit of DMS. Not enough bitterness for my liking either.
Dogwood Youngbloods Imperial Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter - Baltic;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle: Dark brown and mellowed out quite a bit. Tangy flavors with a coffee finish. Thin and slimy body. Tasty. Thanks Indiana_Red for pulling another oldie out of the cellar.
Dogwood Youngbloods Imperial Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter - Baltic;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);"a surprise wish list cross off that has been cellared by a friend since about 2003!!! after a tasting he busted out a 4 year old World Wide, this one (and from what i can gather this brewer doesn�t exist anymore) and get this - a 15 year old bottle of 12% Port Older Viscosity. the sample I had (in 2010) which obviously had some age on it but has been stored well. It was awesome to try, but a little muddled and unfocused. still lots of chocolate and roasted malt, little hop presence, and some warming anise like alcohol. probably better in 04-05, but I can�t go back in time, so i gotta rate it like i see it."""
Dogwood Youngbloods Imperial Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter - Baltic;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);(Bottle during RBWG) cloudy dark brown with dark tan bubbles.

Dogwood Youngbloods Imperial Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter - Baltic;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);"22 oz. bottle from TheBeerSommelier- thanks again, Matt! I think this was a 2004 vintage. Pours an opaque brown with no head. The aroma has some initial metallic notes, but beyond that is tobacco, charred wood, cola, and a lot of dark chocolate. Flavor of roasted malts, cola, charred wood, dark chocolate, and molasses. Nice. Light-medium bodied, with low carbonation and a smooth, roasty mouthfeel. Not bad at all; I can vouch that STLWill liked it a lot, too."
Dogwood Youngbloods Imperial Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter - Baltic;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle as shown. Pours a dark brown with a small quickly diminishing tan head.

Good, but was probably better a few years ago.
Draught House Hop Scotch Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Holy heck, the aftertaste is still on my tongue--and I drank this last night. Pours very dark & is served in a weizen glass. Smells of roasted malt and nuts and initial taste is very good, and tastes as such. The finish is very long. It leaves a metallic (almost chalky) taste in the mouth. Bitter, salty tasting hops makes you salivate while you�re drinking it.
Draught House Hop Scotch Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Draught House Pub & Brewery;"Pour is dark coppery amber with a thin skin of a tan head (again, due to the bartender)...smell is sweet at first with lots of toasty maltiness, but that turns a little ""foresty"" with lots of ""foresty smells"" like pine, other trees, light smokiness...taste is not has sweet as the smell...more hoppy than it smelled...light sweetness from alcohol, but mildly hot...not overpoweringly so...just a strong soapy bitterness...I don�t see how this is 9%...finish is strongly bitter..."
Draught House Hop Scotch Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Pours a beautiful dark color with a nice complex malt aroma.

Draught House Hop Scotch Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Draught House Pub & Brewery;I�ve had this on nitro and on Co2 and honestly the nitrogen kills all of the maltiness this bad boy has to offer. POured into a weizen it looks like deep dark darth vader juice. Thick and sloppy. Nice dark head. Smell is so quaffable I almost don�t drink the beer. Notes of caramel, vodka, juniper, elderberry, and scottish soil. Flavors are even more rich, as the mouthfeel rounds out all of what the nose has to offer. I love this brew with a passion and if you ever see it again you must have it. G-rat
Harveys Tom Paine Original Brown Ale;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Harveys Brewery;Dark fruit aromas. Dark brown/mahogany color with a decent tan head.

Harveys Tom Paine Original Brown Ale;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Harveys Brewery;Bottle... Clear crimson ale with a tiny, creamy, lightly tanned head. Nutty, earthy aroma. Sweet, port-like esters with mild chocolate. Medium-bodied with faint carbonation. Mid-length, sweet, vinous finish.
Harveys Tom Paine Original Brown Ale;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Harveys Brewery;Sample at AleFest Dayton: Dark brown color with a nil off-white head and very little lacing. Aroma of molasses and sweet malt. Medium-bodied and smooth with a mild malt and nut flavor, with a bit of stale coffee. The finish is short and soft with a roasted malt and tart fruit aftertaste. Pretty average.
Great Lakes Thai-1-On;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Bright yellow with a thin film of white head on top. Spicy hefeweizen aroma of bready yeast and banana phenols, but with the twist of the lemongrass. It works well on the aroma, it works a little less well but still OK on the flavor. I�d chalk that out to the ginger, which just doesn�t mesh well with the hefeweizen base beer.
Great Lakes Owens Olympic Pilsener;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Nice golden clear color and a pretty fat sticky head. Like Drew said, it has a really fresh hoppy aroma. Smooth bodied, with a nice touch bready malt. Not as bitter as the Barrel Select Pils. Very nice seasonal brew, I hope they continue to produce it here and there.
Great Lakes Owens Olympic Pilsener;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"Deep golden color, white head, good lacing. Smells ""fresh"" - lightly hoppy, bready. Smooth bodied - hey they served this at a nice temperature! I get so used to beer being served ice cold that this comes as quite a shock! Sweet bready biscuit maltiness with a decent hop finish - dry and crisp. (At the pub - 8/5/2004)"
Traverse Prospero IPA;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;IPA;Traverse Brewing;Draft at Traverse Brewing. Small white head and fine-medium sized bubbles that completely dissipated. Somewhat cloudy, uncarbonated and a yellow hue. Malty and hoppy aroma and the flavor mimicked the aroma. Tingly mouthfeel, medium bodied and good lacing.
Traverse Prospero IPA;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;IPA;Traverse Brewing;This draft brew from the brewery poured a medium sized head of finely sized white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lacing. The body was uncarbonated transparent and orange in color. The aroma was mildly hoppy and skunky. The mouth feel was tingly and mild with a hoppy feeling to it that mellowed in the finish. It had a malt hop flavor.
Traverse Prospero IPA;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;IPA;Traverse Brewing;draft at 2004 MSBF. average head, lasts the whole glass. good lacing, amber color. phenomenal aroma of hops and balanced malt. average body/mouthfeel, which was a letdown after such a beautiful aroma.

Piast Mocne;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Carlsberg Polska;Butelka 0,5 litra. Pite bardzo dawno i bardzo dawno nie powtarzane, st�d brak szczeg��w recenzji.
Piast Mocne;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Carlsberg Polska;Dieses Bier ist einmal farblich nicht passend: es ist eher bernsteinfarben als dunkel. Auch der Geschmack erinnert eher an einen Doppelbock als an ein Dunkles. Auch wenn das vielleicht gewollt ist, passt es auch nicht als Bockbier. Einfach nur abstrus und ungut.
Piast Mocne;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Carlsberg Polska;As usual strong, tough, hard with lots of malt, some earth and lots of alcohol. Fast brewed, fast drunken.
Piast Mocne;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Carlsberg Polska;Can from the Polish shop opposite The Barum Top Inn, Halifax. Pale gold with no head. It certainly hides its strength, but its taste remains bland and unexciting regardless.
Great Waters Oatmeal Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Waters Brewing;Pours an exceptionally dark brown color with a good two inches of creamy tan foam. Thick foam clings momentarily to the sides of the glass throughout the pint, but never sticks to the glass, it just slides right back down. Mildly roasty and even somewhat fruity aroma. Flavors include moderately roasted malt and some coffee, with a dry chocolatey aftertaste. Medium-full bodied, very smooth, and gently carbonated. The beer has a pleasant, slick, and almost oily mouthhfeel, which may explain the foam sliding back down into the glass after each sip.
Great Waters Oatmeal Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Waters Brewing;GW normally has this on cask, but they had it on keg when i was there, and it was the best oatmeal stout i had drank! I dont like cask beers, so i was glad to hear i could get this in a tall COLD pint. Black as night, with a head you could stand a fork in. I did have another pint, which was more watery, not sure why.
Great Waters Oatmeal Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Waters Brewing;On cask at the brewpub: Deeply dark varnishish brown, puffy thick tannish, dusty yellowed head about a finger high. Lacing spotty and whispy. Aroma is mostly chocolate with some barley flake and oat flake sweetness, bits of alcoholic tinges with a light roasty quality over the top. Flavors are nice but not lasting long unfortunately. Warm and milk chocolatey, mild sweetness overall with the oats and malts. It would be nice to see it last for a while on the palate before its leaves. Its far too short for thorough enjoyment. But the warm creamy medium body is quite quenchable non-the-less. Big time smoothness and semi-rich. Slices of warmth and roast mingle more so towards the finish and keeps a mild chocolate tone throughout. This was easily drinkable and mildly smooth in character. On cask, its actually quite good. I just needed more length in the flavor department, and some of the alcoholic warming gets in the way for me too, otherwise this is mighty nice stuff.
Great Waters Oatmeal Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Arrives a very black color with a frothy, tan head. Aroma of chocolate oatmeal. Mmmm... the taste is more of the same. Good malt presence. It is a sweet stout, but not overly so. Very smooth mouthfeel and a touch on the watery side. Tasty!
Codys Export;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;500ml can from Malta. It has light hoppy and yeastly taste (hay, paper?). Some malt help the equlibrium. Not good, it is correct.

Codys Export;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;Horrible stuff. Turpentine and chemicals. Pours golden. Pasty kind of cloying aftertaste. Can in Malta.
Codys Export;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;Actually decent caramel maltiness, bit luscious though, some grassy hops. Moderate sweetness with light bitterness. Drinkable

Baltika Zhigulevskoe (Zhiguljovskoje);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);20/11/18. After a tiring day, I decided to try this beer. 470 ml, 4% vol. Gold colour, aroma and taste are almost average. Nothing special but it's refreshing.
Baltika Zhigulevskoe (Zhiguljovskoje);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);0,47 l Aroma kuruze i slada, boja kamilice, pjena solidna.. okus slabo gorak i slabo zasladjen, metalni aftertaste.. ispodprosjecno..
Baltika Zhigulevskoe (Zhiguljovskoje);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Irgendwie findet amn �berall in der ehemaligen Sowjetunion ein Bier das Zhygulevckoye oder Zhyhulivske, je nach Sprache, hei�t. Auch ist es schwer herauszufinden, welches jetzt das Original ist und was in Lizenz gebraut wird. Aber dieses Bier ist jenes, das ich am �ftesten gefunden habe, sei es in Russland, Aserbaidschan, Georgien oder der Ukraine. Es ist ein klassisches Helles, das aber einen s�ffigen Hintergrund hat. Sicher f�r den verw�hnten Mitteleurop�er zu fad, aber doch trinkbar.
Baltika Zhigulevskoe (Zhiguljovskoje);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Can. Pours clear golden with medium white head. Aroma is cookies, some hay, malts, cereals, dust. Taste is light, cookies, some malts, rice, watery. Drinkable beer!
Sarmat Premium;Donetsk, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Bottled. Pale golden, no head. papery pear aroma. Dryish and salty with clean mouthfeel. Rather bitter finish. Feels industrial.
Sarmat Premium;Donetsk, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Had this at a couple places in Ukraine. Has a slight bready aroma with some touch of medicinal quality and a touch of skunk. The taste is a typical light lager. Nothing to get excited about.
Sarmat Premium;Donetsk, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;Sampled in an untitled bar in Izmail, Ukraine. Golden, aroma of biscuits and herbs, taste of sweet malt and gentle hops.
Oakwell Ginger Tom;Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oakwell Brewery;Cask at pride of Spitalfields. An amber bitter, fairly light with some hoppiness, pleasant medium strength bitter, nothing outstanding but preferrable to the Barnsley Bitter.
Sail & Anchor Laughing Cow L.V.Q.;Fremantle, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Sail & Anchor Brewery;Dark golden almost tawny brown body with a compact but lasting white head. Malt aroma, beefy, vegemite, bonox and dusty. Zesty taste with a touch of caramel, cinnamon, cloves and brown sugar. Of the 2 new beers tried at the brewery this was the better one.
Sail & Anchor Old Smokey Lager;Fremantle, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Sail & Anchor Brewery;Golden body with a medium size white head. Not much in the aroma department, maybe some smoked bacon. Late taste of smoked ham, greasy and a hint of ginger, not much else, otherwise just a straightforward lager.
Carlton W.A. Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Wasn�t expecting much from a beer deemed to recreate the Swan Gold beer once brewed by the Swan brewery. Swan Gold wasn�t much to sing about, and this wasn�t much better. Tasted from the can into a stein glass. Clear lightest amber-gold body with �soda stream� carbonation raising up a thin, soapy off-white head. The head became dense after a minute or so, retained for the length and left globs of lace down the glass. Typical, late Friday night bar-mat pong for an aroma, with hints of sweaty sock and metallic bittering hops. Thinly watery in the mouth, soft in carbonation and a lot cleaner than the aroma. Flavours of lightly toasted malt seemed evident amongst the cardboard and soapy bathwater mix before a lightly bitter and metallic finish. An odd hint of parsley came in halfway through drinking, as it seemed to morph as it warmed. Even more odd, it was easy to drink with each character cancelling the next. Not bad, not good!!! (375mL, BBE10/05)
Carlton W.A. Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Again, I tried this one while up in the East Kimberley. And again I was prepared for the worst, as this is another beer that is available in cans only (a virtual guarentee that this is a crap product). But I was a little surprised really-- deep gold with a decent head that actually left some lacy rings down my glass (I swear to God). Tinny aroma, but not a bad palate for a canned bread-and-butter pale lager. I�ve had much worse.
Carlton W.A. Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);worse than i thought. has that taste familiar to all cub beer. watery and grassy tasting, with the typical sickly sweetness that a lot of low/alc beer has.
Carlton W.A. Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);This is a blatant take off of the old Swan Gold by Swan Brewery. It is brewed by their rival Carlton at their W.A. brewery. It even tastes similar to the Swan gold of old. Coppery golden colour with a fluffy white head. Slight hoppy nose, Light malt taste followed by a trace of bitterness, very light in body and a chalky finish. Head was mainly lasting and left some lacing, also some vanilla and lemon in the taste. Flavoured water!
Stadin Kes� Ale;Helsinki, Finland;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stadin Panimo;(Tapped @ Pikkulintu, Helsinki) Hazy dark orange color with medium, lacy head. Fresh and hoppy, slightly plasticky-waxy aroma. Quite flowery-hoppy, slightly sour and spicy flavor. Medium-bodied palate with quite high but balanced carbonation. A very decent and refreshing summer ale. I'm not sure if it's a Golden Ale or American Pale Ale, but as it was quite hoppy and flowery, I chose the latter. The brewery doesn't say much on the subject.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Simple und nicht ann�hernd inspirierendes Piwo ohne gro�e Punkte. Recht trinkbar, aber im Grunde aromen- und ideen los. Vielleicht etwas Getreide und Malz - das war es dann auch schon.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Beer pours out of the bottle in a clear light golden colour with low head and thin body. Aroma of straw and grains. Taste of mild hops, light malt, caramel, sugar and leaves. Watery and thin finish. Average and boring.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Bottle. Golden yellow color. Small head, disappears quickly. Metallic notes in aroma, faint hops. Malty flavor with mild hoppy ending.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Nach 3 Tagen Bierabstinenz durch einen Erk�ltung nun endlich wieder das feine Gebr�u, fruchtig-frischer Geruch bietet dieser russiche Kamerad. S��er, dann herber Antrunk, bei dem der Alkohol durchzudringen scheint. Malzig, weiter etwas s��licher Mittelteil, der Hopfen wirkt hier etwas penetrant. Der Nachgeschmack ist zuerst w�ssrig, dann setzt ein etwas komischer Geschmack ein, penetrant, etwas malzig, billiger Hopfen, komisch. Geht so. Test vom 14.3.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 7,7,7,4,4,6 - 6,00
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;A typcial mass produced brew. This is more flavorful brew than your typical mass produced brew. The flavor is slightly tart and grainy. Otherwise, it is not too bad.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;lemony aroma clear gold appearance thin head. Decent body, lemony taste with a grainy finish.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Had this with the Philly chapter of the Devonshire Knights. Pour similar to the regular Lager, pale yellow, small head kind of fizzy. Mix of corn and grains with hops thrown in. Dry finish with a little bitterness. Ok but not a drinker for me.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;500ml bottle (Rimi, Tallinn) Pale yellow, dishwater head. Slightly sweet plasticky lager aroma. Not too fizzy, which is nice from a bottled lager - rare to give such a beast 3, to be honest. One initial kick of something reminiscent of some sweetie I used to eat when I was a kid, and a hint of alcohol, but after that, it mellows down to be quite drinkable. It�s more malt oriented than many cheap pale lagers, which means that there�s not so much of the nasty cheap hop extract. Slips down pretty OK for a while. The slightly tacky drying late finish stops it from being something I�d want to drink a second pint of though.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Bottle. Pours a clear yellow colour, short head. Aroma and flavour of some malt, grains a and some caramel. Simple.
Stary Melnik Klassicheskoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Bottle from nestalgia. Utterly disgusting in every way. Aroma is metalic cardboard, alcohol, skunky grainy mess, honestly one of the poorest iv ever had. Taste is similarly awful, i couldnt drink it as hard as i tryed to, 2/3rds went down the drain, and thats very very rare with me.
Distelh�user Landbier;Tauberbischofsheim, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Distelh�user Brauerei Tauberbischofsheim;500 ml bottle. (Heinrichs) Kornwestheim, Germany. Enjoyed on Jul 13, 2019. Clear amber color with a big light tan head. Malt, bread, caramel and some sweetness in the aroma. The flavor is quite the same. Rotbier says the label. That�s quite accurate. All the red beers are quite challenging for me.

Deep coperish amber colour small white lacing with amazing retnetion. Nose is light caramell. Taste is low bitternes low sweetness. Thin but not watery body.

The Brew Kettle Vienna Lager;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Brew Kettle;Tap. Pours clear deep amber, medium beige head, decent lacing. Aroma is caramel, bread, nutty. Flavor is rich and malty, clean, medium sweet, little bitterness. Medium body. Solid.
The Brew Kettle Vienna Lager;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Brew Kettle;Holy cow this is amazing, essentially the platonic form of Vienna lager. Clean, malty, moderately dry. Insanely delicious and drinkable. Perfectly executed.
The Brew Kettle Vienna Lager;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Brew Kettle;Pint at Fourth Street Patio on 5/17/13. Clear amber pour with a thin off-white head.

The Brew Kettle Vienna Lager;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Brew Kettle;Sample at The Pint Room.

Light-bodied with flavors of grassy hops, caramel malt and grain. The finish is sweet with a short malty aftertaste. Slightly above average overall.
The Brew Kettle Vienna Lager;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Brew Kettle;Bomber Bottle from Brew Kettle. Poured clear amber color with a moderate frothy white head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Moderate sweet hoppy aroma. Medium body with a slick texture. Medium biitersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Drinkable smooth brew.
The Brew Kettle Vienna Lager;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Brew Kettle;"Bottle: Light amber w/ a lasting, frothy, pillowy off white head. Heavy bready malt with hints of toasty and caramel malts. Also a little herbal hop. Flavor is well balanced, but has a little too much hop dominant flavor and bitterness to be a classic Vienna. Toasty malt flavor behind all the hops; clean. Finish is bitter and hop flavored. Aftertast is of hop and a little caramel. M/f is dry, lighter body, higher carbonation. Seems to me like this would be more of an American Vienna lager instead of a true classic Vienna. Good beer, just a little over hopped for my expectations."

Cornish Scrumpy Medium Sweet;Truro, Cornwall, England;Apple Cider;The Cornish Cyder Farm;wow ill never drink that again. Too strong, too sweet, too much cider. IT was a mistake to drink this and i shall never drink cider again. I hate apples. The smell of cider reminds me of this time in a cinema there was a passed out homeless drunk asleep behind where i was sitting. He reeked of cider, and thus i think cider smells like homeless men.
Cornish Scrumpy Medium Sweet;Truro, Cornwall, England;Apple Cider;The Cornish Cyder Farm;really strong tasting cider where after a few pints you�ll be wondering if you can stand up properly. Not as sweet as most ciders out there and probably harder to find.
Cornish Scrumpy Medium Sweet;Truro, Cornwall, England;Apple Cider;The Cornish Cyder Farm;Glass jug - a nice sour apple aroma. Clear pale yellow color.

t Hartje;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Graal;Fruity nose, white grape. Clear gold-orange color with a low but tight head. Heavy on the candy sugar side of things, but balanced with other flavors: some vanilla, orange and a little spice. Leaves a dollop of syrup-like sweetness on the lips. Fat profile and all around a very good, interesting beer. Like it!
t Hartje;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Graal;Meet the two brewers at the belgianbeerweekend before I drunk it actually at Delirium cafe.Nice young guys - reminded me of JacovL�wenherz .-) and the little Hobbit from Denmark (you guys should go into the brewbusiness). Ok enough blahblah: The beer has a nice orange color. The nose is orange, cobbweb. Tast is cloves, I would say passion fruit, kind of peppery, spicey in the end. Very interesting beer. Liked it!
t Hartje;Brakel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Graal;Bottled: Hazy orange. Not much head. Flowers, fruitnotes and spices in the aroma. Flavour dosn�t live up to the aroma. Malts, some spices and alcahol is present. Alcahol a little too dominant for my likings in the end.

Very superb fruity (sweet white grapes) taste, white candi sugar; sweet but delicate acidic-fruity aromas, and esters from the yeast. Full-bodied, alcoholburn, dry. Great!

Tucks Red Rye Lager;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tuck's Brewery;On tap at Tuck�s in Portland, OR--Poured a thick copper color with a white head. Sweet caramel malty nose with a spicy lager scent. Fruity and robust. Pretty good.
Tucks Red Rye Lager;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tuck's Brewery;Pours a deep copper color, very clear, with a slightly off-white head. This brew has a nice blend of sweet caramael maltiness up front which blends nicely with the rye and finishes with a well hopped finish. The lagering tried to keep this very clean, but the fruitiness of the rye gave it more of an ale taste.

Hecks Farmhouse Medium Cider;Street, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Hecks Farmhouse Cider;Sampled from bottle shared with some random strangers (and they payed, nice haha, thanks!) @ Drinkers Pub, Eindhoven. Hazy a bit pale yellow golden color, virtually no head. Smell and taste remind me of the peel of overripe, shrinked apples. And too sweet. At the same time some pear and floral influences come through. Medium dry finish indeed. Meh, not one of my favourites.

Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;473ml can pours a light brown color with a 2 finger white head that settles to some thin spotty lacing. Aroma is light caramel and floral hops. Taste is light caramel malt sweetness with some nuttiness and a light hoppy bitter finish. A smooth easy drinking beer that is much better than I anticipated it would be.
Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;"Originally rated February 2006. Pours a deep amber colour with a slight off-white creamy head. Mildly carbonated and good lace. The nose reminds me of almost every other Steelback; a mix of floral, nuts and caramel scents. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Flavours start off mixed between nutty and mild sweetness and finishes with a light bitterness and hint of alcohol. Quite pleasant and easy drinking. Definitely, one of the best Steelback brews."

Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;[1296-20080415] 710mL can. Honey grains aroma has toasted malt and peat notes.

Grainy pebbly creek water aroma has a bit of straw alcohol. Clear, dark amber orange body with a medium-lasting foamy off-white head. Flavour of grainy alcohol middle notes and a sweet straw finish. Watery medium body. Not exactly pleasant but not too offensive either. (4/3/4/2/8) 2.1
Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;710mL tub can from the brewer�s retail that I had to go through a lot to get. Episode VI in my adventures with Steelback. This one poured a nice reddish amber with a large rocky beige head. Aroma is not much beyond weird Steelbackness, bad malts, no hops, chemicals. Flavour is alright, by old Steelback standards. I can actually taste some malt in this one! Maybe a touch of soap, not much honey, except for some mild sweetness in the finish and aftertaste that I guess could be loosly related to the honey. In Steelback�s credit, this is a beer that could be seriously gross and undrinkable, but I�m finding it alright on this fine Canada Day 2008. My only major problem with it is that it�s not weird or crappy enough for me to write a really bizarrely scripted rating! Haha.
Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;I love the deisgn of all of their cans. Poured a clear copper color with a white head. Toasted honey malt aroma. The flavor also had some notes of honey. Light body.
Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;Can from HTH. Lightly sweet aroma, a touch of malt, honey. Not offensive, at all, though not good. Clean, clear flavor, no yeast or hops at all, only pale malt extract, but really not bad at all. Not very bad to drink, though at least its not bad. Drinkable enough. Good to finish a tasting with.
Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;Here we go - 710ml can, my first Steelback: Man, it�s a large can! huge frothy white head on an orange highly carbonated body. Very mild honey hop with a dash of mown grass aroma. Aggghhh WTF was that? Horrific synthetic honey flavour with a big sour sugar finish. Shudder.
Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;710ml can from HogTownHarry - thanks! Clear honey pour with a pillowy off white head. As par for the course with Steelbacks, very well carbonated. Honey and graham cracker nose, sweet malt and caramel. Bread and honey flavors, some cereal and floral hop. Still a tinge of medicinal crap in the finish, but not too bad.
Steelback Tiverton Bear Honey Brown;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Steelback Brewery;"710ml can I don�t actually think of Steelback as a brewery. It�s probably because they seem more like a factory that churns out imitation beer, and hopes you don�t notice the difference. Nonetheless, this is as beery as Steelback gets. Nice golden-brown colour, small head with some lacing. Soapy taste dominates up front, as usual with Steelback, but it�s better than their former ""Wow-it�s-corn"" signature. After this, it�s the honey that hits you, at the tip of the tongue, and then some malts. Not a great beer, but for Steelback, it�s okay, and that�s something of a triumph."
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;"Originally rated January 2006. ""A link to great taste""... oh yeah ! Pours a nice clear golden-amber clour with not much head. Just a bit of foam, that is it. Their usual homebrew dirty lace is there, all over. Very pleasant floral and grainy smell. Very, very light carbonation and a flat mouthfeel. As for most light beers, this one is no exception... light taste. Mild caramel and fruits. Not a bad brew, specially for a light one, but if this is a light version of Chain, I�d rather stick with that one (being my next review)."
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;710ml can from HogTownHarry - thanks! Clear straw with a massive, sticky white head.Light pale malt aroma. Oh GOD, flavor is BAD. An initial sweet graininess is quickly replaced with something weird and plastic... dry, chemical, not quite peppery finish. I got 3 sips into this one, and down the sink she went...
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;710 steeltub. pale yellow with a fizzy white head. adjuct and plastic nose. almost no flavour but whats there isnt good. watery feel to it. poor.
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Pale lagerish looking, lots of foam.

Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Huge can shared by Puzzl. Pours a light gold with a thin diminshing head. Aroma is corn grits, slight metallic, dms, vege, steamed corn, rice solids and stale white wine. Flavor has some acetaldehyde gren apple and dms gritty corn with an artificial sweetness.
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Can shared by puzzl. Aroma is pretty non-offensive. Light pale malt. Straw and a bit of corn. In general it�s pretty clean and refreshing. Non-descript, but non-poor. It�s almost a shame that steelback has risen to mediocrity from their former place in the basement of crapitude
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Can shared by puzzl. Pale golden with a fading white film. Some adjunct in the aroma of corn and rice. Sweet flavor with a fizzy body and no hop character. Papery, adjunct ridden, corn, a mess. No bitterness.
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;710ml can. Old school. This has been sitting in my closet for over a year, courtesy of HogTownHarry. Sweet!. Pour is very piss yellow. So much corn in the aroma, but its actually not THAT offensive. Cream spinach, too. Thin, skunky flavor, easy drinking I guess, but still with big carb. I could see frat boys drinking this no problem.
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Bottle from the relaunched Steelback. Clear, bright golden with a large white head that shrinks pretty quickly. Aroma is light and faintly sweet, with grainy malts and some actual hints of hops. Flavour follows - light but pleasant maltiness to start, and a surprising tingle of hops in the finish. Not something I�d drink everyday, but for a light beer from a brewery with a history like Steelback�s, this is a pretty impressive effort.
Steelback Light (Link);Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;710mL Tub can that I had to go through a lot to get. So my comic mis-adventures with Steelback continue. Episode VII: Link. Pours an empty, souless looking pale yellow, with a huge rocky, white head. Smells like, the sour broken dreams of a once quasi-successful juice-baron, which smells a lot like crappy pale malts and a stick of straw, oddly enough. Tastes like, a fermented version of D�Angelo apple juice, minus most of the flavour. Bland. Empty. Without redeeming quality. Nothing to even rate. Only an unpleasant chemical kick in the finish that simpy begs for an answer to the timeless rhetorical question: why? The marketing slogan makes little sense, as is the way of the Steelback. &quotA European style light lager...&quot? I thought light beers were a distinctly American thing? Maybe the confusion is an intentional deception? I can�t even marvel at the astounding crappiness of this one, because there is nothing here. Is the glass half empty, or half full? Neither, it�s full of a liquid that in and of itself is empty. Think about it. The most depressing thing about this beer, is that as it warms, the fading voice of a single hop bud can be heard, desperate for a rescue that just won�t come......
Scotch Irish 1900 Smoked Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kichesippi Beer Company;"hate when people describe smoked beers as smelling like ""bacon"" or ""ham"", but even I would be guilty here. hazy amber, no head. huge smoky aroma with notes of campfire. makes schlenkerla look like raftman. a bit of sweetness and big ""brothy"" mouthfeel. would probably be great to cook with."
Scotch Irish 1900 Smoked Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kichesippi Beer Company;I haven�t had many bold smoked ales in my life and this one would be one of those. Aroma traditional to Potato Day when scouts and other kids go on field (late fall) to celebrate Potato Day (in Poland). We put raw potato in wood fire and wait till fire ends. At the end you got well burnt smoked potato with aroma very close to this ale. Ash, charcoal, malt and touch of hop. Flavour follows faithfully aroma to the extreme in this case. Lovers of wood smoked produce will be happy. Less meaty smoke that is characteristical with many other smoked beers. I can say I love it nor hate it. For sure it as a special brew.
Scotch Irish 1900 Smoked Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kichesippi Beer Company;Smokey, woody and meaty. Deep amber, slim tan head. Smoke, peat and single malt flavours, very full bodied. Very impressive Perry!
Scotch Irish 1900 Smoked Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kichesippi Beer Company;Slightly cloudy medium-dark orange-amber w/ light tan head. Very smokey, very hickory, campfire-like aroma (reminds me of the cottage). Medium feel. Flavour is mostly smoke & hickory w/ notes of caramel & vanilla. Unfortunately, there was also an unpleasant wet ash quality that developed on the palate. Note as successful an experiment as the Major Misconduct, but a venerable effort nonetheless.
Scotch Irish 1900 Smoked Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kichesippi Beer Company;Huge campfire smokey aroma. Fairly complex hickory notes. Slightly hazy orange amber body with a smallish white head. Smokey hickory dominates the flavour, with a long lingering bitterness, with some malt skulking around in the background. Palate is pretty decent and suits the beer nicely. Overall smoked beer is not for me (smoked anything really) but if you are a fan of things like Schlenkerla you missed out on the best smoked beer I have ever had!

Scotch Irish Elder Statesman;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Pours light gold/amber with a quickly disipating white head. Light flowery aroma with toasted grain aroma. Some hop bitterness. Herbal notes. Earthy malts. Dry roasty finish. Tastey.
Scotch Irish Elder Statesman;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;On cask @ the TO beer festival. Appears cloudy, like a hefeweizen but orangey. Great floral/pine taste and resiny mouthfeel. Too bad it was a festival one off.
Scotch Irish Elder Statesman;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Sampled at the Toronto Festival Of Beer 2004. Hazy golden colour with no head. Appetizing floral aroma, very nice. Very still body, even for a cask ale, and the body seemed a little weak at first, but it really filled out as the beer warmed. Very refreshing flavour - the elderflowers and Golding hops seem to be a perfect match. As with the Dogsbody, Perry proves that lower alcohol doesn�t have to mean lower flavour.
Scotch Irish Elder Statesman;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;elderberries added for taste. English hops. Good water. Light on hops and very light mouthfeel. Very low alcohol.
Scotch Irish Elder Statesman;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Slightly hazy orange amber body. Smallish white head. Interesting aroma, bit of floral hops and a subtle... something. Presumably the elderflowers. Flavour starts out very subtle and leaves a long mild bitterness that sticks with you for a bit with the ocassional mouth puckering hoppy kick. Intriguing. Palate is light, and my sample was on the still side. Seems to fit the beer nicely as a thirst quencher but some more carbonation would be nice, even for a cask.

Eastwood & Sanders Up The Kriek;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elland Brewery;Whilst this this sounded intriguing, it didn�t really come off for me. Murky brown colour. There was a whiff of sulphur in the aroma, but my main problem was that I couldn�t really discern any significant kriek character whatsoever. There was certainly no cherry flavour leaping out. Mildly sour, with a woody, dried up finish. Drinkable, but there�s not much to grab the attention. A brave experiment but, ultimately, not very convincing. Cask (gravity), GBBF 2004.
Eastwood & Sanders Up The Kriek;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elland Brewery;Cask@GBBF04�. Not much fruit at all for a cherry beer. Quite dry and tart in the end, but to be honest there wasn�t much flavour, or much happening at all with this beer.

Sch�nramer Original Altbayrisch Dunkel;Petting/Sch�nram, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Private Landbrauerei Sch�nram;Bottle from Edeka. Crystal clear brown with a nice head. Nose is lightly roasted grains 'n' caramel - Golden Grahams anyone? Flavor has a great caramel intensity but doesn't seem to be so sweet, therefore it's not too heavy, which is a good mix for a Dunkel if you ask me. This is exactly what my Dad likes when he visits over here - would be great to find it exported to Virginia, USA. Drinkability: high.
Sch�nramer Original Altbayrisch Dunkel;Petting/Sch�nram, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Private Landbrauerei Sch�nram;Bottle (BB July 12, 2019). Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is medium brown. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted bread, hazelnuts, caramel), lightly hoppy (herbs), with a light note of marmalade. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Pretty simple and straightforward. No flaws but a bit ordinary. Near the end of its BB date though (and thus admittedly too old for a style like this)...possibly better when fresh.

Flavor is light malt giving a honey note and a little nuttiness backed by a light bitterness and hop spice. In the aftertaste the sweetness comes in a little more and finishes somewhat clean. Overall it's a nice easy drinking brew.

Steelback Red;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;473ml can pours a pale amber color with a 2 finger bubbly head that settles quickly to some thin spotty lacing. Aroma is cereal grains and grassy hops. Taste is light malty sweetness with a moderate hoppy bitter finish. Just another cheap tasting lager.
Steelback Red;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Originally rated October 2005. Pours a light amber colour with a big white foamy head. Also mildly-creamy, the head has amazing retention and the foamy patch lace is everywhere. Medium carbonation made of tiny bubbles. The nose is malty with a touch of alcohol. Starts with a slight sweet and smooth taste, then lands into a world of bitterness for the finish. Mild alcohol comes out in the aftertaste. Pretty decent vienna, also known as, the beer S8n and I chugged before getting drenched in fake blood at a Gwar show. Got the job done.
Steelback Red;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;"***review from Feb 9, 2007*** Uncerimoniously dumped into my glass. The large rocky, rice crispy sounding white head resembled foam on a rough lake. Died quickly. Icky looking amber beer that is no where near to being clear. Aromas of sweetness (not overdone), corn, some malts and some other stuff with some wheat. Taste is acceptable enough even though it is a bit on the weak side. I don�t find anything offensive here. Funny, I�m not actually sure what flavour it is because there is flavour - it�s just bland. Slight malts, slight alcohol and slight flavour. Light bodied, somewhat smooth with a big carbonated swish. Leaves my mouth a bit dry. There is some mild bitterness (sometimes it�s a sharp short lived bitterness) and a slight acidy feel. Did I get a good can? This stuff isn�t as bad as everyone says. It�s swill though - don�t forget that. ""Premium Canadian Beer"" my ass. I did drink the entire 710ml can in while typing this."
Steelback Red;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Poured a clear gold color with a small white head. Dirty malt aroma with a light sweet fruit note to it. Sweet malt front to back. Mild bitterness on the finish. Light body.
Steelback Red;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Can from HogtownHarry. Once again, I fail to be disgusted, and that is disappointing. Drank in the middle of a tasting, this is a decent palate cleanser. Lightly bready, hoppy, clean, I�m almost embarrassed to rate this as high as I am.

Steelback Red;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;another kickass steelback product, tastes better than buck a beers and has that extra bit of alcohol. i dont know why it says its different from steelback silver its prettymuch the same, one of the greats for just drinking to get drunk, epsecially the perfect, manly sized can
Steelback Red;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;"710ml can from HogTownHarry - thanks! I�m assuming this is listed as ""red"" due to the packaging - a red it ain�t. Clear gold with a big white head that descends rockily. Looks really nice. Then you smell it - a corny, husky, chemically mess. The flavor is more of the same, with a distinct tinny bite, creamed corn over ass. The worst part, IMO, is the finish - it leaves what feels like a dry, metal particulate coating. Lovely."

Aroma of of corn and sour grassy bread. Biting carbonation with a thin, somewhat watery feel. Tastes a little bland. Sour and metallic with a bit of a hoppy finish. Boring and not that great.
Steelback Red;Tiverton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steelback Brewery;Bottle (glass). Appearance leans closer to brass than red. Shy aroma features nuances of cherry and malt. Flavour begins with a nice burst of quality malt, leading to a bitterness that feels equal parts tasty hops and rough ethanol. Good for the price-point but lacks refinement.

Willoughby Rapier Wit;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Willoughby Brewing Co.;dark golden with mild hed for style. low carbonation for style. little bitterness before heavy orange flavor with relative paucity of lemon or coriander notes. problem is the finish is not dry enough, not making this a refreshing version of the style. not bad though
Willoughby Rapier Wit;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Willoughby Brewing Co.;"On tap at brewpub My first pint during happy hour was this Belgian wit. Not bad coming from a brewery which is just beginning to adjust to a new head brewer it is overall just above average. This also happens to be the first new rating in three years; maybe they have done some adjustments in the meantime. If you are in the area give it a try - at $2.50 you are not out much. Aroma / Appearance - The hazy golden body and carbonation yields yeasty lemon zest, minty cough drops, honey drizzled white toast, and other aspects that remind me of a Belgian pale ale. Flavor / Palate - Tart sourdough, bread with a sprinkling of lemon zest, honey, and yeast come and go quickly. Fading fast this might be a good sessionable option; finishing a growler might not be too much of a challenge."

Willoughby Rapier Wit;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Willoughby Brewing Co.;THis was the better of the 2 summer beers they offered this visit (7/05), the other being their Willoughby (American) Wheat.

Appearance is mashed-banana yellow with a small head. Aroma is sweet, but not chillingly sweet, and slightly fruity. Flavor is not super-typical witbier, but it�s obvious that that�s the style of this brew. A decent mouthfeel rounds this beer off nicely. Not my favorite style, but I must say this brew was impressive when I had it.

Rochester Mills Rochester Red Ale;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rochester Mills Beer Company;This canned brew from a bottle shop poured a head of foamy auburn colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a softly carbonated transparent red brown colored body and a very good lacing. The weak aroma was malty. The semi-thick crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a lingering Irish red malt aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of Irish red malt and hops. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.
Rochester Mills Rochester Red Ale;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rochester Mills Beer Company;I would have enjoyed this beer if I had bought it at a party store with hundreds of choices, but my city�s local 4th of July carnival had a craft beer booth.

Rochester Mills Rochester Red Ale;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rochester Mills Beer Company;"Of all the beer styles out there, Irish Red seems to be one no one can agree one when it comes to defining it in terms of basic and niche parameters. Seems like you can make any red ale and call it an �Irish Red� and it�ll sell (especially around St. Patrick�s Day). Rochester Mills Rochester Red Ale is a whole lotta meh in all aspects: objective quality; taste; and style adherence. It�s not bad, but it�s definitely not good. I poured a 16oz can into a wine glass. It was canned on 9/5/15 and cost $2.99 ($0.19 per ounce). Appearance: Beautiful red wine-like hue (looks especially appropriate in this glass). Clear, but no carbonation to view. Pours to a small, off-white, soapy head which evaporates quickly and completely. Smell: Mild fruity character and a hint of sweetness. A trace of flowers. Clean, but far from appeasing. Taste: If I had to say whether this beer meets the criteria of an Irish Red, I�d reluctantly say yes. It does have the caramel and toffee flavors you want and expect of the style; the problem is they�re just entirely too weak. There are faint British-style malt notes in the form of dark fruit and marmalade toast, but that�s about it. Hops create for just slight bitterness. The fruity flavors are enjoyable � but only when I really look for them (I shouldn�t have to do that, they should be obvious). I will say there�s nothing off-putting about the beer, so it seems to be well-brewed (objectively speaking). This reminds me of something that would bear a Michelob or Blue Moon moniker. Drinkability: It doesn�t say on the can, but Rochester Mills� website indicates Rochester Red Ale has a potency of 5.9% ABV, which is actually quite strong. The delivery doesn�t seem that strong, though. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, but low in carbonation. And yet the actual texture feels a little watery. There�s no sticky sensation, but some dryness is evident. RATING: 5/10"

Walking Man Flip-Flop Pilsner;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Walking Man Brewing;(Draft: Walking Man Brewing & Public House in Stevenson, WA) The bartender seemed out of sorts when I tried to explain to her I was rating beers and wanted to just do a few at a time, and go from light to dark. She gave this to me after a few dark beers, so it�s tough to rate this one now. It has a grain and corn aroma, but not with a lot of hops. The flavor is the same, but with a nice hoppy bite. Light body, but very clean and crisp. Dark straw in color and fully clear. Very small white head immediately fades to a small ring. Good clean pilsner, probably average for the style I guess.
Walking Man Flip-Flop Pilsner;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Walking Man Brewing;Tap. Clear, golden in color with a smallish white head. Decent lacing. Aroma is spicey/earthy hops with a lightly roasted grain background. Lighter bodied. Big hops in flavor, somewhat drying. The most well hopped pilsener I have ever had, bordering on APA in IBU�s. Clean tasting. Nicely done, a bit out of style.

Blackwater Parsons Porter;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Porter;Blackwater Brewing Company;"on tap at the brewpub (2011); more of a light brown ale; brown color; a very light, easy drinking beer with a mild roasted malt flavor"
Blackwater Parsons Porter;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Porter;Blackwater Brewing Company;Tap @ Blackwater Brewing Co. (Davis, WV). Dark brown / black. Flavor has a sharp, lingering bitterness. More hop than malt. Not very balanced. Finishes with the slightest hint of roast. Lots of character, just in the wrong order for my palate. 25 Oct 09.
Blackwater Parsons Porter;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Porter;Blackwater Brewing Company;Smelled and tasted faintly of vinegar. The one good thing I can say about this beer is that it looked great with a nice DARK brown body and thick bone white head. It tasted just like the stout. It was watery and after two 20 ounce beers I felt absolutely no different. Just go up the road to Thomas where a good brewery is located. Also, avoid eating the food at this place as it is an insult to German and Italians alike.
Blackwater Parsons Porter;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Porter;Blackwater Brewing Company;Draft at brewery. Held up to the brilliantly setting sun, deep ruby red, thin head that did not last. Aroma of chocolate and caramel malts with mild hops. Taste is more of the same, with hops a little more forward. Moderate to light body with rich malt profile makes this a winner in my book
Blackwater Parsons Porter;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Porter;Blackwater Brewing Company;Draft at the restaurant / bar in Davis. Minimal head and subtle carbonation. Very dark brown. A delicious porter that was highlighted by a rich malty backbone. Not an overly full bodied porter - balanced quite nicely and finishes with a mild hoppy note. Chances are you�ll never be passing through Davis, WV but if you do stop in and try their selection.
Blackwater Parsons Porter;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Porter;Blackwater Brewing Company;On tap, from the source: Dark with light shallows and a light tan head. Carbonation is medium-low. Dark roast flavor dominates the beer and is accompanied by mellow hops. Smooth rich palate. Overall, quite good.
Thirsty Pagan Burntwood Black Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Pours clear black with brown highlights and a small, frothy beige head. Aroma is moderate chocolate grainy malt, light dark fruit notes and light earthy hops.

Thirsty Pagan Burntwood Black Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Draft. Dark brown/black with thin head. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, and brown sugar. Light/medium body, medium sweetness, light coffee, and some dark chocolate notes.
Thirsty Pagan Burntwood Black Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Completely still pour at Thirst Pagan. Opaque brown black. Nice rounded chocolate malt edges, caramel. The mouthfeel is the loser here. Uncarbonated? Kills it. Would be nice if...still nice somehow I guess.
Thirsty Pagan Burntwood Black Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;It seems evyone was wearing this t-shirt. Good, if a bit watery. Coffee, though more grounds than cup, a hint of chocolate, a hint of smoke. Ok, but don�t need again.
Thirsty Pagan Burntwood Black Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Has really nice scents of dark coffee grounds, minimal head on this beer. Taste is coffee up front then fades to a light chocolate roast. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Thirsty Pagan Burntwood Black Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Poured on-tap into a snifter A. Pours a dark black, 2mm off-white head that fell off quickly to a medium thick ring S. Semlls of very nice roasted coffee, mild chocolate and some hints of fruit. T. Tastes of dark choccolate, smoked well roasted coffee beans, thick smoke. M. Medium thin body, light carbonation, very chewy. The thick bold feeling stick around in your mouth for minutes afterwards. It�s as if you were chewing on bread. O. A decent brew. I think it�s a little confused on what it is. Is it a mildly thick coffee porter? Is it a thich and chewy smoked beer? Or is it a thin black ale? It seems to be mixed up between the three. It tastes pretty good and is interesting. It is on the thin side which is really it�s only big downfall. But it is a big one. Not something I would ever search out.
Thirsty Pagan Burntwood Black Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Tap at Thirsty Pagan on Nov. 17, 2011. Very dark brown pour with red highlights.

Thirsty Pagan Burntwood Black Ale;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;Small pour (approximately 3 oz.), on tap at Gitchee Gumee Brewfest in Superior, WI on 4-5-08. This was the tenth of 12 beers that I rated (out of about 20 total beers that I tried). I�m not sure what the proper classification of this beer is, but, as a lager, it shouldn�t be considered a schwarzbier. Pours a clear dark brown, but it�s not as dark as the name implies. Small amount of short-lasting beige head. The simple aroma is like that of coffee with cream. Burnt malt taste: Coffee and tar flavors. Tastes most like a dry stout, I suppose. This is not my kind of beer. Light body, undercarbonated. Forgettable palate effects.
Fort Collins Pilsner;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fort Collins Brewery;Extremely sweet gummy candy and hoppy sugar nose. Flavor is crisp with light sweet hoppiness. A very unique pils, and one that is quite tasty.
Fort Collins Pilsner;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fort Collins Brewery;This beer was had on tap at the Fort Collins brewery. This beer pours a very light yellow color with a big thick white head and a mild degree of carbonation. The aroma was wheaty and doughy but relatively mild. The flavor is slightly grassy and doughy with a definite bready finish. Dry, light and mild is the best way to describe this beer. Mild carbonation throughout, this could definitely be a decent summer beer, but nothing more than that.
Fort Collins Pilsner;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fort Collins Brewery;The FCB Pilsner poured a straw yellow with a fizzy white head that was quickly gone. There was not much aroma at all to it. What little there was, was a light grassiness. Its flavor was some fruitiness up front with a light bitter finish and a decent bitter aftertaste. It was a little on the thin side. Overall, I thought it was pretty bland and not too appealing. It was better than a macro, but not by much.
Odell Town Pump Pail Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Draft at BitterCreek. Nice looking beer, gentle hoppy aroma. Taste brings some caramel malts and butterscotch. Flavors bring it squarely into English style. Fast finish, almost had me , then it died on the palate.

Odell Town Pump Pail Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;"""Did seem more like a stronger bitter in it�s aroma and flavor than a pale or ipa. Spicy, lightly bitter, british leaning (not my thing) but solid for the style."""
Odell Town Pump Pail Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Draft sample at the brewery. Aroma is faint citrus and cereal. Taste is orange zest, lemongrass, grain, a bit of pepper. Light, easy drinking.
Odell Town Pump Pail Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;This is about as English and ale as you can expect from a hop heavy brewer like Odell. Restraint is the order of the day with this beer. Floral aromas, mild grassy hops, and bready malts.
Odell Town Pump Pail Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Growler from Odell�s. Appearance: golden-amber color, off-white head, good sized head, great lacing, a little cloudy. Aroma: citrus, floral, caramel, roast, resin. Palate: medium body, fizzy carbonation, somewhat thick texture, long bitter finish. Taste: sweet at start, smooth transition to hoppy bitterness for a second, then a really hoppy spike that is far from smooth, followed by a calm bitter finish. Overall, I like the beer excepting the weird hop spike halfway through the drink. Drinkable and refreshing, but not my favorite for style or for the brewery by any means.
Odell Town Pump Pail Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Draft in a sampler at the brewery. Pours a clear gold with an eggshell white head that leaves some lace. Notes of citrus, straw, bready and toasty malts, and mild spice.

Odell Town Pump Pail Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;On tap at Town Pump. Wow, super fresh aroma of citrus fruits, piney hops and toasty malts. Similar flavor, nicely balanced Pale, with a bitter dry finish. Way better than I remember.
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Lightly hazed amber colored liquid. Fairly small head of off-white bubbles. Not much as far as lace. Sweet fruity aromas - plenty of raisins, currants, light melon and bit of tropical fruit. Medium body with a little �tang/zip� in the finish. Sugary and sweet flavors. Touch of honey. Only a bit of bitterness in the finish and into the linger saves this from being a complete saccharine bomb. Not much balance or diversity in this brew for me. 5/10
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Golden yellow with a thin off-white head. Aroma is bready and yeasty with alcohol, fruit and some off-flavors. Taste is thin and alcoholic with fruit and bready malt and noticeable off-flavors.
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;A golden ale with a thin white head. In aroma, sweet honey, signs of oxidation, orange peels, so-so. In mouth, a sweet candy sugar with coriander, honey, corn syrup, a bit old and tired. Tasted on April 24, 2011.
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Poured into a snifter. Lunatique pours a golden straw color, with a slight haze. Atop this Tripel, is a solid white head with very light retention, but does leave some decent lacing. Aromas are slightly sour tones, sweet breakfast malts, some citrus, as well as some spices. Taste is sweet, like most Tripels, with some hop quality that fades. All the flavors are the same as the aromas, including the sours, its even more faint in the taste than the smell, but it is still there. Mouthfeel is smooth, and bubbly as the carbonation is high. Very drinkable Belgian Tripel.
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;750ml synthetic-corked and caged bottle. It struggles to form a head as it pours a hazy brown. The head is white and sticks for a while before receding with some ok lacing. The smell is super fruity. There are lemons, citrus, grape, and oxidized apple. The taste is reminiscent of the flavor, though it has a kick of caramel sweetness that is almost too cloying. It is very sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit undercarbonated, especially for the style. It is a messy beer, but somewhat decent, the bottle was only 3.99. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 10-11-2010 04:20:50
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;750 ml. bottle from Wegmans Leesburg. It pours a slightly hazy gold with an eggshell colored, almost creamy head. The nose is a touch musty with a little bubble gum, candy sugar, and yeast. The flavor is flat with notes of paper, honey, cotton candy, and yeast. Medium bodied with average carbonation leading to a slight sweet finish. Compared to it�s peers, this one is less than impressive. Too simplistic and sweet for what I have come to expect out of this style.
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;750 ml corked and caged bottle into an Allagash chalice. Pours a hazy orangish-yellow with a medium white head (it�s about time I got decent head from a De Proef beer!). Head collapses in a couple of minutes leaving a good-sized collar of big-bubbled foam and some creamy lace. Aroma is total Grandma�s kitchen--banana bread, apple pie, caramel. Taste is sweet and sour with no bitterness. Tastes a little old. Carbonation is medium-high, body is medium, texture is a little sticky, a little watery. Not as good as the Mystique but far better than the other two I�ve had recently from this brewery (Euphorique and Angelique).
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle. Moderate cookie, nutty and caramel for the malt, perfume for the hops, light dough for the yeast and banana, wood and honey in the background. Head is small, wispy with bigger bubbles, white with slim lacing but good legs and is mostly diminishing. Color is clear on the first pours but gets murky towards the end pours, amber. Flavor is moderately sweet and lightly acidic to start, and is lightly sweet, acidic and bitter in the finish. palate is medium, a bit slick, with a lively carbonation and a moderately alcoholic finish. Much sweeter than I�d expect a Tripel to be, but the complexity and mouthfeel gave it a pretty good overall score.
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;750, corked and baled. Pours a hazy, nearly cloudy burnished dark gold with a towering, creamy white head that falls quickly away to a scant ring of film. Minimal stringy lace. Candi sweet nose with yeasty spice, a little on the coriander side but it seems to be a yeast rather than an adjunct note. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Honey, flowers, candi sugar, and light yeasty spice on the mid palate. Long dry honey finish. Very appealing and on the spicy side compared to so many down-the-line tripels.
De Proef Lunatique (Cuvee Diabolique);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Effervescent copper body with fluffy, sudsy head that flattens to a thin cover in a couple minutes. Peachy yeast aroma with subtle fresh banana are the more discernable notes amidst a tropical fruit medley. Peach fuzz flavor with clean yeastiness and tannic peach skin finish. Light and refreshing. Sour-bitterish. Spritely, lively, fruity, and quite refreshing.

Rochester Mills Paint Creek Porter;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Porter;Rochester Mills Beer Company;Poured on tap at the Rochester Mills Brewery. Has a jet black color with a slight off-white head. Both the aroma and the flavor are all malts. The beer claims a hop finish, but I don�t detect that. Body feel is decent. This is a pretty good porter.

Rochester Mills Paint Creek Porter;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Porter;Rochester Mills Beer Company;On tap at the brewpub, Rochester. Opaque dark brown body, thin cream head.

Rochester Mills Brown;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Rochester Mills Beer Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a sturdy fairly dark brown color with a finger�s worth of tan foamy head. Light stringy lace. The aroma had some nuts, caramel/toffee malts, roast, milk chocolate, brown sugar and some sweet herbal tones. Ended with a little bit of earthy hops. The flavor had some sweet to roasty tones blending together nicely. Soft sweet nutty aftertaste with a slight creamy to chocolatey finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation was stiff, basically there, but seemed to just hit just a touch more than expected. ABV felt fine. Overall, equivalent to an English brown ale, this was Rochester Mill�s version of one.
Rochester Mills Brown;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Rochester Mills Beer Company;Draught at pub. Nutty with a very light creamy finish. The strong alcohol makes it a nice winter warmer but very drinkable and would also be refreshing in the summer.

Lunar Mickeys Pils;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lunar Brewing Company;Bright gold with a bit of haze, a huge lasting head, and amzingly sticky, lastiing lacing. Nose is grassy hops, a bit soapy. Body is fluffy, all of their beers are so damn fresh... Nice pale malts provide decent body to this pils and the finishing hoppiness is strong and dry. The freshness is the best part of this pils, though.
Great Adirondack German Schwarzbier;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;"On tap @ Brewpub, labeled ""ADK Dark Lager"".

Great Adirondack German Schwarzbier;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;Deep ruby shade, only decent head of the lot. Sweetish schwarz with some maple syrup notes and a similar malt profile to the amber but less acidity. Slight roast up front, this is more a dunkel than a schwarz.

Ending bitterness clean. A mild mannered but tasty interpretation. They should drop that bland blond ale and serve this year-round instead.
DarkTribe LSB Special;East Butterwick, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;DarkTribe Brewery;[Cask at GBBF 2004] An orange beer with a small white head.

DarkTribe LSB Special;East Butterwick, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;DarkTribe Brewery;A rare appearance for this beer away from the pub it is brewed for, and a very welcome one. Golden colour. Hops dominate the aroma and flavour of this beer - no doubt the dry hopping is quite generous. There is also a hint of sulphur on the nose. The taste is very fresh, finishing quite sharp. Light mouthfeel. Some people may find this a little one-dimensional, I rather liked it. Cask, GBBF 2004, day 1.
DarkTribe LSB Special;East Butterwick, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;DarkTribe Brewery;GBBF, London. Cloudy, light brown, with no head. A slight sourness on the aroma.

Frog Island Head in the Clouds;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Frog Island Brewery;[Cask at GBBF 2004] An orange beeer with a dense beige head. The aroma is sweet with notes of caramel and black currant. The flavor is weird: it contains notes of bullshit, plums, wood, and flowers - the start of the flavor is awful, but it ends up nicely. Weird.
Frog Island Head in the Clouds;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Frog Island Brewery;cask gbbf: compared to the other frog island i had this one you should pass up. thin and uninteresting. not really a bitter in my opinion. however, the biggest problem was freshness or improper handling of the cask.....this had that nasty sewer nose. which ive smelled before at pubs around england...unbelievable that it would be in this condition at the gbbf???
Frog Island Head in the Clouds;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Frog Island Brewery;GBBF, London. tart, appley aroma. Golden, no head. Very nice, sweet fruit flavour. Lemon, apple, juicy hops, but not overbearing. Sweetnes sets in on the finish, and looks worrying, but without basis. OK.

Wells John Bull (Cask);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"I�m not sure if this is the right John Bull. I�m drinking it right now from a can purchased at the local LCBO and all it says is John Bull Ale on the can. Anyway, this is pretty �ok�. A bit watery, and both the taste and aroma have a hint of whiskey which I am not a fan of at all. If not for that I would have probably enjoyed this ale more, but for me it was pretty ""meh"". Maybe I need it from a tap."

Gold, minimal white head and gentle condition. Malt and slight sweaty cheese notes in the nose, some gentle hop and more cheesiness in the mouth. Little aftertaste to speak of. Too much perspiration and not enough inspiration.
Wells John Bull (Cask);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);I�m not at all sure what prompted Wells to revive one of the reviled names of recent brewing history, originally a macro swill originating from the (now closed) Ind Coope beer factory in Romford. However, it�s surprisingly palatable, if a little on the sweet side and not exactly exciting. Not great, but a perfectly acceptable session beer with malt and hops in reasonable balance. Cask (handpump), White Horse, Parsons Green.

Great Baraboo Snake Eye Canyon Red Ale;Clinton Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Baraboo Brewing Company;Pours an amber color with a thin white head and some lacing.

Great Baraboo Snake Eye Canyon Red Ale;Clinton Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Baraboo Brewing Company;Draft. Pours a nice clear red with sufficient head.

Great Baraboo Snake Eye Canyon Red Ale;Clinton Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Baraboo Brewing Company;This draft brew from a festival poured a extremely large sized head of foamy finely sized off-white colored bubbles that was long lasting and left behind a semi-opaque dark red brown colored body. The weak aroma was hoppy and Irish Red malty. The mouth feel was smooth at the start and mediumly tingly at the finish. The flavor contained notes of hops astringent and Irish red malt. Not one that I would buy again.
Great Baraboo Snake Eye Canyon Red Ale;Clinton Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Baraboo Brewing Company;Draft.

Rock Bottom Chicago German Summer Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draft. The bartender described it as a ""cross between a K�lsch and a Hefeweizen."" Seems to be a weizen grain bill brewed with K�lsch yeast. A definite cloudy hefe body under a style-matching short head. The �nanner and clove hefe taste were apparent at the start, but then gave way to a zesty, lemony wheat beer taste that puts it closer to a K�lsch, in my mind. A hint of coriander as you drink it, light malt profile and low bitterness make this a nice, but slightly hefty brew."

Blackwater Black Diamond Stout;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Stout;Blackwater Brewing Company;The first smell of this beer is of vinegar and the taste was approximately the same. I tried the porter as well and it tasted just the same. It was watery for a stout and after 20 ounces of it I felt absolutely no buzz.

Kudos to head brewer Debra Sampson!
Blackwater Black Diamond Stout;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Stout;Blackwater Brewing Company;7/20/2007: Blackwater Black Diamond Stout was a bit of a rare treat since finding beers from West Virginia is not easy to do. While my friends and I were at the Oak Room in Athens, Ohio during Ohio Brew Week sampling beer, we were talking with the bartender (Kevin) and he pulled out a personal bottle of this beer to share with us... Blackwater Black Diamond Stout pours a clear, very dark brown color. The aroma and flavor are creamy and contain chocolate, darkly roasted malt, and a subtle hint of licorice. The body is medium-full, but there wasn�t a lot (if any) carbonation left since this was from a flip-top bottle that had been previously opened. The beer was also way too cold as the aroma and flavor seemed a bit suppressed. I bet it would be much better at room temperature. It�s still a nice, robut stout. Sample from 1 L bottle shared by the bartender at the Oak Room during the Ohio Brew Week in Athens, Ohio. Thanks Kevin! Rating #3 for this beer...
Blackwater Black Diamond Stout;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Stout;Blackwater Brewing Company;On tap. Pours almost black in color with a tan head that does not have good lacing.

Blackwater Black Diamond Stout;Davis, West Virginia, United States;Stout;Blackwater Brewing Company;On tap, at the source: Frappacino nose, light head and a thick black color that mirrors Cannaan Valley�s Blackwater River which runs wild at the brewers doorstep. At first, there are some offish flavors of sour, musty mold and metallic soap. However, these seem to dissipate after a while and are replaced with tannic roasted coffee and a sweet creamish quality. A rich malt with mellow hops that are a bit difficult to detect. Overall, a decent stout in a beautiful town.

Latgales Gai�ais;Rezekne, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rezeknes Bryuvers;500ml bottle. Wow - am I rating the same beer as you guys? Poured one glass with yeast and one without, so I could compare. Without the yeast, the aroma is quite lagery, some hints of vegetable occasionally. With yeast it�s a bit fuller, but has a strange plasticky tinge. Without yeast, there�s a decent bready taste and a real, but slightly emasculated, hop bitterness. The finish is pure hops - quite resiny. With yeast, it�s yeastier and the bitterness is accompanied, but smeared, by the tang of the yeast. Conclusion - I�d rather drink without yeast. Definitely had the soul of beer, you�re right, Estpiwo, not macroswill.
Latgales Gai�ais;Rezekne, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rezeknes Bryuvers;Bottled. Malty aroma, but I feel some oil tones. Petrol? Probably, problem in water. Golden color with small white head. Flavor is hoppy with bitter aftertaste. But I feel soul of beer unlike big corporatons brews.

Rathskeller Amber Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;tap at Rathskeller in Indianapolis. Decent beer.

Sweetish-round, hints of grain in the background. Fresh and not too sweetish, refreshing without being too watery. Hints of grain in the background, a bit artificial blackberry in the taste with a moderate sweetness. Fruity and refreshing. Nice with a long blackberry aftertaste.

Alcatraz Brickyard Bock;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Alcatraz Brewing Company;amber, malty sweet, medium body, lightly carbonated. farily uninspired average bock. the quality of beer here reminded me of Rock Bottom which ironically is about a block away and even better RAM is directly across the street. how many mediocre brew pubs do we need within a a block of each other. the bar area did have a decent atmosphere though, but that doesnt get additional points here.
Alcatraz Brickyard Bock;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Sampler at Downtown Indy. Medium sized white head with fine-large sized bubbles that completely diminished. Fast rising carbonation, transparent and a yellow hue. Malty aroma. Lightly bitter, malt and hop flavor. Tingly mouthfeel. Medium bodied beer with fair lacing. Low rating due to the fact that this bock was not how a true bock beer should look and taste like.
Alcatraz Brickyard Bock;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Alcatraz Brewing Company;The color of this bock was immediately observed to be different from other Bocks. Even a discussion with the staff resulted in an agreement that this was different and not to style. It was too light colored. It had a medium sized head of finely sized foamy white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a fair lacing, The body was carbonated transparent and orange in color. It had a mild malt citrus aroma and a tingly smooth hoppy slightly astringent mouth feel It had a very mild Bock like flavor if any thing at all like a Bock. It was not per the typical German style or color but did have a notable alcohol content!
Karl Strauss Belgian Abbey Red;San Diego, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;On tap at the San Diego�s Brewers Guild: Was poured in a sample tasting cup with a lot of foam because it was the last beer they had. Color was brown with some amber tint. Had a light spice aroma with a Belgian yeast and brown sugar flavor. Reminded me of a brown ale meets red ale meets Belgian ale. Not much else for me to base this on because of the poor pour.
Karl Strauss Belgian Abbey Red;San Diego, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Taster on tap at KS Sorrento Mesa: Deep red amber color with a small off-white head.

Pours a darker copper amber, mostly clear body with an inch thick, pinkish white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is sweet and heavily malted. Lots of darker caramels and toffees. Big on the dark fruits, such as plums, raisins, and prunes, but has a soft citrus in there as well. A touch of Belgian yeast. Flavor is similar in that there are lots of darker toffees and fruits. More of a bready body giving it a fig newton kind of taste with a touch of Belgian yeast strain fruitiness in there too. Slightly sugary with a soft spicing to finish with a long, malty, raisin aftertaste. Medium bodied, chewy, and slightly dry. Overall, not a bad beer. Pretty enjoyeable for not expecting much.
Karl Strauss Belgian Abbey Red;San Diego, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Tap @ Karl Strauss.

Bath Gem (Cask);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bath Ales (St. Austell);Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. Pours a nice brown amber with diminishing lacing. There is an aroma of berry hop fruits and nicely roasted pale malt. The taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and the palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation with a bitter finish. I am going to try to be a bit more generous in my grading of bitters since it's a British form that is hard to do exceptionally well and this is a very good example. I can easily imagine a pleasant evening spent with this.
Bath Gem (Cask);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bath Ales (St. Austell);Cask at The Wellington, Bristol. Pours clear orange amber with a white head.

Bath Gem (Cask);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bath Ales (St. Austell);The iconic bath gem with its blood orange label is one of my favourite things about going to gigs in Bristol. Seems to be the healthy alternative to Red Stripe in quite a few of the venues, and this I am quite thankful for. Creamier and smoother than the bottled variety, but just as good if not better (actually f*ck it, it�s better).
Bath Gem (Cask);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bath Ales (St. Austell);Everything I hate about real ale- little flavour or complexity, weak and boring. That a company has basically built a living off the back of this beer, and sold it on for much dollar, is simply astounding.
Bath Gem (Cask);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bath Ales (St. Austell);Cask @Bristol Harbour Festival. Small frothy head, dark amber colour, clear. Aroma: roasted malts, grain, bread. Bitter taste, medium to full body, long finish, soft carbonation. Quite ok.

Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are floral and citrusy. A very mild and fruity IPA. Not very bitter. More like an ESB or a mild than an IPA. Nice balance. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Republic of Boulder Oak Brown;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Republic of Boulder;Draught. Head is fully diminishing. Body is light brown. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie), with notes of wood, apple, and allspice. Flavor is lightly sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. At first I thought it might be a cask conditioned brown ale, but the oak presence was so out front that it may just be chipped (not to mention the head in the mug this was poured from was enormous). Has a slight holiday spice aroma as well. Rather thin and watery, though, and on the bland side. Interesting experiment, but this didn�t work for me.
Republic of Boulder Mamas Milk Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Republic of Boulder;tap at brewpub-pours black with a decent tan head. roast, dark chocolate and rum rasin on the aroma. smells pretty robust and much better than the looks of the other ratings. flavors of dark chocolate, molassas, rum rasin,. pretty decent if you ask me! the right amount of carbonation here. Probably their best beer of the evening!
Republic of Boulder Mamas Milk Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Republic of Boulder;Called Mama�s Milk Stout at the brewery. Dark brown body with some light at the bottom. Very thin filmy head... nose is chocolate syrup ice cream topping, more of that pure Vermont maple syrup and some sweet molasses. Semi-thick maple and chocolate flavors, different than most attempts, that can be said. Creamy and wet finish with some grittyness as well.
Republic of Boulder Mamas Milk Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Republic of Boulder;Very dark black. Syrupy-sweet and tar-like. Dark roasted grains complemented by a milky sweetness -- very creamy and sugary. Lesser hints of chocolate and coffee. Surprising amount of bitterness follows through. Overall, big sweetness and big bitterness seemed to compete for attention in my mouth. Pretty good, but heavy sweetness was a bit wearing.
Republic of Boulder Mamas Milk Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Republic of Boulder;Draught. Head is mostly lasting. Body is black. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, chocolate, caramel), with notes of vanilla and milk/cream. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Perhaps the pick of the litter in the first batch of Republic brews, but still too sweet to be drinkable by itself.
Republic of Boulder Dunkel Weisse;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Republic of Boulder;Dark brown with a little reddish glow. Banana in the nose. Medium-bodied with a tingly carbonation ... drinkable texture. Dark and roasted malt flavors and aromas. Hints of dark chocolate. Some sourness and even a little tartness. Quite a bit of bitterness, which was uncharacteristic, but I kind of liked it.
Republic of Boulder Dunkel Weisse;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Republic of Boulder;Draught. Head is fully diminishing. Body is dark brown.

Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. Very dark and thick and...well...kind of stoutish. Not bad per se, but not what I think of as a dunkelweizen.
Republic of Boulder Fiery Lass Scottish Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Republic of Boulder;tap at brewpub-pours a deep ruby amber hue with a small tan head. smells like a roasty porter. stale roast flavors probably been sitting in the fermenter/keg for too long. light peat moss or some flavor that mimics it. really dry finish!
Republic of Boulder Fiery Lass Scottish Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Republic of Boulder;Called Fiery Lass at the brewery. Dark brown color, perhaps even dark purple in the right light. Big maple syrup nose, and I mean pure Vermont maple syrup, not the imitation stuff in the Aunt Jemima bottle... but the real stuff with woody, earthy, gritty oily sweetness... where you can taste the tree. Sweet alcohol noticed in the flavor, with some cherries and plums... carbonated like a soda. Very sweet.
Republic of Boulder Fiery Lass Scottish Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Republic of Boulder;Deep and dark brown. Mouthfeel was nice -- thickish and creamy with a nice carbonation level. Malts were roasty and toasty, and coated by big sweetness (caramel, brown sugar, sweet bread, nuts). Hint of smoke. Pretty tasty.
Republic of Boulder Fiery Lass Scottish Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Republic of Boulder;Draught. Head is mostly lasting. Body is dark brown. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted bread, caramel), lightly hoppy (flowers), with a light note of bubble gum. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery texture, lively carbonation. I hate to run this brewer through the thresher too violently, as this is reportedly his first commercial brewing venture, having previously been a homebrewer. Perhaps brewing in much larger batches is proving a challenge? I�m being slightly generous with these ratings in the hopes that his skills will improve in the next year. The best thing is that he�s not making the same old brewpub lineup of pale ale, porter, stout, amber, golden ale, etc.
Slab City Shawano Gold Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Slab City Brewing;Picked up the last single 12-oz bottle at Flanagan�s in Appleton, Wisconsin and stored in my cellar for nearly two years. Pours a semi-clear golden pale brew with a fast dissolving white head that dissipates clean. Aroma of light white bread malt with wheat, a touch of lemon zest and some cardboard. Taste is pretty thin, some light to medium bodied, some carbonation with a corn/wheat malt flavor with a touch of lemon. Finish is pretty flat and some husk flavors due to the two years of aging. I would have liked to try this one fresh, though.
Slab City Shawano Gold Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Slab City Brewing;12oz bottle. Poured a medium and slightly hazy golden color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of wheat, lemons and a little on the buttery side. Tastes of wheat, lemons and light bananas. Has a light tartness to the finish. Thin body.
Slab City Shawano Gold Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Slab City Brewing;Gold Coloring with White Skin. Puckering Bitter Malt. Not Very Enjoyable.
Slab City Shawano Gold Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Slab City Brewing;Frothy and fading white head... pale yellow body. Stale and sweet lemony wheat aroma. To me, it seems like a combination of a crisp Bud, and a wheat beer. A bit fizzy in the body... a bit too much.
Slab City Shawano Gold Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Slab City Brewing;Appearance: Hazy creamy caramel color. Thin white head that dissapated quickly. Micro particles floating in the body. Aroma: wheat and barley bread, slight banana. Flavor: odd. I definitely get the huskiness that DavidP does. I also get the cornyness that JPDIPSO does. Although, the corn flavor isn�t nearly as good as a New Glarus Spotted Cow. Flavor�s not apalling, but not that good. Palate is pleasing.
Slab City Shawano Gold Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Slab City Brewing;Hazy golden color. Saltwater taffy and stemmy hops backed by rice cake malt in the aroma. Equally exciting flavor of husk, pale malt and stemmy hops. OK but quite boring.
Slab City Shawano Gold Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Slab City Brewing;Hazy straw color with a wispy white head. Clean aroma, meaning nearly no aroma. Light feel. Light corn flavors mix with some mild pale malt. Really nothing going on in this one. I can see this being the cross over beer with the locals for a american lager.
Slab City Shawano Gold Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Slab City Brewing;Apparently the Slab line is as new to Ratebeer as it is to me. This was one of the more average of the Slabs I had, but still not too bad.
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;Old Shawano Lake notes circa 2004. Golden. Skunky. Light bitterness and malt. Odd bitterness. 6/10
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;"This beer is unintentionally not entirely bad. I let this one sit in my fridge (downstairs, secondary beer fridge) for a couple years--somehow I never got excited to drink it. When I opened it, I thought ""oh gee, this is infected...I can�t even rate this""--it foamed up hugely in the glass and even in the bottle. But looking at the ratings for this beer, I think I found the solution: let this beer get old and infected, and then drink it as an Old Ale or a Flemish Sour or something. In this condition my rating beats its current average: fruity, acidic, with a lovely rounded sourness, suggestive of strawberry-rhubarb and unfiltered lambic. Not great, and certainly not an APA, but don�t look at the sourness of this beer as entirely a bad thing. Bottle."
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;Something�s amiss here. It looks okay, a hazy golden amber with a a modest ecru head. The aroma has a light caramel sweetness, but it�s overpowered by a lemony sourness that lasts into the flavor and lingers into the finish. This is just wrong. Breeze-Thru Wine & Spirits, Milwaukee, WI
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;So-So, below average. Reminds me of some PAs friends have brewed, that just didn�t quite work. Sour notes throughout, which is not my thing on PAs (apparently others reviewing this beer agree). Bottle.
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;Bottled. Poured a clear bronzed amber with a dusting and a ring of white head. Nose was sour!... some light fruits and caramel beneath, but not much. Flavor was of enamel-stripping light fruit and citrus sourness with a pinch of toasty caramel at the core... some dusty, leafy hops too. Could not get past the sourness on the palate. Wow... suck.
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;Very novel but poor to medocre taste. Big white bubble with high amount of carbonation. Unusually sour for a pale ale anything-- The only thing I�ve had more sour was breckenridge hefe and that was incrediibly bad. This PA might be worth a try for the novelty or if you like sour notes. Pine, banana, sort of bitter. I haven�t had a chance to try home brew but this seems to scream home brew.
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;12oz bottle. Opened to a loud Psst (I expected it to gush, but luckily it didn�t). I�m not surprised that it poured all head. Settled to a medium and hazy amber color. I�m struggling to pick out the aromas - some citrus and caramel, but nothing really there. Tastes are weak and watery too. I�m on my way to the drain...
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;"From a 12 oz. long neck brown bottled with no bottled/freshness date. Made an below average appearance, poured a clear golden hued amber with a soapy, fizzy head that quickly settled into a fine lacing, low carbonation. Had a unpleasant nose, sour fruity and bananas with bare hints of caramel. A semi-crisp, smooth,but rough drinking, light bodied mouth feel, below average drinkability. Foul tasting for a APA, fruity and sour, mushy banana, traces of sugar and caramel, a rough earthy bitterness towards the end and a dry sour finish. I�ve had two brews from Slab City tonight that weren�t worth the effort, and half way through sampling this APA, I starting thinking this is close to being a beer from Elmwood in Illinois and that is not a good sign, it will be a while before I get up the ""courage"" to try anymore brews from this brewer."
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;After sampling Central Waters offering of this style, this was a huge letdown. Poured a cloudy amber with a weak white head. The citrus notes to the aroma evoked less an image of fresh fruit as they did citrus scented cleaning liquids. Hints of spice and DoubleBubble. Weak and watery in the mouth. The flavor was jejune and banal. Just had to use those words.
Slab City Old 47 Pale Ale;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Slab City Brewing;Certainly didn�t think it was as bad as some of the previous reviews. Local paper had a fairly positive review so I thought I would give it a try. A pleasant light bitterness with no lingering aftertaste. Has a nice kick. Decent flavor. I will buy it again. It�s no Two-Hearted ale, but it�s better than some of the ales I�ve had from more reputable brewers.
Slab City Pulaski Red;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Slab City Brewing;Old Shawano Lake notes circa 2004. Deep red. Toasted malt, bread, hops. Sweet toasted malt and bitter finish. 7/10
Slab City Pulaski Red;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Slab City Brewing;"12 ounce bottle from the Woodmans on Gammon Road, Madison WI (December 2006), suspiciously savored from a Unibroue glass a little above fridge temperature. A thinnish off-white smooth head forms and lasts above the dull hazy golden body, leaving no lacing....sour lemony-grapefruit nose, touches of sour apple, as a previous reviewer states a bit lambic-like, interestingly, but low-strength and dull and with a waft of raw sugar that�s odd and not too impressive....body is quite sour/tart, more like lemonade than anything else, definitely reminiscent of (bad) lambics like Lindemans, de Troch etc; a bit sweet and syrupy at the front, dries out and flattens considerably at the finish....were the carbonation a bit higher and the sugars cut some, this would be a fine American pseudo-gueuze; as is, a complete misfire if considered as belonging to the style it claims, an interesting but not really worth drinking novelty on its own merits."
Slab City Pulaski Red;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Slab City Brewing;More like a sour brown ale crossed with a beligan. Misrepresented and mediocre at best but it is unique. Not insanely carbonated like their pale ale.
Slab City Pulaski Red;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Slab City Brewing;Light golden body with a small off white head. I to am trying ot understand the Red connotation. Apple and hay aromas. Tart flavors with a mild pale malt hint in the background. This brewery seems to have some recipe or sanitation problems. Will seek out a fresh sample to see.
Slab City Pulaski Red;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Slab City Brewing;Pours a hazy yellow color, nice thick white head. Aroma of lemon, straw, spices. Flavor is more belgian flavors, bananas, cloves. This is no Red! or Amber Ale!
Slab City Pulaski Red;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Slab City Brewing;Pours to a thick white head atop a piss yellow body. It has a decent lacing. This beer smells like a lambic. Barnyardy. Sour. The flavor has a fermented wet hay to it. Not a red ale! The flavor is more Belgian than anything else. Palate wise, this one is fairly decent. Good quality.
Slab City Pulaski Red;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Slab City Brewing;This is an odd one. Hazy straw body. Barnyardy tartness, green apple skin aroma. Smells like a lambic. The flavor is less assertive but sitll tart. Pale malt, tart lemon wet hay. The flavor is a bit light but still enjoyable. Light but lightly carbonated palate.
Slab City Pulaski Red;Bonduel, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Slab City Brewing;Ok, why is there no option for Red under beer style? What is that supposed to fall under?!?! Oh well, I think this was misbottled anyway, as this sure did not look or taste like a red, more like a American Standard. I expected MUCH more! Oh well, at least Pulaski is a polka town, and that's something that can never be taken away from it.

Potosi Light;Potosi, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Potosi Brewing Company;Old notes. Another brew from the old Berghoff brewery. Light yellow color with a wispy fading white head. Fizzy feel. Scents, or moe like hints of grain, corn and touch of dried herb hops. Thin flavors of grain with again a hint of herbal bitterness. Quite watery in many ways.
Potosi Light;Potosi, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Potosi Brewing Company;An ordinary light lager. Nothing offensive about it, and the flavor is better than miller lite. Thanks to Skyview for sharing.
Potosi Light;Potosi, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Potosi Brewing Company;"Are we sure about the 4.5% alcohol content? That�s high for a light beer, and as a, um, (*cough*cough) ""well seasoned"" drinker I detect very little buzz factor in this swill. I would double check that figure. Almost no aroma, extra light yellow pour with very little head that fades instantly. No flavor, no aftertaste, no reason to try this again. It was cheap at $3.79 a 12 pack in a grocery store in Richland Center, Wisconsin. That�s they only thing good about it."
Potosi Light;Potosi, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Potosi Brewing Company;This is a fund raiser beer, specially made for the National Brewery Museum that will be opening sometime during June 2008 in Potosi, Wisconsin. Surprisingly, this recently made Potosi Light looks and tastes pretty much what the old Potosi tasted like back in 1972 when my dad bought it for about $2.50 a case (yeah, I was only 7 at the time and learned to enjoy beer very early :-p ). Light corn nose with hardly any hops. Pours a clear light golden beverage, no head and a very thin corn taste. No aftertaste whatsoever. This is how most of the regional light lagers tasted like during the early 1970s to compete with the big breweries. It�s not a micro-brewery caliper beverage but If you like very light beers and don�t care for the full body beers to fill you up, this beverage is okay. The good news about this product is SW Wisconsin has been supporting the brewery restoration AND a micro brewery will be operating in the old Potosi brewery in 2008. Watch for this one!
Potosi Light;Potosi, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Potosi Brewing Company;"""A Premium Wisconsin Light Beer"" Clear, plain yellow, no head at all, flat and dull. Corny aroma, but most of all, bland and bare. Moist, then gone...nothing to speak of in terms of taste, thin as they come... Easy to drink, but why bother. Soda pop has more of a kick. Colored water, and practically nothing else. To call it a bore would be a compliment. If this floats your boat, you�re probably pining for the return of the ""Lawrence Welk Show""."
Potosi Light;Potosi, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Potosi Brewing Company;The old Potosi Brewery has been abandoned since 1972, but is now on the road to restoration! The brewery has been saved by the Potosi Brewing Foundation, and is currently under restoration. Soon, the brand of Potosi Beer will be brewed back in Potosi, WI, and every can and case that is purchased now helps the restoration fund grow and grow, so DRINK UP!!!

Boat Rosie Josie;Castleford, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boat;Copper colour. Mainly malty, with some dry bitterness. Quite good balance.

Upton Cider - Sweet (Draught);Didcot, Oxfordshire, England;Apple Cider;Upton Cider;Hardly in the heart of cider country, this farm originally provided fruit to Taunton Cider Company, but struck out on its own in 1983.

Upton Cider - Sweet (Draught);Didcot, Oxfordshire, England;Apple Cider;Upton Cider;Gravity Great British Beer Festival 2004. Again, thanks to Silk Tork for letting me sample another fine cider. Possibly the first sweet cider I have had, it lacks the harsh dryness and sulphuric aromas a dry cider has, then again if I want something dry I would prefer a lambic. This was more like apple juice and was actually very nice.

Flying Dog Dogtoberfest;Frederick, Maryland, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Flying Dog Brewery;"Reviewed in 2009- Now I remember why I stopped buying Flying Dog. This was given to me as a gift with a few others, this being the worst of the 4 so figured I'd try it first since I hadn't had this type of Flying Dog yet. Had a lighter brown/slight amber color. Very thin appearance and texture, not much carbonation or flavor going on. The aroma was sort of skunky, which was one of the first ""tells"" that I wouldn't care too much for this beer. Flavor was wheaty with caramel malts and honey. Sort of like a thinner-wheatier honey brown. Think I may be flying off the flying dog wagon right about now."
Greenshields Lite Beer;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Draught. Why do breweries make a light beer? That is a good question. Low alcohol and malt content, Watery flavor--It doesn�t make sense. This one had some malt character, but little hop presence.

McMenamins Third Eye PA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Lighthouse Pub, Lincoln City, Oregon. Cloudy soft lemon yellow. Beautiful rich and sweet nose... almost gritty hop aromas, very fresh and leafy. Good tartness, body is light and crisp, with a fresh hop flavor that�s not overdone. Very bitter, definitly a good one.
McMenamins Smiling Lion Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Lighthouse Pub, Lincoln City, Oregon. Rich hazelnut and coffee nose, very rich and smoky, thick stout-like burnt malts, very earthy and thick. One of the better McMenamins offerings.
Bills Spruce Lager;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Medium bronze w. light lacing. Light fruitiness in the nose. Easy flavor of light matl/hopping with a little fruit, and perhaps even spruce detectable.
Bills Spruce Lager;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Pours a cloudy light orange with a smooth white head. Lots of citrus hops and spice in the nose, kinda pilsner grassy quality to it. I liked the fact that the spruce was much more subtle than other spruce beers, not overpowering, but light spruce herbalness.
Bills Spruce Lager;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Light and fizzy yellow colored. Sweet honey and peach fruit flavors, not really catching the spruce (unlike the Siletz Spruce Ale). Spiced rye and sweet ginger perhaps.
Bills Foggy Notion Weissbier;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;On tap at Bill�s Tavern, pours a cloudy pale golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of banana upfront, with a little clove. Flavour is clean, bringing out loads of banana upfront, with a touch of clove again around the edges. Simple hef, with a clean enough body. Decent.

Decent.
Bills Foggy Notion Weissbier;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Pint at the brewpub - Aroma is doughy yeast, lemon and banana. Flavor matches. Palate is creamy and clean. An easy drinking hefe but nothing special.
Bills Foggy Notion Weissbier;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Had this on tap at Bill�s Tavern in Cannon Beach, OR. Colour... lightly cloudy and mustard like. Nose... light citrus and hops, as well as some butyl esters. Palate... lots of hop bite up front, esp. for a weiss, citrus peel, slightly butyl, some bubble gum and clove and a quick bitter finish.
Bills Foggy Notion Weissbier;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;This brewpub is surprisingly good. Banana, yeast, light orange flavors, and some wheat. Faint aroma of yeast and wheat. Spices could have been added for something extra. Medium bodied and lightly creamy. Light carbonation. I think some of the bad ratings come from the lack of quality control at small brew pubs, my beer here was very good.
Bills Foggy Notion Weissbier;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Cloudy yellow, no head, no carbo. Thin malts, little else. Watery finish. Very poor.
Bills Foggy Notion Weissbier;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Cloudy ginger appearance giving off a pleasant wheat aroma, piquant with orange-citrus and a prickly evergreen note. Cloviness develops.

Cloudy pale gold colour with thin white head. Lemon and wheat on aroma, bit of spice, promises juicy fruit. Wheat is present, juicy sweetish lemon fruit. Good finish too of zesty lemon.

Bills Foggy Notion Weissbier;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;On Tap At Bills Tavern and Brewhouse Cannon Beach OR. Pours out a Hazy Yellow topped off with a small white head. A little banan in this one as it sould be.
Bills Foggy Notion Weissbier;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;On Tap at Bill�s: This hefe has the typical murky, yellowish colors and aromas you would expect from its style. It has a thick, full body with low carbonation. It seemed a bit stronger than others in its category and had a strong taste of fermented silage. I am not into hefe�s so when I tried this I thought I was working back on the dairy farm when I was feeding the cows five month old, steaming hot silage in the middle of a freezing Ohio winter.
Bills Bronze Ale;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Mahogany w. light head on rim. Bland, stale steam hop reminiscent aroma and just as unimpressive a blend of dank hop and malt in flavor.

Bills Bronze Ale;Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bills Tavern and Brewhouse;Deep amber hue. Nose of sweet apple cider and caramel. Dirty, earthy flavor that goes everywhere... some wood... not that good, really.
Astoria Puget Island Pale Ale;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Medium yellow. Spiced nose with a little bite of hops, pale and harsh wood and a starchy body... Disorganized.
McMenamins Avalanche Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Crystal Ballroom. Pale orange, good even body with a typical PNW hop bite over a toasted bread malt body. A good APA.
McMenamins Prerequisite Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the Sunnyside Mcmenamins. Pours black with a nice tan head. Tons of chocolate in the aroma with a slight coffee hint to it as well. Taste was rich and smooth with a nice bitterness toward the end to balance. Good chocolate tastes and a decent thickness which is a big step up from most mcmenamins brews i�ve had.
McMenamins Prerequisite Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Kennedy School. Deep brown, very smooth initially, then some harsh hops, some whiskey qualities as well, a little milky malt flavors up front, with a long, buzzing finish. Decent, but not robust or complex at all. Plain, really.
McMenamins Boromir Brown;Portland, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Fulton Pub. Smells like a little roasted malts and a little vegetables. Very burnt malts and a little bit sour... not very complex, very frothy, like chocolate with some acetone. What�s going on here?
McMenamins World Cup Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Columbia River. Creamy dark tan head with swirling colors, like a mocha or cappucino. Really robust chocolate covered coffee bean smell, very well done. A little vanilla underneath the coffee as well... solid thickness, roasted coffee up front turning to bitter chocolate towards the finish. A well made porter, though a little too carbonated which makes the finish a little less smooth than wanted.
McMenamins Medium Pace IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;John Barleycorn�s McMenamins. This was one of the best IPAs i�ve had from McMenamins, actually had quite a bit of body and a strong citrus hop nose. Light grapefruit flavor builds from the hops to sit with the sustaining bitterness left behind. Very nice floral hop quality to it and it never felt watery.
McMenamins Medium Pace IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Oak Hills Brewpub. Cloudy peach colored. The flavor is a fruity peach and orange, a nice, sweet bitterness, solidly smooth and almost hearty. Grapefruit sourness, very good... better than other McMenamins IPA variants... sweet and somewhat tart. Me likey.
McMenamins Jesters Wit;Portland, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Oak Hills Brewpub. Cloudy yellow, soapy lemon dishwater aroma, with a peppy and sour meaty/fishy flavor. Fresh tasting, sweet and sugary, a little bland with a wet finish.
McMenamins Black Strap Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught. This is a nice thick and oily stout with a good roasted flavor. One of the better beers i had during my stay.
McMenamins Black Strap Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Dark color with a sweet smell. Fruity finish, very smooth, no aftertaste. This is a great beer from Kennedy School. I give it an A on my report card
McMenamins Black Strap Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled @ Columbia River in Vancouver. Deep black, medium brown head. Spicy nose of burnt malts, bourbon, caramel and nail polish (acetone, I guess). amaretto in there as well. Oily texture, some bourbon, fruit, amaretto, flavors with a sweet finish. Very good, and better than the usual fare.
Raccoon Lodge Hefeweizen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Cascade Brewing;Yellow and slightly murky. Served with a slice of orange (WTF?). A good spiced banana, wheat and orange flavor, syrupy body with a very sweet finish. A very decent wheat.
Ruski Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);From old tasting notes. Deep Amber gold color.msmooth creamy white head. Faint malt aroma. Tangy malt flavor is sweet and sour. Brief dry finish.
Ruski Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);"Bottle from the shelf at the Gman, probably from early 90�s .. we�ve pulled bottles from the shelf before and had some gems, this one- not so much .. . pours a almost lifeless caramel .. light spots of foam .. . corn, used oil, and wet cellar wood .. . held up amazingly well but none of us could finish our samples, well i did, but you get the idea.. . . did chelsea just beat barca to to to the CL final- weird.. ""secret sauce"""
Ruski Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Unimpressive ultra-carbonated pale beer (label says that it is brewed using a receipt of 19th century - bollocks!). Light caramelliness and tartness in the palate. Watery and useless.
Arsenalnoe Lyogkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Standard lager color, no head. Strong black currant aroma, sweetness too. Strange to have this kind of aroma in pale lager... Thin to medium bodied. Medium black currant in flavor, malts and medium carbonation also. Dries to have mild cardboardy ending.
Arsenalnoe Lyogkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);PET. Light, carbonated and watery lager from Tula. There are some off flavours over boring basement (e.g. hints of soap and marsh, strange indeed).
Volga Yantarnoe Spetsialnoe;Yaroslavl, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);1.5l Bottle - Dark golden/amber in colour. Grapefruit, malt and honey in the aroma which is less appealing than it sounds. It smells rather strong for its strength. Sweetish, malty taste with some grapefruit and honey notes. Could be worse!
Volga Yantarnoe Spetsialnoe;Yaroslavl, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);"Plastic bottle 1,5 ltr Golden color, small white head (where is amber?). Malty, apple fruity and suprisingly only mildly plastic-bottle-unclean aroma. Cardboardish, sweet apple flavoured. Some raw alcohol in the finish. Yes, it is bad, but slightly drinkable compared to eg. ""Volga Cereal""."
Volga Yantarnoe Spetsialnoe;Yaroslavl, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);PET. Straw coloured, big rocky head. Aroma of wort and bread. Some refreshing acidity in the finish.

Golden with rapidly disappearing head. Flowery, perfume-ish aroma. Some pungent bitterness but overall rather thin and bland.
Ostankinskoe Zhigulevskoe Moskovskogo Razliva Svetloe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ostankinsky Pivovarenny Zavod;Real chef d�oeuvre: resident of my Top 5 of the worst beers. Impossible to drink and describe. I�d prefer canned, three-years-old Dutch Bavaria...
Spinnakers Raspberry Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;Draught at the brewpub, 4.8% ABV Hazy light amber color with a pinkish hue. The raspberry timidly participates into this easy Ale, and this is a merit. Refreshing.
Spinnakers Raspberry Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;@GCBF-on tap-pours a ? head and yellow color. Aroma is raspberry. Taste is raspberry, some grain.
Spinnakers Raspberry Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub on August 11, 2006. Deep ruby colour. Great sweet raspberry nose. Tart and seedy raspberry flavour. This is very mild and subtle yet very enjoyable summer drink.
Spinnakers Raspberry Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;Slightly pink-accented copper colour. Strong aroma of raspberry syrup. Flavour of boring beer with raspberry syrup added. This disappoints but does not surprise me.
Spinnakers Raspberry Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;Had this on tap at Spinnakers. Pretty pink beer with a real nice nose if you like raspberry�s.I do.Nice raspberry flavour,but no real character,like a good juice and soda. easy to guzzle and very pleasant to drink.
Spinnakers Raspberry Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;Crystal clear, rich pink colour with minimal head. Faint raspberr aroma. Flavour is quite dry, all raspberry, no malt, no bitterness. Thin-bodied. A bit unidimensional for my tastes.
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;Okay brown body and little head, soft caramel brown sugar aroma like all their other beers. Flavour, if you can call it that, is more brown sugar. Mouthfeel is tepid. A red ale in name only, this is lacking in every category.
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;On tap at Longwood Brewpub, pours a clear dull reddish amber with a small beige head. Aroma is fairly on point, with oxidized bready malt and a touch of sourness. Flavour is likewise very dull, with oxidized bready malt, not much else. Tired, old beer. Weak stuff.
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;Tasted on tap at Longwood Brew Pub in Nanaimo, BC. Weak, watery, lack of flavor, sweetish. Not recommended
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;Draft - Buttery toast and some caramel.. Clear copper with a decent white head. Light sweetness, toffee and a touch of spice.
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;On tap. Pours an amber red with little head. Light caramel aroma. Watery. Flavors of roasted malts and tobacco.
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;"Handpump at the brewpub Dark amber color, small head. Mild caramel aroma with a touch of vegetables and butter. Smooth mouthfeel, but also quite weak, with ordinary caramel flavor, light malt, and a sourish hint that suggests this beer is not very fresh or it has a minor fermentation problem; correct bitterness. Easy."
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;"Rated right at the Longwood Brew Pub. Starting with a creamy, ivory head on top of a beautiful dark red body, served quite nicely in a tall glass, at a temperature of only ""cool"" - all the better to enjoy the taste. The aroma was that of light malting, and the taste was of roasted/toaster malt along with a slight undertone of coffee. Smooooth mouthfeel, neither thick nor watery, and a delicate finish."
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;Tap@Longwood. No nose. Red golden tanned cream. Light body (but chewy like the rest), dry light grassy notes, a hint fruit, not much else. Dusty aftertaste
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;on tap-pours an off white head and amber color. Aroma is medium malt-sweet. Taste is medium malt-sweet, medium fruit. Minimum carbonation.
Longwood Irish Red Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Longwood Brewpub;Deep, bright reddish-amber colour with a loose head. Rich caramel malt nose. Soft, very caramelly palate, smooth and sweet. A bit hard to describe despite its simple concept but they did it well.
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);Amazing flavor with no bitterness or sharp ending. Really unique flavor for a hard cider.
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);WAY too sweet and actually tastes like cough syrup or some sort of medicine. The flavors don't taste natural - more like soda water mixed with sugary ginger ale and apple flavoring.
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);Not impressed, the flavours seem unnatural and separated. Quite tangy and heavy on the fizz. The sour hue leaves a coating on the tongue. The flavour quickly resides leaving a rather bland apple juice taste (not a cider taste). The bubbles are fun to watch tho...
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);"2L bottle. OK the ""New"" on the label scares me. Clear, very slight yellow tinge, carbed. You know those fizzy light soda-like drinks they sell in supermarkets in 1L bottles, this smells exactly like the apple flavoured ones. Flavour does have some sweet cider, actually it�s much better than the nose. Sugar in there, perfumy, very slight tannin, even. Not really for cider lovers, though, way too sweet and soda-like, the nose absolutely kills this thing."
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);Rating #873 - December 29, 2013 - 355ml Can from Coop.Clear, very pale yellow colour, weakly carbonated. Aroma is sweet apples. Taste is bubbly sweet, alcohol very well disguised, this could pass for juice. Artificially sweet.
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);Can: Poured a golden color cider with medium carbonation. Aroma of sweet apples is somewhat fake with definitive use of enhancer or non-natural flavors. Taste is overly sweet with fake apple notes. This is not a cider I would seek again. It is a bit disappointing tasting all the fake flavors knowing that producing cider is not necessarily the most difficult thing in the world.
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);the new cider is awful i drank lots of the old crisp apple and loved it then i lost the bottles that was ok still had the two litters now there gone not only dose it taste bad it is two percent less alcohol its to bad a company can take a perfectly good product and reck it
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);grass, alcohol, pale, sparkling, minimal head, white foam, light sweetness, medium sourness, light body, thin feel, fizzy, astringent, long finish Pale yellow pour, strong apple smell with some alcohol. Light sweetness with strong sour. Fizzy mouthfeel and light astringency. Long finish is a dry sourness with apples for memory.
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);Okay cider with no real sweetness, but it has no real head (I like head on a cider, often hard to find) and a light gold colour. Good wood-apple flavour with no cloying sugars and a dry finish. Palate could be more firm. Just okay.
Okanagan Premium Crisp Apple Cider;Westbank, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Okanagan Cider Company (AB InBev);"LOVE Okanagan Cider!!! Why all the drastic changes...bottling,change of ""Apple"" in the Apple Cider....yes it is noticeable, I always either had Apple or Peach!! Since canned,...prefer Pear! Why fix something that is not broken??!!"

Stiegl Gaudi Radler Holunderbl�te;Salzburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Interessant ist auch der Duft, sehr s�� und kr�ftig. Die Farbe ist f�r ein Biermischgetr�nk doch recht kr�ftig, die Schaumkrone ist noch ordentlich. Das Bier ist w�ssrig, im Antrunk und Mittelteil ist ein Limonengeschmack erkennbar, der stark genug ist, um nicht als Wasser durchzugehen und schwach genug, um nicht als pure Limonade zu gelten. Lediglich der bierige Geschmack will nicht so recht durchdringen. Erst im Nachgeschmack kann man erkennen, dass auch noch Bier im Glas hat, allerdings ist es nur so schwach herb, dass man wirklich alle Geschmacksknospen aktivieren muss, um es zu vernehmen. Der Limonadengeschmack �berwiegt und klingt auch langsam aus. Interessant ist es - wenngleich man mit anderen Biermischgetr�nken sicher besser bedient ist. Test vom 13.6.2005, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 10,7,11,7,14,8 - 8,65
Stiegl Gaudi Radler Holunderbl�te;Salzburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;13th December 2007 Bottle in Salzburg, Austria. Very light floral beer. Elderflower? Crisp and refreshing but lacking and body or complexity. Thirst quenching but that�s about it!
Stiegl Gaudi Radler Holunderbl�te;Salzburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;It�s light golden with a whit, creamy head. The aroma has strong and pleasant notes of elderberry-flower and so does the flavour. The sweetness is smooth and pleasant without getting cloying, and the finish is dryis and refreshing. It would be really nice served on ice in the summer or as a wellcome drink, and if you love the elderflower drink, it�s just right for you!
Stiegl Gaudi Radler Holunderbl�te;Salzburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Bottle from Ica Kvantum, Nyk�ping. Yellow with a small white head. Elder aroma. Sweet elder flavor. Sweet and without balance.
Stiegl Gaudi Radler Holunderbl�te;Salzburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Bottled. Thx rlgk. Light golden with a very brief, white head. Pretty sweet, but not overwhelming, some citric notes. More like lemonade, without any bitterness.
Stiegl Gaudi Radler Holunderbl�te;Salzburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Bottled(500ml). -Looks like camomile tea with fizzy white head and tastes like elder juice. Dry elder nose. Unusual radler, my girlfriend liked it lot more than I did.
Stiegl Gaudi Radler Holunderbl�te;Salzburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Bottle. Pale golden colour with a minor mostly diminishing white head. Weird flavour and aroma of hollunder.
Stiegl Gaudi Radler Holunderbl�te;Salzburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;"Bottled: Small fothy head, pale golden color. Intensiv green apple aroma. Taste has light hollunder notes, but more apple aroma too. A unusuall radler, quite good, but like the ""Radler Himbeer"" without a real beer character and a liitle bit to sweet."
Rebellion Turmoil;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;"Typically high quality Rebellion beer; rich red/brown and providing a full malty/toffee flavour with hints of smoke and a roasted, very bitter but still malty aftertaste. (Cask at Melton Mowbray beer festival)"
Rebellion Turmoil;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;This is the August monthly ale. Cask conditioned at the Three Horseshoes, Marlow Bottom, Bucks.. Malty, loads of fruit, slightly sweet with a few hops thrown in. Very good here, it�s a shame it doesn�t seem to have been served in good condition at the GBBF. Camra�s own staff seem to be putting people off cask bitter, through keeping it badly.
Rebellion Turmoil;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the GBBF, 2004. Deep amber colour with beige fine bubbly head. Confused beer I thought. It seem to have no form or structure. There was no bitterness to hang the malts or fruits on and the beer just seemed like it either wasn�t ready or was never going to be ready.
Rebellion Turmoil;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;I�d never heard of this Rebellion beer before and couldn�t find any reference to it anywhere. Unfortunately, it didn�t seem that well conditioned - too much butterscotch and toffee in the aroma - and I have marked it up a notch to compensate. Mid copper colour Slightly sweet, mainly malty flavour. OK, but I didn�t find this beer particularly appealing. Needs a re-rate in better condition. Cask (handpump), GBBF 2004, day 1.

Cozumel Border Patrol;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Pour is brown with a nice head. The aroma is tons of roast and a touch of chocolate. Flavor is more of the same. Strong roast balanced out by the sweet chocolate. A nice job.
Cozumel Border Patrol;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Growler from the Brewery. Pours dark brown with a medium off white head. Aroma of caramel and nuts. Flavor is roasted nuts, some cocoa, and toast. Lightly hopped, but a moderate amount of sprucey hops are evident in the finish. Somewhat creamy, medium bodied.

Cozumel Border Patrol;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;On tap, Buffalo Brewfest 04. Medium brown colour, decent tan head. Lots of malt in aroma. Very malty taste, hints of chocolate and a roasted dryness. Not a bad brown, but I found it a little too unbalanced.

Titanic Olympic;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Titanic Brewery (UK);[Cask at GBBF 2004] An orange beer with a small white head. The aroma is sweet grassy, while the flavor is sweet and like a field of grass in summer time - from a lovely hop.
Titanic Olympic;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Titanic Brewery (UK);Amber beer with pronounced toffee malt, some candy sugar-like sweetness, and a strongly bitter and earthy finish, very full. Gets better towards the end! (Cask @ Marble Arch, Manchester)

Able to have a fair few this session! Original rating - 3.8 Cask at Royal Oak, Ockbrook. Great golden ale, lovely lemon gold, thick creamy white head, flowery taste with a hint of coriander, if it wasn�t for the fact that I cycled here I�d be enjoying a few more."
Titanic Olympic;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Titanic Brewery (UK);Cask Conditioned, at the GBBF, 2004. Golden with a white fluffy head. Pale and insipid looking but still OK drinking wise. Easy little session beer. Thanks to Ungstrup for this LITTLE taster. Nice work fella.
Titanic Olympic;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Titanic Brewery (UK);Pale gold colour, with a good clean taste and plenty of hop presence. Lots of citric grapefruit in the flavour and a flowery, aromatic, nose. Titanic are very good at producing beers in this style. Not overly complex, but a very palatable, refreshing drop. Just as this style of beer should be. Cask (handpump), GBBF 2004, day 1.
York Chariot of Fire;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);[Cask at GBBF 2004] A light yellow beer with a small bubbly white head.

York Chariot of Fire;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask Conditioned, at the GBBF, 2004. Pale golden beer with a fluffy white head. Thin and not inspirational enough to justify the Olympic logo but nice enough as a regular bitter. Moderate bitter length.

Sonoran Dred Double Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Strong Ale - American;Sonoran Brewing Company;On draft at Pinnacle Peak Patio. Not as good as their Stout but still very good. Poured a rich amber color with a creamy head that didn�t vanish on me. Hoppy and bitter yet with hints of fruit that made if very drinkable. A winner here.
Sonoran Dred Double Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Strong Ale - American;Sonoran Brewing Company;Tap at papago. Amber color with medium sized tan head. Aroma is full of pine hops, crisp, clean. Flavor is very bitter and hoppy, but does have a roasted malt character that reminds you that this is a red ale, however hoppy it may be.
Sonoran Dred Double Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Strong Ale - American;Sonoran Brewing Company;On tap @brewhouse. A double red ale using cascade and simcoe hops. Nice medium red color.

Buckley's Light Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Yarra Flats Brewery;Cloudy apricot with no head. Mild indistinct hoppy aroma. Taste is mostly grapefruit like sour and bitter. Texture is very thin. Very flavourful for a light ale which automatically makes it superior to other low alcohol beers, no matter what you might think of the actual taste.
Old Swan Brewery Brewers Choice;Perth, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;The Old Brewery (Australia);The Brewer�s choice to do what exactly? Tip it out? Damn shame, this looks like a lager, smells like a lager (so there is very little nose) and tastes like a lager. There is low hop presence with negligible mouthfeel. Nup
Schmankerlhof Zwickelbier;St. Georgen/Obernberg, Austria;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schmankerlhof - Pranz und Hammerer Betriebs;Sampled draught at the Brewpub Light fruity and malty aroma. Pale golden, white creamy head. Taste is light sweet, pleasant malty and light bfruity. Quite hoppy aftertaste for a m�rzen, more like a pils.
Schmankerlhof Hefeweisse Dunkel;St. Georgen/Obernberg, Austria;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Schmankerlhof - Pranz und Hammerer Betriebs;Nice brown color, creamy head, a little bit cloudy.

Illinois Pilsner;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illinois Brewing;Draft, at IBC. This was pretty cloudy. The brewer said it had just been put up last week, and clearly hadn�t had time to clear. Plus, I had the first pull of the day. So I got a beer with no head, and a bit of a berry taste. Let�s just say the guy next to me ordered a Bud Light, and I said nothing because I didn�t think this was much better.
Dinkelbr�u Dinkelbier;Wernstein, Austria;Specialty Grain - Other;Dinkelbr�u;Few aroma, light fruitzy and yeasty. Pale yellow, very much carbonation and very cloudy. White soft head. Quite sourly (lemon), light fruity but a little bit watery. Light cherry pit notes. Astringent aftertaste.
Dinkelbr�u Dunkel;Wernstein, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Dinkelbr�u;Sampled draught at the brewpub Aroma is fruity and light malty. Brown color, very much carbonation, very cloudy. Very sweet and malty, but not unpleasant. Quite strange beer, but no real highlight.
Illinois OTurleys Lyte Lager;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Illinois Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Extremely yellow in color. Smells like medicine and corny must. The flavor is water mixed with sour vinegar. Really lame.
Illinois OTurleys Lyte Lager;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Illinois Brewing;(Tap) Pours a light yellow color with a small white head. Aroma of grain. Taste is similar, with faint hop and corn flake notes. Poor palate, with metallic aftertaste. Sorry, but this beer is just plain bad.
Illinois OTurleys Lyte Lager;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Illinois Brewing;Not alot here to comment on. This pale fizzy brew had a touch of malt and a detectable light hopping to it, but it was basically thin and watery. A young couple at the bar were thrilled with it and had three each. I guess it�s a starting point for getting into micros. Illinois Brewing Company, Bloomington, IL
Illinois OTurleys Lyte Lager;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Illinois Brewing;Draft, at IBC. The same yeasty taste as their pilsner, but this has cleared a little better. There�s a halfway decent light hop note. Not too bad.
Dinkelbr�u Weizen;Wernstein, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dinkelbr�u;PAle yellow, very cloudy and much carbonation. Aroma is light fruity with notes of citrus peel. Sourly taste (lemon) with some sweetness in the end. Thirstquetching.
Illinois Wee Willy's Wheat Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Illinois Brewing;sample at Illinonis brewing co�s brewhouse in bloomington illinois. a decent american wheat if you enjoy the style.
Illinois Wee Willy's Wheat Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Illinois Brewing;Draft, at IBC. A much cleaner body than the Lager and Pislner, or rather it�s cloudy in wheat beer fashion. Some nice fruity esters, but still a few off notes.
Illinois Uptown Amber;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Illinois Brewing;On tap at GTMW 2013. Hazy caramel with a very large off-white head. Semi-sweet aroma of caramel and floral hops and some grains. Taste is balanced with caramel and floral hops and light bitterness.
Illinois Uptown Amber;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Illinois Brewing;A decent amber ale with some nice hop character. Nothing over the top, just your typical microbrewery offering. tasty.
Illinois Uptown Amber;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Illinois Brewing;of all the samples i had at IBC this one i enjoyed the most so that was the growler i bought. i will rerate when i crack the growler(hopefully soon). beautiful cloudy amber appearance. some esterey taste as described below, but i think this added to the complexity and taste in this beer while in some of the others detracted a bit.
Illinois Uptown Amber;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Illinois Brewing;Draft, at IBC This one�s had a chance to settle before being served to me. A pleasant looking amber body, still some fruity esters leading to some cider notes.
Illinois Big Beaver Brown Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Illinois Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Pours clear brown. The aroma is sweet malt a sour vinegar. The flavor is sour with a mild breath of chocolate and coffee. Another subpar beer.
Illinois Big Beaver Brown Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Illinois Brewing;It pours a deep chestnut with a tan head that does some good lacing. The nose is of sweet malts, lightly roasted malts, apples, and a slight sourness. The latter becomes pronounced both in the taste and the finish. Something wrong here. Illinois Brewing Company, Bloomington, IL
Illinois Big Beaver Brown Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Illinois Brewing;Had it on tap at the brewpub in Bloomington. Not much taste in this one, just ok.
Illinois Big Beaver Brown Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Illinois Brewing;a nice brown ale from this tiny brewery in bloomington, il. ill need to go back and try some more next time im in town. lower carbonation in this one. the fruitiness that mcdermott describes below was apparent. good beer. much of the appeal of this place is that the beer is very fresh being a brewpub and all and the only one that i am aware of in the bloomington normal area
Illinois Big Beaver Brown Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Illinois Brewing;Draft, at IBC. Still fruity after all these beers. All the beers I tried there had some estery aftertaste that may have been part of the package when brewing in the summer. Still, this went down very well and finished pretty smoothly.
Illinois Stumblin' Stout;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Stout;Illinois Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Pours not quite deep black with red on the edges. The aroma is water and weak coffee grinds. The flavor is a hint of sour and watery coffee. This is one of their cleanest beers, but it�s just not flavorful enough.
Illinois Stumblin' Stout;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Stout;Illinois Brewing;(Tap) Pours a inky black color with almost no head. Aroma of coffee and burnt toffee. Taste is similar, with a dry and slightly dusty finish. This beer was pretty good, and fantastic compared to the rest of the beers brewed at this place.
Illinois Stumblin' Stout;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Stout;Illinois Brewing;A tasty little coffee stout, quite roasty and quaffable. Nice malt balance between the bitter roast and sweeter malts..
Illinois Stumblin' Stout;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Stout;Illinois Brewing;I would�ve entered this as a dry stout, coming across much like the well known Irish stout that it seems to be emulating. Deep brown, near black in body with a creamy brown head, it has a mild aroma of roasted malt, coffee grounds, and a dash of cocoa. Same with the flavor of this smooth drink, with the addition of a light smokiness as the previous rater, LilKem, noted. Dry finish. Not bad. Illinois Brewing Company, Bloomington, IL
Illinois Stumblin' Stout;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Stout;Illinois Brewing;This was a decent stout. If I based my impression on the Illinois Brewing Co. on this beer I would say people are nuts for thinking they suck. This beer had lots of good coffee, rich chocolate, and some smoke to it. The only put off was in the aroma, and it was the ever slight hint of sweat in the aroma. The thing is, it s ever so slight whereas the Atlanta Brewing Co. always ended up with crazy terrible sweaty sock aroma. I�ll be happy to try other beers by this co. :)
Glentworth Summers End;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;[Cask at GBBF 2004] A yellow beer with no head. The aroma is sweet hoppy combined with notes of honey. The flavor is sweet, acidic, combined with notes of hop oils and citrus.

OSTO6;Prague, Czech Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Bottle. Clere golden colour with small head. Light malty apple aroma and a sweet boring taste. Watery body and a sweet watery finish.
OSTO6;Prague, Czech Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Golden colour with a small thin white head. Malty aroma with hints of apple. Malty and sweet flavor. All in all a boring beer.
OSTO6;Prague, Czech Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);"Bottled. A new beer for the new generation, with a ""twist off-cap"", obviously to lure those none-drinkers into start consuming beer? Very clear, pale golden. No hoparoma. A bit too sweet and unbalanced - no malt feel. Chemical. No bitterness interpreted."
Rialto Light Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);For the summertime, there�s really nothing to touch this. $3.50 a six pack at Trader Joe�s (compare to $7 for six Corona) made me pick it up. The clear bottles really make it look enticing, even if the color is nothing special. Smells great (after you stick a lime in it, anyway) and the flavor is the same. Limey, alcoholic, fizzy. People hating on it are drinking it for the wrong kind of reasons.
Rialto Light Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);12oz clear bottle. Light yellow color. white head. Grassy, hoppy aroma. Mildly sweet flavor with no hops. Thin and watery palate. Refreshing and surpassingly not at all skunky. The flavor is barely there, but its kinda pleasant. The new beach beer for sure. Way cheaper than Corona, and cleaner tasting too.
Rialto Light Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);12 oz bottle. Clear bottle at least it wasn�t skunked. Extra point for the huge foamy head. too bad it didn�t last longer. Aromas were Macro. Flavor was Macro. Lame!!!!!!
Rialto Light Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);La Constancia brews a number of extremy light beers for export. Cayuguama is another of theirs. Same brew, different glass bottles. This beer is very light, with just the smallest hint of grain flavour. An outlet here sells it for $4.99 a twelve pack box! It has no real flavour of its own. Rim your glass with lime and sugar. Mix an ounce of lime juice and a teaspoon of sugar into the bottom of the glass and then pour in the Rialto. Squeeze a bit of lime in after pouring and then you can enjoy this really light brew on a hot day!
Rialto Light Lager;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Pours a pale yellow color. Smells of sweet grain. Tastes kind of grainy. A little fizzy. Same style as a Corona Light, except it is better and cheaper.

Iron Hill K�lsch;North Wales, Pennsylvania, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Iron Hill North Wales;Pours a golden color with a white soapy head that lingers. Aroma of bread, toasted malt, and fruit. Fruit sweetness with bread, and toasted malts. Easy drinking summer beer. Not a big Kolsch fan, but this one is quite nice.
Iron Hill K�lsch;North Wales, Pennsylvania, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Iron Hill North Wales;20120701 tap at IH Lancaster. Golden color beneath small lasting white head. Aroma is somewhat bready, or pizza doughish, with a slightly musty hop note. Flavor is full on cereal, maybe Kix, plus maize, and only a touch of earthy hops. Not too exciting, and perhaps more premium lager like than Kolsch but what the hell it was good enough. Gotta love a place where even the stuff you like least is still acceptably good.
Iron Hill K�lsch;North Wales, Pennsylvania, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Iron Hill North Wales;IH kolsch... clean crisp aroma, lightly fruity, not very lively, grassy toasty, not lively, easy easy drinking, watery in a way... nice flavorful kolsch, doesn�t have that sweetness associated this bad kolsch�s... 6 4 6 4 13
Iron Hill K�lsch;North Wales, Pennsylvania, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Iron Hill North Wales;Nitro at IH Pville. Pours a lightly hazy golden with a creamy white head. Aroma of cheerios, wheat, citrus hops and grassy notes. Flavor of cheerios, banana, citrus and wheat.
Iron Hill K�lsch;North Wales, Pennsylvania, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Iron Hill North Wales;Draft at Maple Shade. Poured a mundane looking thin super light colored straw body under a small fizzy bright white head, is this a macro? Aroma is all cereal and grains with a slight touch of corn and vegetables. The body is watery with strong carbonation. Luckily the flavor really steps it up with lots of fresh slightly sweet cereal grains and super crisp grassy hops. Not much to look at smell but the flavor really came through.
Town Hall Thunderstorm Summer Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sample at GABF 10/08/2016, thanks to my sis for assistance with note-taking. The beer is a hazy orange color with a medium thin off-white head that burns away quickly. Spotty lacing. Yeast, citrus and malt aroma. Medium body with flavors of Citrus, herbal yeast, malt and slight hops. The finish is fruity with a yeast and orange aftertaste. Decent overall.
Town Hall Thunderstorm Summer Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;5 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 7-24-16. Nice, clear, bright bronze. Small to moderate amount of long-lasting cream to beige head. Stately and likable appearance. Weak, vaguely lemony smell. Much more powerful and sweet flavor. Both lemongrass and honey are unmistakable. Herbal, grassy, lemony, honeyed taste. Herbality is a nice contrast to the honey sweetness, but, nonetheless, it ends up far too sweet for my preferences. Harsh in its strong flavors at first and grates on multiple sips. Medium body, light for the ABV. Somewhat lively, frothy, and smooth in the palate. The aroma gets a 5 for blandness. The flavor gets a 4 for excess. Not up my alley.
Town Hall Thunderstorm Summer Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap - average size foamy head, medium gold color, sweet honey aroma and flavor, maybe some mild citrus in the background, good combo of flavors, hard to put a finger on much specific, crisp finish, definitely good overall though ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Town Hall Thunderstorm Summer Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap at Town Hall Tap. Unfortunately, I didn�t catch it was a summer ale so I think that contributes to its lack of quality. Orange with minimal head. Aroma brings to mind brown sugar, honey, and maple as expected. Taste is......not good. A little flat. Honey is there but somehow still not sweet. Slightly metallic. Alcohol comes through at the end in a burnt sugar kind of way. I would not recommend. Go for Town Hall Tap�s guest beers instead.
Town Hall Thunderstorm Summer Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Very interesting beer. Lots of citrus and floral aromas. Similar flavours. Sweet flower and orange flavours. Nice Belgian seasonal.

Town Hall Thunderstorm Summer Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Poured on- tap into a pint glass. A. Beautiful dark honey brown color. 1-2mm head that faded to a nice thin ring. S. Fresh honey, lilac, Fresh flowers smell. This beer smells like walking outside on a summer day. It really is just something different and great. T. A wonderfully smooth honey and lemon flavor. A sweet tingle of lilac. M. A nice smooth dryness with a slightly coarse finish. Light on the tongue and very easy to drink. O. This is something completely different for me. I�m normally a dark beer person. But this is something that I could drink year round and feel like I am laying in a summer meadow. This is another impressively different beer from Town Hall.

Big Time Legacy - Dry Hopped;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Sampled @ brewery, cask version. Foamy tan head with weird gray bubbles on the top... looks like whole wheat bread. I hope those aren�t little bugs or something. Appearance is slightly murky orange. Smooth and creamy nuts, sap, and olive-like hop flavors - I know that sounds weird. Sweet yeast with some vegetable qualities. Nose resembles a barley wine, with some alcohol, grain and maple... a little hops in there as well. Very harsh palate.

Aroma of toffee and berries plus sweet, toasty crumb cake and a light edge of tobacco. Medium sweet with good German malt qualities, moderate Noble hop flavors, and a firm bitter and toasty finish. A nice, full-flavored altbier.
John Harvards Alt Bier;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sample at the Pittsburgh location. Clear amber color with a medium thin off-white head that lasts pretty well. Sweet aroma of malt and caramel. Medium-bodied, borderline thin at times, with roasted malt and nut flavors. Just a bit of hops are present too. The finish is roasty and lightly bitter and ultimately short-lived. This one is fairly average in all respects.
John Harvards Alt Bier;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Rich, red-bronze. Very clear. Sweetish cereal aroma. Grainy, medium tartness. Cereal, medium-light bittering. Medium-light body. Goes watery. A rather flaccid interpretation of a style that I�m usually inclined to be charitable towards. Nutty sweetness in the finish.
John Harvards Alt Bier;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sampled at manchester, ct location. Pours a slightly hazy medium to deep amber, light tan head. Aroma is a bit dirty- modest amounts of yeast in the way, bready, very sweet toffee and some maple syrup character. Definitely not as clean as it could have been. Flavor was very sweet- almost too sweet, sugary, not like the toasted and nutty sweet balance you get from uerige. Ok finish, but still a bit dirty, and not really hoppy in the finish. Too sweet.
John Harvards Alt Bier;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On draught in Monroeville. Mild sweet aroma and a bit malty. Light dusty papery hop bitterness. Dry with some nuttiness. Medium amber hazy with thin off-white lacing head. Medium watery body with medium carbonation. Starts with mild nuttiness and good malt character. Carbonic acidity. Medium hops bitter at the finish with light astringency. Decent tasting ale but not up to par with true German alts - though most U.S. knock-offs aren�t, so that�s not really a detraction of the overall rating.
John Harvards Alt Bier;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);2005 GABF Gold Medal winner. Sampled from Growler courtesy of weeare138. Poured a medium and clear mahogany color with a very small sized off white head. Aromas and tastes of caramel, citrus, nuts and yeast. Thinner body.
John Harvards Alt Bier;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);2005 GABF Gold Medal... Poured an amber color with a thin, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus fruits, light earth, caramel malt, some rauch, and a bit of toffee as well. Taste of more caramel malt, earthy yeast, nuts, and low bitterness.
John Harvards Alt Bier;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Draught @ Wayne, PA: Almost no aroma. Just a bit of malt scent. Nice medium brown color. Medium white head. Good lacing. Flavor was malty, nutty, and a bit yeasty, like horseblanket. An easy drink. Not bad, but not the best Alt.
Philadelphias Hefeweizen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Philadelphias Steaks and Hoagies Brewpub;Musky aroma, I do not like this one as well without the generous addition of ginger. big fruity frozen banana nose, lots of tartness and acidity from the lemons and sour and tart in the finish. Unbalanced and one sided.
Philadelphias Hefeweizen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Philadelphias Steaks and Hoagies Brewpub;Murky light yellow. Very fresh and active flavor and palate. Bananas, high carbonation, sweet lemons... basically a light summer hefe.
Philadelphias Hefeweizen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Philadelphias Steaks and Hoagies Brewpub;Pours a hazy yellow color with a small white head. Wheaty floral aroma with a sour apple hint to it. Taste was very fruity, with apple, and a citrus/grassy taste. Very thin and watered down with a kinda herb funk going on that was really bad.
Philadelphias Independence Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Philadelphias Steaks and Hoagies Brewpub;Whilst I�d drink this almost any day over a PBR, I can�t put it in the league of most Oregon IPAs. The last pint I tried had a vapid head and homebrew characteristics. Quite bitter and choice in color, but wrongfully carbonated and only mediocre at best. I will give it another try in the future.
Philadelphias Independence Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Philadelphias Steaks and Hoagies Brewpub;mmmm buttery diacetyl, this was ruined completely for me. You could barely make out the other flavors and this seems just based on that that this could be a semi-decent IPA, but ends up being muddled in bacteria.
Philadelphias Independence Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Philadelphias Steaks and Hoagies Brewpub;Oregon. Burnt orange peel and some nutty, butter and chemical hop notes in the aroma. Weird, woody, sweet orange flavor. Not my kind of IPA.
Philadelphias Independence Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Philadelphias Steaks and Hoagies Brewpub;Pours a cloudy orange with a small white head. Slightly malty aroma with a citrus hop backing. Taste had a strange bitterness to it, not very hoppy, just bitter, with a kinda sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel was very thin.

Soooooo glad I didn�t provide this guy, although I did talk him into picking this up. Oh well. Clear light yellow color with a bit of head. Odor of skunk, there is no other way around it. This is skunked. Well it�s in a clear bottle so what the hell do you expect? Maybe a little bit of grain on the nose but geez... Tastes of bad grains right away with skunk taking a back seat. The bitter grain fulfills the other flavors as well, with a bitter finish. Not a pleasant finish and aftertaste.
Warsteiner HiLight;Warstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Warsteiner Brauerei;Very light beer, almost invisible in color, palate and flavor. Refreshing in a water kind of way, taste skews towards pilsner.

Warsteiner HiLight;Warstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Warsteiner Brauerei;Appearance: Pours a light yellow body as clear as the bottle that housed it. Topped with a smattering of white suds. Smell: Lightly grainy, lightly sweetish nose punctuated by some skunky notes. Taste: Sweet grains given an added bonus dusting of powdered sugar. Mercifully, there�s only a touch of skunkiness from these clear bottles. No apparent hop flavor, but you are treated to a very low hint of bitterness. Still finishes sweet though. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: Unenjoyable and unrewarding. It�s blandly sweet with nothing else to offer.

Warsteiner HiLight;Warstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Warsteiner Brauerei;Bottle. Pours a clear yellow golden with a small frothy white head leaving decent spotty lacing. The aroma is a skunky corn malt. Thin mouthfeel with a skunky light corn malt flavor and metallic finish. Hard to put down nothing going on with this one. Why would anyone use this weird green in a clear bottle, almost to say stay clear of this beer.

Triple fff Sumer is Icumin;Alton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Triple fff Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at Kingston Beer Festival on 13 May 2011. A strong golden beer. Decent condition. Fruity aroma - pears and apricots spring to mind. Clean and fruity on the palate. Slightly sweet for my taste. Very easygoing and easy-drinking for a 6% job. Maybe a touch bit short of presence for a strong beer but pleasant and enjoyable enough. Could be dangerous though.

W�rzburger Hofbr�u Jubil�umsbier;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);"The beer pours a luminous gold with a generous bright white creamy head that lingers long, after its final demise; the lace forms a velum like sheet, to circumnavigate the glass. Nose has a soapy malt sweetness, citrus like in its crispness, pleasant to sniff. Start is modestly sweet, light bitter bite at the back, top is light to medium in feel. Finish has a sparkling acidity, the hops delectable in their spicy bite, quite dry aftertaste, and a fine drinking beer that would definitely make a nice session beer."

Meads Of Mercia The Bees Knees;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Teme Valley Brewery;500ml bottle from Orchard Hive & Vine, drunk at Kookfest, September 2006. Rare to find a braggot, so interesting to try. Mid brown colour. The honey is noticeable but not overwhelming. Smells a bit old, musty and cardboardy. A bit dull. The bottle was getting on a bit so may have been better when fresher.
Meads Of Mercia The Bees Knees;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Teme Valley Brewery;Bottle. Have to agree with silk that this is a bit of a mess, but a mess that surprisingly tastes very decent. This has some light honey character.

Meads Of Mercia The Bees Knees;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Teme Valley Brewery;Bottle conditioned, from The Offie in Leicester. Faintly hazy chestnut red, good lasting fluffy off white head, gentle condition although gushed a little on opening. Delicate honey and hops initially in the nose but with a slight beef stock note developing, some malt and a hint of soapiness. Full bodied but unimpressive in the mouth with some malt and a touch of sweetness but becoming harsh and cheap-homebrewy towards the end. Doesn`t get any better in the finish, with some rough bitterness lingering.
Three Needs Alpha Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pint. Hazy golden colors with big cascading bubbles (no head, thanks barkeep). 95 IBUs according to the chalkboard. Big citrus nose. Initially sweet and then hugely hoppy and bitter.

Three Needs Alpha Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Pint at the brewpub. Slightly hazy light bronze-copper, smallish quick-dying head. Dry, grapefruity-orangy nose, hint of pepper, quite strong. On the tongue, lightly sweet at first, but hugely hoppy almost immediately...dry and lightly smoky, massively bitter, a bit light and watery; yet somehow the hops don�t quite burn and the beer remains very drinkable and pleasant. Powerful for sure, but still a fairly easy-drinking pint on a humid day."

Elevator Xtra;Columbus, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Elevator Brewing Company;Objectively speaking: Quite a spot-on Kolsch, though perhaps a bit too vegetal. I like: Felt it much more deversing than its current score indicates. Clean and gentle ale with soft noble hops notes that linger with their flowery notes. I�m partial to hallertauer. Gentle grassy finish. Light and soft maltiness. I would not mind a second glass. I dislike: Almost a greenish tint to the hue. Celery notes disturb the overall poise.
Southampton Cuvee des Fleurs;Southampton, New York, United States;Saison/Farmhouse - Flavored;Southampton Publick House;8.2% ABV- Wasn't sure what this would be like.....saison explains it. About what I expected. Flavor is a little weird at first, but not too funky. Some flowery sweetness with the Rose Water and all, but balanced out by decent hop finish. Grassy and earthy feel. Lots of carbonation. Not one of my favorite styles...worth the half price on clearance though.

Southampton Cuvee des Fleurs;Southampton, New York, United States;Saison/Farmhouse - Flavored;Southampton Publick House;January 10th, 2017 - Barron�s, a fancy new grocery store in North Park, has just moved into a spot once occupied by some other forgettable grocery chain. But Barron�s is not forgettable. Among the goodies they delight customers with, including fresh food bars all over the store, is a rich and plentiful beer selection. On the corner of one aisle were featured two affordable Southampton beers, and so I begin with the lighter of the two: the Cuvee des Fleurs. Cloudy and orange with a marmalade density, it supports a meaty head of white fluff. A swirl and a tilt and I catch a scent that seems lightly floral at first. And then it seems intensely floral, like a walk through a botanical garden, kissed by tangerine and apple sauce. The body puffs up with good foam and carbonation, and pushes to the corners of the tongue a good flavorful mixture of flower and tangerine, with a snooty soapy touch on the aftertaste. Mostly dry, and brewed with a deliberate emphasis on flowers, this is a good beer that shows off the balance necessary for a botanical brew.
Southampton Cuvee des Fleurs;Southampton, New York, United States;Saison/Farmhouse - Flavored;Southampton Publick House;750ml bottle best before April 25th 2018. Smells and tastes of earthy malt, almost honey like, lemony dry hop bitterness, white pepper, champagne like carbonation. A delicious and very drinkable Saison!

Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, rose water, lavender, mint, flowers, herbal, grass, pepper, clove, honey, biscuit, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, flowers, and bready malt notes; with great strength.

Good amount of peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, rose water, lavender, mint, flowers, herbal, grass, pepper, clove, honey, biscuit, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, flowers, and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible flower spiced saison style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, flowers, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. The flower spice flavors were incredibly well balanced and complimenting to the saison style character. Really impressed me. A highly enjoyable offering."

Soft banana clove aromas with a light white bread foundation. Earthed wheat and banana spice remain balanced and bland. Watery and thin with light carbonation. This one needs some serious help�
Front Street El Hefe;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Front Street Brewery (NC);"Presented as an ""organic"" heffe - well, who knows? How can you tell by the taste? Anyway, it had a great cloudy Heffe appearance. Aroma was nice, couldn�t say this had any banana, but the spicyness was there. Flavor had a nice ""ka-zing"" and finished with a full fruitiness."
Front Street El Hefe;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Front Street Brewery (NC);Listed as organic on the board. Hazy orange color. spicy phenolic aroma. Lemon, banana and spice
Front Street El Hefe;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Front Street Brewery (NC);Date: 08/23.08, draft at Front Street Brewing in Wilmington, NC Aroma - Fairly classic hefe aroma with banana esters and clove, neither of which is overpowering Appearance - Hazy yellow/orange, head is somewhat small for a hefe, but some good rings of sticky lace Flavor - Starts with some honey sweetness, followed quickly by a mild lemony tartness, and finally a soft spicy bitterness right at the finish. Palate - Light to medium body, medium carbonation, clean palate, Overall - A decent hefe, drinkable, refreshing, perhaps on the conservative side for the style, and this is not a criticism.
Front Street El Hefe;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Front Street Brewery (NC);Pours cloudy brown yellow color with foamy film on top. Aroma banana very much with lots of spice. Flavor sweet banana, lemon and dough with much spiciness.

Front Street El Hefe;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Front Street Brewery (NC);Draught at the brewpub. Pours cloudy yellow with bubbly white head. The aroma is dried leaves, banana, some spicy clove notes, and a hint of fruit. The flavor is acidic and somewhat lemony at first, then grass and lemon. Tart finish with some bready notes. Pretty good.
Front Street El Hefe;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Front Street Brewery (NC);Poured a murky orange-tan color. Heavy on the orange. Light on the carbonation. Aroma was full of orange and wheat. Flavor was a conglomeration of wheat, orange, cloves, lemon and just a slight hint of hope. However, there was not much in the way of a balance with the traditional hefe flavors. The orange flavor was also a bit too akin to simple orange juice for me. Kind of made me think they just mixed some O.J. with the beer after fermentation. Medium to full mouthfeel with the wheat giving this beer a nice body. Easy enough to drink but not one of the better takes on the style I have sampled.

Exe Valley Exeter Old Bitter;Exeter, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Exe Valley Brewery;Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys, London as Exe Valley Exeter Old Bitter, 4.8%. Louty crowd here tonight. Dark amber orange, still and translucent with a scummy tan head. Aroma is airy, bready, musty. Plain and even a bit vegetal later on. Body is quite light with tingly carbonation for cask. Taste is thin and watery, then hints at green apple and soap before a punch of redeeming malts come out of nowhere in the finish. The first impression of this was pretty much catastrophic. I�ve never had a beer that tastes this thin and insipid up front only to finish so smooth and malty. There is very little hop bitterness and it drinks like a pale mild. Overall, this is surprisingly easy drinking and pretty unique - took me by surprise anyway. But still way below average.

It figures the finest beer I had on a trip to Asheville was one that was not previously listed. The beer arrived with a medium/dark-weiss color and a full white head.

Much fuller-bodied than expected for the style. I hope this one stays around for a while.

JW Dundees American Amber Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);From Oct 2007 This pours from 12oz bottle a clear amber-red with a 2 finger head of foam that shrinks to a fine but solid layer at the end of the session. The smell has some caramel malt and a light fruit nose to it. The taste has notes of caramel malt, some roasted malt, a faint hint of hops, and not much else. It finishes slightly bitter but more so on the watery side. I was hoping for better because I'm a pretty big fan of the Pale Ale but I've found HFs other offerings are pretty mediocre. Maybe the IPA will be to my liking....

JW Dundees American Amber Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Sept 2006: This was bought in the UK, part of a JW Dundee�s Craft Beers of America Pack. It poured beautifully into a Berliner Kindl 0.4 Litre straight glass, large creamy head on a clear amber body of liquid. No great smell, its smell and taste reminded me of a Dusseldorf Alt, which as a lager: shouldn�t but that was my thoughts. Delicate mouthfeel and drinkable, not what I was expecting, but overall, I liked it.
JW Dundees American Amber Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);26th August 2007 Warning! Early amateur rating! Brown lager! Malty with a very subtle fruit note. Sweeter malt finish.
JW Dundees American Amber Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);The High Falls Brewing Company, the maker of the JW Dundee�s line of beers, has really put me through the ringer lately. Having bought their mix pack, I find most of the beers are average in quality, and their Amber Lager is no exception. It certainly drinks like a lager, though, as it�s pretty direct and an overall simple beer. It�s by no means bad, but there isn�t anything special about it, either. POUR, COLOR AND AROMA I�m not sure why they decided to name it �Amber Lager� since it�s really more of a straight brown or light-red hue rather than a dark gold. I was a little perplexed upon first pouring this beer since it looks more like apple cider than beer.. It forms a small layer of head, most of which dissipates, but there is definitely a lingering effect throughout. There is also heavy carbonation action which slows down as the beer is drank. As for aroma, there isn�t anything distinctive to it. It�s a bit stronger smelling of hops and malts than your average lager, but not in a pleasing way. Of course, I�d much rather whiff this beer than Bud or Miller. TASTE I can�t remember a beer being as inconsistent in taste as JW Dundee�s Amber Lager. It starts out with a strong hoppy flavor, but soon becomes flat and watery. This beer has a bit of a bite to it, but not in an appealing way such as with Sam Adams Boston Lager. It�s just very bitter and not very pleasing to the palate. As the beer is drunk I notice its taste continues to flatten. It�s as if it�s watering itself down, like when you put an ice cube into soda and by the end it tastes like soda-flavored water. This brew is seemingly doing such a thing to itself if that makes any sense. At least it finishes very clean and is fairly smooth throughout the life of the beer. Lightweights and novice drinkers will probably find this much more appealing than the average beer snob. BODY As a lager goes, Amber Lager is definitely fuller in body than your run-of-the-mill American lager, but as a craft beer it�s fairly average in weight. It�s not extremely filling, but if you were looking for a beer you could go through quickly and easily this might not be your best choice. FINAL THOUGHTS JW Dundee�s Amber Lager is one of the strangest beers I can recall drinking. How can a beer�s taste change so often in just 12 ounces? I�d certainly prefer it to any mass-market brew, but as a craft beer it has a long way to go to become impressive. As an inclusion to the JW Dundee�s mix pack it�s certainly drinkable, but not very memorable.

Appearance: Clear amber color with a small, off-white head. Poor head retention. Aroma: Caramel, butterscotch, and apple notes. Flavor: Follows the nose with caramel, some butter notes and apple. Clearly some brewing errors here. Palate: Medium carbonation with a medium mouthfeel and a short finish. Overall: Pitiful. Not recommended.
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 oz bottle purchased in Birmingham, Alabama. Thanks for the memories, you were great! Pours an amber color. One finger or so beige head. Poor retention, okay lacing. Yeah yeah, but the thing that stands out the most is that white floaty stuff in this beer. Lots and lots of it. Ordinarily, I like it, but this is ridiculous. Aroma is malty. Floral hops, earthy hops. Meh. Taste is sweet. Malty. Hoppy, but not bitter. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied. Kinda boring. Overall it's not so great. Boring. I wouldn't buy it again. I wouldn't recommend it either.
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"From Oct 2005 Poured from the bottle a good amber colour with a nice head that settled into a 1/4""layer that stayed for the entire session. The taste is very malty/grainy with just a smidgeon of hops in the background and, another plus in my book is that the carbonation is not overly done. The bottle says ""Full Flavor"" and it certainly is that. For me, this Pale worked and is very drinkable especially considering that I got the 6 pack for US$4.99. Great value for the money, imho."
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle, from US. Backlog entry. Entering my historic scores for US beers whilst visiting New York. No tasting notes kept, just rating.
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Poured from a 12oz. bottle. Appearance: Copper colored, murky body with a 1 finger head that dissipates fast. Smell: Aromatic, mild hoppiness that hints of bitterness. Taste: Small bitterness hits, hints of hops with a resin, pine-like aftertaste. Mouthfeel: More pine followed by woody taste but also a little bit watery at the end. Not much more. Drinkability: I found it was kind of a 1-note beer, not very complex & lacked a hop bite to it. Not tedious but not an eventful tasting either.
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Mix pack fodder. ""Generic pale with a slight cardboard taste. No real hop presence. Ugh."
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Originally rated on 8/6/08. My second offering from the Dundee sampler 12 pack. Had a nice hoppy aroma when i opened the bottle. Poured a mid copper colored body with plenty of carbonation, with a thin off white head. Taste of hops but a little bland. Overall a fairly decent beer, and i would drink this again.
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a clear golden color with white head. Not too malty but not too happy either
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/3/2015. Pours slightly hazy orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and light floral earthiness. Pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops and dark/bready malt notes; with fairly weak strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, light pine, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, pine, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance, complexity, and robustness of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is a very solid pale ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Balanced brew but flavor and aroma are both a bit suppressed. Slightly weak as if adapted for mass consumption.
Dundee Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"""not bad, but i�m not a huge fan either. this kinda leans towards the english style even though no labeled as such. firm, malty backbone with only a moderate bitterness and low level floral and citrus notes."""
Moriau Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;"Thank you for sharing JorisPPattyn! 750 ml. bottle sampled @ ""De grote Black Tuesday Tasting"". Purchased in 1987! Tasted to side-by-side with a kriek from the same era (brewery or blender unknown). Dark red amber, no head. Nos is mellow vinegar, puckering, sourish with interesting sour cherry juice layered on top. Taste is oxidized candy, sour puckering, vinegar, sour cherry juice, oak,�Easy to drink, body showing some signs of age but easy to drink, works well. A bit hard to pinpoint but as odd as those flavor combinations sounded, as good did this one taste."
Moriau Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;"2000 Vintage. 750mL bottle at Grote Dorst, pours a hazy amber orange with a small beige head. Aroma brings out faded cherries, some sweetness, and jam - not a lot of funk. Flavour is fairly jammy and lightly sweet, with very subtle funk. Not very complex at all; very simplistic. Drinkable, but not a superior lambic, especially for a 14 year old one. Another disappointing old filtered kriek."
Moriau Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;Bottle at Grote Dorst, 2000 vintage. Clear red copper with white head. Aroma of syrupy cherries, grassy notes, light oxidization, slightly dusty, mild well rounded lambic funk. Taste is sweet, mild fruity tartness, light herbal finish. Palate is light bodied with light carbonation. A sweetned lambic that still has a great authentic fruit character and a really well rounded mouthfeel. Easy drinking.
Moriau Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;Bottle (750 ml) @ In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst. Vintage 2000. Slightly hazy amber with a small off-white head and little lacing. Aroma is of sweetness cherries, but I imagine the sweetness has mellowed a lot with the age. There�s also leafy notes, wooden notes and hints of acidity. Taste is slightly sweet with a nice fruitiness (even though it�s sweetened, it doesn�t taste artificial) with a very light sourness, wooden notes, oxidation and leafy presence. Light body. Low carbonation. Slightly sirupy mouthfeel. Not the best Kriek available, but definitely impressive for a 14 years old sweetnened one. Drinkable and enjoyable. A fun experience.
Moriau Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;Murky red brown, pinkish head. Plentifull cherry aroma, yoghurt. Very fruity & sweet. Medium body, sparkly mouthfeel.

Moriau Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;"RBESG 2010, Grand Tasting, bottle Cloudy dark amber color, with red shades; small head. Nice ripe cherry aroma, sweet. Some cherry juice flavor, some sweetness, lightly oxidized, the sourness is present but low. Nothing special."
Moriau Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;This bottle -shared with Mikkel is from around 1985. The lable ws hardly readable and one could say that it is unfair to rate this beer when its that old - But hey - you just take in to consideration that its a kriek that old and then I think we will be fine. The pour is pink and pretty thin - it kinda reminds me off ligt strawberrie flavour water. It has a tiny white head. The aroma has still a major cherry atitude but is follow by cork and vinegar. The taste is actually still fine even though its 25 years old - amazing. Its still fresh and sour with lots of cherries and without any oxydation. The palate is medium with a dry mouthfeel. Thx for sharing
Moriau Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;Red brown with a small pink head. Slightly dusty cellar and funk aroma with cherry and almond. Dry and tart cherry flavour with almond notes and funk
Rock Bottom Boston Maximus;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rock Bottom Boston;(Draught) Pours a clear golden body with a small off-white head. Aroma of citrus, banana, bubble gum, and light herbs. Flavor of citrus, candi sugar, and some herbal qualities.
Rock Bottom Boston OSheas Dry Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Boston;Amber brown. One finger head remains. Caramel and malted barley scent. Light oak scent. Taste is akin to a honey brown ale with a more oak or malted barley finish. Not very stout like. Almost no carbonation on the mouth swish. Poor aftertaste.
Rock Bottom Boston OSheas Dry Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Boston;Tap at Rock Bottom Boston, MA. I didn�t like too much. The beer was not cold, thin foamy, black body. Aroma and flavor is roasted malt. Not special like the others..
Rock Bottom Boston OSheas Dry Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Boston;Had on cask at the brewpub. About the only thing I can really say about it is it poured a dark black color. Other than that, it didn�t seem to have much aroma or taste at all. Almost seemed watered down.
Rock Bottom Boston OSheas Dry Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Boston;A really weak stout. Watery and thin like the rest of the beers in the sampler, with the exception of the bock and the IPA. Some roasted malt flavor. No finish or any other flavors. This is probably my least favorite stout ever
Rock Bottom Boston OSheas Dry Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Boston;Sampled @ Rock Bottom in Boston with the Mad_Indian. Pours dark with a large beige head. Aroma of roasted malts and earthy hops. The flavor is roast, nuts, with a dry metallic finish. The body was once again watery. This was the third brew i tried at this brewpub, and all three were watery. After those three brews, we decided to call it a night there.
Rock Bottom Boston OSheas Dry Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Boston;Sampled with Stegosaurus during our second Boston Tour. Served at Rock Bottom. Black pour. Mild Roast inthe aroma. Watery in taste. There is a guy in the brewing area acting like a scientist but I tell you it has got to be an act, because their beers are so thin and watery and lack any imagination. Steg and I thought it was colored water with mild beer presence. Maybe their tap lines were screwed up. This really is Rock Bottom.
Guinness Extra Stout 5.0% (Continental Europe);Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Bottle. Aroma- quite weak, but pleasant. More toasted than roasted maltiness, with a bit milky note. Dark brown, clear, with a medium-low, good looking beige head. Taste- quite sweet, especially for a Dry Stout. Feels like a latte. Minimal roastiness in the aftertaste. Low bodied, with a low carbonation. Not so bad.

Williamsburg Summer Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Had this on draft at County Grill on 8-14-04. Pours an amber body with no head. Not surprising because it is draft. Aroma is sort of wheaty but there�s an obvious citrus aroma, mainly lemon, along with mild hops. Taste is a stronger taste of wheat and more fruit coming through. The hops are light and there is a minimal spice flavor. Palate is light and sort of crisp while being very refreshing. Perfect summer beer. Finish is sort of lemon tinged tartness mixed with light spice and malt. Good beer but it leans toward the lemon a tad too much. One of Williamsburg�s best.
Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout - Oak Aged;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Divide Brewing Company;I liked this better than the regular Yeti. Not too oaky and balances out the flavor a bit. Heavy chocolate, some coffee, vanilla, etc. Appearance really doesn't get any better. Jet black with a dark mocha colored head. A buddy poured me a glass to sample from his bomber, but this is something I would grab to try again.
Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout - Oak Aged;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Divide Brewing Company;Nose: Cocoa, vanilla, espresso coffee, sweet oak, cranberries, lingonberries and some cardboard (but not unpleasant). Taste: Rich body, medium to rich carbonation, Slightly sweet arrival but this is quickly balanced by a lot of well integrated (hops) bitterness, making this beer nicely balanced. In the mouth its very much about strong, heavily roasted coffees, like French roasted arabica, Italian espresso etc.The aftertaste is long and dominated by coffee, seamlessly integrated hops bitterness and hints of vanilla. Rich, well balanced and tasty Imperial Stout but perhaps a bit one dimensional in the mouth (is it more about punch than complexity...?).
Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout - Oak Aged;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Great Divide Brewing Company;0,33l bottle. Pours jet-black with brown head. Aroma of coffee, roast, sweet, coffee bean powder, cocoa powder, vanilla, slight bourbon and wood influence. Taste is big, sweet, coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, slight dark fruit, slightly hoppy in the finish.

Founders Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);9/2/18. On tap at the brewery. Clear dark golden pour, think apple juice, under a small off-white head that sticks. Light aroma, doughy, crisp, hint of grass. Clean enough flavor, doughy pale malts, pils malts, a crisp bitterness, touch of grass and spice. Tasty enough.
Founders Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders Brewery. Clear straw yellow with a thin white crown. Aroma is faint and pale with light coriander and malt. Taste is mildly sweet with pale malts and all too reminiscent of the pale fizzy yellow stuff. Didn�t care for this one.
Founders Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);12oz Draught from Taproom. Appearance is clear, golden color with little, off-white head. Aroma is grainy malts and grass. Taste is similar with flavors of grains, is unit, and mild grassy hops. Palate is light-bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a sweet finish. Not quite comparable to the original Cologne variety - missing some of the crispness - but a reasonable facsimile.
Founders Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Tap and Mallet Goose Island versus Founders event. Yup, its a Kolsch, one of the most unexciting styles on earth, and the Germans at their lowest. Gold, clear. Grassy nose. Mild German hops in the palate. Clean, boring.
Founders Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);A little better than the solid gold. Pours with medium lacing - also solid gold. Has some of the more odd ball pronounced malt consistent with style but nothing mind blowing. Crisp leave, some sweetness. Tap at brewpub.
Founders Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders last weekend. Light grain with a fairly pronounced lemon character. Very dry. Quite drinkable, but nothing too exciting.
Founders Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. This was pretty disappointing overall. Clear straw body, thin off-white head. Served too cold to detect much aroma, but I did pick up on some grassy hops. Flavor is lightly sweet, biscuity, and grassy, hinting at corn sugars. Tight carbonation. Overall there just isn�t much going on here.

Heavyweight B.O.R.I.S.;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Pours a thick black color with maybe a quarter inch of tan foam. Minimal head retention, no lacing to speak of. Bold and full aroma of coffee, chocolate, and dried plum. Big and malty flavor, full of dark roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, sweeter chocolate, molasses, and tart raisin (you know how usually they are sweet, but every once in a while you get a tart one? � that�s the flavor). Nice roasted grain in the finish � though mellow rather than harsh, with some oily tobacco (reminded me of the sticky end of a cigar butt � really, it did) and just a touch alcoholic in the aftertaste. Thick and smooth at the same time, moderate carbonation.
Heavyweight B.O.R.I.S.;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Pour is black with a thin brown head...smell is wonderfully roasty and chocolatey with some of the expected hints of coffee...flavor was sharp and much less roasty and much more fruity...like an older English impy...lots of prune and cherry...finish was strangely metallic...
Heavyweight B.O.R.I.S.;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavyweight Brewing Company;From a 750mL Bottle. Deep black, shiny pour with a thin layer of well roasted head. Delicious aromas of dark chocolate, prunes, and other berries come together nicely, accented by a hint of spice and an interesting floral character. Full bodied, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Wow, this palate is amazing. Some sour cherries start out the flavor parade, giving this brew an intensely deep tart fruit character without being at all excessive. This tart fruitiness then gives way to more flavors of molasses and dark prunes, followed by yet another layer of rich, velvety chocolate. The chocolate then drys up the palate a bit, ending in a final smack of well roasted kona coffee. Each sip is left to be slowly savored, revealing each delicate layer carefully, and each flavor phase different enough to repeatedly relish them for the first time. Simply amazing!
Heavyweight B.O.R.I.S.;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Dark blackish pour, with aromas of roasty dark malt, tart cherry and berry notes, plus some oaky and scotchy notes. Some roasty malt, brown sugar, molasses, tart fruit, and fine maduro cigar notes in the flavor. Very complex and well balanced.

A-Mazing, thanks Cornboy!
Heavyweight B.O.R.I.S.;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Last HWOH- thanks to Cornboy for sharing his bottle with us. I think he shared another bottle about 6 months prior that was stellar! This one had maybe passed its peak a bit, but was still awesome. This is still one of my favorite impy stouts ever! Pours a deep dark black, has a slihgtly viscous body and a thin lasting dark beige head. Aroma is intensly roasted malts, some chocolate, a dry acrid burnt malt character and moderately sweet caramel malts- a bit of fruity esters and a hint of tobacco. Flavor is dry roasted bitterness, some balanced sweet malts, toffee, a bit of brown sugar, and molasses and a bit more tobacco in the end. Nice clean smooth bitterness in the end. Body has become a bit past its prime- I remember it to be much fuller, but it is still pretty nice. Oxidation overall has been kept to a minimum with only a very slight hint of soy as it warmed in my glass. Very nice overall.
Heavyweight B.O.R.I.S.;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Thanks to footbalm for sharing this one at DLD06. Aroma of raisins, chewy caramel, other dried fruits and tons of roasty chocolate. Black in color with some brown showing through the edges. Roasted chocolate flavors with a bacon like smokiness. Medium body, fairly crisp...not as cloying as some other Imperial Stouts.
Heavyweight B.O.R.I.S.;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavyweight Brewing Company;750-DLD06-thanks to who brought this beer to the tastings-its been on my most wanted list for about 3 years. 98% black with a small tan/kacki swirling head. big oxidized note of chared and black patent malt here. Char, dusty ester, black currants, and aged dark malt dominate the flavors. some notes of licorice on the finish. alcohol is well hidden due to age. body is medium and balanced. Pretty nice. i wonder how old the bottle was?
Facers Smoked Ale;Flint, Wales;Smoked - Rauchbier;Facers Brewery;[Cask at Volunteers Arms, GBBF, 2004] An ambe beer with a huge white head. The aroma is slightly smoke with notes of rope, but also somewhat sweet. The flavor is sweet and only slightly smoked combined with notes of oranges, peach, and a dry finish.
Facers Smoked Ale;Flint, Wales;Smoked - Rauchbier;Facers Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Head of Steam, Euston, London. Golden with a grey thin head. Slightly smoky aroma but with a definite smoky flavour. Chris_o was on hand to compare this ales form with that at the GBBF and confirms it was smokier then, but its still discernable.
Facers Smoked Ale;Flint, Wales;Smoked - Rauchbier;Facers Brewery;A real curiosity. Amber colour. The aroma is certainly smoky - definite rauchbier similarities - but it has some floral hop notes in the background too. The flavour is also smoky, but light and crisp as well. The smoke burns off a bit after a while. A bold experiment and one that, for me, is very successful. But then, I�m a sucher for smoked beers. Cask (handpump), GBBF, day 1.

Storm Desert Storm;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);Cask conditioned at The Swan Inn, Buxton, Derbys. Brown with miniscule white head. Thin, malty, some dryness, some fruitiness otherwise quite bland, flat. Unfortunate.
Storm Desert Storm;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);Cask, The Man Milton�s Head, Buxton. Copper with a firm cream foam. Aromas are light toffee malts with chocolate and Weetabix. Hints of Autumn fruit. Flavours are low malts with light fruit and an earthy peppery finish. Average.

Storm Desert Storm;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);Cask/handpump at Battersea BF 2011. Amber-brown with a mid-coarse clingy head. Plenty of malt and a hint of grassy hop on the nose, smoky and nutty on the tongue turning fruity mid-palate with a touch of apricot. Good chewy body for a bitter.
Storm Desert Storm;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);Cask at The George Inn, Belper, Derbyshire, 14-07-09 Pours hazy amber with a white head. A most unusual nose that seemed to combine a smokiness along with some floral notes that I couldn�t quite make out, Loz also got pear drop on the nose. The taste was also strange, wood smoke, sweetness and malt. Unusual stuff that I wasn�t really a big fan of. A4 A3 F4 P2 Ov8 2.1
Storm Desert Storm;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);"Cask conditioned - handpump - Out Of The Vaults Leicester. A copper coloured beer with an off-white loose head. The aroma is thin and hard to find; there may be some wheat? The taste is also thin. Not much happening.

Storm Desert Storm;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);A new brewery for me. This is a ginger coloured beer, with a vaguely malty, but not very assertive, aroma. Clean, dry flavour with a balance of malt and hop. Finishes soft and a touch sweet. A pretty decent effort. Cash (handpump), GBBF 2004, day 1.
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;Very black, no head. Smells burnt. Really roast. Slight vanilla. Distinct oak flavor.
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;Bottle. Poured a tan head, fair lacing, opaque, carbonation, and a reddish brown hue. Aroma is malty, chocolate and coffee. Flavour carries these characteristics through. Smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied beer. Finish is decent but a little hot.
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;"Poured amber with a hint of red. Nice head gave way to substantial lacing. Lots of sediment - I didn�t think I poured it too quickly but obviously I wasn�t careful enough. I ended up re-pouring it, slower, into another glass to remove some of the floaters, whatever the hell they were. I love what they were trying to do here, but this just doesn�t work for me. A hint of sour can be a nice way to pique the palate, but this is overbearingly so. The aroma was gorgeous, rich with ripe fruits and malt, but the flavor was so sour that no amount of sweetness could�ve brought it into cohesion, at least for me. Maybe this one didn�t age too gracefully; this was a 2005 bottle after all."
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;pours a dark amber with small head. aroma is sweet and malty with some spice and red fruit. drinks sweet with citrus and grape with nice roasted malt coming through. alcohol punches through the malt on the finish and warms as it goes down. i like this one
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;"Very hazy orange coloured body with a small white head and a nice golden tint. Strong aroma of coriander seed, wheat, malt, hops, sweet sugar and also some curacao. Full-bodied; Strong sweet taste of oranges, lemons and a bit of grapes with sugars and a good malt backbone with wheat most prevalent. Aftertaste very very strong and wheatie with a bunch of sugars throughout. Overall, a very strong and potent beer with plentiful amounts of sweet tastes with some nice hop and traditional �tripel� tastes too. A great beer - try it if you can find it! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Dearborn, Michigan on 08-April-2006 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia."
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;Smells of grapes and chocolate on first pour. It is dark brown with a red hue. I don�t really know how to describe this beer. It has a slight roasted flavor to it which disappears under the cough syrup flavor which must be attributed to whatever is smelling like grapes. The roasted malt is what lingers on my tongue though. The ABV warms my stomach and hits my head hard immediately. I like it and am not really sure why!
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;Weird smell of nasty alcohol. This is an odd one. Deep, Malty weizenbock-type taste initially, then sour at the end. Alcohol taste is way too obvious. Changed my mind after I couldn�t drink anymore after 4 oz. Blech. Good beer when you�re already drunk, maybe.
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;"Thanks to General Gao for this 12 oz. Small lasting ring of foam atop the translucent reddish-copper body. Sweet and spicy aroma of plums, figs, caramel, grapes and some light earthy funk - nice, but more akin to a Belgian. Flavor is acetic lemon juice, green tomato, and sour fruit, caramel, alcohol and wood; more akin to a sour ale. Some pear on the finish. Light-medium body is dry and lightly acidic-tingly. No divinity here, but if you like soured ales this one may be of slight interest."
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;Poured a cloudy orange amber color with small head. Aroma was off way off, grapes apple and something not right. Flavor was almost like bad grapes some caramel malts and a few spices which i couldn�t pick out. Not a good one.
New Holland Phi;Holland, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;New Holland Brewing Company;Boittle from boboski. Pour was orangey with some haze, weak head. The aroma was funky off grapes, grainey malts, other light fruits. Flavor was funky sour grapes, pears, some sweet caramel and bready/grainy malts. Spicing was very light but didn�t add any value to the overall beer. Mouthfeel was a bit dull. Another New Holland bomb. Thanks for the opportunity, though, Jason - it was fun and interesting anyway.

Wentworth Strongest Bar None;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wentworth;On cask at the Worcester Beer Festival. Claims to be aged for six months. Very dark barley wine. There was a lot of fruit in the aroma and very malty. Quite smooth but with an underlying alcohol taste. A good beer but would probably be excellent with another six months ageing.
Enville Maidens Ruin;Enville, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Enville Brewery;Bottle from Nottingham CAMRA Festival 2005. Heavy bronze body with little carbonation. Spicy licks around the orange and pear flavours.
Enville Maidens Ruin;Enville, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Enville Brewery;Bottle conditioned (abv 6%). Hazy (as it leapt out of the bottle to greet me) light amber colour with a slim white head. Aroma is orange peel and spices. Taste is pleasantly fruity, spicey and lightly bitter in the finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Nice.
Enville Maidens Ruin;Enville, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Enville Brewery;Tried in bottle form. Quite a strange one-dry slightly spicey and a taste that can only be described as earthy. Low carbonisation and a pleasant warming aftertaste make it quite a pleasant beer-I think!
Enville Dorika;Enville, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Enville Brewery;Cask (handpump), GBBF 2004, day 1 (last beer). I think 30 beers in the day is more than enough, but a bit of a shame to finish on a low note. This has a golden colour but was dominated by a very heavy diacetyl butterscotch aroma, not helped by the fact that, being made with honey (Hungarian acacia honey apparently), it has some sweetness anyway. Consequently, it comes over a bit sickly and there�s not much in the way of bitterness to cut through. Not ready in my view. Drinkable, but not great.

Merrydown Original Vintage Cider;Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;SHS Drinks;"Bottle, 750ml *** Colour: Bright yellow, greenish, clear, no head. *** Nose: Mild aroma of dry white whine, lemon. *** Mouthfeel: Despite 7.5%, rather light bodied, medium carbonation. *** Taste: Dry, sour apples, lemon (a whole lot of). Fruitier towards the middle, with some apple peel, finish is dry again, but not as sour as before. After taste of lemons disappears quickly. *** Impressions: A comparatively inexpensive cider, and it shows: Lacking in fruit, body, depth. Just a quick way to ""get it on"" for young people I guess. At least it�s got a screw top so you don�t have to drink the whole botte in one go."
Blue Anchor Spingo IPA;Helston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blue Anchor Brewery;Cask at the Blue Anchor. It pours cloudy amber with a dense white head. The nose is fresh, sweet orange, doughy malts, bread & marmalade and earth. The taste is crisp, bitter, creamy, bready malts, brioche, orange peel, apricot, touch of astringency, earth, leaf, light spice, floral notes and some cereal with a firm, dry finish. Medium body and fine, foamy carbonation. Pretty pleasant old-Englandshire IPA in good condition.

Blue Anchor Spingo IPA;Helston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blue Anchor Brewery;"21st October 2013 On tap at the wonderful Blue Anchor. As �Jubilee IPA;. Almost clear gold - amber beer. Good white head which is odd because there is no carbonation in the smooth palate. Light malt, clean and little creamy, Light orange marmalade hops with some floral things. Light finish with a mellow bitter linger. Good flavours but flat condition."
Blue Anchor Spingo IPA;Helston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blue Anchor Brewery;My Bottom Line: Ripe pears and bitter hop resins dwell within honeyed malts in this silky, engaging Old World IPA. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam surrounds the misty dark golden. -A touch of sulphur adds to the list of idiosyncrasies. -This one doesn�t taste as unique as their Spingos, but it�s still different from the normal English IPA. -The hop aftertaste is quite leafy. -An engaging briny touch melds with the hop profile. -Carbonation is very low, increasing drinkability. On cask at The Rake.

Blue Anchor Spingo Bragget;Helston, Cornwall, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Blue Anchor Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Blue Anchor, Helston, Cornwall. Hazy gold with white head.

Blue Anchor Spingo Bragget;Helston, Cornwall, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Blue Anchor Brewery;24th October 2013 Bottle drank on hols in St Ives. Hazy gold beer, bubbly white head.

Blue Anchor Spingo Bragget;Helston, Cornwall, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Blue Anchor Brewery;Cask at the Blue Anchor. Deep gold with a white head and a yeasty nose with honey notes and hints of lemon and a slightly floral character. More honey and yeast on the palate gave an interesting dry/sweet combination, but it also had unpleasantly dusty and musty notes (a bacterial problem?) which spoilt it for me.
Blue Anchor Spingo Bragget;Helston, Cornwall, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Blue Anchor Brewery;Cask, handpump @ the Blue Anchor, Helston, Cornwall. Ahhh, nothing like a piece of heaven. Or in this case a table full of pints of Spingo middle and a singular serve of the Bragget for myself. This was a lovely predicament to be in as the social scene at the pub seemed more inviting than this beer alone. Go figure!. A hazy, pale yellow in body, breaching on gold, with a firm, thin creamy snow-white head that laced well. Huge presence of fresh honey, cloves and spicy apples in the aroma that trailed right through into the flavour. In the mouth it�s smooth and tangy displaying some pleasantly sweet green apples, pale honey and some phenolic spice. Lightly herbal, it�s very smooth in the back and the finish has more fruit, spice and just a touch of the ABV to let you know who�s boss. Body is medium and it is very well rounded and pronounced yet it slips down with extraordinary ease making the locals fearful of a visitor who drinks too many. This 800 year old brew is now brewed for the queens jubilee say the locals. I wished it was brewed for mine. My notes don�t near meet this beers complexity so I must say this is another step back in time courtesy of the Blue Anchor, and another gem from this old-as-old brewhouse. Lovely!!!!

Hops Batch 500 IIPA;Madison, Georgia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Autumn Brew Review 2004. AAAHHH!!! Holy hops! After my initial disasterous visit to this brewpub, I was terrified of their booth at the Brew Review. This pours a solid golden color with zilch on the head. Just truck loads of hops on the nose and tongue. Very full of citrus (grapefruit? lemon?). Some malt, but the hops definitely overpower. Sweet as well. This redeemed a lost (in my opinion) brewer.

Corner Pub Brown Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Clear brass in color with a nice thin grey, creamy white head. Smells up to speed - maple, brown sugar, nutty pancakes post syrup, caramel and toffee. Creamy palate hit, and now we�re getting somewhere. Heavily caramelized mixed nuts, some tree bark and assorted toasty qualities. Faintest hint of chocolate toffee chews. Few surprises, but well-executed.
Corner Pub Brown Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Dark amber to brown color with a moderate light cream color head. Aromas of mild coffee, light licorice and choclate malt. Straight forward ale. Touch of fruity sweetness and light herbal bitterness to offset.
Pinnacle Gold Honey Brewed Hard Apple Cider;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Apple Cider;Meadery of the Rockies;Clear light yellow, nose of green apples, quite a sour flavor too... light semi-sweet sticky coating, and really just too thin and fizzy. Malternative flavored fizzy cider.
Brewery Creek Amber Ale;Mineral Point, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewery Creek Brewing (WI);"On draught as ""Dark Amber Ale"" at the brewpub in Mineral Point, Wisconsin. Pours a reddish amber with a creamy off-whtie head that has good retention and some spotty lacing. Aroma of roasted caramel malt, some roasted nuts, a touch of tobacco and a subdued apple vinegar. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with flavors of roasted malt, nuts and some sweet apple character. Finish is semi-dry with a roasted malt and nut aftertaste. Hop presence is very light."
Brewery Creek Amber Ale;Mineral Point, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewery Creek Brewing (WI);Draught at the brew pub.

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;This beer pours a dark amber. The beige head lasts, as does the lace on the glass. I detect dark, brown sugar aromas on the first sniff. There are also some oily alcohol smells as well as some lactose creaminess. This is a very rich beer with a strong alcohol presence (6.9%). The bottle notes the IBU (hop bitterness) as 34, but with the malt being so sweet, it is hardly noticeable except in the aftertaste. This is a very good Scotch Ale. I like the fullness, the maltose flavors and the subtle hop taste in the swallow. It may be too rich to quaff, but it�s certainly worthy of placing within a flight of similar brews.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;Picked up this retired gem at the local Greens. I must say the color is right. The beer is a dark caramel brown that has little head. The head actually fades away rather quickly. There is a slight smoke aroma, but mainly buttery. I don�t think they did well on the mashing part, or maybe the yeast gave off some butter flavors. The aroma is okay, but very weak to the nose. Not a bad flavor. The beer is very creamy, actually a lot creamier than most. The beer does not have too many dimensions to it. A subtle smokey flavor, but there is mainly caramel. The beer is just one dimensional. I am not to impressed with the flavor. The appearance and body are great, but the flavor and aroma are just weak. Overall, decent, but for this to be a special beer I would have to say improve the recipe.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;22oz. bomber: I found this one hiding in the back of the refrigerator. This one pours a slightly ruby tinged darker amber color. Mine had quite a bit of a beige head on it, but it dropped off rather quickly. Interesting aroma. Caramel, toffee, fruits, almost belgian-like. Caramel, a hint of smokiness and peatiness, and some muted fruits to the taste. This was pretty good. I�m not sure if the unintentional aging helped or hurt this one. I�d buy it again if they decided to make more.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;Was excited to taste this one....Poured out a dark brown color with a decent sized creamy head. The aroma was of caramel, roasted malts and maybe some fruit. The taste was not what I�d expect. Very watery body with a bad earthy aftertaste of pete. Not that great of a beer, too bad I have to give this such a bad rating.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;Bottle. Slightly hazy brown color, with a medium head consisting of large bubbles. Lightly hopped aroma, with caramel and fruit. Pleasantly malty at first, sweet with caramel and some milk chocolate, but finishes thin. A decent beer in what is admittedly a tough style to get enthused about.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;Light brown in color with a light texture and a creamy off white head. Smelled lightly of chocolate with some decent but subtle orangey notes and some weird funk barnyard texture. Tasted a bit on the sweet side for a scotch ale with some mild caramelly notes, but otherwise watery and bland.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;Brownish in color, with a roasty malt and nutty aroma. Tastes roasty malty, with some almonds, caramel, and dark fruit in the finish.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;Hmmm... not assertive as a scotch ale. Some peaches, some deep toast but nothign like peat, slightly sweet, some subtle carmels and welcome rotting leaves. Lightly astringent.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;okay and better than the idea of it I had somehow managed to plant in my head sweet, caramelish and with a whole realm of flavours that while not unpleasant, were hard for me to separate from the whole and also not inviting me to go beyond just thinking that this was okay and not great.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #06 - Scotch Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harpoon Brewery;I must thank ClarkVV for bringing this out to me. This beer pours a beautiful burnt copper color with a nice off white head, that disappeared really quickly. The aroma is malty, sweet toffee with a nice roasted chocolate balance, followed by the ever so faint smoke. The flavor is nice, malt (roasted caramel) and alcohol, smooth with lots of body. I think this is such a good representation of the style that Harpoon will reconsider making this a seasonal.
Coachs Dunkelweizen;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Coachs Brewery;Slightly murky dark yellow with a white head. Nose is a sweet corn and grainy lemon, with a similar flavor. Doesn�t resemble a dunkelweizen at all, more like the hefeweizen that Coach�s brewed. Overly sweet oranges and lemons and sickly grains as well. Wet finish.

Oliver's Dry Table Cider (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Oliver's Cider;A still, dry, clear (presumably filtered) cider from Olivers, who are generally regarded as perry specialists. This is a very pale gold colour. There�s a hint of barnyard (but not much) and an even fainter apple remnant in the aroma. However, there is no fruit, nor vestige of sweetness, left in the flavour. It is completely attenuated to leave an uncompromisingly dry and austere cider. Yet Olivers seem to be trying to steer away from a rustic farmyard product towards something rather more refined - almost like a bone dry white wine - but seem to sacrifice some character, and interest, in the process. That�s not to say it isn�t still a pretty reasonable cider, but it won�t be to everyone�s taste.750ml bottle from Hop Pocket Wine Co.

Bristol Belgian Wit;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bristol Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Pours yellow and cloudy with a thin white head garnished with some sort of fruit slice which I removed from the glass and hurled as though it were a boomerang through the bar area. Sadly the slice did not return to me. Lots of orange peel and coriander on the nose which bursts and insists itself on the taste buds. Finishes clean but when I belch I�m reminded of Florida. Nice!

After Taste: Dry. Very bready and quite bitter to mouth. Comments: This one boost a very hearty malt character in both aroma and taste, essentially a liquid bread but with the nice, surprising touch of rum booze you most likely find in Imperial Stouts. Simple but well made. Well worth the money!"

Devil's Canyon Full Boar Scotch Ale;San Carlos, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Devil's Canyon Brewing Company;Holy foam-over, Batman!! This thing burst from the bottle when I opened it and foamed up like crazy when I poured it. Sometimes that's a bad sign, but not in this case. Deep, dark brown body with a (wait for it) *very* foamy tan head. Loads of cocoa, molasses and brown sugar in the aroma. More molasses and dark brown sugar in the taste with a bit of dark roast coffee and toasted wood. A bit of smoky wood peaks out after this but not in a campfire way. Some more cocoa powder and a little root beer come later. Finishes with a milk and dark chocolate flavor and a creamy body. Excellent Scotch ale!

Very strong nutty/roasted nut flavor. There is some sweetness, more fruity than sugary. I like the flavor profile quite a bit. Herbal bitter hops to balance, maybe stronger than I would have liked.

Olde Towne Amber;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Towne Brewing Company;[3216-20100731] Bottle. Light grains aroma is a little corny. Clear, amber orange body with a quick foamy white head. Grainy alcohol flavour has lingering graininess. Medium body. Not great. (@ ChrisO�s Pre-GBBF 2010, London, England)
Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Clear golden-copper in color with a one-finger white head that leaves a film. The aroma is strange. Nutty with some sweet malt and mild hop notes. The flavor is like a nut brown pale ale. Nuts, caramel, and mild hop resins. Weird to say the least. Medium body with average carbonation. Not good overall. Hopefully freeing the hops with help Alabama make better beers than this.
Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;12 oz from Spirits in Tuscaloosa. Pours hazy yellow with a white head. Nose is lots of malt with a twinge of honey and a bit of hops. Flavor is the same- lots of malt and just a few hops mixed in. Sweet and malty with a hint of hops in this light to medium-bodied APA.
Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;From a bottle into a lager glass. Received in a trade with brentfeesh. Thank you, sir. Appearance is a translucent amber with a thick, fluffy beige head. Aroma is made up of hops, lemongrass, and grain. Taste is sweet up front, with some grapefruit coming through and other citrus fruits coming through about the middle of the drink. It finishes with a calm hop profile that is not very bitter. This beer would be great to drink several of, it�s just too bad I am not able to do so.
Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Thanks to Kirkpjr for this long time want. An Alabama beer brewed in Alabama. I pored the bottle into my Sam Adams glass and was greeted with a two finger off white head sitting on top of a golden orange body. My first thought on the aroma was lemon so I go with that. I liked the flavor It is great to see a Pale that doesn�t try to be an IPA this one was balanced out just right and a pleasure to drink. It had a medium body with ample carbonation. It drank extremely well and I was left wanting for more. I would be proud to call this my local Pale ale great job Olde Towne
Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;12oz bottle thanks to drowland!

Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;From the Bottle at Chris O�s pre GBBF tasting, Kensal Rise 31/07/2010 Hoppy aroma.

Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;8/18/10. 12oz bottle. Clear amber, almost orange, pour with a big fluffy off-white head that lasts. Mild bready aroma with hints of citrus.

Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;A Mes rate. Bottle at home thanks to Amy, via Chris. Very slightly hazy pale amber with a rapidly vanishing white head that settles to a rim of bubbles. Bready malt aroma with some faint citric hops and a burnt note. Similar flavour really. Very little happening. Too much bittering hops and not enough for flavour. The malt is a little too clear and the bitterness seems to come from nowhere. Rather basic but certainly drinkable.
Olde Towne Pale Ale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Thanks to FreeThyHops for sending me this beer as an extra. This is my first beer from Alabama. The beer pours a hazy orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is toffee, pine, brown sugar and iced tea. The flavor is toffee, tea, earthy hops and some orange citrus notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;This one is your typical pale ale. Hazy in appearance. Not too much aroma. Sweet (not too much though) on the palate. Nice offering, prefer the Hefe and Porter by far to this one though.
Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Pours a hazy golden orangish color. Aroma is mild hops with some floral and fruit. Flavor of a pale, mildly sweet malt action followed by a little hop flavor bite.
Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Bottle... RBSG2006... Hazy yellow ale with a large, fizzy, white head. Citrusy nose with notes of lemon and beef broth. Balanced flavor. No bitterness. No sweetness. Tart �n� tangy. Light-bodied and bone dry with mild carbonation. Not real good... and judging by previous scores, it looks like I�m being kind!
Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Wow, extra what? Extra pale? Well, that doesn�t mean extra hops, it means extra less flavor than their pale ale. Poor Alabama! Poured a pale golden yellow with a respectable head but no lacing. This was a straight up wheat based blonde ale that stunk upon opening, as I couldn�t tell if I was smelling the beer or bfeld�s dog�s breath. Somewhat saison like in aroma, the flavor was watery wheat with funk and citrus. Mouthfeel was somewhat watered down and thin. A below average, but not terrible blonde ale.
Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;"""Ba humbug again Alabama has nothing. The pour was better then the last one pale yellow but had a nice head. Aroma was awful skunked junk. Flavor wassome funk citrus and something was wrong in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was watery."""
Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;For my 400th brew I thought I would rate an Alabama looser. This is about the 4th time I�ve tried it and I hear it (this beer) will soon be out of production due to slumping sales (go figure). WTF! I poured one ounce out of my bottle and filled my 16 oz pint glass. All foam, and turns out the bottle I had was about 1-year old (talk about slow turn over at the �reputable� store were my friend picked this up for me). The aroma was semi-sharp. Light hop notes with a grassy spicy hint, not very enjoyable. The taste was better than I expected in that it was non-descript. Light grain and grassiness from the hops (I assume-though it could have been lawn clippings). Almost in the vein of BMC. Light body and huge carbonation (anyone surprised after the first comment?). I know I�ve said this before but...Never Again. I�ve already apologized to everyone I traded a bottle of this to, and I apologize again. Sorry.
Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;Thanks (I think) to brenbtfreesh for sending this one! 12 oz bottle. This must be somewhat better on draft locally than this bottle. No one would want to take this home. I had two bottles and both were the same, it took a week to get up the nerve to open the second one to be sure. Gushes out of the bottle at the pour, producing an entire 16 oz glass of pure tight white foam. Slowly a mostly clear light yellow body formed at the bottom of the glass. Sour acidic aroma (infection in the bottling line maybe?) Tastes like it smells. Really bad, a true drainpour.
Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;"My least favorite of Olde Towne�s beers. In fact, I probably won�t order it again. Light clean yellow color, nice light sweet flavor, but seemed a little watery. I didn�t know what to expect from a ""extra"" pale ale and maybe I still don�t. Not bad, but not nearly as good as Olde Towne�s other beers."
Olde Towne Extra Pale;Huntsville, Alabama, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Towne Brewing Company;12 oz Bottle: Pours a very light pee like golden yellow. A quickly fading head. A little, but not a lot of carbonation. The aroma is fairly typical of a Pale Ale:floral, hoppy, malts, citrus, bread. The taste was sweet malty and nice.

Clear reddish/gold pour, no head. Sugary raspberry aroma - candy-like. Taste is more raspberry, wine-cooler like, some metal on taste. but it actually has a little bit of body/mouthfeel in there. Not a great beer by any means, but refreshing, reasonably tasty, and drinkable.

Jurand Dri Piwo Malinowe (Raspberry);Olsztyn, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Dark orange gold body with a lightly off white head.

Jurand Dri Piwo Malinowe (Raspberry);Olsztyn, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Bottle, Wow this smells like skunk, what the hell. A Polish person must of made this :).

Pyramid California Un-Common;Seattle, Washington, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Orange gold color. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is malty and fruity. A medium-bodied California Common (Steam Beer) Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are slightly bitter and fairly mild. Subtle beer. The steam process really allows the malt grainy to show in this beer. Touches of orange and citrus. Very smooth. Nice balance. Would make a good session beer. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
El Toro Barrel Aged Deuce;Morgan Hill, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;El Toro Brewing Company;Tap @ Toronado. A murky orange amber color with a tan head.

I think the brewer�s done a capable job with this seasonal. Give it a try before it�s replaced by the IPA.

Arcadia Batch 999 Imperial IPA;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;IPA;Arcadia Brewing Company;"Very hazy amber/ruby/copper coloured body with a great dense tan head that tops the beer perfectly. Aroma of cardboard, low a.a. hops, caramel, flowers and some wierd metallic scents. Medium-bodied; Strong hoppy flavours with some good malt kicks and a bit of metallic (almost bloody) tastes mixed in. Aftertaste shows a light fruityness and some mild malt - but the earlier tastes are a bit overpowering. Overall, not the best IPA i�ve had - worth trying if you like the style - but don�t expect much!

Fruity, biscuity malts showing some oxidation, hints of caramel, lemon tea, lightly tart and acidic, tangerine and spruce needles from mellowing hops, though still potent enough to leave a lingering astringent aftertaste. Medium to full body, smoothly tingly carbonation. Would have been interesting to taste this beer fresh, though it was still enjoyable aged.

Rogue Two Tier Beer/Gone Awry IPA;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;IPA�s brewed with rye are an interesting offshoot of the standard. This is a good one. If you like this you gotta try Bear Republic�s Hop Rod. Thanks Marc for pulling this one out of the barchive. Since this one was in the bottle for a couple years the hop aroma had dissipated some. The taste was still in tact - full flavored north west hop varieties and that distinctive dry bitter bite the rye provides. There are certainly other adjuncts included that gave off herbal and citrus like flavors as well. This was a great anniversary brew for Rogue.
Rogue Two Tier Beer/Gone Awry IPA;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;I had this beer at the 2004 OBF, Portland. Pale yellow in color. An overall nice RyePA.
Rogue Two Tier Beer/Gone Awry IPA;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;Bottle obtained in a trade with Larry Pitonka, thanks Andre. Deep orange amber in colour, very thin quickly dissipating off-white head, some leftover lace on the side of the glass. The aroma was plenty hoppy with lots of citrus, pine and some caramel malt sweetness. The hops carry over into the flavour as well. Still lots of citrus (grapefruite and oranges) and pine, soft caramel malts, earthly in the back. Bitter dry mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation. Finishes dry and lingering. Quite nice.
Rogue Two Tier Beer/Gone Awry IPA;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;Bottle shared with tupalev -- courtesy of tupalev. Pours a beautiful clear dark orange with a big rocky off-white head. Big hoppy aroma along with rye, malt and caraway seeds. Flavour of rye, caraway seeds, hops, pepper and malt. That�s got to be one of the strangest list of flavours I�ve written for an IPA. I quite liked this -- it�s definitely original and you�ve got to respect Rogue for trying something different.
Rogue Two Tier Beer/Gone Awry IPA;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;Bottle that I bought at the Rogue pub in San Francisco shared with Blankboy. Dark orange, big thick off white head - really does look amazing. Strong hops in aroma but also strong bready spices as well - weird. Strong hops in taste, but also really spicy with lots of pepper - I thought bore a close resemblance o the Chipotle in that it seemed to be a good Rogue hoppy ale mixed with strong spices/flavours that didn�t agree with me. Medium mouthfeel. This is very flavourful but those damn spices won�t let go - I find them way to overwhelming. Well made but I simply do not like the taste.

Millys Tavern Blueberry Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Draft at the brew pub. Gold with a purple hue of blueberry juice plus berry�s floating around. Basically this is golden ale with Maine blueberries added to it. The malt and berry do play well together. Not overly sweet. I no longer drink a lot of fruit beers however if you are in the mood for one, this is respectable.
Millys Tavern Blueberry Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Tap at millys. Pours a light golden with a violet tinge and a few blueberries floating in the beer. Aroma is nice real fresh blueberry and blueberry muffin- doughy and sweet. Good flavor- good berry pretty powerful overall, nice crisp pils malt backbone with a light sweetness, blueberries become a slight bit harsh in the end and almost solvent like but still pretty good for this style which I usually don�t care for.

Millys Tavern Hefeweizen;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;In short: A very problematic wheat beer. Bad. How: Tap at brewpub, this batch at 6.55% (currently listed on ratebeer at 5.8%). The look: Cloudy straw color body topped by a small white head. In long: Nose is a bit sharp and weird, smells like old orange juice and urinal cake. Houston we have a problem. Taste is dominated by crushed aspirins, old acidified apple juice that has been sitting in the open for two weeks, young green bananas, some wheat. An overall chemical sensation. Pretty much undrinkable, I can�t believe I was served a pint of a crap like this at a brewpub, don�t they taste their own beer? Not only was the beer bad but when I smiled and winked at my waitress she told me I was an ugly piece of shit, I�m telling you, I�ve never been so insulted in my entire afternoon.
Millys Tavern Hefeweizen;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Tap at Milly�s in Manchester, NH. Outstanding hefeweizen - banana and clove jump out of this one, making it very interesting and enjoyable. Far from a bland wheat hefe - this one has plenty of character.
Millys Tavern Hefeweizen;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Hazy straw pour with a medium sized fizzy white head. Huge spicy banana and clove esters give way to unmalted wheat ans bubblegum notes. Very typical of the style, but nothing special going for it. Light body with fizzy carbonation.
Millys Tavern Hefeweizen;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Draft @ the brew pub. Served in a pint. I talked with the owner / brewmaster. He uses German yeast and you can tell! The nose is lots of clove and banana, with a hearty yeast body. Flavor was well balanced between the malt and the yeast, no hops at all here. Lightly sweet and refreshing with light citrus to go along with the banana and clove. The body is fuller and really makes it close to what you get in Germany. Excellent example of the style. And I will go back before the end of summer to get another few pints. High drinkability.
Millys Tavern Hefeweizen;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Quite a bit better than the raspberry version- but not that great overall. Pours a light golden hazy with a thin head. Aroma is slight diacetyl and buttery light sweetness, ok bready and some wheat- ok hefe character a bit too phenolic with some clove and more butter. Lightly spicy flavor- phenolic clove, crisp crackery wheat malts and overall a bit weak and watered down with a lower than expected carbonation making the beer feel a bit more slick.

Millys Tavern Hefeweizen;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;I always ask for this type of beer without a lemon, this time I forgot, so I ordered a second pint and drank the lemon one after I was finished with the non-lemon...everyone follow that? Cloudy golden color(lots of nice yeast still in there of course),with a nice firm white head. Aroma is wonderful, nce banana, and a bit of clove, though not the bubblegum some people say. Flavor was well balanced between the malt and the yeast, not much for hops here.Slightly sweet and refreshing with a hint of citrus to go along with the banana and clove. The body is fuller than some hefes but it doesn�t make it less drinkable.
Millys Tavern Hefeweizen;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Served to me on tap at Volgons... This was the last pure glass from the keg... haha Volgon�s last beer... another victory for me! A clean honey color. Immediate light hints of banana. The banana accentuated the aroma in the second taste. A nice mix of yeast and malt with light hops... like I like it. Would be great on a hot summer day. Glad to get a taste before it was gone :)

Harvest Moon Beltian White;Belt, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harvest Moon Brewing;"Clear golden and lightly coloured copper body with a thinnish white head and no cloudy or haziness at all. Aroma of coriander seed, light oranges, some spices and a bit of malt/wheat noticeable - not much else though. Light-bodied; Strong curacao and orange flavours at the front end with a bit of grass and dry malt and a touch of sweetness on the finish. Aftertaste shows some dry grass and herbs with a little sweetness and a lot of coriander seed and curacao throughout. Overall, a nice and refreshing beer with some good white characteristics, but about average for the style - however, to get this in Montana regularly, not a bad beer. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased by my coworker on 27-October-2015 from Great Falls, Montana, sampled at home in Washington after a few hours after returning from Great Falls on 23-June-2016 - Thanks Randy!"
Harvest Moon Beltian White;Belt, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harvest Moon Brewing;Straw color with a smallish diminishing white head.

Harvest Moon Beltian White;Belt, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harvest Moon Brewing;The aroma is more wheat than fruit. The first sIP is wheat and then the fruitiness and coriander come on fairly strong. Decent overall but too much wheat for my taste
Harvest Moon Beltian White;Belt, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harvest Moon Brewing;No lasting head and no lacing. The flavours are of wheat and citrus and coriander and the spices expected.The flavours aren�t as strong as the Euro�s might be but that�s ok because it balances.
Harvest Moon Beltian White;Belt, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harvest Moon Brewing;Not my favourite style but a clean and crisp brew with a fresh and floral profile. A beautiful pour of light hay and a puffy, dense white head. Floral and slightly perfumy hop and ester blend. A good session brew with citrus, coriander and wheat flavours.
Harvest Moon Beltian White;Belt, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harvest Moon Brewing;Served on tap in a snifter glass Appearance � The beer is served a very hazy orange amber color with a tiny white head of pure white. The head fades very fast leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass. Smell � The aroma of the beer is big of yeast and wheat with a good showing of spices of coriander and clove as well. Along with these aromas comes some notes of a light lemon and orange citrus as well as some bready smells. Taste � The taste begins with a drier wheat bread taste mixed with a moderate showing of some citrus of orange. There is a bit of yeastiness as well as some flavors of spice upfront, with coriander and clove being the strongest of the spice. The yeast and spice grow slightly stronger in nature as the taste advances, but never become overly strong. A little more orange sweetness comes to the tongue as the taste advances to the end, with a bit more spice and some slightly sour lemon coming as well. With all the changes that occurred throughout the taste, one is left with a nice drier citrus and moderately yeasty and spiced flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker side for a brew of only 4.75 % with a carbonation level that is rather average to slightly higher. The thicker body does well for the yeast and spice, really accentuating these all while the higher carbonation excites the tongue and is very nice for accentuating the sweet citrus. Overall, the feel is very appropriate. Overall � A rather nice wit overall that packs a nice flavor into a minimal abv. of 4.75 %. Very well done!!
Harvest Moon Beltian White;Belt, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harvest Moon Brewing;On tap at Sparky�s Garage in Butte Hazy yellow with a medium sized white head, lots of lacing. Aroma of oranges and wheat. Taste is wheat, grainy and oranges Good wheat beer, tasty

Broadway Cider;Broadway, Worcestershire, England;Apple Cider;Arnolds Broadway Cider;"75cl bottle obtained at the brewer�s shop in Broadway. No head. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket), with notes of apple, bandage, mint, grape, sassafrass, wood, flowers. Flavor is lightly sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is moderately acidic. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation, lightly tannic. A very lightly carbonated, very dry, very rustic cider. Aromatic notes are extremely complex and one of the best I�ve experienced in the world of cider, but this is like a Bordeaux of the cider world; integration, complexity, finesse, and subtlety are the goals here, NOT power or boldness. As a result, most people will probably not find this cider compelling. A very refined little cider, indeed. Had a pleasant chat with the brewer about yeast, and found that he doesn�t use Brettanomyces to ferment this...so I�m guessing it has infiltrated his casks, as happens with wine (and it is a VERY attractive barny/horsey smell...about as attractive a variety as I�ve experienced, including all the lambics I�ve had). He sells mostly wine in his shop, so that may explain his focus on balance and integration for the cider. In fact, the small amount of residual sugar, along with the incidental carbonation and tannic grip make this seem more like wine than cider. Tastes like it�s alcohol-free, quite honestly...no trace whatsoever in aroma or aftertaste. Extremely high coolness factor, IMHO. Whereas Etienne Dupont Brut may be the d�Arenberg Dead Arm of ciders, this is the L�oville-Poyferre."

Iceni Elveden Forest Gold;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Iceni Brewery;Bottle: No head on this hazy auburn beer. Very still indeed. A little sour bite hidden in the aromas of the hops and light honey. Sweet (almost a little sickly on first being in the mouth) and fruity (light orange) with some drying hops slightly later on. Outrageously still, a couple of bubbles wouldn�t go amiss but it makes up for it with its smooth, oily texture. Overall quite tasty if a little placid.

Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);ABV= 10%: My first Imperial Oktoberfest. I like Marzens, but this is too sweet for me. I guess it has to be this way to get the strength, but looks like I prefer something 5-7% in this style. Appearance is nice, murky darker orange to medium brown. Caramel flavors with maybe some light fruit to get this extra fermentation and sweetness. I would pass on this though for the price. For this strength, I like a barelywine, DIPA, or Strong Ale over this style.
Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Not sure why this was not on the shelves in October but that's our stupid distributors here. Thick malty dark gold brew that has lots of malt flavor with some hints of alcohol and spice. Really good brew that I would have loved to had back in October. Maybe next year they will pull their heads out and get it when it is suppose to be drank.
Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);12 oz can from Total Wine and More in Short Pump, VA Now this is the Octoberfest beer that I can get into. The beer poured a clear amber color with an off-white head and lacing. The aroma of caramel malts and bread greet you. A welcoming aroma and appearance. The beer has a nice full body with soft carbonation. The taste is more typical Marzan style yet muted. You also detect some sherry like flavors that help make this a go-to beer for celebrating Octoberfest.
Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Nutty malt profile with a bit of chocolate in the aftertaste. Finish is creamy with some spices.
Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Can from Craft Brewed. Pours a clear golden copper color with a finger of foam that dissipates after a short linger. Alcohol aromas with caramel malt and toffee with some faint herbal hops in the background. Sweet on the palate with caramel and vanilla notes dominating. Boozy with a lingering alcohol burn and toasted caramel toffee malt.
Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);We had booth at the Butterfield taproom in September 2018 it was very nice but did not taste like a traditional Oktoberfest ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);I was ready to dismiss Avery's Imperial Oktoberfest label as part of the often-gimmicky take-a-basic-style-and-make-it-bigger school of thought, but The Kaiser truly does look taste like extra strong Festbier. This brew pours a darkened copper shade that's nearly brown. Sweet malty nose. Heavy caramel taste and a hint of butterscotch. I do wish there was a bit more noble hop character in the finish - the hops sort of get clobbered by sweetness from the malt and alcohol. Still, this is a wonderful malt bomb to help mellow out the spiciness of some homemade currywurst.
Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Sweet caramel malts. Mild earthy hops. Some nuttiness, spice, mild alcohol. Nice balance.
Avery The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);bottle batch 13 2016 9.5%alc. clear dark red-orange,orange head. crazy color. nice flowery dough aroma with warnings of a high alc. content, but not direct alcohol aroma, also some sweetness. flavor is sweet malty, dough, faint flowery, very full bodied, fainter notes of fruity candy, warming sensation. really good flavor, not so often a lager this strength is drinkable, flavor almost lends to barley wine. aftertaste hints of the high alc percentage where the alc and the hops match up to create a bitter very slightly herbal sensation.
Meadery of the Rockies Blackberries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Sample at the tasting room. Pours a clear, pink color. Lots of tannins and berry notes, with orange peel, and honey. Not too sweet, with a light, subdued bitterness. Light to medium body, with a sticky, astringent feel. Solid and surprisingly dry for a fruit mead. Nice.
Meadery of the Rockies Blackberries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Small bottle pour at Barrels and Bottles. Clear light brown appearance with a small, fully dissipating head. Aroma of blackberries, fruity esters, honey and sweet malts. Similar flavor, medium to heavy sweetness with a medium body and a hint of booze at the finish. Kind of fun to sip on.
Meadery of the Rockies Blackberries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Bottle, shared on the RBSG bus. Deep garnet hue, pinkish highlights, still, with nice viscosity. Sweet red fruits, honey sweetness, mild tartness. Nice for a fruited sweet mead.
Meadery of the Rockies Blackberries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Bottle @ RBSG 2015. Thanks, Craig. Pour is like red Kool Aid. Some tangy beer and a touch of spice on the nose along with sweet honey and fruit jam. A bit of anise, perhaps? Slight acidity and tartness to the flavor, but mostly sweet honey, graham cracker, and berry jam. A nice fruit character and a spicy, floral finish. Interesting, but not my favorite.
Meadery of the Rockies Blackberries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Bottle on the bus. From Craig, thanks A: Dark raspberry/light blackberry color, no head. N: Raspberries, blackberries, honey, some blueberry even, and a touch of peppercorn. T: Sweet and fruity. M:Treacly and sticky. Easy to drink. O: Quite nice. Very much a mead to go with a shortcake or something of that nature.
Meadery of the Rockies Blackberries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Bottle, pours a clear dark red with a small pink head. Aroma brings loads of sweet blackberries and artificial honey. Flavour is sickly sweet, with artificial tasting berries and lots of sickly sweet honey. Low complexity and way too sweet. No good.
Meadery of the Rockies Blackberries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Bottle on the RBSG bus. Pours a clear ruby with no head. The aroma is honey, berries, booze. Thin mouth, strong honey, berries, boozy finish, really good.

Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Sample at the tasting room. Nice, sweet cherries, orange blossoms, and honey. Sweet and sticky. Pretty nice.
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;4oz glass at the meadery. This was my favorite of the ten meads I tried. Aroma is bright pie cherries and jam. Medium sweet, certainly not overly sweet. Really great cherry notes. I inquired and this is made with local Montmerency cherries. Nice sipper but I probably won�t go out of my way to buy a bottle for $15.
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Aroma of sour cherries and honey drift up from a clear cherry red pour. The taste follows the nose - sours berries and honey notes. Great digestive.
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;pick this up on my colorado trip. shared at dak�s 8/14/10. looks like kool-aid. clear cherry juice color. tart fresh cherry aroma mixes well with honey, wood, florals and herbs. the flavor is the same... lots of honey and lots of tart cherries. it is very tannic and full of skins with a peppery spice on the finish. medium body and sweetness are kept in check. this is nice.... and really easy to drink. i�d love to have some black mesa chevre right about now! 7/4/7/3/15+
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;My very first mead...wasn�t sure what to expect. Looked a bit pinkish red, and for a wine it didn�t leave much legs on the glass. Smelled a bit bitter and sour from the cherries, slightly sweet notes. Smelled dessert-like. Taste was where it fell apart for me. The honey-ness and the sweetness appeared at the forefront of the taste profile, but quickly left and turned into a dry, slightly cherry zinfindel finish. A bit sour, too, from the cherries I presume. Honey flavor comes out more when heated/warmed, and the cherries are less bitter/sour. Overall, its better when warmed, but I don�t think I would get it again.
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Light red color pour with no head. Sweet aroma of honey, cherries and light yeast. Flavor is sweet and sour cherries. Interesting.
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Pour is glistening red. Aroma is sweet and syrupy with notes of cherry, apple, honey, vanilla, and some underlying earthiness. Flavor shows the same. Overall it�s pretty damn sweet but not overly cloying. It�s syrupy body is cut with decent acidity and some shining alcohol.
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Rose colored pour. Tart cherries and a musty quality. Flavor is sour cherries. All sour cherries. Ok. Thanks to Hellbilly.
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Bottle, courtesy hopscotch. Pours still, clear reddish amber in color. Thin sheeting shows on the glass. The nose is sickeningly sweet and artificial, with notes of cherry-cream soda, vanilla, watered down honey, and a touch cinnamon. Likewise, the flavors are a muddled, overly saccharine mess. Weak honey is outshined by sugary soda water and fake cherry notes, with too much vanilla and a weird, fruity tartness that just seems out of place. The body is again sugary and cloying, also pretty hot from the alcohol. Lacks focus and execution. This is not my idea of a good mead.
Meadery of the Rockies Cherries 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Thanks to Hopscotch for the glass. Still reddish gold pourwith nice legs. Sweet honey, cherry slightly astringent aroma. Taste is sweet cherry and honey, very sweet. Decent desert mead.

Light peach aromas, with some orange peel and clover honey. Very sweet. Light to medium body, with a bit acid and syrup. Pretty nice.
Meadery of the Rockies Peaches 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;(750ml bottle) clear light peach, a bit of legs and coating on the glass. Nose of peach, alcohol, cheap wine, herbs, smells like drunk white girl and cardboard. Taste is oddly alcoholic, cheap wine, perfume, fake peach, a Harry Hines stripper and a bad brunch beverage.
Meadery of the Rockies Peaches 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;2 oz pour at Barrels & Bottles. Pinkish clear appearance with no head. Sweet, fruity and boozy with notes of peaches and honey, obviously. Creamy, smooth and strong.
Meadery of the Rockies Peaches 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Clear vibrant yellow. Smells of strong peach syrup and a lot o candy sugar. taste is warm, spicy, peachy, and sweet. Just a little honey honey on the finish.
Meadery of the Rockies Peaches 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;Aroma: strong scent of peaches/peach nectar--complimented by smooth, sweet honey scent--slight citrusness Appearance: sunshine yellow, small air bubbles throughout Flavor: smooth honey flavor, sharp peach nectar flavor, some orange blossom flavors apparent Palate: very smooth mouth feel, tingling the tongue, warmness in the mouth, warms body when swolled, smooth, sweet warming aftertaste
Meadery of the Rockies Peaches 'n Honey;Palisade, Colorado, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Meadery of the Rockies;No head (still). Body is clear light yellow. Aroma is strong notes of apricot and peach, with notes of apple, lime peel, honey, fusel alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, flat carbonation. Rather overpowering fruit aroma (plus that damned gasoline) hurts this one.
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;Draft at Maple Shade for the barrel aged beers event. Poured a rather ugly muddy brown that had burgundy edges and a spotty light beige head. Aroma of cherry, wet wood and super old rotting banana. The body was watery with some noticeable acidity, super soft carbonation and a slightly sour finish. Flavor of sour cherry, wood, acidity, earth and some balsamic vinegar on the end. Good stuff but the body thinned out with age.
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;8-yr old batch at the Barrel & Bug event 2013. Aroma of tart cherry, caramel and a yeasty sourdough. Pours bright hazy red with typical brewpub film. Tast is very tart with underripe cherry, cranberry, and a dusty cellar funk. Nice mouth pucker up front but the finish was a little dusty for my taste. All in all, my favorite sour of the day.
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;"8 year old brew, on tap at Iron Hill Mapleshade for their ""Bourbon and Bugs"" event. Red pour with light head/lace. Notes of sour funk, wood, caramel, cherry and cranberry. Pretty well balanced and the age def helped this one out after reading previous reviews."
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;"This was at the Maple Shade, NJ location @ Barrels, Bourbon, and Bugs Event in March 2013; Commercial description is A deep red, Flemish Brown Ale, starts off malty with a bit of caramel charaacter, Finsihes witha refreshing tartness.

Nose is malty, sour mashy fruit, woody. Taste is woody, raisiny, malty, with some tartness and a definite caramel apple flavor. Not sure what the deal is with this batch that I had, but I kept the menu displaying it in the seasonal list in case a query comes up.
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;some lacing. smell of raisin with a watery raisin taste. not as good as Rodenbach
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;Flat brown, beautiful deep chestnut colored with no head. Nutty chocolate and cherries nose, earthy more than woody, nicely toasted malts taste good, but feel a bit out of place. Very fruity, figgy, plummy and apple-like. Rather subdued taste, faint candyish sweetness, licorice stick and light watery palate, a bit sticky and almost flat.. too bad.
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;07.16.05 Tap at BCTC. Cloudy brown, little head. Brown sugar, caramel apple, super sweet nose. Flat. Lots of sugar in flavor (brown sugar). Dominated by sugars, not a hint of sour. Prunes and dates.
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;(Draught) Sampled at the Belgium Comes To Cooperstown 2005 in Cooperstown, NY. Pours a cloudy, reddish body with a dissipated white head. Smell of toasted pop tarts and fig newtons. Flavour of a thin watery, fig juice. Good.
Iron Hill Oud Bruin;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Iron Hill West Chester;BCTC. Kind of a let down after their great lambic. This is more like an old-ale than a flemish sour. Brown sugar & butterscotch nose. Those smells continue into the flavor and mingle with a bit of fruitiness. Oakey slightly cherry finish.
Lancaster Saison;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Hazy orange color. The nose picked up orange, yeast, and wheat, and other grain tones. Flavor was strong oranges and spice with very minimal bitterness. Very enjoyable.
Lancaster Saison;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Corriander and rosemary. Good spice aroma. Appealing to smell, somewhat less to taste. Begins like a saison and ends like a wit. Somewhat refreshing, but ends too spicy and herbally dry.

Cottage Going For Gold;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;15th August 2008. Clear amber beer. Soft creamy beer. Nice fruit profile - mild non bitter finish. Refreshing and moorish.
Cottage Going For Gold;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask (Head of Steam, Euston) (2004) Light copper, thin head. Sweet and light fruity aroma - citrus hops too. Taste is very well balanced bitter, pleasant lightly-roasted malts carrying a refreshing hoppiness.

Cottage Going For Gold;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Golden, foggy body. Hoppy pineapple aroma. Thin through the middle but arriving with solid bitterness very late on the palate. Not an unpleasant drop by any stretch.
Cottage Going For Gold;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Dog + Bone, Gillingham. Chrissie liked this. Butterscotch and apple. Low hop awareness. A very laid back ale which is going for gold by laying down and waiting for its tummy to be tickled. Pale gold colour.
Cottage Going For Gold;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;"Presumably an Olympic special. Singularly inappropriate considering the performance of the British competitors so far. Yet another in the seemingly interminable ""Sporting Whippet"" series. Occasionally, however, these beers impress, and this is one such beer. Mid copper colour. The aroma is mainly soft malt, but there�s some tangy hop there too. Fruity flavour with hops coming through very nicely. Clean, crisp mouthfeel and finish. A rather nice, well balanced best bitter. Cask (handpump), Head of Steam, Euston, London NW1."
Tower Winter Spirit;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Tower Brewery;Cask @ Wenlock arms. Pours a clear dark amber color with an off-white head. Roasted malty chocolate aroma. Roasted malty chocolate flavor. Has a sweet malty chocolate finish.
Tower Winter Spirit;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Tower Brewery;Cask at Market Porter, Dec 07. Sweet malty bitter, you might call this a Winter Warmer. A bit grainy, a bit yeasty, not outstanding.
Tower Winter Spirit;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Tower Brewery;Cask (handpull) Brunswick, Derby. Sometimes, things connect. Cool day. Warm pub. Hot chips. Succulent burger. Great pint. Deep brown body, smooth malts, hold the sharp edge of a dry knife to the back of your palate and then swiftly withdraws... impressive stuff.
Tower Winter Spirit;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Tower Brewery;Cask Stillage at the New Century Hall, Manchester 21/01/2006 Amber coloured with sour fruit aroma and flavour. Slightly dry and bitter on the palate with a full malt finish.
Tower Winter Spirit;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Tower Brewery;Burton Winter Fest. Quite dark brown in colour. Aromas are malty and fruity with chocolate and dry hops. Flavours are smooth, fruity and malty. Becomes quite dry and bitter with the malts struggling to get noticed. Has a touch of the homebrew kit about it. OK.
Tower Winter Spirit;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Tower Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Amber beer, no head. Wine aroma. Gentle malty beer, with a smooth smidgin[sp?] of mulled fruits. Pretty boring and average really.

A: malty, bit bready, caramel touch. T: medium malty base, watery grainy, bready touch, clear bit too boring taste yet not bad for the style, medium carbonation, metallic touch, ok drinkable but still a lot of tradition beyond this beer.
Pax Pils;Opitter-Bree, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Cornelissen;Bottle 0,25ltr: Clear golden colored brew with an slightly sweet bitter taste with some dryness. Almost taste like an German Pilsener but not yet close.

Pax Pils;Opitter-Bree, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Cornelissen;Sampled from 0.25 l bottle from 'Prik & Tik' (Tongeren) as 'prik & tik Pils', best before March 2018. Clear, golden yellow with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, white head. Sweetish, slightly grassy aroma of grains, corn and some straw. Moderately sweet, slightly bitter, grassy taste of grains, straw and hints of cardboard, followed by a short, medium bitter, quite grassy and rather dry finish.

Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle courtesy of bhensonb. This poured a amber color without much head. Nose of very light malts and hops, but but basically odorless. Fizzy mouthfeel. Flavor is off somehow, with some floral notes. Bitter finish, but not a nice bitter. This bottle is labeled Two Palms Brewing Company in Berkeley CA but I suspect this is bogus and it was contract brewed by Pyramid as it says above for the mass market.
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Light aroma of citrus hop, backed by some light malt. Light amber, golden amber?, color with a beige head that sticks a bit. Medium mouthfeel. Starts with light hop, followed by light malt. There�s a deal of carbonation, but it�s smooth rather than harsh. The finish is well balanced, and the bitter persists. It�s just more like a light APA than an IPA.
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);$4.99/12 at Albertsons, I got 2 each of this, the PA and the wheat and went through the self checkout -- guess that thing�s good for something. Yellow color just this side of macro, a little more golden than that, decent white head, extremely carbonated. Aroma is metallic, corny, taste is a little better of slight grapefruit and metal. Probably the worst IPA I�ve had, if it can be called one.
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Bottle. Fruity aroma with some hops; fairly average nose. Hazy gold wih lots of visible carbonation. Some lace. Not great. Not bad. Just unrefined. Nothing stands out about this beer. It�s not painful to drink but it makes you want something more."
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottled. Hazy, honey-colored liquid topped by a medium-sized white head, leaving behind sticky blotches and rings--some ring//sheet things--of lace. Smells metallic, corn, sugary, hay, some muted pine/grapefruit rind hops. Body is lighter with quick, foamy carbonation and a half wet n watery, half dry finish...it does eventually dry out, but it is awful wet for a while. Sugar, touch of honey, floral, spicy, a touch woody, grass, a bit of sour sweat//leather earthiness on the finish before the respectably bitter finish. Very drinkable, despite some undesirable--albeit light--flavors. Mild and muted. Looks good, smells bad, tastes ok.
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Light golden color with quickly dissipating white head. Fresh citrus aroma gives way to light hop taste. There is a difference between hoppy and skunky, this beer id the later. Not a horrible beer for the price (cheap).
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);A reasonable IPA but nothing to make it standout from others. If you like IPAs the bitter aftertaste is very defined.
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Had this one from the bottle purchased at Albertsons (the best part about this beer was that it was on SALE). Pretty weak on the hop character in both flavor and aroma. I wouldn�t consider this an IPA at all. Just another bland fizzy beer. No bad tastes, but no good ones either.
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Drinkable at best but Very Dissappointing. I should have known anything coming out of Berkely CA isn�t going to be great. Poured Medium-Dark gold with very little head, and no lacing . Mouth feel was on the watery body side, with moderate carbonation. Aroma was very slight, almost corn-like. Flavor not too great. I didn�t detect any grapefruit whatsoever, as some raters have. IIt was on the sour side with very slight burnt malt, with a slight hoppy finish. I would not classify this as an IPA compated to any other true IPAs out there. Pass this one up.
Two Palms Sand Dune IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Not a bad looking beer, but it goes downhill from there. Smells sour and corny and burpy. Really citrusy (sourish) hops with with some peppery notes. Thin and no malt presence whatsoever. Not a very good beer at all.

Amber pour with frothy head, way over carbonated. Floral notes on the nose. Slighty oxidized flavor aith caramel malts, toffee, and dried fruit. Slightly dry finish, overall a nice beer considuring its storage conditions.
Highland Heather Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Highland Brewing Company;12oz bottle. I struggled with whether or not to rate this given the age of the bottle (3-4 years old), but it was stored in a fridge the entire time and did hold up remarkably well. The heather must have acted as a preservative because it tastes as fresh as the fresher bottle of Fraoch I sampled alongside this one for comparison. Enough about the background. Pours brown with a red tint and an off white head. Smells of heather, strong spice, some caramel and slightly nutty. Tastes of sweet caramel, some raisins, some floral notes, in all likelihood coming from the heather used in the beer, some dryness as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a finish that is sweet and lasting. While I enjoyed this beer, I found Fraoch to be superior to it.
Highland Heather Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Highland Brewing Company;This rating is from extremely old notes. I found this to be a very pleasing beer. The nose is quite flowery, with a tremendous amount of earthiness. The Heather emits a really unique perfuminess that is unmistakable. All the flavors kind of play with your senses in different ways, but the finish just drops right off which is kind of disappointing. I was kind of hoping for a little more body. Very drinkable though.
Highland Heather Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Highland Brewing Company;Nice heather in the aroma. The beer malt base was just right to balance the heather.
Highland Heather Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Highland Brewing Company;On tap at mellow mushroom and also sampled from bottle. The draft was far superior. Interesting substitution of heather for hops. It was smoother than some other heather ales I�ve had, but that�s not saying much. Body was a little weak. It�s drinkable but nothing to crow about.
Highland Heather Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Highland Brewing Company;Nice heather aroma, a bit thin. Solid brown color. OK, too many other better beers out there.
Highland Heather Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Highland Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with BlueDevil0206, thanks James!) The small, light tan head stands in stark contrast to the very dark ruddy brown body. But for as dark as this beer is, it has surprisingly little body and isn�t all that flavorful either. This beer is quite dry, with only a slight sweetness in the background. Mostly, it�s spicy, herbal, lightly roasty, mildly bitter. The nose is dry, a bit malty, lightly roasty, but I really need to swirl my glass to get much in the way of aroma with this beer. Light-medium body has a somewhat watery mouthfeel, especially in the finish. The head fades to a ring fairly quickly. Not coming close to tickling my fancy.

Highland Heather Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Highland Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from Johnathan3584 as a bonus! Thanks Jonathan! Pours dark brown with some ruby highlights with a slight offwhite head that lingers around the edge of the glass and laces a little. Aroma is of roasted carmel malt, some prunes/raisins and just a touch of floral hops. Flavor starts out sweet with notes of plums and sweet malts and ends with a nice roasty peat flavor.. This reminds me a lot of a severely tamed hair of the dog adam. On the palate this is medium bodied but the watery finish kills it. This could definitely benefit from that NC cap being lifted.. A touch more malt would make this one very good. Still a good brew though quite drinkable and a good session brew! This brewer should rock when they get a chance to make the big beers..

Fitgers Park Point Pilsner;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fitgers Brewhouse;Sampled on draught at the Fitger�s Brewhouse in Duluth, MN. Pours a clear light pale golden brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves behind very little trace of head or lacing. Aroma of light bread-like malt and just barely some grassy hops. Taste is light bodied, plenty of carbonation, some light grittiness with a light bread and herb flavor. Finish has a dry bitterness, a little watery with a light bread aftertaste.
Fitgers Park Point Pilsner;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours a clear gold, lots of effervesence, with the size of the head dependant upon how aggressive the pour was. As I was in a hurry to drink this, the head is about an inch and a half, nearly white and soap-sudsy-like foam. Good head retention and even lacing. Smooth cereal malt in the aroma with nice grassy spicy hops. The flavor is very similar to the aroma, a drier biscuity cereal malt with very nice tart Noble hopping. The hop flavor is grassy and spicy, and leaves a near-citrus bitterness in the finish. Also in the finish, there is a subtle lemony fruit flavor, ever so slightly sweetened.

Fitgers Starfire Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Tap at Fitgers Brewhouse in a pint glass. Blonderedhead also imbibing. Straw golden with a hue of orange distinguishing it from a standard domestic. Full finger of white head. Nice lacing. Nose is a slight floral citrus with a pine accent. Taste has plenty of bitterness as expected since hops are in charge. Not a lot of sweetness coming through. Pine and a citrus rind characteristic. Not for a non-hop fan. Relatively easy to drink but I�m missing some balance. Average.

Fitgers Starfire Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at GTMW 2014 A reintroduction to Fitgers started with a basic session beer. Buried at its heart is that upper Midwestern niceness that asks for permission before smothering you in hops. Bright and citrusy, this draft exemplifies the typical Fitgers attention to detail. Aroma / Appearance - A light coppery body shimmers in the bright summer afternoon light. Fluid with just a thin trace of head, the body slowly unfolds with waves of citrusy hops, mellow malts, and an understated nature that feels apt for a beer from Minnesota. Flavor / Palate - A burst of citrus tickles the tongue. It then explodes with a rich flavor that carries into a crisp finish. A refreshing beer packed with flavor tempts one to stay and get more more pours. If this is a regular draft I will be ordering one when I visit Duluth some day.
Fitgers Starfire Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Draft at the brewpub. This is a very good, textbook APA. It delivers a sturdy malt backdrop, then a slippery, citric hop flourish. A go-to choice. (#5675, 8/29/2014)

Three Degrees Fuss Pots;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Gunn Island Brewbar;17 Aug 2004 - Fruity hop malt aroma, that does not last. Clear amber , low head retention with good lacing. A pleasant fruity sweet malt that gives way to a slight metallic taste. Easy drinking, slightly fizzy but a clingy Pride of Ringwood aftertaste. Couldn�t keep drinking this beer, you�ve had enough at the end of the glass.
Three Degrees Fuss Pots;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Gunn Island Brewbar;"Firstly I�ll list a few things I object to about this beer. 1. A glass costs $5. 2. They serve it in these big, clunky glasses which are like a tall tumbler - not cool. 3. They advertise this beer with a stupid slogan like ""Beer for blokes. Made by a chick."" (I�m paraphrasing.) Anyhow, it�s actually not such a bad beer. Doesn�t start or finish very well, but in the middle it�s quite good. Aroma is pretty poor. All I could smell was bready yeast (much like VB etc.) Nice firm maltiness with a fair bit of crystal malt, and reasonable hop character, but then it finishes with a bit of warm-VB-opened-the-night-before funk which is disappointing. One thing that impresses me with this brewery�s beers is the nice, thick mouthfeel but I�m not entirely sure it�s appropriate for the styles they brew."
Three Degrees Fuss Pots;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Gunn Island Brewbar;Aroma: lightly malty with some floral hop & a touch of stone fruit. Appearance: clear amber with a huge head (when first poured) that dissipates fairly quickly. Flavour: malty, hoppy with some caramel sweetness (maybe not maltier but more crystal malt?). Balanced maltiness with a fair amount of bitterness. Only some formaldahyde notes present. Palate: thin with some residual bitterness (common to Aussie lagers most likely pride of ringwood).

Brutopia Maibock;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brutopia - Brasseur Artisanal;"ummmmm, either my defonition of bock is REALY wrong, or this is not a bock at all. Canadian ale is how I would describe this one, blond, adjunts, ale yest, cold lagered. But I digress. Pours a deep gold, low carbonation, large bubbles, thick small whispy head, light lacing. mouthfeel is chewy, full and soft/silky. Aroma is sweet plumb with some cerals and a touch of brown grass like hop. Taste is simple. Domonance of brutopia�s almost ""Signature"" spoiled malt {stop cheeping out mr brewmaster} corn syrop, mild maltyness, flowery hop, grassy hop, and a very nice blend of barn yard grains {corn, oat, rice ect....} with undernotes of sweet corn, cornstarch, spicy hop, ripe fruit and silky smoth crystal malt. Aftertaste is suprising! Stong bitterness dominates with undernotes of bready malt and just a hit of unactive yeast. Very refreshing. Not a bock, but very refreshing. Great example of what ""50"" tries to be. Should be called ""Brutopia�s clasic canadian"" or somthing like that. but not the my-bock play on words they use. WE MUST STOP CANADA�S OBSESION WITH MISLABEINIG BEER {blue is called a pilsner, keiths is called a ipa, brown ales are called ""Rouse"", pale ales with a touch of roasted barley are called mild�s, malt liquors are called strong beer, ect, ect} BEFORE IT�S TOO LATE!!!!!!!!

Fitgers Bruges Belgian Blonde;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fitgers Brewhouse;16 oz. pour on tap at the brewhouse. This was the first of 9 Fitger�s beers I tried on 4-4-08, but the only one that I got in a pint instead of a 3 oz. sampler glass. Aroma of citrus (orange, lemon), coriander, and a touch of bubblegum and watermelon. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a small to moderate amount of near-white head. Produces nice lacing. The taste is not as sweet as I espected, although there is an underlying sweet cream flavor. The key flavors come from the dry, spicy, lemony, peppery finish. The taste is better than I expected. Light to medium body. Soft in the palate. Low in carbonation. Easy to drink. The beer came out of the tap very fast, and I think that may have interfered with the intended palate effects. Fitger�s Bruges Belgian Bolonde is not a bad beer at all, but it is nothing special.
Fitgers Bruges Belgian Blonde;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fitgers Brewhouse;An abyss of bright lemon candy yellow cloud. Totally opaque. Atop, a pure white cloud of merangue-like head. Aroma is a slightly distance lucid lemon and hexane. The right desnity, with the esters not overpowering, instead letting some yeast and grain into the limelight. Flavor is an inexplicably bright, lemon wheat and candied lemon rind, swirling with some fig and herbal notes, all pouring over a cold savory pear and light nuttiness. Lots of wheat. Alcohol actually shows through a little, with a tart warmth in the humours. Bubbly and well carbonated with lots of delicious freshness. Sugary and a hit of dry euro hop pucker on the back end. Fantastically balanced.
Fitgers Bruges Belgian Blonde;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fitgers Brewhouse;Kind of a hazy gold color with no head. Very odd aroma... maybe pickles or Pert shampoo. Upon further reflection, it�s probably a different strain of yeast, as is pretty evident in the flavor. Kind of lemony as well. Tasty!

Pours a hazy golden pale brew with a creamy white head that quickly dissipates to a thin white ring and film top. Aroma of Belgian ale character with scents of light banana esters, yeast, a subdued cloves and multi-grain malt. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with flavors of light multi-grain malt, yeast and a touch of banana esters. Finish is semi-sweet, some fruity aftertaste of banana and apple.
Fitgers Amsterdam Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fitgers Brewhouse;Reeks of hexane and rotten lemons. Light golden clear pour, with totally diminished head. No lacing. Extremely strong ester profile, which is too much for me. Tastes like a rubber sneaker. Palate thins out fast and leaves a little oily residue. Can�t really finger anything distinct, other than some orange flavor.

Holdens Netherton Flickers;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Holdens Brewery;Cask at Queens Head, Lichfield. Thin white cream head, golden body, creamy bitterness with little aroma, watery wash of fruit, seemed to under-deliver.
Holdens Netherton Flickers;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Holdens Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. In absolutely wonderful condition it was one of the most golden bright beers I�ve ever seen. Capped with a cream/beige head the beer had a sulphurous bitter aroma. Flavour was solid and firm bitter with good length and clarity.
Bowland Owd Stammerer;Clitheroe, Lancashire, England;Brown Ale;Bowland Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. A large discussion broke out in one corner of the bar about the properties of this beer. A clear dull amber body was thinly capped with an off-white head. Asparagus, bubble gum, vanilla and toffee. Other notes from the boy are , custard, vanilla fudge, spearmint and liquorice. This beer apparently had it all. It certainly was varied and complex, probably worth trying several times from start to finish.
Harvest Moon London Porter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);One of the few draughts I�ve rated. Black pour. Nose and taste of coffee and mocha. Very tasty. Rated 11/25/2000
Harvest Moon London Porter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);A beautiful black coloring with a tan head. The aroma showed a lot of bittersweet chocolate, while the flavor was all coffee. This beer had a great finish and definately proved to be my favorite.
Harvest Moon London Porter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Tap at the brewpub. Brown with a diminishing head. Ok. Vanilla porter was much better. Nice roasty aroma. Malty. Full bodied. Enjoyable.
Harvest Moon London Porter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Tap at the brewpub. Brown with a diminishing tan head. Roasty, fruity aroma. Roasty carmel flavor, and a slight tart finish.This is a basic average porter, and not quite as bad as what the previous rater says.
Harvest Moon London Porter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);I had to bump up the overall impression cause I love this place. Unfortunately, I did not love this beer. Newly brewed in July, this is a very harsh and painful to drink porter. Now I know what Palate actually means. It felt too astringent and painful in the mouth to enjoy. If given the option, try their sully oatmeal stout instead. Steer clear.

Hotteuse Grand Cru;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Bottled 330ml from Marche de Natalie, Bouillon, Belgium. Pale gold to yellow with white head. There is quite a heavy carbonation with this, but the beer is sharp, fresh, despite an ageing of 4 yrs, lemony citric with a Belgian boiled sweetness and spicy yeast. All in all a well set up beer, lasting on the palate and well worth trying.

Hotteuse Grand Cru;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Bottle@Home. Light citrus, sparkling, well balanced. Not overwhelming nor very interesting but just a good Triple. I�m pretty sure BTW this is brewed by van Steenbergen and could easily be the same beer as Augustijn Grand Cru.

Pearl Street Bedwetter Barley Wine;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pearl Street Brewery;Very good traditional style barleywine. Aroma�s malty, toffee, hint of yeast. Flavor�s like nose, bittersweet and fairly easy drinking. Strength shows later. Good stuff.
Pearl Street Bedwetter Barley Wine;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pearl Street Brewery;Aged for a year this beer is truly amazing! Malty and warming it has deep complexity with prune and tobacco notes. Pours a deep hazy amber.
Pearl Street Bedwetter Barley Wine;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pearl Street Brewery;GTMW. Poured cloudy amber with a creamy beige head. The aroma was on the sweet side, with toffee, caramel, and fruity notes topped by peppery warmth.. very enticing. The flavor found toffee and fruity notes at the core, with some odd buttery character, fruity bitterness, and other nondescript bitterness around.. finished with more of the weird stuff.. this went downhill as it progressed. Medium-plus bodied, but slick on the palate.. low carbonation.
Pearl Street Bedwetter Barley Wine;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pearl Street Brewery;Draft at Dexters. 10%. Black-brown, a hint of orange. Cloudy. Big off-white/beige head. Rich caramel tones, very malty. Mild hops are quite overwhelmed by the sugar sweetness of the malt. A little boring as far as mouthfeel, almost watery, but still captures the style well enough. Big and brutal, resinous sugary chocolate finish.
Pearl Street Bedwetter Barley Wine;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pearl Street Brewery;Sampled this beer at the Great Taste of the Midwest in Madison WI. Even though my scores on this are accurate and well researched, Da Man wants me to say more about the beer, so I will. The first beer I sampled at GT, so the one I remember the best. Good aroma and flavor, but not as much hoppyness as I usually like.

Hampshire Bees Knees;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;"Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham during their ""Wheat Weekend"". Cloudy amber, with a thin head. Elements fo cocoa in the aroma. Really strange flavour combination - rich berries, choc, mulled-ness and soothing, sweet wheat. Quite nice, but hard to pin down."
Hampshire Bees Knees;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;Tamworth Festival. Massess of honey all around this, big nose, honey body thanks to the wheatiness, great honey taste at first but its a bit cloying in the finish.

Whitstable Bohemian Pilsner / Bohemium;Maidstone, Kent, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whitstable Brewery;Cask conditioned handpump Sun Hardingstone 05/04/14. A blonde beer with a white head and lace. Light and lagery. Clean and tasty enough. Doesn�t have so much a Czech character as a Central European character. Tasty enough.
Whitstable Bohemian Pilsner / Bohemium;Maidstone, Kent, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whitstable Brewery;"Bottle: Pale golden, hazy, small white foamy layer, perfumed grainy nose with very well hidden hoppy traces; tart bitter flavour, light bodied and harsh; short bitter-fruity finish. Oh no, they should better keep on brewing Oyster Stout�"
Whitstable Bohemian Pilsner / Bohemium;Maidstone, Kent, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whitstable Brewery;(draught keg @ The Continetal Hotel,Whistable). Not a Pils @ all. I was pretty eager to sample this , as Pils fan , so when something calling itself a pils is in reality some crappy pale lager with out a hop profile , well im not buying a second.
Whitstable Bohemian Pilsner / Bohemium;Maidstone, Kent, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whitstable Brewery;330ml bottle. Pours light gold with no head. Aroma is a bit of vinegar and a little cheesy champagne. Taste has grass and straw with a slight sour touch. Better then a macro but still a bit boring.
Whitstable Bohemian Pilsner / Bohemium;Maidstone, Kent, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whitstable Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Southampton Arms, Kentish Town, London. Pale straw with white head. Thin, malty beer, a little on the dry side and a touch of bitter lemon, otherwise fairly bland.

Whitstable Bohemian Pilsner / Bohemium;Maidstone, Kent, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Whitstable Brewery;330ml bottle from Utobeer Market Stall, shared with friends at a hotel room in Earls Court. Gushy stuff, not easy to stop, but we managed at last to get a good taste of the remaining content. Huge, but quickly vanishing, white foam. Hazy, straw coloured with a greenish tint. Malt-fruity aroma. Bready malts and subdued citrus in flavour. Dry in the mouth. Medium bodied. Alright, but far from memorable (London, 02.08.2009).

English Ales Victory ESB;Marina, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;English Ales Brewery;Tap. Golden amber pour. Strong roasted malt aroma. Flavor is also roasted malts with some nice spicy hops. Lighter body and lower carbonation.
English Ales Victory ESB;Marina, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;English Ales Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Pours a clear amber/brown. Earthy hop aroma, flavor is fruity malt, juicy grapes, caramel and hops. A full flavored and well balanced ESB. Delicious! Wish I could�ve brought some back to the east coast with me.
English Ales Victory ESB;Marina, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;English Ales Brewery;On tap. Pours a clear amber with a white creamy head. Mlaty aroma. Taste is malts and grain, very clean tasting. Water like mouthfeel with light carbonation

Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are mild, grapefruity and citrusy. Medium bitterness. Nicely balanced. Smooth taste. A somewhat bitter ESB. Nice for a change, most of the ESBs I�ve had lately have been rather mild and without any bitterness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Framptons Black Oak Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);Bottle 03/07/2003 Golden coloured and slightly sweet on the palate. Some dryness in a tangy finish.
Framptons Black Oak Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);At first I thought this must be an unattributable own label cider and was doubtful about rating it. However, it does seem that there is a company called Frampton Village Cider Company, although there is precious little information about its cider making activities. I did note that it is based in the same village as Wye valley Brewery - some connection? A perfectly acceptable, but unexciting commercial supermarket cider from Tesco in a 2 litre PET bottle. OK for slaking a thirst and certainly better than some commercial ciders I could mention.
Blue Tongue Winter Brew;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);"on tap at the ""brewery"" in newcastle. a great disappointment that the old newcastle old is no more. anyways this is pretty bland - dark brown with a thin head; rubbery aroma; some light bitterness and an otherwise dusty finish"
Blue Tongue Winter Brew;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Agree with the previous rater. It�s pretty much Tooheys Old. Except Tooheys Old is better. Quite bland and thin really.
Blue Tongue Winter Brew;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Seems that this is the replacement (hopefully temporary) at the Brewery in Newcastle for Newcastle Old. It�s a winter seasonal but don�t worry too much if you miss it: a very unremarkable Tooheys Old style dark ale. After one minute my head became some few soapy suds around the edge of glass. Flavour was inoffensive bordering on some taste. I miss Newcastle Old.
South Street Wit;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;South Street Brewery;Appearance is nice: very soft looking head that sits on top of a light golden cloudy brew. Aroma is weak, but citrusy- not exactly like mose of the witbiers I�ve smelled, but not completely unlike it. Taste is a bit thin and average. It�s thirst quenching, but nothing overly special.
Grizzly Peak Kriek;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;Served in an attractive flute. Color was more burnt orange than pink. Aroma was quite sour and lambic but the flavor failed to match this. Like cherry flavored carbonated water, actually. Thin (very) body and flat. But I have to give the brewpub props for attempting this style.
South Street Rebel Brown;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;South Street Brewery;"An ""experimental brew"" according to their menu, this beer is ""carbonated in the cask with bourbon-soaked cherries,"" and is served at ""cellar temperature."" Anyway, the sight is gorgeous. Deep brown, with specks of spice lingering about. Small head. Smell is very appealing as well: roasted nuts, cherries, and other lingering aromas make this complex. Flavor is very much like their other nut brown. Two complaints: this beer would definitely benefit from being slightly chilled. I don�t think this was quite ""cellar temperature,"" but more room-temperature, as it was nearly warm. Other complaint is the lack of carbonation... felt like drinking beer that had sat out all day and lost a lot of its punch. I hope they keep experimenting with it- this one has the potential to be outstanding."
Vasileostrovskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Vasileostrovskaya Pivovarnya / Vasileostrovskaya Brewery;Clear golden with a white smallish head.

Vasileostrovskoe Flash Back;St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Vasileostrovskaya Pivovarnya / Vasileostrovskaya Brewery;Bottle, shared by Per. Murky but in the light it�s red, and flat. Nice dark malts, lots of Malta. Tart, though. Not supposed to be, I imagine. But inoffensive. Like a fruity tang. Acidic, thin, and tart all around.
Vasileostrovskoe Flash Back;St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Vasileostrovskaya Pivovarnya / Vasileostrovskaya Brewery;Draught at Pivnoi Bar Prokhodimets, St. Petersburg. Hazy nut brown, small head. Tart lactic nose with raspberries and chocolate. Sweet and sour with medium body and soft mouthfeel. Low bitterness.Too much frambozenlambic tartness to be OK.
Vasileostrovskoe Flash Back;St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Vasileostrovskaya Pivovarnya / Vasileostrovskaya Brewery;On tap at the Pivnoi Bar in St. Petersburg. Poured a hazy dark mahogany with ruby highlites. Sweet aroma of some rich chocolate with notes of fruit acidity. Taste is very sweet, some chocolate, cherries, toffee, slightly citrusy. Fairly full body. Almost too sweet to finish the .5 liter glass, but still a very unique and refreshing beer.
Vasileostrovskoe Flash Back;St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Vasileostrovskaya Pivovarnya / Vasileostrovskaya Brewery;Cloudy chestnut brown colour. Sweaty, wheaty aroma. Smooth, sweet palate with candyish notes and orange. Strange, with the heavy citric notes, but a very lively palate. Body is fairly light. I�ve never had a beer quite like this before.
Piter Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Bavaria (Sun-InBev);Light copper colour. Aroma is light, but shows caramelly, bready malts. Slight appley notes. Quite clean otherwise. Minerally, wet finish
Stepan Razin Vyborgskoe Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Yellowish with thin ugly head. Chemical and grassy aroma, sour adjuncty palate. Swill.

Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap @ Goose Island Clybourn. Clear golden with a white head. Aroma of zesty citrus, spicy rye and some toasty malt. Flavor is bitter up front with the malt and rye adding a balance. Medium body with average carbonation and a clean, crisp finish. Good Pale Ale, the rye adds a nice touch.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft @GTMW. Pours a light amber with a full white head. The aroma is very hoppy, grassy. The flavor is full of hops, with just a touch of the malt coming through, but that is quickly covered up by the hoppy finish. Very well made.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn location. Coudy light color with small white head. Grassy aroma. Very hoppy, fairly bitter, lots of pine and citrus. A little too woody to be extremely drinkable, but overall excellent beer.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);growler via myself. i didn�t realize this is so well rated. definitely not worth $16 for a growler refill, where does GI get off? there really wasn�t any rye in the flavor it all. it was pretty hoppy all around, pretty IPAish with a bit of a lager taste as well. reasonably drinkable, but probably would have started to get kinda heavy after 3 pints of it. so not a session by any means. in retrospect i wish i�d paid more attention to the hops so i�d be able to identify tomahawk in the future. but instead i was at a party. oh well.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Growler via Jason. The beer pours to a hazy straw/amber body with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet pineapple and pine and some sweet malts. The flavor is pine and spruce everywhere. Rye is there, but not overly intense. The palate is bitter and medium bodied.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Thanks to Ugsmash for sharing from a growler. cloudy off orange color w/ a nice white head and some decent lacing. Great hoppy aroma lots of tropical fruits very fruity... num num some sweet hop flowers as well and a good amount of oranges and carmel. Palate is fairly avg. flavor is surprisingly more bitter than i expected some pine and carmels some light tropical fruits. Pretty good stuff, could use a little more sweet.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pint on tap at Clybourn brewpub. Light orange and pretty much opaque in the pint with a feathery, soapy-looking dusting of head that leaves a big doily (sp?) lace half an inch up the side (nice). Smells of flowery hops and musty sugars. A bit watery at the very first, it settles into a warm medium-bodied feel. Sweetish, with the malts very nicely defined and somewhat dry, cracker and fruitcake. Flowery hops lilt over the top of the malts, and get delicately bitter and dry in the end, with a little bit of lingering citrus. Well crafted beer, great session ale.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);GTM �06 draught. Nice hempish, hop aroma. Wet hop. Hazy orange, not much head, not much lace, thinring of large bubble, off-white head. I don�t like the hop variety which is why I gave this brew a relatively low rating.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);From an Old growler from Librarybrewer.No head to speak of isince it�s age has depleted what carbonation it had.Nice dark amber color.Aroma was light malt with some hints of rye and a decent showing of fruit.The flavor was actually not bad for being over 5 weeks old.Malty and rye taste with some nice hints of fruit as well as a nice citrusy side and a good hop showing in the back ground.I have to say that this is or was a good brew and a fresher sample would probably render a larger rating but,from what i can see sofar it still ranks up there pretty high despite it�s flat feel and appearance.If i can get a fresher sample i rerate this tastey brew.
Goose Island Rye Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Growler from BBB63. Darker golden color with a good looking white head. Strong hop aroma followed by a bit of the rye spice character. Flip flopped in the flavor. The rye takes charge, yet the hop flavor manages not to be an afterthought. Solid mouthfeel. Good carbonation for sitting in a growler for a couple of weeks. Really good stuff.
Arsentich Svetloe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arsentich;"Golden colour; some pale bready notes. Hint of fruit, very light hop aroma. Frsh, clean malt character. Hop provides a slighlty berryish backing note that adds refreshment to the finish. Good helles."
Arsentich Svetloe Nefiltrovannoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arsentich;Biggish creamy white head over hazy yellow body. Acidic rubbery aroma with some sharpness, and hints of spice. Taste is wheaty and spicy, lightly acidic, with mealy mouthfeel. No aftertaste. Not at all bad, and quite refreshing. (0.3l on tap.)
Arsentich Svetloe Nefiltrovannoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arsentich;Golden with slight haze. Thick, rocky head. Slightly maltier than the filtered in the aroma. Otherwise basically the same beer. OK, perhaps a stronger hop note in the finish. Still, good helles.
Arsentich Temnoe;Moscow, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Arsentich;Big beige creamy head with some larger bubbles. Dark red-brown body with ongoing carbonation. Light roasty caramel malt aroma with faint hoppy background, and maybe some chocolate. Taste is light, stale roasty caramel. Unusual. Aftertaste is dryish. Lingering, chocolatey burnt taste. It`s OK. (0.3l on tap.)
Arsentich Temnoe;Moscow, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Arsentich;"Dark hazy chestnut brown; big thick head; aroma mainly of cocoa with slight hints of brown bread crusts and hazelnuts. Thinness detracts from the demerara body."
Angara Svetloe Nefiltrovannoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Angara Restaurant & Brewery;Hazier than the filtered, which makes the gold colour a little bit lighter. Thicker, more lasting foam. Same grainy, slightly estery macroish aroma. Palate is basically the same, perhaps a little dustier, but maybe that�s just because I want it to be.
Sixteen Tons Svetloe Spetsialnoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Ale - English;Sixteen Tons;Hand bottled to PET from brewery kindly donated by Gurthnar. Hazy yellow golden color with medium white head. Aroma of sweet malt, tangerines, herbal notes. Fruity taste with tangerines, orange zest, floral hos and herbal notes. Hoppy bitterness in fruity finish. Best from Sixteen Tons beers I�ve tasted.

Sixteen Tons Svetloe Spetsialnoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Ale - English;Sixteen Tons;"Biggish offwhite lasting creamy head; deep hazy orange body. Very faint milky aroma. Taste is strongly spicy, sweetish and milky, with notes of honey. Quite bitter. Dry, bitter, spicy aftertaste. Some pepper. Good. (0.35l on tap.) This is listed as ""Light Special"" in the English menu."
Sixteen Tons Svetloe Spetsialnoe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Ale - English;Sixteen Tons;Hazy orangey-amber colour. Strangely spicy aroma w/ caramel background. Very soft body. Gently herbal and caramelly- chamomile, sage, raspberries. Reminiscent of the countryside with all those natural nuances. Light body, though, feels kind of nitrogenated and dead. They ought to put this on cask and let it shine.
Sixteen Tons Temnoe Dvoynoe;Moscow, Russia;Mild Ale;Sixteen Tons;Hand bottled to PET from brewery kindly donated by Gurthnar. Dark brown color with medium beige head. Sour aroma of plum jam, coffee. Taste almost the same. I don�t think that this beer would be better at source.
Sixteen Tons Temnoe Dvoynoe;Moscow, Russia;Mild Ale;Sixteen Tons;PET bottle. Maybe this one did not survive the 36 hours journey, even though it was in termo bag. However who knows. Aroma coffee, chocolate and astringent sourness. Dark brown colour. Taste is sour, chocolate and coffee. Minus the sourness it would be good. Finish same as taste, medium duration. Either it is spoiled and it was good beforehand, or it is not spoiled and still drinkable, but weird and not to my taste. I will revisit this on my next journey to Moscow.

Sixteen Tons Temnoe Dvoynoe;Moscow, Russia;Mild Ale;Sixteen Tons;Tiny beige filkm of a head covers half the beer. Opaque black body goes hazy brown at edges. Faint milkiness to an aroma of nothing. Taste is sweet licorice with peppery mouthfeel, and notes of coffee. Some acidity. A bit light, but not bad. Taste could be stronger. Seems Russians want their beers light. (0.35l on tap.)

Durdin Bavarskoe Pshenichnoe;Moscow, Russia;Wheat Ale;Durdin;"Big creamy white lasting head; hazy dark orange body. Aroma with sweet and acidic notes, within an unimportant distance of being undetectable. Sweet milky taste with acidic, almost tart aftertaste. Body maybe a bit thin.

Durdin Kabinetskoe Krasnoe;Moscow, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Durdin;Clear ruby red with small fading off-white foam head. Not much of an aroma and likewise bit watery taste. Not a bad beer, but could have a bit more spunk to it. (Moscow 201404)

Durdin Bogemskoe Barkhatnoe;Moscow, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Durdin;Dark ruby color with off white lacing foam head. Little caramel aroma, nothing much. Nice taste, dark light caramel, even some coffee notes present. Like this beer. (Moscow 201404)

Klinskoe Zolotoe;Klin, Moscow Region, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Klinskiy Pivokombinat (AB InBev-Efes);It�s my favorite! Earlier, it can be buyed anythere. But now it is stopped to produce :(
Klinskoe Zolotoe;Klin, Moscow Region, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Klinskiy Pivokombinat (AB InBev-Efes);Bottle (33 cl). Golden colour, hoppy aroma, first sip is candylike, then it�s getting watery and harshly sweet.
Klinskoe Zolotoe;Klin, Moscow Region, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Klinskiy Pivokombinat (AB InBev-Efes);Very pale and bubbly. Aroma is a little bit of malt and a lot of corn. So much corn died to make this beer. That�s aIl I taste, besides a rather minerally variety of water. There�s people who want to drink this?
7 Stern Weizen Orange;Vienna, Austria;Flavored - Fruit;7 Stern Br�u;Very cloudy, much carbonation, creamy head and a orange/yellow color. Aroma is fruity with citrus notes. Very sweet taste and sticky. Noticeable orange taste. Taste very chemical, light a artificial orange ice. Too sweet, chemical and hard to finish.

Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Nice fruity drop, with a solid bitter finish. I definately recommend this one. A real winner.
Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Pours a nice deep amber color. Aromas of citrus. Strong hop flavors with malts and a dry finish.
Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Tap at Brouwers. The aroma is interesting and doesn�t really strike me as usual IPA like. Some toasty caramel sweetness with light grassy peppery hops. Pours a golden amber color with a decent lasting head. The flavor is initially medium sweet caramel and toasted malts. This is followed by a grassy sweet hop profile that was odd to me. The grassy sweet hops gently segue into a lasting floral peppery bitterness that lingers on the palate for a little while. I appreciate the uniqueness of this but thats about it.
Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Draft pint at a Whitefish restaurant. I�m flabbergasted by the previous ratings (most of them). I found this to be outstanding. But then, this was about my 12th beer for the day, and was consumed over an awesome pizza, and served by the hottest waitress I�ve seen in months ... but I digress ... Nice orange amber with a very well laced and frothy head. Beauty of a citrusy aroma. Perfect citric-hoppy flavors with a solid malt/mussy underpinning. I was impressed ... Quintessential American IPA ... not sure why the disconnect with others. (#2868, 5/12/2007)
Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;This beer was horribly sour tasting. I tried it over the course of a few days to eliminate any false tastings that I may have had due to food or something else. It tasted cheap. The color was nice, however.
Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Draught at the Parkway Tavern Day of IPAs. By now I�ve tasted too many beers in one day, so take this with a grain of salt. Pours a clear reddish amber. Light body, some citrus with an almost crisp finish.
Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Draft at the Parkway�s Day of IPAs. Dark gold, small white head. Yeasty nose. Mild malt body, crisp hop finish, watery, light finish. A little sweet.
Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Hazy light copper colour. Light citrusy, woody character. Woody, refreshing moderate hops. Woody dryness. Breadcrusty background with caramel and earth.
Lang Creek Wingwalker IPA;Marion, Montana, United States;IPA;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Tap @ Capone�s Coeur d�Alene, ID. Semi clear amber/copper w very good dark beige head, good lace. Carbonation could have been better (weak). Aroma is light/medium roasted malt w fresh, clean, floral hops. Flavor is slightly sweet, creamy smooth, light/medium roasted malt w good/strong cascade type hop flavor and bitterness. Nice spiciness. Medium bodied w lingering hop flavors and bitterness on the finish. They�ve rung the bell with this one. 8/15/06: I�m dropping this to a 3.7. I must have been a bit overzealous when I first rated it. (or maybe it changed a tad)
Kr�lovsk� Medovina Mandlov� (Royal Mead Almond);Z�b�eh na Morav�, Czech Republic;Mead;Vcelnex;Dark tan colour, still. Strong almond aroma on top of a sweet, lightly spicy body. Flavour is very sweet, lightly spicy, with a long almond finish. Alcoholic heat is obvious.
Kr�lovsk� Medovina Mandlov� (Royal Mead Almond);Z�b�eh na Morav�, Czech Republic;Mead;Vcelnex;Bottled. This is a herbal beverage made from honey, 18 sorts of rare herbs, ingredients and genuine almonds. It's unboiled, unlike most meads(?). The aroma is rich, with cherry stone up front, followed up by almonds. The sipping reveals �quite a thin� body for being a mead but the flavour is pleasantly sweetish with notes of almonds up front and cherry stone behind. The sweetness is not as balanced as in Vikingernes Mj�d, frankly it�s a bit too sweet, but I like it. The alcohol is clearly evident, as it should be I suppose, with that gut-warming feel. A stand-in for a liqueur maybe?
Struise Pannepot (10%);Oostvleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Struise Brouwers;Aroma: Moderate sweet, dried dark fruits, figs, dates and spices Appearance: Dark amber-brown with a medium white head that disappears fast Taste: Moderate sweet and mildly bitter, complex dark fruits, figs, dates and spices with a long duration Mouthfeel: Watery mouthfeel with moderate carbonation Overall: Good beer for the price :)

Struise Pannepot (10%);Oostvleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Struise Brouwers;2016 vs 2013 bottle, courtesy of SinH4. Pours dark brown with a lively head. Aroma is dried prunes, dark fruit, fig, hints of booze. Body is heavy, but not too dense or oily, rather drinkable texture actually. Rich and intense, hints of booze, far from overdone though. Fruity, in a dark Belgian way. The 2013 already has a much weaker body and is oxidized. Very good!

Struise Pannepot (10%);Oostvleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Struise Brouwers;I have found this beer, in the biervana shop, in Munich. Trying and enjoying a lot, this bottle, at home, in Epalinges. The color is black and deeply troubled, average carbonation, a bit high, white and brown foam. In the mouth, it is simply a bomb, an explosion of aromas, a bit similar with the rochefort 10, a solid beer, developping a lot of aromas of red wine in barrel, astonishing and well made aroma of vanilla, plum, cherry, sweetness so pleasant in the mouth, perfect dosis of hop, malt, a beer to savour quietly, contemplate the stars in the sky.
Archers February Flavour;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask@The Green, Shepherds Bush, London. I�m sick of Archers, pretty much all there beers taste the same. This was sweet and hoppy, with lightly aromatic aromas and flavours. Too sweet, almost sickly. Slightly drinkable.
Archers February Flavour;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Golden in colour this ale had little aroma although it had a slight malty fruity taste with a good bitterness. Not really their best as it needs a bit more in the flavour stakes.
Church End Fat Boy;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Church End Brewery;I thought this was a little disapointing from church end who can do better. They are the kind of brewery that must mix lots of different receipes. This is not the best and although pleasant I can only score it 10.
Rock Bottom Denver Smoked Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Rock Bottom Denver;Bomber poured a clear dark breown with a small lingering tan head. Aromas of smoke, chocolate and light coffee. Palate was medium bodied and crisp with a smooth finish. Flavors of smoke, cocoa and light coffee with a smooth lingering smokey finish.
Rock Bottom Denver Smoked Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Rock Bottom Denver;"Bomber purchased to go from downtown location, labeled as ""smoked up porter"" - pours a fizzy dark brown - fairly substantial, soapy lace - aroma of roasted, nearly burnt malts, damp charred wood, blueberries, light smoke - flavor is rather sweet - strong roasted malt character, some char and mild smoke, and a light bitterness try to temper this, but it remains pretty dang sweet - some anise quality thrown in there - fairly creamy texture - not nearly enough smoke for my taste, and that sweetness starts to get to me after a while - light acidity on the tail end, despite the high sweetness - not great, but better than I was lead to expect fro this brewery."
Rock Bottom Denver Smoked Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Rock Bottom Denver;Draught in Colorado Springs at Rock Bottom. Pours opaque with a rocky tan head and spotty lacing. Aroma is deep roasted chocolate malt, toasted grain, smoked wood and yeast (leather). Medium bitterness, dark chocolate and coffee, charcoal, malt, yeast, roasted caramel malt. Dark bodied, creamy and smooth palate.
Rock Bottom Denver Smoked Porter;Denver, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Rock Bottom Denver;Sampled @ Falling Rock, Denver. Deep brown color with a dark tan head. Nitro-like creamy head, and a smooth body initially. Liquid smoke in the nose and flavor, really heavy which is a common thing with this style. Rich smoke nose, not allowing anything else to make itself known. Rich texture, but not much present other than a buttery smoked flavor. One-dimensional.
Trinidad El Porto Robusto;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Porter;Trinidad Brewing Company;Samled @ brewery. Dark brown color with a tan head. Served @ proper temperature. Nose of espresso, campfire smoke, in fact a very strong smoky nose. Light carbonation, but certainly not light body. Thick, coating texture with a lot of liquid smoke steak marinade.... some chocolate and coffee as well in the finish. A good one, indeed. Certainly unique, and better than the usual fare. The folks at Trinidad know what they�re doing.
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;Pretty decent IPA. Tried for the first time in 2008 in the summer before the brewery closed. Dry and sweet. Amber color, malty and piney aroma. Pleasant.
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;"From Apr 2008 This pours from 22oz bottle(brew batch #41 on week 2 of March 08) a slightly hazy orange gold with a good 2 finger head of foam. Pretty good head retention and there's a bit of lacing. The smell is really hoppy with a big piney profile and a small but definitely there note of malt sweetness. You just have to take some deep whiffs to get to it. ;^) Taste wise again, the piney hops are in control, along with a melon sweetness and some bready tones trying to give this IPA some balance but I fear it falls way short. This thing is like sucking on a pine cone, it's *that* piney and while I do like a bit of that flavour in some of the IPAs I've tasted before, this one takes to a level that I don't really care for. It has a nice medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is light so...appearance & mouthfeel are certainly the best points of this brew. Drinkability? For me, it'll be kind of tough to finish off the bomber but in no way is it a drain pour. Cost: US$4.99"
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;10-May-08 (22-oz bottle: Shared by SDbruboy, thanks Cliff!) Dusty, citrusy, light piney hop flavor, but somewhat acidic with some mild plastic phenolics in the background. Toasty malts are very lightly roasty, but these seem relatively far in the background. In the nose, dusty and tart citrusy hops dominate, but tart stone fruits and plastic phenolics show more presence when the beer is swirled in the glass. And as in the flavor, the malty aromas are subdued and remain pretty far in the background. Medium in body and medium-high in carbonation with a dry, almost cottony mouthfeel. Dark ruddy-amber, hazy body is capped by an inch of off-white head that shows solid retention and is easily rejuvenated with some swirling. A naked patchwork of spotty lacing is left on the glass.
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;22oz bottle bought for $4.99 at Lukas with no freshness date. The color is a solid orange-amber with a healthy off-white head. The first smell makes me think of butterscotch but then becomes flowery hops as indicated on the label. The flavor has a vegetal hop flavor and then the butterscotch shows up on the finish. I�m no expert beer-taster but I think this one has too much diacetyl. As I made my way through the bomber my stomach got really upset and I had to pour the rest of the beer out so the drinkability gets the lowest score possible . I�m scared to try the Imperial Red next. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 03-29-2008 23:21:24
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;Draft from brewery. Wonderful bouquet dominated by floral aromas and a faint resiny smell is also detectable. Great taste starts with the green bitterness and fades into mild bitterness and malt flavors. I really enjoyed this IPA.
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;Bronze colored brew with a full sized creamy white foam. Fairly nice nose with some lemony and brightly fruity notes from the hops along with some well extracted dessert-like malts. Sweet malts with notes of spruce from the hops. Tea-like. Different.
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;Draught at brewery. Pours clear orange with a small, fizzy, white head, mostly diminishing with spare lacing. Aroma is average malt (hay, straw, meal), heavy hops (herbs, pine, citrus, grapefruit), average yeast (sweat, earth) with notes of apple and pear. Medium bodied, sticky texture, lively carbonation, and a bitter finish. Average duration, light sweetness, heavy acidity and bitterness.
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium to dark amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, caramel), moderately to heavily hoppy (resin), with a note of plastic. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter, husky. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;"22oz Bomber Bottled 4/08 Another brew in a recent trade with russpowell, thanks again Russ. Drop City pours surprisingly dark for an IPA. The appearance is more along the lines of an amber with dark ruby hues. A ruddy two finger off white head formed on the pour and as the larger bubbles burst the head began falling leaving sticky chunky lacing on its way down that eventually fell back into the body. Very few large carbonation bubbles rise to the surface. Half way through the glass the head is now a tiny ring and that�s it. The nose on this IPA is VERY non-IPA like. As a matter of fact it�s unlike any beer I�ve encountered in the past. Are you ready for this? As soon as I stick my nose in the glass I�m greeted by a huge amount of moist, freshly cut cedar. I actually really enjoy the smell but not in an IPA and not so much in something I�d like to drink. Let�s see where this goes. There�s a little of the wet fresh cut cedar right off the bat but it morphs into an earthiness rather quickly. There�s a bit of sweet maltiness along the lines of crystal and a slight caramel quality. The swallow brings a lazy bitterness and a mouthful of cedar. I don�t even think this is what the brewer was going for. It does grow on me but not what I want in an IPA. The carbonation is on the lower end of the spectrum and lets the medium body work through on its own. Drop City finishes a bit dry with a growing bitterness on the tongue. I�m going to finish this bomber but that�s all I could or would want to drink in a sitting. The flavors are just too...out there for me to enjoy anymore then a bomber. This beer isn�t all that bad but it�s not an IPA in any way, shape, or form. The bottle describes this as ""Deep golden color, full flower hop aroma and bitterness..."". I haven�t come across one of those things. This is my second offering from Trinidad and most likely my last. Both samples came no where near the styles listed on the bottles and both fell pretty flat. 5/18/08"
Trinidad Drop City IPA;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;IPA;Trinidad Brewing Company;22oz bomber. Batch #53. Looks like a red beer. Beige head and nice lacing. Earthy aroma, along with vanilla and pine. Taste recreates the nose, with a huge explosion of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth albeit a bit thin. Good strong hoppy aftertaste.
Pyatiy Okean Svetloe;Moscow, Russia;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Pyatiy Okean (Fifth Ocean) Pivnoy Dom I Restoran;I have a hard time believing that they sell a russian beer as their own in the Ale House in Sofia. However I might be wrong. As 'Live Beer' in said location. Hazy golden. Aroma is butter toast pear cake. Not intense. Taste is a bit strange sourness together with nice full bodied bready body. Sourish finish. Balanced well except for the sourness.
Pyatiy Okean Svetloe;Moscow, Russia;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Pyatiy Okean (Fifth Ocean) Pivnoy Dom I Restoran;The best thing about the beer was the tap at the table at Ale House in Sofia.

Pyatiy Okean Svetloe;Moscow, Russia;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Pyatiy Okean (Fifth Ocean) Pivnoy Dom I Restoran;On tap at Ale House, pours. Hazy golden blonde with a small white head.

Gusher... golden body I guess... aaaand... it�s off. Damn. Sharp stinky yeasty aroma, slightly sour. Taste...

Pyatiy Okean Svetloe;Moscow, Russia;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Pyatiy Okean (Fifth Ocean) Pivnoy Dom I Restoran;Draft @ Deja Vu and other bars in the Phan Theit area as well as in Saigon. The beer is bright hazy orange, with a good white head and decent retention. Fresh hoppy aroma with lots of leaves, grass, minerals. Clean, soft mouthfeel. Dry finish. Nice floral hop profile and sweet malt character to balance. Reminiscent of Boulder Mojo. Beer tastes best in Saigon with much livelier, fresher flavors, closer to the source.

Augsburger Oktoberfest;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;12 oz bottle from Woodmans on Gammon Road, Madison WI (October 2006) consumed from a Fitgers pint glass at cellar temperature. Warm whisky-gold color with a lasting creamy off-white head and a nice bit of lacing....pumpkin, caramel and cinnamon in the fine spicy nose, this is more like a pumpkin ale than anything else but I�m not complaining, light doughy yeast adds some depth, a delight....body isn�t able to keep up to the standards set in the aroma alas but there�s a decent malt depth, moderately sweet and lightly bready at the front, dry and somewhat dull towards the finish, dry and fairly strongly filtered mouthfeel, decent carbonation level. Overall I was pretty impressed with this -- much better than the other 2 in this line.
Augsburger Oktoberfest;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;Amber orange in color. Some head with a nose lending itself to the likeness of a very light hopped but malty beer. Went down smooth enough but without a lot of overpowering flavor you can get from better Oktoberfest beers.
Augsburger Oktoberfest;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;For a low cost oktoberfest ($5.99 a six pack) this one is not too bad. It is very smooth and drinkable. Slight aromas of grain and hops, but mostly just a smooth amber lager.
Augsburger Oktoberfest;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;From a 12 oz. twist cap green bottle with no freshness date, but I know this is the fall �06 version. Poured a clear copper with a foamy white head that settled into a thin, slightly sudsy lacing. Aromas of grassy hops, lightly toasted grain, subtle fruity and caramel. Moderate carbonation and a malty crisp, smooth light bodied mouthfeel. Pleasant Oktoberfest tasting, but average overall, toasted grain and sour fruity, a sweet, lightly caramel malty, hints of sugariness from the malts as well, earthy, grassy hops, a very soft bitterness and a dryish hoppy and malty finish, affordable and passable drinkability. An average Oktoberfest, a bit light and malty thin, but at a very affordable price.
Augsburger Oktoberfest;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;Light brown. Simple malt aroma and lightly sweet malt flavor. No flaws but there is nothing to enjoy either. Less flavorful than a good oktoberfest.

It poured yellow body with small head. Strange sourish, lightly sweetish malty aroma. Similar flavor, utterly simple and even unpleasant grainy.

Sports Brew Pub Second St. IPA;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;IPA;Sports Brew Pub;Amber beer with a sticky white head that left sheets of lace. Big orange and tropical fruit nose. Sweet beer with some white sugar and caramel notes. Lots of hops with orange peel, apricot, red grapefruit and some pineapple. The finish adds some pine to all the citrus, but the burps are mostly grapefruit. Maybe a little thin, but it is tastey.
Sports Brew Pub Second St. IPA;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;IPA;Sports Brew Pub;Orangy amber color, off white head. Hoppy aroma, light malt. Malt is muted in the flavor by the hops and it makes for an unbalanced beer. Medium bodied, bitter finish. Not all bad.

The nose displays a light strawberry and grapefruit ester, moderate piney hops, heather and flowery, slightly soapy as well.

A nice solid brew and surprisingly good.

Sports Brew Pub Second St. IPA;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;IPA;Sports Brew Pub;On tap. Thin mouthfeel. Hops overpowering the malt. Alcohol is apparent although not overwhelming. Ruddy orange color. Hop aroma. A little tweaking and this could be a nicely balanced IPA.
Sports Brew Pub Timmys Tough Guy Stout;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Stout;Sports Brew Pub;Below average dry stout. Not much aroma, taste, etc. Like a thin version of Guinness.
Sports Brew Pub Timmys Tough Guy Stout;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Stout;Sports Brew Pub;Nitro. Poured a dark brown color with a brown nitro head. Roasty aroma, light coffee and a touch of cocoa. A little more chocolate in the flavor, pretty roasty, light sweetness. Body could use some more oomph but it�s nitro, what do you expect? Not bad and yes let it warm up a bit so those flavors can come out and shine.
Sports Brew Pub Timmys Tough Guy Stout;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Stout;Sports Brew Pub;On tap: Nearly opaque with a nitro creamy head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of roasted and lightly burnt malts, cashews, butterscotch, plum, coffee and mocha. The taste starts malty with noticeable chocolate notes, bready and sweet, not an dry stout for sure. Hints of smoke, mild fruit, and coffee as well more towards the finish. It is smooth and quaffable, standard thin nitro feel as expected. A good stout and worth a try, let it warm.
Sports Brew Pub Timmys Tough Guy Stout;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Stout;Sports Brew Pub;On tap: Light malt and coffee aroma. Dark brown, virtually black, with a nice tan head. Very thin and watery mouthfeel. The fact that you�re drinking a stout makes it seem even thinner. Rather bland up front with a nice coffee and light chocolate finish.

Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Absolutely love this beer. A couple of limes and sweet perfection. Comparable to Corona with a higher APV(5.3).
Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Firstly, my bottle says 5.3% ABV. Secondly, this is a fancy bottle, no sticker, the label is painted on best I can tell. Third, this has a seriously tight cap.Pours a very very clear pale clear light golden clear yellow color. Few beers are this clear and pale and it usually means, no flavor. Super carbonation but that may be because it�s so clear it stands out more. Two fingers white head that fizzes quickly, but maintains a white cap.Aroma is nothing, except some spicy hops. Sort of like a Pilsner.Taste is not much. Lightly bitter, more of a spicy hop punch though. I don�t know what malt they use, it may be all rice. Seems like a touch of lime at the finish.Mouthfeel is very light. Not too dry. Very easy to drink.Overall, I expected a Corona really. But it�s not, it might be better. Congrats to Guatemala for doing their own thing. I would probably buy it again (because of the low price) but wouldn�t recommend it.
Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Picked up a six-pack at Aldi. Clear bottle. Cracked one open after mowing the lawn. I figured I could use the refreshment. The beer poured a pale yellow, almost clear (which was not surprise, as the bottle was clear. The aroma was a bit skunky, with high grain notes (rice). Watery mouthfeel, with a slight metallic fore and aftertaste on the sides of the tongue. Not something I'd go back for again. When I am drinking a pale lager, I'm looking for something I can drink without thinking about it. The aroma really put me off. I'll leave the rest for beer bread, maybe brats...
Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;35,5cl Bottle. Gift from a friend. Golden colour with a thin white head. Aroma is grain, straw. Taste is grain, sweet, watery. Light body, average carbonation.
Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;There is little aroma, possibly because the carbonation is mild. The appearance is the same light gold color as most of the popular clear bottled Mexican beers. I could believe that this beer might be all malt. It's dry but has a bit of a cardboard off-flavor. The finish has a pleasant little bite but that off flavor was really off-putting. I don't think I would buy this again but I might drink it if offered by a host.
Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;ClearYellow color water has no tast and no smell at all had to check the bottle if it has alcohol soap bubble head the Disappeared within seconds I thought I was drinking non-alcoholic beer when I was drinking no taste start to finish would never buy this again too bad it's got a good price it was like drinking Kirkland light worst
Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Aldi south of the border special. I wish I could rate this beer the way it was supposed to taste. But the six pack from this Aldi location was seriously skunked (clear bottle) like the Bacher Lager purchased from the same store on the same trip. I live in the country and am familiar with skunk aroma in the barn and also cat urine in old sofas. i guess I am overly sensitive to these smells,but anytime I get that from a brew, I am out, dealbreaker. Don't tell me that the skunk is part of the charm of certain import beverages. you drink what you like and i will also. Once again I can't get past the skunk. I really wanted to like this beer. COLOR: pale clear with minimal white head. TASTE: Bitter, AROMA: skunk, cat urine APPEARANCE: flat
Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;12 oz. bottle from Aldi pours a clear pale golden color with tiny white head that lingers for a minute and leaves no lacing. Aroma is corn and hay. Taste is almost nonexistent, but is on the sweet side with a slightly bitter finish. Body is light with the right amount of carbonation. This was one I avoided before, thinking it was a cheap Corona wannabe. Perhaps it is, but 1) at least it�s from Guatemala, and 2) the bottle says 5.3% ABV
Cerveza Monterrey;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;12 oz bottle. The pale lager poured a clear gold color with small disappearing head and no lacing. Aroma of cooked corn. Light body with average carbonation. Very light beverage not much body. With a lime on the beach in the summer would be its best opportunity for enjoyment. Some sourness after each swallow.
Willimantic Postmaster IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;on tap at Brewpub. Pours a vibrant cherry red with heavy lacing.

Steelhead Belgian Pale Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is yeasty, citrus and lemon. OK and a touch of cat piss. A medium bodied pale ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are citrusy and slightly bitter. Bright Belgian yeasts. Light and refreshing. Very fruity, yet still has that APA hop bite. No trace of the 8.3% alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Interesting beer.

Pours dark golden amber with a clingy foamy light tan head. Aroma is a bit herby - or maybe that�s rye. Medium body/medium carbonation. Flavor is rye and likely citrus bitter. It is dry and bitter. Unusual. Good.
Third Street Aleworks Rye Special Bitter (RSB);Santa Rosa, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Third Street Aleworks;"Draft. Hazy deep gold, medium white head; impressive retention for context. Pleasant floral, mint, citrus aromas. Flavors suggest a very young beer. There is some yeasty funk, green tartness, and scrapey bitterness. Finish is chalky and bitter, but that would certainly go away with some age. Looking forward to re-rating this. RERATE: After three weeks, this beer has really settled in. The zippiness in the nose has left somewhat, but the flavors are much more coherent and pleasant. A bit of rye is just barely apparent under the broad swath of American hops. Finish is cleaner but still a bit resiny."

Suzdalskaya Medovukha Dvugrivennaya;Suzdal, Vladimir obl., Russia;Mead;Suzdalskiy Medovarenniy Zavod;The re-rate comes from a bottle (6.3%) found in Moscow. Dull pale tan colour. The aroma is a simply honey and alcohol concoction. It�s alcoholic and sticky sweet with what is perhaps clover honey. But this is nonetheless balanced and refreshing. Original rating, 2004, Suzdal. The mead produced by Suzdalskaya Medovuh can be found in a few different strengths (it�s all the same base brew), in bottles and at the tap room. So you may find other versions besides the 7%. It has a golden colour, with the strong aroma of alcohol and garbage - not a good start. Sweet flavour - quite medicinal (Hall�s) with lemony notes and hints of wood. 2-2-7-3-12 = 2.6

Finish is moderate in carbonation, the hops apropos to the style, a drinkable beer, and certainly not the worst I�ve tasted over the last 50 plus years of beer drinking."

Olde Hickory Blue Velvet;Hickory, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Olde Hickory Brewery;Weird beer. Tried it cos it was on tap. Odd beer. Looks like a Jones soda more than a beer. Tastes a lot like one too. Smooth beer, but pretty odd. Not something I think I would go for again.
Olde Hickory Blue Velvet;Hickory, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Olde Hickory Brewery;Cloudy purple. It actually is exactly the same color as plum baby food. No joke. Faint aroma, and it actually smells more like wheat bear than blueberries. First flavor is a hint of blueberries, then a nice wheat bite. Nicely creamy, and a fairly restrained use of fruit. Not bad.

Fenland Ouse Cruise;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fenland Brewery;Pale amber colour. Dry malt aroma. On the palate, it was dull and the flavours were flat and ill-defined, which made me wonder whether this beer was on its last legs, as it was the final day of the festival. As it is, it scores below average. Cask (gravity dispense) at Bedford Beer Festival 2004.
Fenland Ouse Cruise;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fenland Brewery;Cask conditioned - Gravity Dispense - Bedford Beer Festival. Very little in the aroma of this golden coloured bitter. A dirty sulphuric grassy taste. Not particularly pleasant from a brewery better than this.

Some burnt caramel sweetness with malt syrup, toast, some apple and a bit of a grain astringency. Lively on the tongue. Not bad but nothing too interesting.
Sports Brew Pub Brickyard Red;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sports Brew Pub;Not a red. Nothing spectacular about it. Good enough to drink at the brew pub, not good enough to buy if they were to bottle.
Sports Brew Pub Brickyard Red;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sports Brew Pub;Tap: Amber in color, kind of hazy, off white head. Lighter fruity malt within a decent balance with some earthy hops. Medium to light bodied. Not bad.

Sports Brew Pub Raspberry Wheat;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sports Brew Pub;Hazy golden color, white head. Sweet raspberry aroma, possibly some underlying malt/wheat, but mainly the berry. Light tartness in the flavor from plenty of berries. Mild wheat. Light to medium bodied, some what refreshing.

Sports Brew Pub Maple St. Wheat;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Sports Brew Pub;Hazy golden amber color with a white head. Mild aroma, light fruit. Really missing some of the wheat beer characteristics like the banana esters. Thinner bodied. Overall, not a very good example.
Sports Brew Pub Maple St. Wheat;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Sports Brew Pub;Tap: Hazy golden hue with a small fading head and okay lacing. The aroma has notes of faint wheat and buttery malts in addition to some light pear and apple (no banana or clove so I guess it doesn�t have Hefe yeast). The taste starts with a slight twang of lemon with weak wheat and yeast notes, zip for depth. The feel is watery. The only difference between this a most crappy American wheats is that this is not filtered. Needs some improvement starting with more traditional yeast characteristics.
Sports Brew Pub Maple St. Wheat;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Sports Brew Pub;On tap: Light citrus aroma is barely detectable at the brew pub. Cloudy pale yellow with a white head.

Sports Brew Pub ESB English Ale;Wyandotte, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sports Brew Pub;Dark amber. Soothing English hop presence. Hints of smoke and roasted malts. Thinner, drier body made this very drinkable. A really nice ESB.

Great lacing. sweet malt up front with a somewhat mettalic character in the aroma. Flavor is very fruity, not sure if it�s esters or not, seems a little off. Fades to a sweet caramel middle and the fruitiness showing up in the finish again.
Fox Branthill Pioneer;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);500ml bottle with BBE April 2015. Label now states ABV of 5.2%. This is a fine amber-coloured real ale with a robust citric hop bitterness to balance out the firm bready malt bill. Smooth and easy drinking. Medium-light body. Under-rated in my opinion.
Fox Branthill Pioneer;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottled. Overly yeasty with pear and sharp apple notes. Looks nice, a fine burnished orange appearance, but poured very flat, with a bubby head that broke up a lot. The flavour is sharp, bordering on astringent and has sour notes on the back of the tongue. Infection? Very possible, which is a shame as I think this could be quite a tasty beer otherwise.

The aroma has notes of fruit and the flavour is slightly fruity with notes of caramel and an OK bitterness. The ABV is low, but is has a lot of taste and it would be a great session beer.

Hazy bronze, no head and low condition.Initial nasty chemical phenolic nose which subsides to leave gentle toffee malt, quite full and fruity in the mouth with some nutty notes and a rough maltiness but little in the way of hop balance. Nutty and malty in the finish.
Fugelestou Fulstow Common;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Cask @ Oxford Beer Festival, UK Backlog 22 Oct 2004 Quite sulphury though still quite drinkable. Detected some shades of boiled veggies at the end though.

Fugelestou Fulstow Common;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Cask conditioned - gravity - St Albans Beer Festival. A mid brown bitter with a bit but not much fruit in the aroma. Some berry fruit in the taste but overall a bit thin and unexciting but then it is only 3.8%
Fugelestou Fulstow Common;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;A copper coloured session bitter from a new brewery. Not as interesting as Fugeletou�s Wat Pasture (q.v.). Marked sulphur aroma. Dry, but a bit thin, and not packed with flavour. Not bad as a session beer and, as ST says, it may not have been in peak condition. Cask (gravity), Peterborough Beer Festival.
Fugelestou Wat Pasture;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Cask @ Oxford Beer Festival, UK Backlog 23 Oct 2004 Unbalanced roastiness. Quite malty and harsh. Probably spent to long time in the mash.
Fugelestou Wat Pasture;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Cask Conditioned at Oxford Beer Festival �04. Dark brown red beer with a big bubbly head. Dry roasted malt flavours predominate but with a powdery bitterness. Nut flavour on the finish, this is a crossover between a mild and a bitter.
Fugelestou Wat Pasture;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;A slightly unusual beer from a brand new brewery. Very dark for a bitter - chestnut colour. Roasty malt aroma with some sulphur. Malt, hop and a hint of chocolate in the flavour. Dry finish, with some bitterness. A bit like a cross between a mild and a premium bitter. Not bad though. Cask (gravity), Peterborough Beer Festival 2004.
Fugelestou Wat Pasture;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Peterborough Fest. Dark bitter. Slightly acidic. Chocolate notes. A darker and stronger version of the Common. The two Fugelestou beers certainly drew attention - this being the first time beers from this new brewery have been available. Mick the Tick came up and quickly bagged them before they ran out.
Full Mash All Saints;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Mash Brewery;A pretty decent beer from a tiny, home based, brewery. Amber colour, but slightly cloudy. Quite strong floral hop aroma, with some sulphur. The flavour is dry, very hoppy and a bit tart. I enjoyed this. Cask (gravity), Peterborough Beer Festival.
Full Mash All Saints;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Mash Brewery;Peterborough Fest. Burst of flowery hops. Pale amber. Dusty finish. Pleasant orange sweetness. A very decent ale, but not to my personal taste - too much Goldings.

Sweetish, flowery and fruity flavor with a slicky asparagus finish. Medium-bodied, quite refreshing palate with balanced carbonation. Doesn�t really feel like an ESB, but is quite ok.

Teerenpeli Leuhkalasse;Lahti, Finland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;Draught at the brewpub. On the house. Sweet and grassy hop aroma. Hazy dark amber colour. Small stable tan head. The flavour starts off with some bitterness, then reveals a high amount of grassy and citric aroma hops, then some maltiness, dark malts. the aroma hops are a bit overdone in my opinion, and are getting quite sour. 636315
Teerenpeli Leuhkalasse;Lahti, Finland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;Draught @ Teerenpeli, Kamppi. Ruby color, no head. Sweet aroma with hoppy undertones.

Teerenpeli Leuhkalasse;Lahti, Finland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;Tap at Teerenpeli Kamppi. Dark amber, off white, almost beige head. Nose is strong barnyard, wet dog, hay, mustiness, grass, some darker fruits maybe. Flavor is nicely bitter with a bit of syrupy roast, veggiestock and maltiness. Flavorful.
Teerenpeli Leuhkalasse;Lahti, Finland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;Draught. Nice apple-cherry aroma, meidum strength. Taste balanced and strong, but not too complex. Orange-carrot body, almost no head.
Teerenpeli Leuhkalasse;Lahti, Finland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;Draught (Teerenpeli, Kamppi) Bold orange, small head. Served very cold (as always). Big dry dusty hoppy aroma - full flowers. Slightly fizzy palate, but otherwise pleasant. Burnt, dusty and husky taste, which has a good hop accompaniaments. Has that bottom-fermented feel (a certain thinness to it), so falls a little flat (or should that be fizzy?). However, it�s a solid bitter with no real flaws once it�s warmed a bit.
Red Star Altbier;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Red Star Agave Grille;Sample at the brewpub. Dark amber color with a thin light beige head. Thin, spotty lacing. Mildly malty nose with a bit of nuts and caramel. Medium-bodied and sweet with malt and nut flavors, as well as a touch of hoppiness. The finish is short and sweet, with a nutty aftertaste. Slightly above average all around.

Dull clear mahoghany amber with no head. Medium to light watery body with medium to high carbonation. Starts dry and smooth. Touch of nutty sweet malt and light caramel. Mild beany and tart cherrystone notes. Finish is some mild honey with dry alum-like bitterness. Crisp hops to end, with light sweetness. Also has a quite smoky profile for an altbier."
Red Star Altbier;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Red Star Agave Grille;Nothing really distinct about this one. I think I originally tried it because they had no IPA on tap. I wound up coming back to it as a good session beer.
Red Star Altbier;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Red Star Agave Grille;Not really a style that I am overly fond of but the Red Star did a credible example. +++Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a medium bronze color with a small white head. The aroma is sweet and malty. The flavor was thick and richly malty with a light nut undertone. Dry malty grainy flavors linger on the aftertaste. A fine brew
Red Star Altbier;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Red Star Agave Grille;Draught: This one pours with a bit of a fluffy head. The color is pretty much a clear coppery amber shade. The aroma is a little thin. There were some hopiness, along with some minor malts. There was a bit of a hop taste to the beer, with a dryness in the aftertaste. There was also a hint of fruit sweetness to the taste.
Glentworth All American Hero;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;Clear straw colour. The US hops are obvious and make a good impression - spicy and aromatic - in the aroma. This carries through into the flavour, with lots of juicy hops, nicely balanced by a touch of subtle malt. Crisp, dry finish, again with tangy hops maintaining the interest. Many beers of this style promise a lot in the aroma, but ultimately fail to deliver the goods. This one has all the elements in place, in good balance and impressed me greatly. Cask (gravity), Peterborough Beer Festival 2004.
Glentworth All American Hero;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;Peterborough Fest. Excellent Golden Ale - plenty of gentle citric fizz, pleasantly supported by a decently brewed pale malt. Very nice.
Glentworth Antipodean Gold;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glentworth Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Cask & Cutler, Sheffield 21/08/2004 Clear golden hoppy with some citrus flavour. Bitter slightly dry lasting finish.
Glentworth Antipodean Gold;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glentworth Brewery;This was by no means a bad beer, but it suffered by comparison with the same brewery�s All American Hero (q.v.) tasted alongside it. It is pretty much the same straw colour, but the hop presence is far less apparent and the palate a lot softer. Altogether more lager-ish in feel and with lot less backbone & grip. Overall, OK but a touch bland. Cask (gravity), Peterborough Beer Festival 2004.
Glentworth Antipodean Gold;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glentworth Brewery;Peterborough Fest. Touch of butterscotch on the nose. Nice balance. Sharpish hops and an OK malt. Adds up to nothing much.
Arlem Goa Dry;Goa, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arlem (Aurangabad Breweries/Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Bottle from an off-licence in South Woodford. A creamy vegetable fat lager. Mostly neutral, and on the plus side of bland and inoffensive. Pleasantly interesting.

Green Jack Cherry Popper;Lowestoft, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Green Jack Brewing Co.;Red/brown colour. I�m assuming there is some cherry in here, but its not too obvious.

Green Jack Cherry Popper;Lowestoft, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Green Jack Brewing Co.;Peterborough Fest. It was good to see some big beers at this Fest, after the timid display at GBBF.

Green Jack Ripper;Lowestoft, Suffolk, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Green Jack Brewing Co.;Completely unable to disguise the alcohol. Sharp and sweet but let's face it horrible poorly balanced extra strength beer. Struggled to finish a half pint

Green Jack Summer Dream;Lowestoft, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Green Jack Brewing Co.;Cask at Draft House as �Summer Dream� 4%. Says it�s brewed for Draft House, but I�ll assume it�s the same beer. Pale yellow, clear, still, small foamy white head. Aroma has lots of elderflower as promised, green apple. Body is medium, smooth, low carbonation. Taste is light, biscuity, elderflower, minerals and dissolved sugars, quite watery but with a musty bitterness that builds.

Green Oak Lager & Lime;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oakham Ales;Flowery hop aroma, with nettle and grass undertones. The citric lime flavour is very noticeable, with some gingery spices. Nicely crisp finish. Not too complex, but very refreshing and zesty. Just as a golden ale should be. Cask (gravity dispense) at Peterborough Beer Festival.
Green Oak Lager & Lime;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oakham Ales;Tamworth Festival. Top stuff - lovely light gold body, aroma is all flower tops and light spice, love how the lime shines through and doesn�t overtake the crunchiness of the finish, Cask of the festival for me.
Green Oak Lager & Lime;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oakham Ales;Peterborough Fest. Pale yellow / gold. Spicy aroma hovering around corriander and ginger. Flowery. A rather pleasant golden ale. Spicy, flowery, crisp, refreshing and satisfying. Biscuity. Very good.
Pitfield Organic Honey;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Bottled. Golden body, clear and clean when carefully poured. White volumous head, slightly over conditioned. Settles after a while to leave a slightly sweet malty aroma. The honey is more apparent on the palate then the nose. Clean and free from any impurities the beer seems to be very well made. Pleasant drop.
Hereward Session Bitter;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hereward Cider;Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. A dark golden coloured beer looking little lifeless in the glass. The aroma is a little sour and hints at infection. The taste is very rough and poor homebrew-like. It�s not actually bad just odd and probably not how it should be.

Wellington Volenti;Hope Valley, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Edale Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. I�ve e mailled the brewery about this one as I�m convinced it�s a Belgian Wit. A slightly hazy golden/yellow coloured beer with an aroma of spices, lemons and wheat. There is coriander and curacao in both the aroma and the taste. It�s really a lovely drink, very clean, very tasty and very moriesh. Not quite as heavily full-bodied as some wheats but perhaps the better for that. Truly lovely. Postscript: Response received from the brewery: There is minimal wheat used for head retention only, and no spices. Mainly Maris Otter Malt with Fuggles and Styrian Goldings hops. So much for my Belgian Wit theory! However it still remains a delicious beer.
Wellington Volenti;Hope Valley, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Edale Brewery;Pale gold. Aromas are toffee malts with lots of peppery hops. Flavours are citrus with pears. Earthy and dry, especially on the finish.

Strangford Lough Legbiter;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;(American Bottle) Dark copper to brown in color. Small lid of tan bubbles. Caramel, toasted malt and earthy hops aromas. A sweet and hint of sour in the start. Toasted malt leads to a bitter acidity. Quite light in feel. More an Irish ale than a blond. Either way a bit earthy/dirty and rather shallow. 4/10
Strangford Lough Legbiter;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;A mild, bready beer with a bright, fruity finish. Hops are subtle but dominate the overall character of the beer.
Strangford Lough Legbiter;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;It smells and tastes like someone threw some olives and spinach into my Budweiser.

Strangford Lough Legbiter;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;"Bottle: slight haze on an amber pour with a large frothy white head. Aroma is slightly floral with honey, toasted grain, and a vegetal note. Flavor is light and highly carbonated, almost tea-like, with caramel, honey, overripe/vegetal tasting peach, a small bit of grain and a peppery bitter. Not sure about this one, it may have past it prime, it is thin on flavor and has off flavors, but still some quality with the caramel/honey high carbonation; I would not got out to buy it again."
Strangford Lough Legbiter;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;12 oz twist off bottle brewed in Rochester, NY. It is not a golden or blond ale but a normal bitter-type beer. Smell of olive and english yeast, taste of vegetal garbage. Mouthfeel is thin and soda-like.
Strangford Lough Legbiter;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;Murky, amber-brown, instantly vanishing head. Scent is caramel, a little fruit. Taste is malt, caramel, bread.... Sweet, fairly refreshing... Just a hint of bitter. Pretty good.

Strangford Lough Legbiter;Downpatrick, Northern Ireland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Strangford Lough Brewing Co.;It�s decent, but I think I was fooled by the name into expecting something in the vein of a Skull Splitter. Not the same ballpark.
Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);A fantastic beer! One of my favourites. Quite hoppy (which I love) great all round taste! Can�t wait for my next one!
Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);copper colour, with a good lacing. very crisp and fizzy, medium bodied, slightly fruity, with a touch of grassiness/leafiness. very summery and drinkable ipa.
Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Somewhat opaque light orange, small fading foam head. Bitter aroma, some spice - pepper. Nice bitter hoppy taste, and aftertaste. (Moscow 201409)
Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Quite disappointe din this IPA. should have more of everything in my opinion. Lacks the hop punch associated with the style. ok
Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Bottled 500ml, present. Orange gold with white head. Quite a thin bodied beer, malty and a little grainy, then with a gentle oranget, citrusy hop. It�s fairly pleasant but lacking any oomph to get the taste buds excited.
Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Golden orange pour, good sticky white head. Some interesting bits floating in the glass. Pasteurizing is a shame, but at least its not flitered as well. Bread dough and sweaty tangerine aroma with a pinch of cinnamon, fairly low volume, but pleasant. Oily citrus bitterness, candy-coating the mouth with hops. Restrained malt sweetness, leaning toward full body and with a softness emphasized by restrained carbonation levels. Williams Bros beers in the bottle overall seem rather variable, but the last couple I�ve tried have been very decent.
Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Bottle, Beer Ritz, Leeds. Poured a clear darkish golden colour with a thin white head. Aroma had some berry fruit and malt traces. Flavour was sweetish citrus with gentle hop, finishing slightly dry and bitter.

Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Bottle. High fluffy and lasting white head. Clear amber body.

Williams Brothers Joker (Bottle, Keg & Can);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);I�m going to give this the benefit of the doubt, because I think I had ruined my tastebuds with drinking too much of the �good stuff� all night.

High Desert Hefeweizen;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;High Desert Brewing Company;The beer pours from the growler with a straw gold color that shows quite a bit of haze to it when held up to the light. The beer is topped by a frothy, pale, one-finger thick head. A bit of clove, perhaps even a bit floral, perhaps some pear like notes, this is backed by some hay notes, and a touch of cracker like pale grain. As the beer warms a bit of sweet grain character becomes a bit more noticeable and it combines with the yeast character to produce a hint of something like cotton candy. Prickly carbonation, quite light bodied, but it does have a touch of viscosity to it. The beer has a sweet grain character to it, some straw like notes, and a touch of cracker like grain character that gets a bit more chewy and noticeable in the long finish. There are some light fruit notes here, the banana becomes more noticeable as the beer warms, there are also notes of pear, a touch of apple, and perhaps even a touch of something like Meyer lemon. The finish has a fairly solid bitterness to it, at least for a Hefe, but it is certainly not intrusive at all. Not a bad example of a Hefe, it has the requisite yeast character, but I usually like a bit more wheat / barley influence (decoctions are really nice for this style). Still, this has grown on me a bit as I work my way through my pour.
High Desert Hefeweizen;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;High Desert Brewing Company;Light and clear pour. Light citrus aroma, with some spice. Sweet, with orange and banana flavors. Light finish. Very refreshing, easy to drink, and perfect for the heat.

Steelhead Chocolate Kiss;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steelhead Brewing Co.;deep dark stout with a thick receeding moka head. A wonderful aroma of chocolate, Nestle Quick, intense. In mouth, a sweet chocolate brew with sweet Nutella overtones, which doesnt come out as good as the aroma suggest, a bit thin and simple.

Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle poured a hazy reddish brown with a lasting tan head. Aromas of smoke, carmel and light fruittiness. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of smoke, carmel and light fruittiness with a smooth lingering smokey finish.
Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught at Redoak, Sydney. Pours mahogany with medium beige head. I could swear this was almost the same beer as the St Andrews but with the peat character I was looking for...very strange. Anyway this is very sweet for a rauch, I�m getting caramel, beechwood and a hint of peat. The smokiness lingers through the finish but remains rather uninspiring overall. It�s more in line with their Scottish Ale, which isn�t really a Scottish Ale but could be...yes I�m confused.
Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;On tap at cafe. Velvety smooth. Subtle smokiness, mostly successful by the way it lingers in the aftertaste, in a very good way. Bit of sars... porter-esque. Slightly caramel. Sweet n smoky, best rauch I�ve had outside of Bamberg.
Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Thick creamy head. Very Good example of German Rauch Smoked malt nose and palate. Well balanced and finishes nicely. WBC gold and PRBS champion. A very good beer to style but not one of my personal favourites.
Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Beautiful dark amber-mahogony color. Smoked chedder cheese and caramel in the nose give hints of the off putting mouth, which adds some butterscotch flavors. Potential to be great.

Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Reddish-brown colour. Smokey nose with some tartness. Fizzy, slightly tart but with a smooth smokiness. Has body issues, probably because of the sloppy QC that�s allowed this thing to keep fermenting. The smoke character is pleasant, though, so if they dial it in a bit better they might have themselves a beer.
Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle. Clear reddish-brown with fizzy head. Sour off-notes in the aromas including some diacetyl, detracting from smokiness. Fizzy palate. Flavors include some nice smoke but it�s marred by a sourness that should not be here even though the bottle came direct from brewery.
Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Sweet malt hop aroma. Red brown colour with poor head and lacing. Malt hop flavour. Smooth palate.
Redoak Rauchbier;Sydney, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"A beer I tasted early this year though I remember it well. That evening I had whipped up something special for my wife. It consisted of clean wedges of grapefruit and orange atop pan-fried, well aged cacciatore and chorizo sausage simmered in napolitana sauce and nestled upon a bed of chiffonade roquette and baby cos lettuce. �Fookin� fantastic and then came this one. An accompaniment to smoked meats, but so perfectly matched it scared me!!! Released from the bottle and as it splashes against the glass it shimmers instantly and produces up a lustrous orange copper with very little of that tight pad of yeast moving into lique-form at all. The head - NNNNiiicce - a meadow of dense off-white airiness that sees fit to hang around with much ado about mucking left streaked across the glass as it empties. Its all Thuringien rauchfleisch-haus on the nose, cured slowly smoked pork, rough edges of the wood in use, broiled pork lipids and an odd hint of orange wedges, fresh and ripe. Taste is initially of stewed, caramelised oranges, though the smoked meats are well pronounced, flavoursome, salty and ash ridden. Black malt husks and pine-wood in back (could that be the beechwood). Finish is clean, all smoky meats, malts and citrus fruits, so in tune it, again, is scary. The body is solid, but not hefty. The carbonation very light and it is oh-so smooth as it goes south. The meal I served worked; the citrus flavours balancing the spicy and salty meats giving a quenching and reducing, very refreshing effect upon the palate, in the same way this did (lets take out the spice!), I loved this stuff. Up there with the greats really with an Aussie twist to make it a completely original tasting beer. My wife even approved of this. (33cL, Int�l Beer Shop, W. Leederville)"
Redoak Special Strong Bitter;Sydney, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;On tap at Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe, pours a hazy copper with a small white head. Aroma brings out astringent metallic hops and toasted malt. Flavour is fairly astringent, with lots of floral metallic hoppiness and soapy finish. Like an amped up version of the Pommy Bitter, with all the same issues. Decent.
Redoak Special Strong Bitter;Sydney, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tap at the brewhouse. Pours a dark red/brown with a tanned head.

Redoak Special Strong Bitter;Sydney, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught at Redoak Brewpub, Sydney. Pours amber with a medium white head. Aroma and flavour of toasted malt, caramel, fruits and earthy hop notes. Looks good and tastes good as well, this was one of the better beers on the day. Nice bitterness in the finish.
Redoak Special Strong Bitter;Sydney, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;I had a lovely couple of sessions at the Red Oak in Sydney. Unfortunately I lost my notes but I can report that all the beers I tried were perfect examples of their respective style. The aroma, flavour, mouthfeel, malt and hoppyness is exactly what you would imagine from reading standard guidelines. Very well crafted and very tasty, but a bit to predictable to be outstanding.
Redoak Special Strong Bitter;Sydney, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Served on tap at Redoak Cafe during Earth Hour so the lights were turned off. A decent sized lasting head was visible with the candlelights. Aroma of floral hops and mild caramel malts. Full bodied with a fruity taste and nice hop bitterness to the finish. Served too cold though IMHO.
Ross Valley Lord Fairfax IPA;Fairfax, California, United States;IPA;Ross Valley Brewing Company;(22 oz bottle: Quality Liquors in Fairfax, CA) Since this place went out of business a year ago, I was surprised to find several bottles still in the cooler at this nice liquor store near where the brewpub used to operate, so this bottle is at least a year old by now. Pouring the beer, the eruption of off-white foam fills much of the glass, but it quickly settles out so that I can get a good amount of beer into the glass. The hazy, golden-amber body shows the steady supply of carbonation bubbles rising quickly through the beer to aid in head retention. Given that the initial head was mostly very large bubbles, the head has shrunk rapidly down to about quarter of an inch in height, but it has been holding there. It smells a bit musty and moderately hoppy, but an obvious toasty aroma jumps out of the glass. The toastiness is much less of a factor in the flavor, where a fairly bitter hops controls this beer, relegating the toasty maltiness to the background. Light-to-medium bodied, crisp and dry on the palate. Patches of thick foam remain on the glass long after I�ve finished contemplating this beer. It�s too bad this place is out of business since they were producing quality beer, and this IPA was another solid product from their lineup.
Ross Valley Lord Fairfax IPA;Fairfax, California, United States;IPA;Ross Valley Brewing Company;Tap @ Bistro 7th IPA Festival. A light golden color with a laced white head. A little rough on the edge with a slightly malty flavor. Rather ordinary for an IPA and not assertive enough to stand out at this festival.
Kelley Brothers Port Barrel IPA;Manteca, California, United States;IPA;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;Tap @ Bistro 7th IPA Festival (August 7, 2004). A dark golden amber color with an off-white head. The brewer said this beer was simco and cascade dry hopped and laid to rest in a port barrel. I enjoyed it on cask at the festival at close to room temperature. The port element comes through fantastically well and is a wonderful compliment to the hops in the IPA style. It cuts through the hops but supports it well. Rose pedals, oak, cherry, and malt flavors with warming alcohol. A fantastic beer.
Bulgarpivo Chelninskoe;Naberezhnye Chelny, Republic of Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bulgarpivo;Hazy straw colour. Grassy aroma with cookie dough malts. Bready character with hints of hay, green apple. Thick, sweet, icing sugar finish detracts from the overall drinkability of this brew.
Buket Chuvashii Prazdnichnyj;Cheboksary, Republic of Chuvashia, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buket Chuvashii;Bottle. Clear golden pour, moderate white fluffy head. Aroma: fruity esters, corny grains. Almost Bit spicy. Almost Belguim-like. Medium body. Dense malty flavour with sold fruity accent and low to light ending bitterness. Light warming alcohol. OK lager.
Buket Chuvashii;Cheboksary, Republic of Chuvashia, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Buket Chuvashii;Bottle. Malty nose. Spicy hop notes all along as well. Medium body. Taste: big malts, stale hops, minor alco. Drinkable.
Buket Chuvashii;Cheboksary, Republic of Chuvashia, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Buket Chuvashii;"The eponymous brew from Cheboksary�s main brewery has a light straw colour; a minty, slightly toasty, flat-parsley like aroma; fairly light body; slightly spicy hop notes, and a sweetish, adjuncty finish."
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Good looking and well carbonated lager pils, which is sadly very a very bland drink.
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Large chunks are suspended in this beer. Apple aroma. Taste is apple cider vinegar and honey.
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Pours a golden body with particulates. Smells of overripeness and honey. Taste is muscat sweet with a cardboard, bitter finish. Hard for me to drink.
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Sampled at the Impromptu Butter�s 6th cellar clearance. Pours a near clear dark gold with a lot of suspended particulate and with a thin ring of whitish head. Extremely overly sweet. Huge honey nose. There are much better euro lagers out there.
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);"<i>500 ml bottle</i> <br /><br /> Every once in a while you have to drink swill to appreciate the good stuff. That�s the only justification I can provide; otherwise I�m not sure what I was thinking. Even at $2.19 this may be overpriced. Then again that�s on par with stuff like Budweiser which is probably what this is competing against. <br /><br /> <b>Aroma / Appearance</b> - The huge billowing head yielded to a transparent copper body. Warm apple sauce and dry crusty toast make a poor man�s lunch. It is about as bland as it gets but at least there is nothing particularly off about it. <br /><br /> <b>Flavor / Palate</b> - Flat ginger ale makes this almost palatable. Some maltiness tries to turn it into something more than an alcopop but fails miserably. Forgettable from the first sip this is not the worst beer I�ve tried but it is certainly very close. Don�t buy it unless you are planning on slumming it one night."
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Bottle as Snow Cougar from The Wine Merchant Ltd. in (near) St. Louis, MO. Gold color with a fizzy white head that didn�t last. Slightly sweet grainy aroma. Medium body with frothy carbonation. Flavor is rather malty. Seems like a lager trying to be a malt liquor. Flavor is like cola tinged beer or something. The finish is that rather nasty thing common to 24 hi gravities. Lots more flavor and character in this though. Glad I tried it. Would choose it over any number of macros. Final note: There�s cool white floculent floaters. Not too many, but enough to make a show.
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);The aroma smells of sweet hangover. The appearance is shabby with its cheap label, and the flavor is quite sweet and cloying in that way that comforts you that it�s not too expensive and you�re not living beyond your means. The palate is pretty one-dimensional. The ABV is high though, so that�s a mild plus. Overall, not too shabby...but shabby, nonetheless. The biggest plus is the price.
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Aroma of corn. Sweet with some chemicals. It looks like it might be unfiltered, I can see some kind of matter in the glass. Gold color. Not terrible for what it is.
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);"Small sample at OSLO and Guerde�s tasting on Friday, 5-23-08. Labeled as ""Snow Cougar."" Pours gold with uninviting suspended particulate. Weird, sweet, honeyish aroma reminiscent of mead. Compost and rotting crabapple smell. No hops presence noticeable. The aroma is not as bad as I expected. Sweet flavors that become gross upon multiple sips. Generally tastes like it smells. Apricot notes. Medium body. Slick in the palate. I didn�t think this beer was that bad at first, but I quickly came to my senses."
Ak Bars (green);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener - Imperial;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);OSLO and Guerde�s Memorial Weekend Tasting, 5/23/08. Thanks to JK. I could have sworn I had previously imbibed this heavenly nectar, but aparently I had not. Gold color with no head. Strong sweet grain aroma and light cinnamon. Somehow switches to bone dry grain taste, fresh bread and the quintessential cinnamon flavor of the Soviet lagers. Long live Mother Russia!
Bulgarpivo Baron;Naberezhnye Chelny, Republic of Tatarstan, Russia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bulgarpivo;Reddish light brown colour. Rich nose of toffee. Thick, toffeeish body. Slight almondy note. Very sweet, chewy, earthy finish. Macro bock.

Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);"500ml bottle. ""Red East Classic"". The color is a medium gold with a fizzy head. Smells like sweet dough, not much else, doesn�t smell like the average EPL. The taste is sweet and grainy, very sweet. It doesn�t have much besides some brown sugar flavor. Definitely an oddity. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 01-20-2011 01:51:37"
Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);1pt 0.9 oz bottle: Aroma is sour apples, grainy, and some funky hop scent to it. Appearance is a clear golden with a thick white head that lingoes for quite a while. Taste is rather funky and off flavor off the top. Rather vegetable taste to this but not in a good vegetable beer way. I would go further but this is not a good brew. Bad smelling, looks like a pale or premium lager. But taste and palate is horrid. Maybe I got a bad one but this is not good whatsoever. Cheers!
Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Got this at Surdyk�s in Minneapolis a month ago. Poured with a decent foamy, frothy, textured off, white head, that lasted a while and no lace. Color is yellow. Aroma is malty, sweet, and a bit of hops. Flavor is about the same. Too sweet for me. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is dominated by corn sweetener. Not a session beer for me.
Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Bottle from John�s Market in Portland, OR. Brassy gold color with a minimal white head. Not much aroma. Medium body with fizzy, creamy carbonation. Flavor is rather spicy, like pepper or ginger, though not strong or distracting this is the principal taste impact. Finish is quite pleasant. If the bitter/ spice is hop, I�m not familiar with the type. Super spicy noble hop? Nice change from the usual East Euro lagers.
Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);The beer pour an amber color with a bit of head. The beer smells of yeast and malt and hops. The taste is more on the malt with a sutle sweet finish. Body is thin but not watery. A better version of Bud. A clean finish. easy drinking
Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Pale pour...light yellow straw collor with light fluffy head. The nose is cheap...sweet malt and adjuncts. Flavor is typical Eastern-European lager...metallic pale sweet malts and adjuncts...nothing I�d care to ever repeat.
Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);"Clear golden coloured body with a very thin white head. Aroma of alcohol, malt, metal, blood and corn - nothing pleasant at all. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong malt flavour with metallic tastes fades to a mild finish with some sweetness and some other bitter sugars. Overall, not as horrible as the �extra�, but not a great beer either. I�d pass on this next time, but when I�m here in Oklahoma and looking for something new - there is only so many options. I sampled this 50 cL bottle purchased from Sam�s Warehouse Liquors in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on 23-January-2008."
Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Bottle. Usual pale lager body-straw yellow with a fading foamy head. Nose-old malt, light dust, light macroness. Taste-lots of clean fruit esters, milky/lactic mouthfeel, lime, medium sweetness, sugary, plum, white grape skins, very light skunk masked by the aggressive sweetness, corn water. Tastes like a well done macro that was sweetened with artificial sweetener.
Krasniy Vostok Klassicheskoe (Red East Classic);Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Bottle. Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is clear medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (grain, husks), lightly hoppy (flowers, herbs), with a note of soap. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, slightly husky, slightly unclean. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. The usual industrial character, with perhaps a touch more hop aroma than normal.
Krasniy Vostok Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);My bottle poured a much better looking drink than Oakes� (see only other rating to date), a golden yellow color with modest carbonation, yet supporting a sustained frothy white head. Unfortunately (for the brewer), we�re pretty much in agreement after that. The aroma has some bready malts, but is topped with an odd sweetness. The malt comes through slightly in the flavor, displaced by a corn syrup sweetness and a light tinny taste. Some hops wave from the distance in the finish. Forgetable.

Krasniy Vostok Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Dull gold colour. Strangely bubblegummy aroma. Palate is cleaner - malt accented in an upscale macro sort of way. Slightest hint of hop.

Krasniy Vostok Zhigulevskoe Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Bottle. Ah, the pour tells of a beer that�s sat on the shelf for too long -- full of muddled sediment-like floaties. The aroma is sweet and corny as you�d expect. and the beer drinks with a firm if unobtrusive malt base and a sweet finish. To be fair, I�d like to try a fresh one while reminiscing about the good old days under Stalin. (#3606, 14 July 2009)
Krasniy Vostok Zhigulevskoe Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Bottle from Belmont Party. Poured clear golden color with a minimal white frothy head that diminished quickly with minimal lacing. Light sweet aroma. Light body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of short duration. Another worth trying once beers.
Krasniy Vostok Zhigulevskoe Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Aroma is typical of a pale lager, crisp and malty, nothing special - but at least it is strong and not watery. It pours with a nice thick white head, but the wan straw yellow is not inspiring - nor are all the little goobers I saw floating in the bottle. Flavor is flat and weak so it barely tastes like beer, or even a macro-brew. Texture lacks even a nice beery fizz, and leaves a barely noticeable malty aftertaste. Maybe this bottle was from a bum batch.
Krasniy Vostok Zhigulevskoe Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);I just grabbed this from a Greek deli since the label was mostly incomprehensible. Pale gold color with an audible fizzy white head. Light malt, table sugar and a little cardboard in the nose. This was so much better than I thought it would be that my score may not be accurate. Light citrus notes with some lemon and some bitter orange. Lightly toasted bread with some corn sweetness and light spice. It has some of the usual cardboard flavors from imported lagers, but this wasn�t too bad.
Krasniy Vostok Zhigulevskoe Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);16.9 ounce bottle from Beer Run in Charlottesville, VA. Pours a pale yellow color with almost no head. Lots of floaties. Aroma is grassy and full of adjuncts. Taste is very watery, with some sweet corny notes and not much else. Thin bodied.
Krasniy Vostok Zhigulevskoe Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Pale light gold body with a large bright white head. The aroma has notes of beets and dirt. There is also a little bit of floral character. The taste is very sweet with beets and unsalted potato chips. There is also a little bit of banana peel. This is a lightly spicy brew without much to recommend.
Krasniy Vostok Zhigulevskoe Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);1 pt, 0.9 fl oz. Pours extremely page yellow, with a pretty small head. Aroma of malts and sugar - but not much of one. Flavor is, well, not very good at all. Notes of malts and honey. Little else. Drank half and eventually gave up.
Krasniy Vostok Zhigulevskoe Svetloe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);"Clear golden coloured body with a thin white head. Aroma of pale malt, light sugar and not much else. Malty cardboardie flavour with some raisins and yeast - nothing too pleasant. Medium-bodied; Funky corn flavours with some yeast and alcohol coming through near the end. Aftertaste shows some malt and pale flavours - not much complexity. Overall, not such a great beer - worth trying to see the style - but that�s more than enough. I sampled this 500 mL bottle purchased from Norm�s in Vienna, Virginia on 30-June-2008 on 05-July-2008 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia."

Ingobr�u Meistersud;Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Ingobr�u (BHB);Drank this beer in my youth when we played role playing games like Midgard in Ingolstadt.

Innstadt Passauer Wei�e Hefe Dunkel;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Innstadt Brauerei;Recht spritzig, trotzdem s�ffig, sehr erfrischend, dominant, aber angenehm malzig, durchaus wohlschmeckend. Bei h�ufigerem Genuss wird es aber schnell recht langweilig. Beileibe kein schlechtes Wei�bier, dem aber vielleicht etwas Tiefe und Harmonie fehlt. Ich glaube mich zu erinnern, dass es fr�her (in der B�gelflasche und tats�chlich noch von der Innstadt Brauerei in der Passauer Innstadt produziert) einen ganzen Ticken besser war.

Innstadt Passauer Wei�e Hefe Naturtr�b;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Innstadt Brauerei;S�uerliche und getreidige Noten dominieren zun�chst, fruchtige folgen. Nicht besonders w�rzig. Schmeckt zun�chst aber mal schon sehr gut und ist wirklich sehr erfrischend und s�ffig. F�r ein Feierabendweizen vielleicht etwas zu wenig Substanz und Charakter. Aber ideal f�r hei�e Tage oder beim Weggehen (egal ob Biergarten oder Disco). Auf Dauer wird es allerdings etwas �de und man trinkt sich vergleichsweise schnell ab. Nachdem ich drei Abende in Folge nichts anderes bekommen hab, war Apfelschorle oder Wasser (fast) eine Alternative. Also kurz und ganz bewusst genie�en. Dann macht das auch Spa�. Ich erinnere mich, dass es fr�her (in der B�gelflasche und tats�chlich noch in der Passauer Innstadt Brauerei produziert) einen ganzen Zacken besser war und in Schlagdistanz zur wirklich sehr starken Konkurrenz aus der Region lag.

Baltika Samara Klassicheskoe;Samara, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika-Samara (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);1.42 litre bottle. Pours clear brown-cold with no head. Aroma is malt, butterscotch, dough. Taste is caramel, grain, cardboard. Almost flat. Very similar to Samara Cheshsky Khmel. Bad, even in terms of Russian macro lagers.
Baltika Samara Klassicheskoe;Samara, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Baltika-Samara (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);0.5 l bottle got from my mother-in-law who was in a river cruise in Russia. Looks like lager with OK head. Taste has absolutely no hops at all. This is rather sweet. Tastes like the strong Russian lagers, but this has only 4.7 %. I wouldn�t recommend this to anyone.

Azia Premium;Bukhara, Uzbekistan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ziyobakhsh Uni Trading;Gold colour with low carbo and no head. Rather sweet aroma with biscuits. Sweet, slightly oily and vaguely malty. Hard to pin down the flavours - honey and graham crackers sort of. But I like those things and I don�t like this.
Alt Stadt;Samarqand, Uzbekistan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod Tomin;Hazy straw colour. Honeyish, nutty aroma. Rather sweet taste that is faintly honeyish. Quick, bland finish.
Toshkent Blue 13%;Tashkent, Uzbekistan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Besh Yog'och Pivo;Dull, flat light amber. Aroma of diacetyl and lots of sugar and malt. Really minerally, astringent and diacetyl-ridden. Dirt cheap and tastes it.
Toshkent Green 10%;Tashkent, Uzbekistan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Besh Yog'och Pivo;Dull copper colour. Aroma of diacetyl and minerals. Flat, minerally, watery and sour. Soviet lager is still alive in Uzbekistan, unfortunately.
Osterbrau Chilla;Qibray tumani, Toshkent viloyati, Uzbekistan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Osterbrau;Unpasteurized. My information on this brewer is a little confusing. I�ve heard but have been unable to confirm that they originate from Shimkent, Kazakhstan. They do, however, definitely have a plant on the outskirts of Tashkent to produce for the Uzbekistan market. Golden colour. Wonderful bready malt flavours and aromas. Very clean, maybe a little almondy. Sweet, grassy, and refreshing. Nicely done.
