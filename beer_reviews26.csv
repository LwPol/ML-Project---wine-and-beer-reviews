Even weaker buttery taste but still fairly free of imperfaction. Very refreshing would be it’s best feature, but at the end of the day extremly boring. Still better then som other very light brews.

Goose Island Dunkelweizenbock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Smokey malty brown sugar aroma. Draft at wrigley goose island. Molasses and earthy taste. Don’t love it and don’t hate it. You can tell love was put into this and it is solid. Not my style I guess
Goose Island Dunkelweizenbock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Re-rate at GI Clybourn. Pours same color, beer is devoid of the plastic that destroyed it last year. Nice roast and cocoa. Clean. Big and a touch boozy but okay. Really dig this iteration.7-4-7-4-15 Draft at GI Clybourn. Pours a deep, slightly murky brown with a sticky head. The nose is roasty and then a strong phenolic note, followed by coffee and some banana. Nose is sloppy and odd. On taste, it is a really big beer, banana and bubblegum with plastic as well as some cocoa. It’s all over the place and not focused. Bombastic, in a bad way. weird and a bit of a trainwreck.5-4-5-2-10
Goose Island Dunkelweizenbock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sample at the Clybourn brewpub.

Goose Island Dunkelweizenbock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Flight on tap at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a well hazed murky ruby copper almost brownish hue. Well hazed with glowing copper red edges. A frothy tan head sits atop and dies to a small film, ring clinger really. Laces small. Aromas are crisp carmelized malts, banana, brown sugar. Touches of clove, maraschino cherry, toffee, biscuits. Gentle kisses of brown sugar and caramel dance as the banana esters mix, giving a sweet essence of banana bread, toffee. A fairly sweet potent nose. Initial is medium bodied offering a sweeter quaffable caramel and brown sugar front moving into banana esters, toffee, biscuits. Gentle kisses of cherry, vanilla, and spice. Some clove, gentle carmelized sweet and toasty mesh well. Backend and finish dry up a bit, some brown sugar and spice, carmelized and toasty, a touch of dryness but then sweeeter and toasty elements stick, bananas and cherries mix. I enjoyed this. Pretty drinkable, ABV hides itself. Wheat beers rue the day today.
Goose Island Dunkelweizenbock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pours cloudy and medium brown. Sweet light aroma.

Goose Island Dunkelweizenbock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);2008 vintage 750ml thanks to Nanoslug. Pours hazy reddish brown with a small khaki head that leaves a thick bubbly ring. The age shows on the aroma, with sherry and dark fruit notes and some toffee. One the flavor, this seems actually to have aged well. On top of the typical toffee, banana, and wheat, there’s a very nice tart cherry note as well as some sherry. Is it infected? I don’t know but I like it either way. Medium-full body with soft carbonation and a very smooth mouthfeel. Overall I like this. Good to have a new taste of pre-BMC Goose Island. They were good.
Goose Island Dunkelweizenbock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled from 750 ml bottle during Dark Lord Day ’09, at table 4. Pours a hazy brownish amber brew with a thin beige head that quickly dissipates to an off-white ring. Aroma of caramel malt, some yeast/banana esters, cloves, and a touch of citrus zest. Taste is medium bodied, some light carbonation with flavors of dark multi-grain malt, some banana esters, clove, chocolate, bubblegum, and a touch of lemon zest. Finish is semi-sweet, with a mild banana aftertaste that quickly disappears.
Goose Island Dunkelweizenbock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Sampled March 2009 This beer pours with a noticeable viscous texture. The beer is topped by a frothy, initially two-finger thick, lightly browned, tan colored head. The beer is a murky, muddy, brown-amber color that is hazy enough to be opaque when held up directly to the light, but does pick up a bit more of a red hue. Up front I get a banana note that is quickly subsumed by a toasted malt character. A bit of clove character is noticeable throughout the aroma and there is also a nice nuttiness here in the nose. There is a touch of spiciness here as well, which seems to meld with the toasted grain notes, and there is also a prune / fig fruit thing going on here as well that seems to get a bit over-ripe as the beer warms. An interesting nose, but it isn’t quite as expressive as I might have hopped. Not nearly as sweet tasting as I expected, there is a touch of malt sweetness here, but it is well tempered by a wheat-tartness and the toasted malt character. My second sip sees a bit of clove spiciness become noticeable up front and the tartness accentuates some plum-like flavors. The finish has a mix of hop bitterness and toasted malt notes that are not quite roasty, but do provide a touch of astringency. The body of this beer isn’t as big as it looked visually, but does have some heft to it; the beer is actually pretty quaffable for a beer of this strength though and is pretty nice for the style. This has a bit of an off flavor in the finish that is sort of plastic like, a bit savor / meaty, or perhaps just burnt; I really can’t quite put my finger on it. Not a bad beer as most of the elements seem to be here, but somehow all the flavors / aromas don’t seem to combine into an integrated whole all that well. Still this is certainly enjoyable"

He'Brew Messiah;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;12floz bottle, no date, $1.75, nonic glass. This beer appears alright: dark brown with clarity and a steady head. Smell isn't skunky, but I detect unwanted age, fungified cereal grains comes to mind. Although ipast it's time, it tastes okay. It is weaker than I remember when I had this about ten years ago (fresh and contract brewed by Southern Tier (I think that is who they contracted with)). Not at all bad as is, because it seems to get a little better with acclimation. In summary, it fairly sessionable and tastes like lightly sweetened dirt.

Hofbrau Freising Festbier;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);"I am always interested in Octoberfest beers, so I tried this one when I saw it in a local store that I trust. Really bad. Not even a good aroma. It has that ""rusty water"" taste associated with bad hops and/or OVERLOADED hops. Hops?? In an Octoberfest??? A beer KNOWN for its MALT??!!! The label says ""golden lager"", but it tastes like a really bad czech pilsner. The back label lists ""Bayerisches bier"". This beer tastes like that Mex mess known as ""Modelo"". I was surprised that this beer had such an ugly taste. Ive had some bad Octoberfests, but this one pretty much takes 1st Place. Congrats, I will never buy this swill again."
Hofbrau Freising Festbier;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);I'm being generous here with the scores because a pale lager just isn't the traditional red Marzen with the properly handled Vienna malt for that slight dry roastiness at the end that is so good.

Hofbrau Freising Festbier;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);Bottle. In today's world where all beers have to be so dad gum hoppy, it's nice to have a malty beer. Light Amber in color with a really small head. Great stuff.
Obolon Temnoe;Kyiv, Ukraine;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Obolon;Bottled. Dark brown beer with a strong head. The aroma is quite malty and the flavour is quite cakey, spiced and malty. Overall a reasonable beer.
Obolon Temnoe;Kyiv, Ukraine;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Obolon;This was an ok beer from a decent eating establishment in Kyiv. The coloring is a darker amber with some slight notes of toffee in the aroma. The taste is also fairly thin with notes of a roasted candy bar. Overall, a thin and watery beer as others have noted.
Obolon Temnoe;Kyiv, Ukraine;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Obolon;The head was always a problem with the Ukrainian beers. This is complicated perhaps by the fact that the water used to rinse the glasses in the average Kyivan home was extremely hard. Expats were advised not to drink tap water and invariably we used bottled stuff. It didn’t strike me as necessary to wash my glasses in water I paid good money for. So, the presence in the glass was a fine amber with a cloying toffee nose. Hop presence as fleeting as a warm day in February. The body is not in keeping withe the ABV and as such not what you want in a beer that promises in its appearance.
Obolon Temnoe;Kyiv, Ukraine;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Obolon;Amber with no head. Some chocolate/toffee aroma. A burnt caramel-flavour, but way too thin and watery.
Obolon Temnoe;Kyiv, Ukraine;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Obolon;Light brown. Watery aroma. Just a hint of watery coffee flavor and a slight smokiness. Okey by Ukrainian standards I suppose...
Carver Firkin Ale;Durango, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Carver Brewing Company;Toffee, caramel, and pine aromas. Vanilla, scotch evident but more subtle.

Carver 120 Schilling Scotch Ale;Durango, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Carver Brewing Company;"GABF 2005. Body is light amber. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel), with notes of diacetyl and vanilla. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. This sampled after Dry Dock’s awful Lucky Scotsman had me wondering if it was me or these ""Scottish ales"" that were off. My guess is the beer. This was like caramel syrup at first, dissolving into an unbalanced/harsh finish. Not really sure what they were thinking here, but this recipe is in dire need of an overhaul."
Carver 120 Schilling Scotch Ale;Durango, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Carver Brewing Company;Sampled from growler at the Mondial. Dark hazy amber-copper with little head...spoiled milk lactic acidic qualities and vegetal aromas overwhelm a touch of caramel...flavor profile reminiscent of rotting cherries and oranges...plastic-fuesel finish...nasty cottony-sticky mouthfeel. Among the worst of the style that I’ve had.
