Lovejoys Ferret Trap Trappist Ale;Austin ,Texas     ,United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;The last thing you'd expect when you order a belgian ale. Starts bad                                                                                                      ,finishes worse.
Lovejoys Ferret Trap Trappist Ale;Austin ,Texas     ,United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;"""A failed attempt"" is the best that one can say about this. A horrible, horrible aftertaste is what you get as the taste of rotten fruit dissipates on the back of your tongue. Some monks would be kicking ass if they knew about this excuse for a beer. And since when can you just arbitrarily call something a ""trappist ale""? I'm tired of micros calling their Belgian style beer ""trappist"", when the word implies that the beer is brewed by real monks with exacting standards. I propose a new category of beer, called ""crappist"". This one would fit in pretty well."

Bitter End Prescotts Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;A multi-medal winner GABF Wee Heavy winner. A perfect blend of alcohol, smoke, and malts. Yummy to the max, and easily the signature beer of the BE.
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Bubblegum, alcohol, grapes, figs and raisins in the aroma. Clear copper coloured body with a low, fine bubbled, off white head that recedes to ring. Honey, raisins, figs, grapes and bubblegum esters are strong with some alcohol in the vinous finish. Medium full body with moderate carbonation. Perhaps a bit simple, but enjoyable. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Lasting off-white cover over the clear copper-brown hue. Great display of malt power hints at caramel, bread, cereals, coffee, honey etc. It becomes more scotch ale like once the peaches and figgy fruitiness join in, surprisingly late in mouth and pushing the already fatiguing sweetness even further. Spicy anise, pepper and vanilla nuances derivates the mind from the alcoholic nature for a few moments. Full body, oily and liquorous. Mellow acidity may not be the best option to bring a sense of balance, I�d prefer more earthiness or something smoky in there myself, but as a malt showdown, you are served here.
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;dark brown w/ a small tan head. a dark malt smell w/ some dark fruits carml�d sugar and very weak tart. Palate is light creamy warm and well coated. Light flvr sweet carmel and brown sugar and a touch of smoke.

Bitter End Prescotts Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Growler, served considerably warmer that they do at the bar. Poured a nice ruby color with a thin beige head. Rich aroma of honey, alcohol, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Taste is very sweet, with vanilla, and a nice roasty smokiness. Burning alcohol sensation down the throat, or maybe its just my heartburn, who knows. I could sip this all night.

Bitter End Prescotts Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On draught in snifter. 2003 batch aged. Reddish-brown color with small head. The aroma is malty with alcohol apparent. The flavor is sweet, woody, some vanilla, alcohol, some oxidation (in a good way), heather, earthy, vineous, silky, amd mildly hopped. It gets smoky as it warms. It has a big body with good carbonation and is smooth and creamy. Excellent beer! Thanks for holding back some kegs!
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Cloudy red with some head and creamy lacing. Sweet malt and alcohol with notes of oxidation in the nose. Smooth and silky texture. Malt, raisin, plum flavors with notes of smoke in the background. Definite alcohol warming. It gets even more complex as it warms up. Great beer.
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at the B-Sides (a little offshoot of the Bitter End). Pours a dark ruby red, not much of a head. Pleasant aroma of toffee, a little bit of molasses., some roasted notes. Flavor has all of the same notes, with the toffee coming through the strongest. Some faint fruity notes appear as well. Good smoky, roasted notes round it out nicely. Mouthfeel is thick and warming. Very good.
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On draught. Light golden color with excellent head and very clear. The aroma has lavender and other flowery notes. The flavor has some green tea, lavender, honey, grass, and some sweetness. Excellent beer!
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Slightly cloudy yellow; unidentifiable spices in the nose. 1st sip is sorta unexciting. Lot of really interesting tea flavors emerge- lavender, elderberry and jasmine. Tell tale ""BE"" yeast flavor for sure."
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pours murky straw golden with a thin head and some lacing. Green tea and spicy nose. Very herbal flavor. Thick in body and creamy in texure. I�m not big on hebal beers so this one is not for me.
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Had on tap at the brewpub. Pours a light, murky golden with a thin, but sticky and clumpy white head. Aroma brings essence of green tea and some spice. Flavor has that same green tea flavor with some green grape notes and altogther ""herbal"" and flowery. Drinkable, but not in a beer-like nature. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick and it goes down easy. An interesting experiment, but not one of BE�s better ones."
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Wow, this is a fantastic medieval gruit. A sparkling golden. Lavender comes across as does other herbals -- fennel? basil? The beer underneath is held aloft by the herbals. It's slightly nutty and those patented Bitter End grain flavors. Very quaffable and fairly low alcohol (5 or so). Delicious and daring. Another far out and right on beer from Bitter End!
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Golden color. Smelled like a spice cabinet. Flavors of various herbs, bready. Interesting, but not something I'd drink often.
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;One of those beers you just have to question. The bartender did say that it was brewed with green tea. Very floral.
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;I don't know what to make of it either. Didn't the bartender say something about green tea? I felt like I was drinking a plant.
Bitter End Equinox Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Way too herbal and floral tasting. I didnt really know what to make of this beer.

Budels Oud Bruin;Budel, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Budelse Brouwerij;Bottle 300 ml at home, poured into a stemmed glass. ABV 3.5% Brown colour on the body, looks darker than it actuallis . Two full fingers of light brown to off-white eventually head, with very good retention and nicely formed webs of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is very malty and sweet. A little bit of roastiness, wet corn flakes. Very sweet taste, very malty, ends with a light metallic flavour, some light soft drink acidity as well, like someone poured a 7up in it. Very thin on the body, average carbonation, that still doesn�t manage to make it taste less flat. Overall very sweet, as all of the dutch oud bruins I have tried, ideal for kids maybe.

Budels Batavier;Budel, Netherlands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Budelse Brouwerij;"12-12-2017; bottle; at home (bought at beerwulf.com, #12 of their Christmas advent calendar). The looks of the beer are nice. The beer has the most perfect amber colour. In the light, it has a nice red glow. The beer is crystal clear. On top of the beer some rather rough, off-white foam is formed. Foam retention is low and hardly a drape is left after already some minutes. The smell of the beer is nice. It is quite a sweet smelling beer. I smell a lot of malts. I smell some nice sweet aromas of caramel and toffee, but also a slight minimal roasty edge. There is also a sweet sugary touch. Besides the malts, there are also some sweet fruity aromas. Hops give some rather plain and slightly floral aromas. Not bad. The taste of the beer is also nice. Not to strong, but not bad. The taste starts with some sweet malts. The maltiness is not as intense as it was in the smell. The malts have a slight aroma of caramel and some toffee. The fruity notes are also present, and give some nice additional sweets. Hops give a nice bitter counterpart for the sweeter malts, thus resulting in a well balanced beer. The palate of the beer is fine. Medium body, smooth and rather low carbonation. The finish of the beer is rather sweet and has some alcohol flavours. Not to special in the finish. All in all, a nice beer. Easy drinkable and quite tasty, but not top segment. More of a high average."
Dommelsch Ice;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Jammer dat dit niet meer bestaat zouden ze terug op de markt moeten zetten. Vooral met die warme zomers
Dommelsch Ice;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Fles gedronken met Roelzie. Het is een goudgeel helder bier met matig wit schuim. Aroma is moutig en wat citrusachtig. Smaak is fruitig. Drinkt lekker weg.
Dommelsch Ice;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Lang geleden dat ik het op heb maar ik kan me herrineren dat ik het veel te waterig vondt. En daarnaast, het blijft D(r)ommelsch en dat vindt ik gewoon niet lekker.

Dommelsch Ice;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);I don�t like those �special extra cold pilsners�. Mostly because it kills all the taste. This one is kind of ok. But only when it�s crazy hot outside..
Dommelsch Ice;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Standard yellow golden color, average white head. Not very different from the regular Dommelsch pilsener. Decent, but noting special.
Dommelsch Ice;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Orange yellow color. White head, fading rather quickly. Sweet nose, malts and corn. Sweet corn flavour, very light on hops. Mostly just watery and bland. Could be refreshing, if that is the main quality you look for in beer. But in such occasion I�d rather suggest ordering tap water. Really boring. (from 33cL bottle)
Dommelsch Ice;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Bottled, pasteurised, 330 ml from Camping Flevostrand Supermarket. Pale straw, white head.

Dommelsch Malt;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Dit bier was vroeger te verkrijgen bij de plaatselijke cafetaria, die geen drankvergunning had en daarom als alternatief deze bocht verkocht.

Dommelsch Malt;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Bottle at Wildschut Cafe. Another malty low-alc drink. I wonder why these are called malt as that�s a universal beer ingredient. Anyhow, taste not all bad but couldn�t imagine drinking this by choice...
Dommelsch Malt;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Pours a very light piss yellow. No aroma to speak of. Thin and sweet........
Dommelsch Malt;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Only drank this because I was driving, although I told myself to have iced tea instead. Why do I keep doing this to myself. :(
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);"Fairly straightforward, mass-produced example of ""Nederlands oud bruin"", which is basically the same style as brown Belgian tafelbier. Made with unmalted wheat, sugar, caramel and (artificially added) lactic acid. Beige, not too stable foam over a very dark chestnut robe with a ruby glow. Sweetish, weak aroma with some faint wheat, candi syrup, cacao powder and vanilla, lactic acid hardly noticeable. Round, sweetish malt taste, smooth, again the lactic acid is hard to find but could have added some complexity - alas, it remains as simple as it began, with only a very faint, late bitterness in the tail. Even for this totally unambitious style they could have done better."
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);"Opaque dark brown, foamy tan head, vanishes quickly, some lacing; roasted, hint of dark fruits, chocolate; taste is sweet, sugary, roasty undertones; light body, watery texture, flat carbonation; sweet finish, hint of bitterness."
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);30cl bottle at home. Clear dark brown with a small beige head. Light to medium body with some carbonation, not much. Very sweet caramel. Not my kind of beer, too sweet.
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Pours dark copper reddish brown, tan beige foam, nice ring lacong. Aroma is weak fruity, sweet malty, caramely, Taste is sweet, sugary, honey like. Minimal sour at the end. Light body, watery texture, minimal dry finish. Oa its like honey water, not beer except foam and lasing was very nice. update: Now when I know what style it is low alco not beer, I will re-rate accordingly.
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Bottle. Clear maroon color, scant head. Aroma of subtle prunes and raisins. Taste is odd sweet, sour and buttery. Calling this one an oud bruin is false advertising.
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);"Bottle of 300 ml at home, poured into a tulip glass. ABV 2.5% Very thin head, maybe half a finger, beige in colour. It goes off quite fast also.Colour of the beer itself is very dark brown, only when hold against the light takes some amber hues, very dark, again. The head has now gone almost completely, some of it lingers around the glass and a big island of foam has now formed on the surface of the beer. Roasted malts on the aroma, very strong, it makes it smell like dark chocolate, quite pleasant. Taste is sweet, and as with most of the Oud Bruins I have tried, there is a metalic aftertaste.Some notes of the roasted malts are being found on the taste too. Light on the body, with very low carbonation, which in combination with the low alcohol makes it very drinkable, although I find it too ""light"", some more carbonation would be welcomed. Overall, a modest one in the genre."
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Bottle at Locus Publicus, Rotterdam Dark mahogany color, medium head. Perfumy caramel aroma. Sweet caramel flavor, no real bitterness. Actually I find it not deep but quite refreshing.
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Dark Brown with brownish foam head lacing to the glass. Sweet aroma, taste is pretty sweet, with some wheats. Very little aftertast. (Velp 201206)
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Dirty brown-greige head, small, over muddy dark brown beer with an orange sheen whilst pouring. Sweetish nose, bit of liquorice, and a faint sewer-ish smell, just under the warning treshold. Sugarwater with liquorice and some bready malt. Dissolved brown candi sugar, and trace of overripe banana in the finish. After some time, impression of Traubenzucker. Watery consistency, with a syrupy-sticky thread running through it, as an oiltrace running in the midst of a creek. We would call it tafelbier, and serve it to the kids.
Dommelsch Oud Bruin;Dommelen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Bottle. Brown, beige head - sweet and malty aroma of candied sugar with some metal - flavour is sweet and sugary. Not a lot of bitterness or sourness.

Dommelsch Dominator;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Looks good, light amber color and a thick head, but only has a grainy aroma. Sweetish and grainy, medium bodied. Some apple. Clean palate, but lacks flavor.
Dommelsch Dominator;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Blond beer with a small head. Dominant hop aroma. Light sweet taste of hop and honey. Very light bitter aftertaste.
Dommelsch Dominator;Dommelen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij (AB InBev);Strong pilsener. Hoppy. taste is malty. Not very interesting this one is. Not let me dominate the Force will.

End of bottle solid yeast � but in suspension, and rendering the second glass visually quite unpalatable. <i> Speculoos</i>herbs (sweetish), slightly (masked?) sourishness. Sweet-spiced taste, mainly liquorice (<i>drop</i>) and some green cardamoms. Ginger too. Very flat, as the carbonation gets knocked out at pouring, it seems. Sharp short sourish ending, also in the mouthfeel. Certainly NOT overspiced. But to say that it is balanced, would be saying too much. It is more like � all impressions knocking each other out. <i> Many thanks, Dean! </i>

Klein Duimpje Zevenmijlslaarzen;Hillegom, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;"Exploding after opening the bottle; far too much CO2. (And that problem was already mentioned in 2014, as I see). Pity, because this defines everything about this beer: pouring with small gushes brings a lot of sediment, and no aroma breaks through the enormous head; and I'm left with the feeling that I miss a huge part of the beer... So what I see, after the head has fallen down, is a (now) very hazy amber pour. Can not say anything about the aroma; there is none coming through. But the taste is nice; a fresh and fruity, bit hoppy sort of mild sweetness, caramel, with a substantial bitterness in the aftertaste. Carbo differs: at first none seems to be left, but later it's alright or even strong. Well, how to rate this?? I feel forced to count the problem in... Please, Klein Duimpje, adapt the beer, because this is terrible...."
Klein Duimpje Zevenmijlslaarzen;Hillegom, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;Bij openen spuit de koolzuur eruit waarna er een half flesje bier overblijft Naar wat in de keuken dweilen kunnen we pas dit biertje raten.....

Redelijk fruitige hoppige geur. Deze beetje droge Belgian Ale heeft duidelijk invloeden van een zoete IPA. Smaak palette is dan ook lastig te defini�ren maar is ondanks zijn CO2 isseu best ok�. Maar door aanwezigheid van extreme koolzuur is absoluut een lagere rating gerechtvaardigd. En als ik zo achteraf bij mijn mede raters lees ben ik niet de enige die hier last van had.

Celjski Grof;Maribor, Slovenia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarna Tara;Very blond beer with a medium, rather creamy head. Sweet aroma with the typical Slovenian hop. There is definately an awful tequila like taste to this beer. Not good.

Celjski Grof Pils;Maribor, Slovenia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovarna Tara;Can, 0.33l. Clear deep straw color with large frothy whit head and sparkling appearance. Extremely awful pilsener with dry mouthfeel and clean grassy and grainy taste with unpleasant bitter finish. Light body, watery texture and fizzy carbonation in palate. Naming such shitty beer after such a noble personality as Count from Celje si real shame. Luckily it�s only a reminder of a past history...
Celjski Grof Pils;Maribor, Slovenia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovarna Tara;"Very blond beer with a small head. Really an unusual aroma; It is certainly not beer. My son just said, after smelling, that it probably was beer, with Sprite or something. Anyway, It is the worst I have had as far as I can remember which does not say much. I tend not to remember bad beers."

Velebitsko Tamno;Donje Pazari�te, Croatia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pivovara Li�anka;Pivo u fla�i. Na�alost nisam pio ovo pivo u samim po�ecima kad su ga svi hvalili da je izvrsno. Sada mi to izgleda ovako. Aroma je tamno-sladna ali i slatkasta. Okus je iznena�uju�e slatkasto karamelast , �ta mu prividno daje puno�u , ali nakon par sekundi se to nekako sve rastopi i razvodni. E sad volim kad se kod tamnih piva osjeti malko slatko�e , a ne da su samo na tamnu �okoladu i na neza�e�erenu kavu , ali ovdje je to ipak malo previ�e , pogotovo zato �ta nema gor�ine . �ta ja znam ...mislim mo�e se popiti , nije ba� katastrofa od piva , posebno ako ti ne smeta slatko�a u pivu.

Arbor Triple Stone ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Draft... Ugly medium murky honey gold, a bit of brown, ok light tan head... Super sweet nose, this doesn�t look or smell like a esb, very fruity, light wet grain, ok... Tastes bad, wet skunky grains, very hoppy but a weird greeny quality that I hate
Arbor Triple Stone ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Cask conditioned at brew pub. Cloudy pour from the hand pump with a big frothy head. Very smooth on the tongue. Just light spicy bitterness. Clean.
Arbor Triple Stone ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;On cask at the brewery. Hazy medium orange body, creamy off-white head. Herbal, citrusy nose. Nice hoppy, creamy body with bright citrus, floral notes, and bready, cerealy malts. Pillowy mouthfeel. Quaffable.
Arbor Triple Stone ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;In short: A light honeyed English blonde ale of some kind. From the cask it was quite good. Probably very ordinary on regular tap. How: From the cask at brewpub The look: Partly cloudy blonde body with a little white head In long: Honeyed fruits is the main attraction. Honey pears, honeyed bananas, honeyed peaches, a little caramel touch and a twist of lemon. The juicy/fruity/honeyed body is followed by hops that add a welcomed contrasting dryness with a mild bitterness. Lacks the crispness that I like from the style. However the cask conditioning was top-notch. Smooth bubbles and velvety moutfeel. Overall it is a very average ESB but the superb cask conditioning really ups my score to a superior ESB but if you remove the cask� well� you�re gonna have beer all over the floor.
Arbor Triple Stone ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;On tap at the brewpub. Crystal clear orange-tinted gold, with a white rim. Aroma is a real, dry grassy hop, nice and glowing. Flavor is a little flacid. Cask seems a touch warm to me. There�s some buttery, cheesy hop character right off the bat, and then more of the grassy, juicy English hop style. Fresh tasting. Cask carbonation is working well. Pretty heavily hopped. Not much malt to back it up. Not bad. But, I get stuck on the cheesy, butteriness that develops as being unclean.
Arbor Triple Stone ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Not bad! sweet fruit,citrus and hop aroma....tastes just like abitter should and would be a great session beer.
Arbor Triple Stone ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Cask sample at the brewpub: Arbor likes their Bitters! Pours a cloudy yellow/orange color with a foamy bone white head that lasts awhile. Patchy lacing on the glass. Tangy fruit and malt aroma. Medium-bodied and glassy-smooth with an unassertive hops flavor, as well as touches of fruit and malt. The finish is mildly bitter and short. Pretty forgettable overall.
Arbor Triple Stone ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Cloudy golden pour with a thin white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrusy hops. Flavor of citrusy hops with a very strong and dominating bitter finish. The body is light and oily with soft carbonation. Not bad but there�s more bitterness than hop flavor.
Arbor Duggie Style Rye;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Medium gold, IPA-ish looking beer, with a surprising bright fruity character in the aroma and flavor - actually quite sweet and honey-like - hard to detect the rye, despite it being 35% of the grain bill - it is a bit grainy, but it remains sweet and lightly floral throughout - like and IPA/Maibock hybrid.

Arbor Duggie Style Rye;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;I like the taste of rye, so extra point bias. It is dark brown with a little head and lace. Fruity malty taste, though acidic bitter finish
Arbor Duggie Style Rye;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;On tap at pub. Pours a copper color with a thin white head. Had a little rye bitterness in the flavor. This one seemed to be pretty sweet also.
Arbor Duggie Style Rye;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Draught. Dark opaque orange with no head formation. The aroma is sweet and slightly buttery with a sufficient level of ripe hops, and perfume. Strange flavour is bready with buttery/flowery hops and alcohol sweetness. I was expecting more from this but I got more of an underfermented medley of sugar and hops. Tasted at the brewpub on December 27, 2006.

Sweet caramel malty aroma has a touch of noble hops. Starts with a sweet viscous caramel maltiness balanced with some German malts turning more bitter toward the finish. Has lots of citrusy hops throughout, but is perhaps a bit too sweet.
Arbor Duggie Style Rye;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;On tap at the Arbor Brew Pub.

Lilys Brown Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a brown color with a film of a little white foamy head that slid off into oblivion. No lace. The aroma had some damp nuts, somewhat sweet with a super mild roast. Cardboard. Light grassy hops. The flavor was towards the sweet side and had a little bit of cardboard. Aftertaste was damp paper. Sweet wet finish. The feel was light bodied with a decent sessionability about it given the weight of the body but that cardboard flavor, well, it�s smooth and quaint. Overall, I�m a brown ale fan and find this to be a disappointment.
Lilys Brown Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;on tap atbrewery. pours light brown with not much head. not much aroma either very plain brown. needs more body
Lilys Brown Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;I certainly prefer their Stout over their Brown Ale. It is fine, but nothing that I would go out of my way for or even order again.

One of my least favorite beers of the flight, I would skip this in the future.
Lilys Golden Pilsner;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Very much like a budwesier or one of its kin. A light, bright yellow, unappealing. Little, fizzy head.
Lilys Golden Pilsner;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Golden? More like light yellow and unimpressive, much like its taste. Reminded me off any beer I could buy in the cooler at your local party store.
Lilys Golden Pilsner;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Actually called Shackleton Gold. Tried a sample of this at the brewery yesterday. Bright gold appearance, mostly clear with a big foamy white head. Smells of lightly sour hops, maybe tettnang and/or hallertauer. Opens up with a lightly grainy hops flavor mixed in with some coppery mineral flavors. High amount of carbonation, mostly dry but has some buttery sweetness on the finish. Pretty good actually, it's not amazingly flavorful, but it's not watery either.
Lilys Light Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Tap. Blond colored. Slight in aroma and flavor. The archtypical microbrew crossover.
Lilys Light Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Nice golden color, two finger white head. Sweet malty aroma. Nice tasting malts on the first taste, with a fairly well balanced hop finish presenting itself at the finish. Feels great in the mouth, which was surprising, I figured this would be very light tasting. Lacing presented nicely.
Lilys Light Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Very plain. A quality brew, but nothing worth celebrating. Very simple. Quite dull actually
Lilys Light Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Clear yellow, traditional fare, light malty body is sweet, some hops make their presence known in the finish. Nothing bad about this very plain light ale.
Lilys Light Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;No sediment, small head, faint aroma of hops and grain. Yellow. Not worth saying much about, dry, no malt, little flavor, light body, etc, etc.
Lilys Light Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Weak head and lace, pale yellow color. Heavy hop flavor. Long lasting aftertaste and it seemed to have a touch of cardboard in the flavor.
Lilys Light Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Ok ok ok, no one on this whole site likes light beers ... and I am included in that. But, on occasion, it is nice to drink about 10 beers in a single session. Whether you are heading out with this endeavor or you sort of slip into it, this is the beer you'll end up drinking once you can't taste anything anyway. Nice and grain-y with hints of sweetgrass. Low hop bittering and virually no aroma. If the corporate domestics put beer this good in a can, I would probably buy a couple of cases now and then.
Lilys Whitefish Bay Wheat;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;April 29, 2014 - on tap at Lily�s. Clear yellowish pour with limited head. Aroma was yeast, clove and fruity. Taste was consistent with aroma, but also had some spice.

Lilys Whitefish Bay Wheat;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Draft serving. Did smell like bananas and cloves but the taste has much to be desired. The flavor was overpowered by astringent taste that some on else noted. After taste hung around in my mouth for awhile. Will not be drinking this one again.
Lilys Whitefish Bay Wheat;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;If memory serves me correctly, another reason to leave American wheat beers alone. Little flavor beyond that blandness that such beers carry.
Lilys Whitefish Bay Wheat;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;This draft brew from a festival poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that was long lasting and left behind a hazy dark yellow colored body and an excellent lacing.

Not one that I would drink again.

Lilys Reggies French River Red Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;On tap, poured into a nonic pint glass. The aroma is a prominent floral aroma, with a mild caramel and lactose note. There�s also a faint roasted grain and/or rye aroma. It pours a clear red brown with an oily sheen to it. A very thin white ring is retained and a very light, web lace is left behind. It�s a primarily medium bitter sweet, with a deceiving medium sweetness hidden beneath. The beer is slick in texture with a medium full body and lots of soft carbonation. It finishes with a full resin, rye, and citrus rind flavor and some toasted caramel. The resin sticks to the mouth with a mild cereal and caramel for a little while, but it�s not strong, nor does it stick long.

Translucent copper body, medium clumping tight buff head. Nose of round caramel, toast, and diacetyl. Body quite dry and hoppy for the style, with toffee brown sugar, leafy, spicy hops, and light diacetyl. Interesting.
Lilys Reggies French River Red Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the pub into a mini pint glass...This just looks terrible, a light copper that was watered down, totally see through. However, the head is amazing, its a super thick dark tope. A decent cap, but the lacing is unreal. It fully coats from the top of the glass to the beer, amazing. Scoring has me quite confused...The aroma is a really hoppy subdued pale ale with a hint of rye. Needs a little more rye in this, but the hops are nice...The mouthfeel is great and this is an easy drinker. Solid red worth trying
Lilys Reggies French River Red Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;This draft brew from a festival poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized bubbles that was long lasting and left behind a transparent uncarbonated dark orange colored body and an excellent lacing.

Lilys Reggies French River Red Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Amber color with a tiny head. Malty aroma with both a sweet and sour (as opposed to bitter) taste. Some lemon taste that I think shouldnt be there. Not much going on. If going to Lily�s, stick with the stout.
Lilys Strange Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;On tap, poured into an imperial style half pint. Fresh off the pour, the beer smells like fresh baked oatmeal raisin cookies. After this mellows, a sweet, roasted espresso bean note and milk chocolate comes through. The very dark, brown-red beer is topped with a sudsy, light brown head. This reduces to a medium thick ring of micro and small bubbles and a light wispy surface. It leaves a clean glass with no lacing. The taste is a medium bitter with a medium light sweet. The medium malty body beer has a gritty, chewy texture and a fuzzy carbonation. Coffee and oats finish the beer with some dark, dried fruits. A resin-y aftertaste is initially strong, but it fades quickly and is replaced by a roasted note and a dark chocolate covered raisin remain in mellow abundance. It�s dry with a crisp touch

It�s a dark brown with some orange highlights and a small beige head that leaves behind some nice webbing on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate with a touch of caramel. The finish has moderate roasted, light nuttiness, and coffee. Medium bodied with lightly fizzy carbonation. Overall, a solid sessionable stout, but I could go for a less fizzy mouthfeel.

Lilys Strange Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;On-tap at the pub. Strange stout in dead, looks and acts like a porter...Pours a very clear dark brown with hints of amber. The head is an equally light tan but forms a great cap with great retention...The aroma is boring, only a hint of chocolate, sweet...The taste is ok, a little chocolate, bitter roast, a porter but very crushable. Skip this one.
Lilys Strange Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;sampled at Lansing Winter Beer Fest 07�...probably the worst beer at the show...aroma was nice and sweet (chocolate and toast)...thin palate led to a bitter, dry roasted watered-down coffee flavor
Lilys Strange Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled at the 2nd annual Michigan Winter Beer Festival, Lansing. Nice chocolate and roast in the aroma, but the beer was of the thin, acidic woody roast variety, with little depth or heft. Not a show-stopper by any means.
Lilys Strange Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;This draft brew from the Michigan Brewers Guild Festival poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized brown colored bubbles that was mostly diminishing and left behind a . The aroma was malty roasted malt and toasted malt. The mouth feel was smooth flat and weakly tingly from start to finish with a mild malt bite. The weak flavor contained notes of malt. Not one that I would drink again as it was just too flat and lifeless.
Invercargill Brewery Special (IBS);Invercargill, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Invercargill Brewery;Amber/light brown in colour with big white head. No aroma of any note. Mild hop taste with hint of biscuit/bread.
Invercargill Brewery Special (IBS);Invercargill, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Invercargill Brewery;Tasted 17/01/2005. 500ml bottle from Regional Wines and Spirits. Pours a reddish copper with a light tan collapsing head. Aroma is strongly grainy with a little spice from the hops (Goldings?). Flavour is againy grainy with caramel notes. A hint of whisky in the maltiness but without the alcohol. A peppery hint comes through from the hop flavour. Palate cleans out nicely with a moderate bitterness. A good interpretation of an English Bitter, a style I was more fond of a couple of years ago than I am now.
Invercargill Brewery Special (IBS);Invercargill, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Invercargill Brewery;started out pretty funny but did improve as it warmed. passionfruit frozen yoghurt aroma, the first taste is slightly composty, infected, but later on there was an interesting rockmelon in brown sugar flavour. if they could get their act together they might be able to make some good beers at this place. maybe they should try washing their equipment or something
Invercargill Brewery Special (IBS);Invercargill, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Invercargill Brewery;like kaya i think we had an infected one - this brewery seems to have a bit of a problem, the wasp was off too. very fat, sticky caramel taste, with some fat hoppiness, but there's an alarming amount of rotten rockmelon.
Invercargill Brewery Special (IBS);Invercargill, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Invercargill Brewery;Dirty amber-orange colour. Pours with a tall head at first which quickly fades. Yeasty, very fruiyt aroma. The flavour is way too fruity and borderline defect. Not enough bitter hop flavour at all. This is one that I would avoid.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;Tap@TEFAF. Haze yellow. Small head. Spicy. Low carbonation. Faint flavours. Boring.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;Draught at Rosie O�Grady�s, Napier. Cloudy pale amber, creamy head. Orangey nose. Sweet, fruity and yeasty with notes of melon and clean mouthfeel. There�s not estery bananaish Weihenstephaner yeast character, rather witbier like curacao falvour. Orange jam dominates thie finish. Not the best offering from Limburg.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy liquor that fades from a pale yellow to light gold below the blossoming white head. The nose is apple blossom and spice with notes of apple juice concentrate. The body is light with some spice, a little orange, and vinous notes reminiscent of watered-down apple juice.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;Tasted 02/05/2005. 330ml bottle from New World, Miramar. Pours a murky yellow with a large, almost uncontrollable, sudsy looking, white head. Aroma is predominantly of green apple chewy lollies with hints of banana, spices and yoghurt. Sweet flavour up front with more suggestion of apple plus wheat. Spicey through the middle with very little bitterness. Watery mouthfeel and palate. This one is a little too thin and overly carbonated. I remember it being better. Disappointing that there are no batch details.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;Appearance was a bit on the over cloudy side if that is possible. Aroma offers banana and caramel with hints of clove. Flavour is typical for the style with a long palate that goes from banana in to caramel. Good carbonation on this batch (Best Before Apr 05) a couple of the past batches have been a bit firey at best.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;Bottled, at Paddy�s Brewpub, Flemington, Australia. Foggy blond body. Flavour and aroma were really no descript for me at this stage of the night. Weisse beers were being through on the back of stouts and chocolate porters. Stouts were being contrast and shared with pilsners and bocks. It was frenzy time. The gathering: duff, eczematic, Linc, motelpogo, Spiesy, Sully.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;strange aroma of apple cider. tasted mainly of cloves with some wheat bix and vanilla ice cream. pretty bland, especially compared to limburg's excellent wit
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;Light coloured (almost orangey) with a big, fluffy head. Flavour has strong wheat and fruit tastes - particularly banana and maybe a hint of chewing gum. Good stuff.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;When Duff and i both had this we looked at each other and thought were is the flavour. Little bit of fruit aromas and a stale finish. I want to give this beer another go and hope that we had a bad bottle.
Limburg Weissbier;Hastings, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Limburg Brewing Company;Hmmmm, maybe i missed something or maybe i had a bad bottle, but it was really lifeless, little lasting head, which is unusual for a weiss, stale wheat and slight banana aroma, quite light aswell, sorry, no stand out flavour, i wasn't really a fan.
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);"Aroma is fruity with a slight amount of hops. Taste is full bodied and fruity esters. Very clean with a slight amount of hops, touch of fizz and a bock-like quality that I would almost call ""old""."
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);The aroma is cheap pale malts, metal, and off hops. The appearance is slightly hazy gold with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma and the addition of peanuts. The palate is thin. This is not good but better than expected.
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Bottle (identical to the high resolution photo)... Clear yellow lager with a mid-sized, fluffy, white head. Excellent retention. Almost a Belgian/Flemish nose... herbal, peppery and acidic with fuzzy fruit esters. Perfectly balanced flavor, but lifeless and thin. Light to medium-bodied and watery with modest/tingly carbonation. Frail, diluted finish.
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);"Except for the 6.2% abv (which really can�t be detected), this is one mild lager. I think the ""Power of crystal-clear water"" takes over the show. Mild grassy aroma, some malt sweetness in the nose. It�s got the flavor of ""ripe barley ears""... well not really. That�s what the description says. A mildly sweet malt taste and a modest bitterness are all that�s in the flavor. Finishes on a lightly sour note. Interesting, that this brew is retired. My bottle tasted pretty fresh. DiCarlo Fine Wine and Spirits, Mundelein, IL"
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);"Well, I don�t know who this ""Ryan"" guy is, but my Namyslow looked like the Hi-Res Photo of this beer. Bottle pours a witbier-hazed yellow with a fluffy (almost creamy) white head that holds as a thin cap. Aromas are sour dough and grass with dry caramel malt. Flavor is sweet and grainy without adversities, but within a flat, thin body it loses the greater appeal that it strived for. Finish leans towards sourness, but a roasty, malted backdrop is not entirely covered. Purchased from Di Carlo Fine Wines and Spirits, Mundelein, IL 60060"
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Light gold, vanishing oily head. Nose very sweet, light hops, a bit of fruit. Flavor not particularly good, quite sweet, then minerals, as if somebody brewed a beer with candied rocks. Which probably isn�t what happened, but it�s still not very good.
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Gold Coloring wth White RIng. Swet Malty Aroma. Sweet Malt Notes. Grassy. Relatively Smooth Mouthfeel. Simple, Not Necessarily Satisfying Lager.
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);For a pale lager, this wasn�t bad. Beer 2 of my polish beer night. The head was cotton white with a gold/honey pour. Very clean, but not over filtered with a ez fall down the mouth. Flavour has some citrus, some grains, and a very faint hop thats good. If only every lager was this decent...and shit...its freagin retired!! better go clean the store out.
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Tasted from the bottle and poured into a Pilsner glass. Tight, short white head of foam sat atop a brilliant gold body. Aroma of sweet honey malt and caramelised sugars, with a bit of lemon and orange zest. Quite a clean aroma, and similar in the mouth. Flavours of cereal grains mingled with sweet malt and minimal bittering hops to give a relatively sweet lager, with a medium length fruity swallow. Medium-light bodied and mildly carbonated made for quite a good sessionable Lager that was well balanced, and a good thirst quencher for the warmer months.
Namyslow N Full;Namyslow, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);"The beer pours from the 500ml brown bottle the quintessential lager gold with a moderate sized frothy white head as it evaporates; the residual lace forms a velum like jacket upon the glass. Nose is the prototypical lager sweet malt, fresh and clean, crisp and the start has a decent malt presence and is somewhat sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a stern acidity and the hops apropos to the style, quite dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate, a quite drinkable beer, but at 6.2 percent ABV, I guess not a good session beer."
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);bottle. nice golden color, small head, pretty decent dry taste, drinkkable.
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);The commercial description is as confusing as the taste of this beer. The aroma is sweet as expected with paper and malt. The appearance is amber with floaters and a thin head with NO FOAM. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. This is one to avoid.
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);slightly hazy gold with a large foamy white head. flavors of light honey, tangy malts, hint of sour citrus(lemon), chewy caramel, and even some spice(clove?). a very nice pale.
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Bottle... Clear yellow lager with a mid-sized, creamy/frothy, white head. Good retention. Mead-like aroma... wildflower honey. Flavor of sweet, pale malts... reminiscent of those old time, chewy, Luden�s honey cough drops. Crisp hop balance. Light-bodied with moderate carbonation. Short, crisp finish.
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);500 ml bottle from Blue Max in Burnsville, MN (I think). Looks pretty nearly identical to the same brewer�s Zamkowe that I just had, giant frothy head leaving lots of lacing, atop a golden body...though this one is a bit hazier and darker....some small amount of sweet malt in the nose, a touch of old lemon, honey and grass....light, clean, crisp flavor, bit citrusy, grassy...somewhat lighter-bodied than the Zamkowe but overall just a touch more character with even a nice hint of sharpness at the finish.
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);"Yellow with an anti-freeze glow/haze and a big, cream-tinted white head that faded quickly to a film. The malts in this smelled really good... bready, almost ""cookie"" with an odd grape/caramel combo. Slight cardboard smell in the background. Flavor was lacking... bitter and sour with green leaves and a bit of lemon. Malts came out later... it was actually a little better as it warmed (which I�ve never witnessed before in a Polish lager). Palate held the essence of grapeskin, sour and dry with light astringency. This beer was not the worst. It started great but came up short. Bridgeview Liquors, Bridgeview, IL"
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Great big frothy white head. Slightly skunky aroma but goes away quickly to leave a light crisp grassy meadow aroma. Quite nice actually. Little floral also. Color is a light gold. Flavor is pretty weak with some cardboard, grit and a bit of corn. Dry and chalky palate. Finish is dry and parching in the mouth. Clean finish. Aroma is promising but falls pretty quickly after that.
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Bottle. Straw colored yellow with a tall bubbly foam head. Nose is straw, sweet buttered biscuits and light malt. Taste is semi-sweet malts, light grassy notes, some buttery notes and light citrus. Body is light and laden with carabonation feel. Finishes with light grass, buttery maltiness, light lemony notes.
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Sweet, thin, watery, no zest or fizz. Nice gold color with a tall head having decent retention. Maybe some hops at the back of the throat on the finish. Makes me write in phrases, not sentences.
Namyslow Zloty Denar 5.5 %(Golden Denarius);Namyslow, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Namys��w (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Pleasant golden color, decent stream of bubbles for a good head. Highly sweet aroma with a touch of hay. Flavor is also stunningly sweet, a touch of grain, and an almost sour finish. Why do I keep trying these Eastern European lagers?

Theakston Cool Cask;Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Theakston;Cask, or is it keg? Soapy brown appearance with nitro head. Death by freezing beer, sharp harsh and confused. The hops can herdly get going. Is this really Theakston or the work of the Ampersand group?
Theakston Cool Cask;Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Theakston;Bottle. Hard mouthfeel - beneath the carbonation the beer is lifeless. Minimal hops. Vanilla notes Looks nice - tastes shite.
Theakston Cool Cask;Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Theakston;"I really don�t see the point of this. Take a cask ale and serve it chilled to within an inch of its life (it certainly seemed colder than the 10C claimed) and through a sparkler so tight that it comes over almost identical to the nitrokeg that it is presumably aimed at weaning fizzheads off. Why bother? It�s methadone for keg junkies. Not blatantly offensive though. It would probably be marginally better without the sparkler. ""Cask"" (handpump), The Bull and Chain, Lincoln"

Waiheke Island Onetangi Dark Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Waiheke Island Brewery;Bottle from Waiheke Wine Centre on 20 November 2018. Perfect beer for a cool wet day . Bitter burnt toast flavour with a nice bitter finish as well.

Waiheke Island Onetangi Dark Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Waiheke Island Brewery;(330ml bottle, BB 070117) Pours an opaque black body with a thick tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, licorice, chocolate, and dried dark fruit. Flavor of roasted malt, raisins, grass, chocolate, and licorice with a dry finish.

Waiheke Island Onetangi Dark Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Waiheke Island Brewery;The head is ok, the body almost black. It smells coffee-chocolate, bit sour-plum, The taste is darkmalty, coffee-chocolate, bit sour-plum. Ok, easy drinkable.
Waiheke Island Onetangi Dark Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Waiheke Island Brewery;My experience seems a little different from others! Dark body with decent tan head. Spicy zesty sharp nose, then subtle roasty notes. Not what I was expecting! Strongly carbonated. Similarly astringent and sharp to taste. Doesn?t really have a full bodied taste, its rather light. Nice roasted taste coming through late. A surprising beer from the dark body to zesty citrus aroma to the initially sharp then roasted taste. Not an every day drink but very interesting! Retaste: none of the sharp or sourness, just a solid porter. (Perhaps the last batch was contaminated?). Not too heavy, easy drinking. Perfect for sumer
Waiheke Island Onetangi Dark Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Waiheke Island Brewery;Tasted 7/2/2014. Draught at Waiheke Island Brewery, NZ. Poured a translucent deep ruby red colour with a light tan collar that produced poor lacing. Carbonation moderate with small bubbles. Aroma of nice sweet coffee dominates and not really anything else. Taste of sweet caramel malt, slight chocolate on the after-taste, and very slight bitterness. Light body, lighter that I was expecting. Smooth, light, clean with a long slightly bitter finish. More a dark lager that an ale or porter. Quite nice but a bit thin in the body.
Waiheke Island Onetangi Dark Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Waiheke Island Brewery;Keg at the brewery 31/12/12 Dark ruby brown with fluffy tan head. Chocolate, fruity coffee and redcurrants on the nose. Medium mouthfeel with roast barley, dry coffee and a long malt finish.
Waiheke Island Onetangi Dark Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Waiheke Island Brewery;330ml Champagne style brown bottle purchased on Waiheke Island near Auckland NZ. Pours dark brown with a small tan head of minimal duration and lacing. Nose is sweet dark toasted malts with dark chocolate and mild coffee notes. Flavour is similar but there is a stronger than average hop bitterness to the finish (they now use NZ grown Styrian Goldings) which earns bonus points. Body is medium-light but with a somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Nicely balanced and easy to drink.
Waiheke Island Onetangi Dark Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Waiheke Island Brewery;"Good looking dark ale, nice colour with a smallish head. Aroma is full of roasty chocolate and some coffe notes. There are some good roasty flavours too but it falls short here for me. The palate is thin and feeble which really lets this beer down. If there was some more weight and mouthfeel here this would be a very good beer. As it is, its just ""alright""."

Flossmoor Station Panama Limited Red Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Bottle thanks to dtjager! It�s a gusher, lots of foam and overflow immediately after opening the bottle! Dirty brown pour, lasting head and an aroma of spicy/hoppy caramel. Flavor is very creamy spicy malt, herbal hops and finished nice a bitter. Aside from the overcarbonation, this beer was pretty great! Plenty of flavor that you�d get from a great imperial red, without being too high in alcohol. Not sure what the bottles run, but I�d certainly buy it if priced right.
Pipkin Pale Ale;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pipkin Brewing Co.;12oz bottle (old Notes)-Pours a copperish orange with a decent head. Aroma of hops and malt. Taste of the same. This medium bodied brew is well balanced and goes down easy.
Pipkin Pale Ale;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pipkin Brewing Co.;Copper color with a small white head. Hop aroma. Flavor is bitter and hoppy, but not in a good way. This looks to be an old bottle, but the year was not marked.(Choice of 97,98,99)
Pipkin Pale Ale;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pipkin Brewing Co.;Maltier and a bit fuller bodied than what I'm used to in an american pale ale. More english style, I think. Very good, nonetheless, with a pleasant pale malt character and a good hop presence.

Pipkin Pale Ale;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pipkin Brewing Co.;This is a great Pale Ale brewed right here on the banks of the Ohio. It opens to a great aroma reminding you of barley waving across the bluegrass. A taste and it�s full bodied on the tongue and smoother than the Call To The Post at Churchill Downs. Then the flavor hits you like a run-away coal barge on the Ohio River. It finishes with a hoppy bitterness that reminds you that life is fleeting and we should enjoy it while we can. I should note here that BBC has bought out Pipkin Brewing and they will not be making my favorite ale any longer so I urge you to enjoy it while you can.

Oakham Harlequin Ale;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oakham Ales;Cask at Oakham Brewery Tap, Peterborough. What more can I say about Oakham beers.

Oakham Harlequin Ale;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oakham Ales;This is an Oakham beer so no surprise that is golden and conspicuously hoppy The aroma is grassy with noticeable orange zest notes. Juicy, fruity flavour. But its relatively low key and less ebullient than many of its stable mates. There�s a hint of underlying malt in there too. Rather acidic finish. Fresh, clean and citric but not as much pizzazz as I�ve come to expect from Oakham. Cask (gravity), Cambridge Beer Festival.
Oakham Harlequin Ale;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oakham Ales;Cask conditioned at the 32nd Cambridge Beer Festival, gravity dispense. ABV was listed as 4.9%. The brewery website does not mention the ABV, it might vary. This is another lovely citrussy golden ale from Oakham, a style which seems to be their specialty. Golden colour, low head. Plenty of citrus, tropical fruits and honey in the aroma. Flavour has some citrus, but also some of the dusty hoppiness you�ll find in many Southern English ales.

Obviously, after a hard day drinking 55 plus beers at GBBF, what is required is a nightcap. Sort of orange/amber colour. Hazy.

Hoeksch Bokbier;Oud-Beijerland, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bierbrouwerij Hoeksche Waard;A 2002 vintage at �t Arendsnest. Deep hazy ruby beer with a lasting and more than honest-sized off-white head. At 5 years old, this is still quite aromatic and the oxidation remains limited. Brightly fruity, cherry-like malts with nutty notes being its only aging features. Where it suffered the most is predictably in its body that feel thinned out, but still offers plenty of soft carbonation to sweep the caramelly flavours� sweetness. Well done, but I�m still trying to figure out where to position dutch boks with regards to german bocks and this one did not hint at many differences.

Osje�ko Biker;Osijek, Croatia;Radler / Shandy;Osje�ka Pivovara;0,5l bottle. Taste is a little bit acidic, it has lemon flavor. Not really good beer, but it is refreshing.
Osje�ko Biker;Osijek, Croatia;Radler / Shandy;Osje�ka Pivovara;Finally got this one from Osijek, as now it�s available only in that part of Croatia. 0.33 l bottle which poured pale yellow body with big very short living head. Flavor is acidly lemon sweet, simply too much and, again, it seems that there is only little bit of beer inside. Alright, may be a bit better than other radlers I�ve tried, but now I am asking a question will I ever find I good radler?
Osje�ko Biker;Osijek, Croatia;Radler / Shandy;Osje�ka Pivovara;i don`t like any flavored beer`s so this beer is bad .................................................
Osje�ko Biker;Osijek, Croatia;Radler / Shandy;Osje�ka Pivovara;The lemonade component combined with the acid of ordinary Osje�ko is a bad combination. Tastes horrible.
Osje�ko Biker;Osijek, Croatia;Radler / Shandy;Osje�ka Pivovara;Not as bad as I expected it to be. Certainly not as foul as some other fruit beers/radlers I�ve tried. Far better than Desperados and Bandidos, and has a more balanced taste than Kronenbourg Panache. The lemonade taste is predominant though, and it�s too sweet.... maybe they�ve improved the recipe ?

La�ko Roler;La�ko, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna La�ko;Rating from the past. It poured a clear slightly pale yellow color. There was a lot of carbonation, and a generous white head with bad retention. The aroma was sweet and citrusy, lemon-like. The taste started sweet (artificial sugar) and slightly citrusy. No bitterness present, except a tiny level of it in the finish. Refreshing and very drinkable, but never among the popular ones.
La�ko Roler;La�ko, Slovenia;Radler / Shandy;Pivovarna La�ko;Can, 0.33l. Poured clear straw color with medium frothy white head and lively carbonation. Aroma of lemon and light malt.

Good old roler, retired of course...

Mill Creek Brew 22;Walla Walla, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mill Creek Brewpub;Taster - Mill Creek Brew Pub - Walla Walla, WA � An easy drinking lager that lacks any real flavor. This was a good local beer for the non beer snob.
Mill Creek Brew 22;Walla Walla, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mill Creek Brewpub;"Does a fine job emulating Pabst Blue Ribbon. A decent pale lager. My friend commented that "" it doesn�t taste much like beer."" As if that were a good thing. Pours gold-amber with a rapidly fading small white head. Few lacings. Has a mild sweetness with a hard to find hop profile. The hops show up as some bitterness in the finish. Some butter qualities that fades as beer is consumed. Overall a pretty good light bodied lager. abv seemed pretty low also. From a growler fill."
Mill Creek Brew 22;Walla Walla, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mill Creek Brewpub;Dark golden with hints of brown, a slight haze, and a thin white head.

Sweet brew with a light body.

Leavenworth Whistling Pig Hefeweizen;Olympia, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;12 oz single can from Total Wine & More - Springfield (VA). Hazy yellow colored appearance with a small bubbly white head. Mild aroma of wheat, fruitiness, light esters and a hint of banana.

Leavenworth Whistling Pig Hefeweizen;Olympia, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Can at home just a quick cheap new brewery tick grab. Not the prettiest hazy orange. Nose is dull wheat hint of cloves. Tastes the same very little banana and some esters. Dry as a bone and some cardboard aftertaste.
Leavenworth Whistling Pig Hefeweizen;Olympia, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Poured into a weizen glass, the appearance was a semi-cloudy orange to burnt yellow color with some slight brown hues closer to the center. Two finger white foamy head started and dissipated to leave some semi-foamy lace roaming all around the glass. The aroma had more of a sweet banana to lemony quality about it. Sweet wheat, but somewhat like just there. The flavor leaned towards the sweet side and didn�t have the normal wheat bite to it. And where�s the clove? Sweet wheaty/lemon and banana gripping the aftertaste. No finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly big sessionable smooth wet feel. Carbonation feels lower than suspected and so does the ABV. Overall, weird hefeweizen. I almost want to say that�s it just leans towards an odd American pale wheat ale. And if it really is that, well, I would much rather have other APWA�s before this again.

Flavor is a little light with some wheat, corn and yeast backed by a nice bitterness. After taste is more wheat and the bitterness holds for just a bit. Overall it�s an easy drinking brew but just seems to be lacking flavor.

Rather rude up front for a hefe, seems to have a few wheat ale attributes floating around in there. Yes, does not hide the alky well, seems much more than 6%. Could use some carbonation, comes across almost flat like lager left over night. What ever, needs some manners and civility. Could not be in the same styles as Erdinger Weissbier, Schneider Weisse Original, �vyturys White - Baltas Hefeweizen or East End Monkey Boy. Well, near the finish, I do get some watery banana in there. Yea, sure can use some co2 sizzle.

Flossmoor Station Pullman Nut Brown;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Porter;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"From Aug 2008 I got this in a trade with joe1510. Thanks Joe! It pours a very dark brown with a small head of tan foam. The smell is both bitterish and sweet; some notes of coffee and chocolate and some grain. The taste is as nice as the nose. I'm getting the bitter/sweet thing with good tasting coffee notes and good chocolate, which I think is adding both sweetness and bitterness. A nice medium mouthfeel here which also describes the carbonation. It finishes with a nice bitterish kick that leaves a good long lasting aftertaste. I like. Bottom line: Here's a nice American style Brown Ale that's plenty tasty, has a good mouthfeel, is easy drinking, and looks good in the glass. A solid example of the style."
Flossmoor Station Pullman Nut Brown;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Porter;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Appearance: Holey moley! I�m pouring foam into my glass not beer! Every time i pour, it comes out foam with very little body. The light brown head looks gorgeous though all frothy and whipped. My wife says it looks like a root beer float. After several minutes i eventually see the opaque dark brown body. Though off-putting a little, it looks really nice once it settles down. Smell: Molasses, chocolate and brown sugar. Nice bitter edge to it. Taste & Mouthfeel: Combining these together because the carbonation is way out of hand on this one. I get a little bit of molasses but the carbonation is literally hurting my tongue. I let calm down for awhile and try again. Carbonation is still high but i do get some coarse chocolate and burnt sugar. Other than that, nothing and not quite pleasant i must say. Drinkability: Not really. My wife couldn�t continue after a few sips but i tried to give it a chance but i couldn�t finish my glass. The astringent taste and overly excessive carbonation kills it for me.

Flossmoor Station Pullman Nut Brown;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Porter;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;My first time drinking anything from this brewery. I�m surprised to see how many beers they have produced and yet I�m just now learning of this brewery in my home state! Poured from a pint can which did not say NUT brown however all other facts are the same. Pour is so black light can�t penetrate it...has a huge long lasting tan head which is beautiful and thick. The head dissipates slowly and the glass of beer left behind has amazingly so the lowest amount of carbonation I�ve ever experienced. It�s smooth and a tad sweet but I do not get the nut flavor. No doubt the dark color and the slight sweetness is from the black strap.

Pours a deep brown color with two fingers of thick, creamy tan head. Smell is mildly sweet and a bit roasty.

Oak Creek Pullman Porter;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Porter;Oak Creek Brewing Company;4 oz. sample at the brew pub. Aromas aren�t overly potent, weak roasted coffee, light roast. Palate is watery and lacking depth. Tastes like a generic porter. The flight of beers started decent but ended with a big fizzle.

Moderate toasted dark malt and caramel aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium toasted dark sweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration.

Oak Creek Pullman Porter;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Porter;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Taster. Blackish pour with creamy tan head. Dark roast coffee and chocolate notes... Similar flavor profile... This is almost a stout. Well done...
Oak Creek Pullman Porter;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Porter;Oak Creek Brewing Company;The newer prosperity porter which is a touch bolder at 6.5 percent. Clean malt profile with roast, light nut and coffee roast/bitterness... Easy drinking porter!
Oak Creek Pullman Porter;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Porter;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Pour on tap at the brewery, slightly hazy dark reddish black pour with tan head, aroma brought notes of roast, water, grain, some slight cocoa but pretty mild. Taste was a mix of grain, coffee, dark chocolate, hints of slight watery grain into a bit of yeast, finishing dry.

Ellezelloise Saison 2000;Ellezelles, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des L�gendes);Many yeast residues sink to the bottom after pouring. Persistent white foam. The aroma has suffered from roasted malt and a distinct aroma of freshly baked rye bread, besides some fruit. Very spicy flavor with creamy mouthfeel. There is revealed sweet fruit tones aforementioned bread, wheat malts typical citrus touch, light roasted malt, caramel, spices (including nutmeg) and a little sharp but moderate hop bitterness at the end. Great fullness carries it all the way through the palate. Very little carbonation, but the persistent creamy foam is also a good enjoyment. Dry aftertaste. Great beer.
Ellezelloise Saison 2000;Ellezelles, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des L�gendes);Like Saisis, this is another of the original Ellezelloise beers which did not survive the fusion with G�ants. Wheat saison with yellowish white, thick, stable, moussy head and deep peach blond colour, cloudy. Very fruity aroma of orange, strawberry, white grapes, wheat, caramel, liquorice, grassy hops, honey, pepper, white chocolate, aniseed, coriander. Fruity onset with citrussy freshness, full and rounded palate, malt sweet, more spicy in the middle (impressions of ginger and cinnamon), with mild herbal hoppy finish. A bit too polished and not �wild� enough for a real saison, but still a more than decent ale.
Ellezelloise Saison 2000;Ellezelles, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des L�gendes);11.2 oz bottle from January 2008. Pours flat and dark amber with no head, but some random bubbles around the collar. Aroma is sweet caramel some pepper spice and nothing else. Taste is more of the above with no signs of carbonation or flavor, but the sweet caramel water. Palate is thin flat and blah...
Ellezelloise Saison 2000;Ellezelles, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des L�gendes);Rated on 4-02-2009 (Bottle) This beer poured as a gusher with a large white very fizzy head, hazy straw body, visible carbonation, and no lacing. The Aroma is malty, sweet, hoppy, spicy, and fruity. Ditto for the taste along with some yeast. The Palate is smooth and watery. This beer is light bodied. Overall, this beer is easy to drink. Almost too easy to drink. It is worth trying.

Ellezelloise Saison 2000;Ellezelles, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des L�gendes);33 cl bottle. Originally rated on 20100715. Pours hazy golden color with a large head. Aroma of yeast, citrus fruits, mild hops, spice notes and mild pale malts. Flavor of citrus fruits, some apricot, spices, pale malts and yeast. Well balanced. Very nice.
Ellezelloise Saison 2000;Ellezelles, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des L�gendes);"Pours murky brown with very little fizz. Smells a bit funky with some caramel and bready notes. Taste is bready, malty sweet, and a bit fruity. Medium-bodied with a smooth texture and mild mouth-carbonation, Ellezelloise Saison finishes with a mild sweetness similar to honey. This is not like any saison I�ve ever had; it was more like a dubbel than anything else."
Ellezelloise Saison 2000;Ellezelles, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des L�gendes);The beer in the glass is strong golden yellow with a soapy-pearly head. It smells dominant malty, slightly sweet and fruity. Starts hoppy, floral, very fruity, balanced sweet-sour. The middle part is fruity-sweet, surprisingly hoppy and slightly yeasty in the background. Goes into a fruity-sweet-sour finish with grassy aroma hops. Might as well pass as a german Kristallweizen!

St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;Bottled. Dark with a tuby tint. Sooty aroma with some herbal flavour, too. Liquorice, salt. Different, but I am not convinced about this one.
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;Bottled. Reddish brown coloured. Very malty aroma. Sweet and boring flavour. No sign of the juniper. Dissapointing.
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;Nice sweet flavor. Smoked taste. Dry aftertaste. Tastes a little bit like wine. Good beer.
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;Aroma is a bit winey, fruity and smoked. Clear, reddish colour with a decent lacing. Taste is slightly thin. Bit weird. Herbs, fruit, sweetness, smoked all together well balanced. I had to get used to its taste, but it was good. Pleasant brew.
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;Clear red color, short head. Aroma of caramel malt, hint of kriek. Sweet fruity taste.
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;Bottled, sampled in Jerusalem Tavern. Clear dark copper coloured, dying head. Very malty roated aroma with some port notes. Superb smooth flavour. Sweet finish. My personal favourite of the St. Peters brewery.
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;"My bottle had its Best Before Date set at ""Feb 2004"", but it seemed to have survived in fairly good condition. Herbs (juniper and nettles, the label says) are evident in both aroma and taste: the beer smells almost like vermouth or bitters. The taste is good, strongly malty, with a licorice-like note, and a slightly dry finish, even if the body is rather thin and watery. I suppose this would have been much better if fresh, but you have to understand me, I just can't resist an unusual beer on sale (40% off)..."
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;Bottled. Deep amber approaching brown. The head didn�t stay around very long. Rich malty flavour. The absence of hops defines this Saxon styled beer. Rich mature malt flavour. Medium length on the palate. I can definitely recommend this beer for its historical importance and quality.
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;This was a disappointment (like all other St. Peters beers) No taste of juniper berries at all. Quite mild, low carbonation. However it is still not a bad beer. The label is just telling you something else.
St Peters King Cnut;Bungay, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;St. Peter's Brewery;The aroma is spicy - undescribable special. The color is red and it has a small disappearing head. The flavor is very spicy, noticable juniper, and slightly sweet. This beer is more special, than it is good, but I'm glad I've tried it.
H.C. Berger Federales Export Pilsner;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Golden colour with a quickly dissipating head. Sweet flavour with a late dryness.
H.C. Berger Federales Export Pilsner;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Had a bottle of this today after some hot sex. I think the fact that I was so thirsty really helped the rating. Clear light sparkling straw. Large tight & dense creamy white head has fair lacing and lasts well after the last of the brew has been quaffed. Mild fruity and perfumed hop nose with plenty of malt grain. Sweet and fresh flavor with a slightly spicy middle, and an average balanced finish. Light and dry body that is lively and finishes clean. Very refreshing.
H.C. Berger Federales Export Pilsner;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;"this wan pastel yellow beer hasn't the strength even to hold it's head up, so it's not much to look at, tho emerging from an eighteen hour shift in a coal mine might improve it's allure. i merely mowed the lawn and find it, predictably, just adequate and refreshing. nose was moderate with some grass, honey, alcohol and sour apple. smooth. a tad watery, dryish, modest bitterness. if the brewer was sitting here, i'd say ""hey, pretty good!"" and feign some enthusiasm. well, he ain't here."
H.C. Berger Federales Export Pilsner;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Good beer for the style. Would be a great hot weather beer. One of the only pilseners I've seen brewed in Colorado, and probably the lightest beer made here.
H.C. Berger Federales Export Pilsner;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;straw color, no nose. i guess you could say it has some hop charecter, thin
H.C. Berger Working Mans Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Darker than I expected with a name like that. A little chocolate, not really lager-like flavor (missing that distinctive lager character)
H.C. Berger Working Mans Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Reddish-amber colour with a quickly dissipating head. Toasted malkt aroma and sweet malt flavour. It actually seems more bock or vienna-like to me. Not nearly dry enough to be a dunkel.
H.C. Berger Working Mans Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;More of a black bier than a dunkel... not as much malt. Light and drinkable.
H.C. Berger Working Mans Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Nice creamy head, brownish red color. Thin coffee scent. Light coffee taste, with not much else to it.
H.C. Berger Working Mans Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;A Rush inspired name? Probably not. I mised the fine print IDing this as a Munich Dunkel, so I expected this to be a light lager of some sort. Imagine my surprise when I saw this dark stuff pouring out of the bottle. This has an excellent toasty toffee aroma. Its a clean aroma that isn't overdone. Small head - no retention...dark red-brown. Nice clean and crisp malt with caramel toffee flavors. Better balanced than their other beers.
H.C. Berger Working Mans Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;burgundy beige head. thin, first i had of the H.C. Berger Variety Pack. unimpressive
Plank Heller Weizenbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;Nice intense fruity beginning. Lots of clove and yeast. very intense and deep, fantastic balanced and fruity. Full-bodied, rich in total, lots of clove and yeast in the aftertaste with a smooth Weizen sweetness. Fantastic.
Plank Heller Weizenbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;Hazy deep orange, with a big enough but not as big as usual for the style head. Ok retention and some lacing. Aroma is a bit too subdued, with bubblegum and fruity notes of peach and banana taking the main stage, plus slight clove. Taste is brighter. Obviously sweet (averagely so per style), with hints of spiciness/clove and the slightest sourness to bring balance. Notes are bubblegum, banana, peach. Medium bodied with average carbonation, overall kind of lighter than usual for style and abv. A rather simple, highly drinkable, smooth interpretation of a weizenbock. Nice enough, but not very interesting to me.
Plank Heller Weizenbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;Frothy white head stayed on a finely carbonated, cloudy dark orange coloured body. Orange, yeast & spice aroma - smells like a Tripel. Medium bodied, creamy to the fore with a tingle down the back. Wheat, banana, orange, yeast, spices, pepper & sweet citrus with a boozy tangy finish.
Plank Heller Weizenbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;This is a backlog rating from�2011 from a bottle, from�notes.�When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are wheat malts, banana, light spice, caramel, yeast.
Plank Heller Weizenbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;Nice, bananey weizenbock with a rather full palate. Looks pretty with a hazy orange colour
Plank Heller Weizenbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;Bottle yesterday. Was hazy, fullish bldied, substantial.. nice weissy ripe bananas, but malty.. not as peppery spicy as some, but hints still.
Plank Heller Weizenbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;0.5 l bottle from Alko Arkadia, Helsinki. I guess you could call this imperial Hefe-Weizen. A bit heavier but still smooth and easy.

Pokal Pilsner (Carlsberg);Copenhagen, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlsberg Brewery;"The nose is very slightly malty. The color is yellow and it has a flat fast disappearing head.

Pokal Classic (Carlsberg);Copenhagen, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Carlsberg Brewery;"Not much aroma. Plenty big head disappearing quickly. Weissbier-like first impression.

Frankenheim Blue;D�sseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Privatbrauerei Frankenheim (Warsteiner);A favorite among the many Beer/Cola mixers that sprung up in the 2000s. With Altbier as a basis, it pours dark brown as it should. There is just a little additional fruity/cola-esque flavour, adding to the original taste rather than overwhelming it. Good.
Frankenheim Blue;D�sseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Privatbrauerei Frankenheim (Warsteiner);Sampled from 0.33 l bottle from local 'trinkgut', best before July 2018. Clear, very dark red with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, off-white head. Sweetish, slightly sourish aroma of cola, burnt sugar and some nuts. Quite sweet, malty, a bit sourish taste of cola, grains, burnt sugar and some nuts, followed by a short, minimally bitter, slightly sourish finish. Medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Quite refreshing, not that bad when you're thirsty, still way more cola than Alt.
Frankenheim Blue;D�sseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Privatbrauerei Frankenheim (Warsteiner);Bottle. Frothy off-white good mostly lasting head. Amber colour. Light malty and hoppy cola aroma. Light bitter flavor. Short light bitter finish. Watery palate.
Frankenheim Blue;D�sseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Privatbrauerei Frankenheim (Warsteiner);Bottle. There is some underlying darkish, maybe bready malt presence but sadly the cola has taken over. Sweet, lackluster soft-drink.

It poured slightly hazy golden body with head. BB date was 15. March. Crappy aroma, totally malty with rotten cabbage, eggs and cornflakes. Flavor is luckily weaker, sweetish malty and not so bad as one would expect from the stench. Thin to medium body. Sweetish honey finish. A pilsener? No way, but its ordinary, boring and just drinkable all malt pale lager. But again, it was near to its BB date so it might not be in its best shape.

Cerveceria Paraguayana Pilsen Cerveza Blanca;Ypan�, Paraguay;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Paraguaya - Cervepar (AB InBev);Bottle in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay - I was in Ciudad del Este only for a few hours, and all I wanted was a beer from Paraguay, which tourned out to be nearly impossible. All shops selling beer had not one from Paraguay in their shelves, and the clerks looked at me quite funny, when I kept asking for one. Paraguayan beer really seems not to be that great. Finally, I chose to dine in a small shack in a shopping center, just because they had a bottle of this behind the counter. Tourned out to be a good choice - the food. Beer was weak, but it gets some extra credit for me for being so hard to find :)
O'Fallon Spring Ale;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;O'Fallon Brewery;decent enough copper color..very thin white head. aroma was mostly malts with a hint of floral hops thrown. weird...flavor was all that different. little hops on the tongue, then you swallow the beer and shit, where did any flavor go? i'll have to try this again in the spring (assuming they brew it again) when it may be a little fresher...although i dont think it was a bad bottle, just devoid of most flavor characteristics.
O'Fallon Spring Ale;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;O'Fallon Brewery;"Given the other reviewers comments, I fear I may have gotten a weird bottle. But, rate I must. In the words of Golum ""We loves the Spring Ale.......NO!!! We hates the Spring Ale!"". By the pour and appearance of this offering I expected bliss. Yet upon tasting, my tongue, riled by deception, scolded and scorned the dreamers purchase. Perhaps it's the dryness that so offended. The aroma was pleasant enough, but there is no malty goodness, no body, no life force from which to draw. Just empty fizz and some lanquid hops. ""We must re-rates the beer......NO!!! me must punishes the beer!......""."
O'Fallon Spring Ale;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;O'Fallon Brewery;"Picked this one up in St. Louis. Has a clear dark amber body topped by a thin off-white head.

Spaten Maibock;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Spaten-Franziskaner-Br�u (AB InBev);"Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #83. Draught pint - or probably .5 liter - at the Essen Haus in Madison, WI, August 2008. Pale clear gold with a lasting dollop of snow-white head...grassy aroma at first, more like a pils or helles, but caramelized malts do come through after a minute or two...body too is more reminiscent of a lighter lager style with the caramelization rather muted; there�s also some discernible hops which is unusual, though they are faint...light alcoholic bite, pretty full at the finish and sweet enough that, OK, yeah, it�s a bock I guess, just a very lightly-flavored/textured and dry one. Which isn�t really a bad thing."
Spaten Maibock;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Spaten-Franziskaner-Br�u (AB InBev);Similar to a Heineken. Super skunky flavor and bitter. Had to drink this because i rated all other beers. Pours light yellow in color. Had out of a bottle. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Spaten Maibock;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Spaten-Franziskaner-Br�u (AB InBev);16 ounce pint - $5.50 at Taco Mac in Kennesaw, Georgia. Appearance: Served up a clear, deep yellow-hued body with a medium-sized, white head that soon settles into a thin ring. Smell: A whiff of pilsner malt, some soft, sweet-accented breadiness, a thin sliver of honey, and spice and dried leaves in the background. Taste: An initially twangy taste of faintly grainy pils malt. Lightly sweet, hinting barely at mild honey. German noble hops provide touches of florals, spice, and a slight leafy quality. Modestly bitter. Drying on the back end, with a final pop of malt on the finish, then a lingering mingling of graininess and bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-plus carbonation. Overall: A decent, suitable maibock.
Spaten Maibock;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Spaten-Franziskaner-Br�u (AB InBev);Tap. Fluffy pure white head, clear golden orange-yellow. Very fruity in both the aroma and taste - stone fruits and apples. Gets a bit grainy as well, and has some metallic notes in the flavor. Sweetish, and has a heftier nearly syrupy body. Too sweet for me....
Spaten Maibock;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Spaten-Franziskaner-Br�u (AB InBev);Had at Huettenbar. Nice malt sweetness. Not every sip but some had a spicy flavor. Serving: Tap
Spaten Maibock;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Spaten-Franziskaner-Br�u (AB InBev);"Like so many things that have attained iconic status, it�s tough to say anything too good or too bad about this. Both the aroma and the palate beckon with so much malt that it hints of sour grapefruit. Yet the body is surprisingly thin, and the carbonation surprisingly coarse for those of us who cut our teeth on American craft brews. A nice beer, but it�s too bad not every classic can be ""Casablanca."""

Bavaria Light (Costa Rica);La Ribera de Bel�n, Heredia, Costa Rica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Bebidas (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is light yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (grain, cereal, husks), with notes of metal and DMS. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, slightly unclean, slightly husky. Light body, watery texture, fizzy/lively carbonation, metallic. Help, I�m stuck in Costa Rica! Actually it�s a great country but the beer in stores is all this Florida factory garbage.
Bavaria Light (Costa Rica);La Ribera de Bel�n, Heredia, Costa Rica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Bebidas (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle in some random bar, Puntarenus, Costa Rica on 29th March 2014: why do I drink these sort of beers? I know I don�t like them: I�ve turned into a ticker haven�t I? In my quest to drink as many different Costa Rican beers during our short stop over as possible I�ve driven myself to this sort of thing (and a bloody Rock Lemon!). Weak, and iffy in all aspects: quench your thirst with this my all means, but don�t expect a beer experience. I�d take a sip then wash your feet in it!
Bavaria Light (Costa Rica);La Ribera de Bel�n, Heredia, Costa Rica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Bebidas (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottled in Monteverde, Costa Rica.

Bavaria Light (Costa Rica);La Ribera de Bel�n, Heredia, Costa Rica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Bebidas (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);to be honest, the reviewer below me sums up my thoughts on these. yet another rubbish beer from floridas bebidas. not much to choose from in costa rica.... granted most do the job for what they are designed - to quench thirst on a hot day.
Bavaria Light (Costa Rica);La Ribera de Bel�n, Heredia, Costa Rica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Bebidas (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Jesus, I don�t know why I keep doing this - the depths I�ll go to in order to scare up a rating in this country. Unbelievable what a monopoly on trash Florida Bebidas has in Costa Rica. I wonder what their marketing plan is. Hmmm, let�s try this: another trashy pale lager. We�ll call it the same as the rest only we�ll add �light� or �ice� or something after the name and add one more or less grain of barley where needed so we can say the beer is different.
Bavaria Light (Costa Rica);La Ribera de Bel�n, Heredia, Costa Rica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Bebidas (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Cans in Costa Rica. Coors-lightish, moderately offensive. Costa Rica is not a place for beer drinkers.

Club Premium (Ecuador);Guayaquil, Ecuador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Nacional Ecuador (AB InBev);This is terrible !

Club Premium (Ecuador);Guayaquil, Ecuador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Nacional Ecuador (AB InBev);Pours a clear straw yellow from the bottle with bubbly white head that leaves light lace. Aroma and taste of corn and hay, light grass and crisp lager yeast. It's a mass produced light lager, made by AB-Inbev, and it tastes like it. But its good on a hot day after a long hike in the Galapagos.
Club Premium (Ecuador);Guayaquil, Ecuador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Nacional Ecuador (AB InBev);"Bottle found at a supermarket in Quito, served warm - as the old grandpa said, ""kid, if you don't like warm beer, you don't like beer"". So here we are. It pours with modest thin head and a heavily carbonated yellow body. Smells like dried shit, the likes of which I saw on the sidewalk near their fancy cathedral this morning and I can only hope it wasn't human. The flavour is that of a non-alcoholic brew with lots of cloying bread going on. Wet and sugary finish. There is essentially nothing to recommend here, I suppose if it's chilled enough and you're poor it could be an okay way to forget about your week. But then again, so is a mickey of vodka."
Club Premium (Ecuador);Guayaquil, Ecuador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Nacional Ecuador (AB InBev);Not bad when travelling in Ecuador. On a global standard it is no more than an average Lager.

Jacob Bodenw�hrer Weissbier;Bodenw�hr, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Familienbrauerei Jacob;getrunken vom Fass am Feuerwehrfest Perchtoldsdorf, einem Vorort im Speckg�rtel von Wier, der offenbar diese als Partnergemeinde hat. Jedenfalls hat dieses Bier hier eine gewisse Tradition. Es ist ein Weizenbier, so wie ich mir es w�nsche: ein traditionelles Weizenbier mit richtig sch�nen fruchtigen Aromen, welche nicht komisch �bertrieben wirken und doch den Mund mit einer Geschmacksexplosion erfreuen. Man kann es als Strandbier als auch als vollmundiges Feierabenbier trinken. An dem soliden Bier gibt es echt nichts auszusetzen.

Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;Geprobeerd tijdens de 24 uur van het belgische bier in Antwerpen in 2002. Ik had toen genoteerd: mooi rode kleur, zeer speciaal met de druivensmaak, een echte meevaller.
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;750ml shared by callmemickey. Thanks again Ryan for this rare treat. Pours a dark amber, almost brown color with purplish hues and a one finger light beige head that slowly settles into a thin ring. Spotty lacing left behind. Funky, musty aroma with lots of earthy oak and vinous dark fruit. I was really surprised by how funky the nose is. Not in a sour/wild ale way but really damp, leathery and earthy countering the sweet fruit notes. Underneath there is a decent amount of grape and other berries. Medium bodied with soft carbonation and a stronger fruit presence than expected. Also, nowhere near as funky as the aroma suggested with subtle earthiness and leather notes. Very vinous with lots of grape, currant and other dark berries as well as some subtle malt and dry oak. This beer has developed a lot of complexity and has held up surprisingly well. Lots of amazing funk in the nose and still plenty of fruit in the palate.
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;Leather, wax, earth, cork, herbal hops, wood, cherries, grapes and alcohol are all notable in the aroma. Very hazy, bright reddish-brown coloured body is topped by a fizzy, pink-tinged head that recedes rapidly to ring. Strong earth, cork and strong acidity in the very dry flavour. Grapes emerge in the aftertaste. Dusty and somewhat astringent and puckering with plenty of tannins and vinegary, balsamic notes. Strong, lively fine bubbled carbonation is surprisingly quite prickly on the tongue. This one didn�t work for me nearly as well as for others in the session. Bottle sampled with MartinT, Olivier_MTL, Rastacouere and Siroy.
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;Purple/red color is gorgeous to look at. The head is initially good sized, but quickly diminishes to a white ring. Cabernet Sauvignon blackcurrant character is attenuated by a huge leather/cork character that evolves as it breathes. Very vinous, pretty dry, somewhat meaty and definitely leafy in its woody, �chewing on branches� character that dries out. Earthy in that fashion, it becomes more Merlot-like, plumy and fleshy. Slightly sweet at first contact, it boasts an infinite funk repertoire. Grapes and hay, blueberries and pie crust, nicely juicy, moisty and toasty. Just plenty of unexpected flavours that manage to work together in a basement/cobwebby yeast atmosphere. Strong carbonation, medium bodied, very soft astringency for what it is. Enormously unclean, like their kriek, but terribly fun to try in that fashion.
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;"Any first impressions? -A veil of head hangs on to the opaque pinkish-red. -Heavily corked aroma, with balsamic undercurrents and hiding hay. -Dirty earth generously spread over sweet black grapes. -Important carbonation enlivens the somewhat lazy mouthfeel. What if you dig deeper? -The sweet black grapiness develops, with time, into a long finish. -Dry earth and leather contribute healthily to that finale. -Some tartness within the fruitiness, but definitely not overdone. -Another dusty but tasty number from Uitzet, but I admit the dustiness feels exaggerated to me. Bottle; no date."
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;At Delirium Cafe, Brussels, Belgium - Thanks to Olivier (Olivier_MTL) and his friend for sharing. Virually no head on this beer. Clear, reddish brown body. Looks just like a fine red wine. Nose of leather, grapes, cherries, red and white wine, port, cask wood, ... really WOOOW! Just like one of my favorites of Cantillon: St. Lamvinus. Moderately acidic, lightly bitter initial flavour. Moderately acidic finish, averagily long. The flavour is a little bit weak. It is still quite sour, but a little bit softenned out. It is just like a (sweet) lambic with grapes added, but with not that many carbonation yet.
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;08.25.05 750ml bottle, corked and capped, undated. Dingy red pour looks quite a bit like a dusky beaujolais nouveaux or an organic cranberry juice. Only a tiny, sudsy head of large bubble at first, followed by an upwelling of fine, pink dense bubbles like a soda, and then all is quiet, still. Aroma is musty, mineral, sulfur, some grapey, jam-like sweetness, nothing at all beery. At first, the beer is plain, a bit sour, and very corky and astringent. As it warms a stronger vinous quality arises along with a more assertive tartness. Grape skins, astringent tannins, must, and a light and lasting vinous quality.
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;Beautiful red color with a small pink head that quickly dissipated. Vinous, grape and cherry aroma. Flavor reminded me of a mild homemade grape wine with just a touch of carbonation. Expected(and hoped for) a little more tartness. Was mildly impressed after the first couple of sips, but by the end of the bottle I really started to enjoy this. Nice dry finish.
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;75 cL bottle, (corked and capped): moist cork, but it slides out with only a minimal release of carbonation. Mostly headless, with a beautiful ruby body that practically sparkles. Musty, tart red grape aroma mixed tannins, limestone and hints of cherries. Extremely acidic on the tongue and especially in the back of the throat. Full fruit flavours with a bit of gueuze-like funk (which I like) and astringent grape skins. You know, this one was definitely too old (I would love to try a fresh one), but I think it held up pretty well, especially if you like funky beers with a fruity tinge.
Uitzet Druivenbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;"Absolutely gorgeous deep-red colour; head pinkish, gone in secs. Fruit nose: is it cherry, is it grape, is it anything else? Vinous anyway, bit of tobacco as well. Grape juice with the sugars removed, fruit acids - without the tannines from the kernels - dominate the taste. Great, but somewhere I preferred their former grapes (I�m told they changed) - the preferences of the rich. Bit of cork, earthy as well. Medium bodied, acidburn, fruitesters, dry. Impressive any way to look at it."

De Proef Flemish Primitive;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle in Seattle. Soft head, a touch of yeast haze on a light orange body. Yeast and apples on nose. Sip is a bit flat and muted, peppery apples and a bit of tripel-like ester. Some honey flavored dustiness. I suppose this might be old, no real hops coming through. Any Brett is highly muted.
De Proef Flemish Primitive;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;De Proefbrouwerij;"Pours a golden with a white head. The aroma is of sugars and fruity esters; there is an intense blend of tropical fruit. The taste is fruity and yeast. Later, this finish becomes more dry and bitter with a hint of grapefruit and hops. The taste also becomes more complex; a yeasty flavor takes over as well as hops that balance the sweet tone."

Smells medicinal, fruity, and yeasty. Tastes medicinal, too. Brett and a little bit of sweetness that turns medicinal. Super high carbonation. Takes a while to swirl out the carbonation. Medium body.

Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;Kolsch??? Not even close. This tastes like a wheat beer. It is slightly hazy gold, it has some body, it has lemony, peppery, and yeasty tastes. This is a wheat beer, regardless of the grainbill. Kolsch is in a different time zone.
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;12 oz. can purchased as K�lsch Style Ale poured to a fest chalice at home displaying a clear & bright, golden tone, with a decent layer of soft white/light cream colored froth that remained for awhile, and waves to spots of lacing. The nose was soft grain/biscuit-like malt, with a touch of sweetness, and subtle fruitiness as a combination of pit variety & apple. Light to medium bodied, with lively enough carbonation, the taste was similar, clean & smooth, with slight tanginess that coupled with modest, grainy astringency. An enjoyable representation of one of my favorite session styles.
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;Was not a fan. Grainy accented with lemon-pepper. The color is a bright yet dense lemon-gold. Simple and balanced beer with a long finish, but too much of a yeast aftertaste for my liking.
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;3/14/19. 12oz bottle as Alaskan Kolsch on clearance for 99 cents at Family Beer & Liquor. Enjoyed from the bottle. Golden, I imagine. Malty aroma, dough, a spicy bite. Clean flavor, dough, pale maltiness, crisp, a touch of citrus, grass, spice. Not bad.
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;On tap at Tattooed Dog as Alaskan Kolsch. It poured a golden color with a white head. The aroma was of grains, pale malts and herbal hops. The taste was similar to the aroma with more grains, malts, hops with mild carbonation and a nice smooth aftertaste. Tasty.
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;355ml can into schooner glass. Thanks to bitterlady. As Alaskan K�lsch. Golden amber beer with a thin white head and high carbonation. Lightly perfumed malt nose. Flat and easy to drink, touches of grain leading to a slightly sour/bitter finish. For better or worse, definitely a K�lsch!
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;Drank on an Alaskan Airlines: pours light orange with white head. Aroma is mold appleish fruitiness and pale malts. Low bitterness. Somewhat sweet. Thin malty backbone. Good enough.
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;Well I have recently enjoyed several bottles of this kolsch from an Alaskan Brewing mixed 12-pack that has traveled by car across the continent all the way down to South Carolina, thank you so much Megan! So for starters, this rendition of the lagered ale kolsch hybrid style tends much more towards the lager end of the spectrum, with an overall very clean and smooth lager flavor profile of bready malt and herbal hops, and no yeasty notes to speak of. On the nose, this was all malt, sweet and slightly caramelized, pleasant but not very delicate or aromatic. I should mention also that this poured a perfectly clear burnished gold with lots of carbonation and white foam. The flavor is more sweet malt and grain up front, however with a grassy and herbal hop aftertaste that gives an authentic German accent to this beer. The palate is a solid medium-bodied with a smooth finish that leaves a bit of residual sweetness from the malt. Overall this comes across as a very enjoyable and balanced golden lager, but doesn't appear to be particularly true to the kolsch style, as the maltiness is too sweet and has notes of caramel that are more reminiscent of a Marzen. There's nothing crisp and delicate about this beer either, but that being said, if it were more available down here in SC I would definitely drink this more often as a go-to casual lager.
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;In terms of no-frills refreshment, Alaskan Summer Ale is tough to beat. As a Kolsch this earns a close-enough verdict. It manages to be grainy and sweet without being cloying. Finish is pleasantly clean. That closer definitely could use some more happy flavor. Still, this is a reasonably crisp beer, and in terms of sheer drinkablity, it's on par with Alaskan Amber. Overall, it's simple and satisfying.
Alaskan Summer Ale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Alaskan Brewing Company;GNBF 2018, Werner Park. Bottle. Golden, white head. Aroma of dough, grass. Taste was light bittersweet, bread, light bitter finish.

Boulder Beer Brown Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Boulder Beer Company;"Nutty malt aroma. Slight mustiness...I really hope this bottle isn't too old! Fairly even, standard head and carbonation, but my suspicions about this being old have now increased...there are ""floaty things"" in the beer. I know this is supposed to be totally filtered. Well, here goes... Hmm. Sweet, bready malt flavors with a hint of nut and butter. Finish has a slight amount of hops and an almost imperceptible twinge of sour. Medium body, slightly watery finish. Ummm...I can't tell if this beer is supposed to taste like this or not, so I'm going to assume no. Oh well, maybe I can find a fresh bottle next time. At least I didn't buy a whole 6-pack!"

Tuzlanski Pilsner;Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivara Tuzla d.d.;"This ""pilsener"" has quite strange and unconvincing flavor, creating only a distant association with beer.

Everards Mild;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Mild Ale;Everards;First tasted this in Coanes, Johnstone in May 1997. Cask, handpump dispense. Black in colour with ruby highlights and a thick creamy buff head. Pleasant roast malt in the long aroma. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malts give a burnt toast note from the black malt and then roast grain flavours with treacle toffee, plain chocolate and creamy coffee. Slight prickle of hop resins in the short aftertaste. Finish is slightly dry with hints of liquorice and molasses in there. An excellent session mild.

Everards Mild;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Mild Ale;Everards;Keg at the Queen Victoria, Syston, Leicester. Very good Mild, my favourite so far. Creamy and slightly more opaque than my previous experiences with the style. Soft and smooth on the front of the palate, with a small burst of roasted malt to finish.

Steelhead Galapagos Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Utter garbage, a huge disappointment. I felt like I was licking an ashtray. Even the food was mediocre, overall I left the Steelhead premises feeling somewhat cheated... dark brown, a little light shining through, nice head, but it doesn't matter, can't get past the ashtray taste...
Steelhead Galapagos Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Black with brown head.Roasted nose. Good heavily roasted malt flavor........
Steelhead Galapagos Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Served on handpump. Attractive deep brown-black, with a slightly medicinal liquoricy bite that fades quickly. Leaving a beautiful flavorful stout with wonderful real ale mouthfeel. I realize that every brewer can't do handpump stouts, but they are infinitely better that those crappy nitro stouts. The mouthfeels of nitro and handpump are actually reasonably similar, I'd say that the handpump ones have larger bubbles, but they leave behind a beer which you can taste all the flavors that are there. The roasty malt, the hops, which I really enjoy. It just bugs me when brewers fo through the effort of making a flavorful stout, and then serve it on nitro tap and effectively rob it of most of its character. Sorry for the rant.

Russian River Damnation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Russian River Brewing;Cant believe I haven't ticked this yet, at least 5-6 bottles over the last 10 years or so. Cloudy golden with a small white head and decent lace. Notes are yeast, banana, rich malt, fruits, citrus, and other classic Belgian stuff. Medium in body with a complex close.
Russian River Damnation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Russian River Brewing;375ml bottle. 12/21/18 bottle date. Appearance: Cloudy light golden with a massive fluffy white head driven by aggressive secondary fermentation. Aroma: Grass, hay, and herbal hop notes. Some bready and cracker malt as well. Low yeast fruity esters. Taste: Bready maltiness is fairly light sweetness, a touch of pear and apple esters, and an herbal, earthy hop bitterness that builds strongly against the light malt base. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied. A surprisingly light creaminess given the light color. Really high carbonation. Finish: An interesting mix of light fruity esters against a fairly strong herbal hop bitterness. Nice contrast. Overall: a wonderful light Belgian pale ale, balancing the lightest touch of fruity esters against a fairly aggressive herbal and earthy bitterness. Beautiful head driven by a really high carbonation. Awesome beer.
Russian River Damnation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Russian River Brewing;Cork popped out as soon as I took the cage off (be careful people). Highly carbonated hazy yellow with a huge growing, rocky head. Took 4 separate pours and a lot of waiting to get it in a large Duvel tulip. Moderate esters on the aroma with mellow bubblegum, pear, and mild phenolic spices. The flavor is much like the aroma, with added pineapple notes that start sweet, then finish with a well balanced bitterness and dryness. No real trace of alcohol. Well done.
Russian River Damnation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Russian River Brewing;(375ml bottle shared @ Nische's tasting, thanks Niko!) Pours rather hazy pale gold with a decent sized white head. Notes of rather sweet fruit, with banana, orange, mixed tree fruit all in there, rather floral (fresh and dried), some sweet pale malt with cereal hints, some herbs, touch of clove, yeast has a bready sparkling wine quality and is slightly dusty, finishing quite dry with orange and grass, slight zestiness, a little dry earth in the back end too, light bitterness. Medium-bodied with mouth-filling effervescence. Quite nicely brewed blonde Belgian type thing, rather delicate and perhaps blown out late in a big tasting. Refreshing.
Russian River Damnation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Russian River Brewing;Taste at Trail's End. Pours a clear, golden color, with a big, frothy, white head. The aroma is guava, mild earth, rosemary, leather, roses, and caramel. Sweet and yeasty, with a mellow, dusty bitterness. Light body, with a creamy, dusty mouthfeel. This is a nicely balanced, complex, and delicious beer.
Russian River Damnation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Russian River Brewing;July 27th, 2015 - The marathon plowing through the Russian River approaches an end with the Damnnation. A brighter beer with a brighter scent, it has some lemon juice on the nose and a touch of champagne and orange juice. So, maybe a mimosa on the scent? The flavor reminds me of a bright blonde, with gentle grain notes offering glimmers of orange citrus. It's tasty, but light, and inconveniently placed near the end of the race.

Farsons Strong Ale;Mriehel, Malta;Strong Ale - English;Simonds Farsons Cisk;Sampled draught at The Scotsman, St. Julians, Malta. Dark copper, no head. Medium sweet and near full bodied with rather thick mouthfeel. A big resiny hopppiness is lingering on until the bitter grapefruity finish. It is chewy and robust but perhaps not overly complex. Sadly this beer is no longer bottled and only available draught at a handful of places in Malta. Old rating for the now discontinued bottled version: Nut brown. Flowery hop aroma. Full bodied, fruity, very malty with some crystal malt flavours. Bitter finish. Not exactly what you expect to come out of a sunny tiny island nation, but surely a very pleasant surprise.

Marthas Weathertop Doppelbock;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;My wife and I stopped by, at the source. This is a very relaxing, full-bodied beer that has both flavor and a kick. It's got the doppelbock sweetness, but does it with a lot of flavor and complexity.
Marthas Weathertop Doppelbock;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;This is an excellent beer. It has a great appearance, very dark and interesting. It also tastes great, which is a good combination. I like a tasty beer and this one does the trick. Come down to Nashua and try one.

Dark brown color with lots of ruby highlights. Aromas are ripe dark fruit, bread, and caramel. Soft carbonation with a sweet mouthfeel. Taste of malt, dark fruits, light roasted grains and a hint of toffee afterwards. This batch weighed in at 8.8 % ABV. And honestly only a very little hints of it on the backend. Very nice and worth a try.

Redruth 1793 Stout;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Stout;Redruth;Canned. Worse stout I have ever had. But this is the best product I've had from what appears to be Britain's worse brewery. Cheap and nasty seems to be the brewing theory here. Calling this a mild might prevent people from becoming too shocked at the thin texture and low flavour profile, but that would be doing mild a disservice.
Redruth 1793 Stout;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Stout;Redruth;Can bought in Hong Kong at a Park N' Shop. How a beer like this ends up in Hong Kong is beyond me. Solid black but basically no head after the pour. Minimal aroma. Weak and watery flavor with some roasted malt. Maybe I found it because it is an Asian lager equivalent of a stout.
Redruth 1793 Stout;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Stout;Redruth;This stuff tasted bad. What else can be said. Now, I don't know whether it was because I had two nice beers before tasting it, and the other alcohol may have screwed up my taste buds, but I rather doubt it, especially since I also had a nice one afterward. The strangest thing was how it tasted more like a 10% Faxe or Crest and not like a 4.2% stout! I just tasted alcohol and little else. And, unless the ratings for it suddenly move upward, I have no interest in trying another to confirm my thoughts on it.
Redruth 1793 Stout;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Stout;Redruth;Awful stuff. Ultra-sweet, thin, bland. Not sure you could even call this a stout.
Copper Tank Black Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;RE-RATE: I must have had a pint from a bad batch the first time, I've come back and had this several times since and enjoyed it. Perfect with their pub grub. Original rating 3/28/02: 2.4. Pretty weak, I only called it a stout because they didn't have anything specifically called a stout and it's like, a law that all micros must have a stout in their rotation. The roasted barley in the flavor was surprisingly nice, even though I don't have much else good to say about this beer. Not such a great smell, bad aftertaste, and it looked pretty poor for a stout.

Breckenridge Pandoras Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Location: 12 oz bottle from Giannone, 11/10/13 Aroma: The aroma is fairly sweet, caramel, brown sugar, some molasses, and earth Appearance: It pours a dark reddish color with a long last beige head and lots of lace Flavor: The flavor is medium-heavy sweet, quite malty, a little roasty, and a very mild hop Palate: The body is light-medium, feels a touch watery and a little cloying, with a short finish Overall Impression: It�s a little thin and a little too sweet overall. Not terrible, just not a well-rounded offering. Lacks balance.
Breckenridge Pandoras Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);One of the better breckenridge beers. Decent balance. More watery than I would prefer.

Ohlssons Lager;Sandton, South Africa;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);This is the best tasting beer SAB�s ever made. Unfortunately, very bad marketing and very good marketing by it�s competitors brought an end to this magnificent golden nectar.
Ohlssons Lager;Sandton, South Africa;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);"One of several African beers brought back by the generous pfoxyjohn. When I opened this beer and poured it�s crystal clear golden body into a glass, the smell reminded me of every country i�ve ever been to that has had that similar tasting pale lager which is advertised all over the whole country. When you�re there, it�s not about the beer. It�s about the experience and the beer just happens to be a small part of it. Corn, hops and grain on the palate. Slightly watery finish. I wasn�t anticipating a world class beer, but i was looking forward to another country�s proud offering. Thanks John!"""
Ohlssons Lager;Sandton, South Africa;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);Smells of alcohol, corn starch, some grain, and a bit of unwashed male buttocks &#40I should know after travelling through Africa for a month!&#41. It has a very faint yellow colour and not much head at all. Flavour is some slightly sorry grain notes, breadiness, and a little hint of alcohol. This is a weak excuse for a beer and definitely nothing special.

Malzige, getreidige, s�uerliche und fruchtige Noten (in dieser Reihenfolge) sind ebenfalls vorhanden und f�gen sich harmonisch ins Gesamtbild. Einen echten Kritikpunkt gibt es: Viel zu viel Kohlens�ure. Das passt gut zu hellen, fruchtigen Bieren. Bei einem dunklen, malzigen und (in besonderen Ma�en) rauchigen Bier ist dies aber meistens recht unpassend. Hier darf es gern weicher sein.

It's a watery sugary drink, which doesn't resemble any beer taste. I really thought I opened a radler by mistake. Will give it another chance as I don't think anyone intended it to be so bad. But still giving it half a star as this batch shouldn't have passed the quality control.

Typhoon Golden Ale;New York, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap - Typhoon bar - Dull golden colour with a noticeable vegetable (cabbage?) aroma. The taste isn't as bad as the smell, but is still not a particularly good experience and is a bit tart. This beer was served far too cold for me, and put me off trying any of their other beers.
Typhoon Golden Ale;New York, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;Clear yellow color, little head. Aroma of grape and insecticides. Flavor brings in some dirty notes. Later it hits more and more like a dull American lager, but it at least has aspired to greater things and thus has achieved a slight measure more.

Typhoon Golden Ale;New York, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;A bit crisp and perhaps citric. Hops are noticeable but not prominent. The bartendender told me this is their biggest seller!? Why? Perhaps because it''s the closest thing they have to Bud.

Typhoon Winter Wheat;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;"Although the beer menu lists this merely as ""wheat"", I'm told by the manager that it's the Winter Wheat. Not sure I believe them since my rating will differ significantly from the others. This beer is extremely wheaty with a strong Belgian angle. You can taste what appears to be Belgian yeast along with a German hefe flavor. Odd, but I'd drink another. It was also warm when I got it. Could the beer be infected?"
Typhoon Winter Wheat;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;An unusual wheat. Marzen colored and clear. Good body and nicely hopped. Doesn''t look much like wheat. Nutty.
Typhoon Winter Wheat;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;Slightly hazy light orange. Lightly frothy white head. Moderate carbonation.

Typhoon Righteous Red;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;Ahhh, a terrific red ale. Fairly sweet and red like the setting Autumn sun. Extremely mind and lightly carbonated. Terrific. This is their best brew, IMHO!
Typhoon Righteous Red;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;Deep reddish/dark amber with a fat creamy off white head. Malty aroma laced with earthy hops. Too winey, not much hop balance. Very strange fruity flavor, after a promising start. Sampled after the excellent Thai food was devoured (not too spicy though) which may have skewed the flavor profile. Still, a weird mix of flavors.

Randalls Clameur de Haro;St Peter Port, Guernsey;Mild Ale;Randalls Brewery;Brown-red. Light bodied. Oily with coffee aroma, amd all kinds of other strange flavours. A strange brew...
Randalls Clameur de Haro;St Peter Port, Guernsey;Mild Ale;Randalls Brewery;Another funny little mild from the Channel Islands, like the Mary Ann Brown from Jersey. The aroma, slighlty metallic, shows some dark fruits. The character is very rustic - yeasty, with plums and raisins, and a sourish, vinuous finish. This would have its ass handed to it at any brewing competition, but in the manner of Bavaria Svetloe from St. Petersburg, it's the flaws that make it an interesting beer to drink.
Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;Guess the only guy, hailing right from Kalyani, where it all started, right from the time of my golden youth, the beer that we drink whilst alone, with a cigarette. Its Golden, frothy, sweet, amazing aftertaste, 6.6% OH, 90 bucks and a great feeling.!
Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;Golden lager with absolutely no flavor. Roughly foaming with good taste of malt and hops. Lovely German-style lager. Absolutely type really. No distractions and it stays in length a little too monotonous.
Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;From notes. First reviewed 1/29/2009. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: Pours a golden straw yellow, with a small head that fades quickly. A fair amount of carbonation is visible. A rather odd smell. Soapy, metallic, a little bit sweet (adjunct sweetness, but still sweet), and ethynol. Pretty bad. Wow, this has to be one of the worst five beers I have ever had. There is some light corn sweetness in at the beginning, but the other flavors that come in are almost poison: aluminum, soap, and ethyl alcohol. It almost tastes like this beer was made, but then after brewing they put in all of these additives. Awful. It�s light and fizzy, which normally would be a slightly higher ranking, but the additives just bring it down another level. I could not finish this. I had the 650 ml bottle, and I needed to get rid of the last third. My head literally started to throb before I finished half of the bottle.
Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;Bottled. A golden beer with an off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty combined with a skunky note - that could stem from the clear bottle and light.

Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;(Bottle 65 cl) Courtesy of madsberg. Pours a clear golden with a rough white head. A little aroma hops in the nose and something resembling chicory that for some reason I often detect in cheap ass Lagers. Medium body with sweet malts and not to forget loads of brewing cereal - rice I suppose. A somewhat chemical edge with some cardboard as well. Subdued bitterness. 201008
Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager Beer. Bottle. [Tasting @ Papsoe 20-10-2008] Small bubbly white head that mostly diminished. Spare display of lacework. Clear yellow color. Aroma of fresh grass, mild floral, hint of hay and corn like. Over the palate came distinctive metallic, corn and rice like in the feel. Almost chemical like. Light to medium bodied with a sparkling carbonation and mild dry texture. Light bitter and sweet flavor. Light bitter dry finish.
Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;Bottle bought in Ooty in Tamil Nadu. Golden coloured. Clear. Dense off white head. Lots of carbonation. Hay and grains in the aroma. Quite distinct. Flavour is a bit citric and dry and has grainy notes. Hay again. Is quite thin bodied and is dry. Ends on a very light bitter note, but sweetness is the dominant factor. Hmmm. Still have to stick to my Kingfisher I guess.
Kalyani Black Label Premium Lager;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;SO far our favorite beer available in Delhi. Lacks the bitter aftertaste of just about every other beer available here. It�s a much better flavor for real beer drinkers than Haywards 500, a malt liquor of the worst order. It�s still kinda sad that this is the product of the same brewery that makes Newcastle. I�d kill for a Newcastle here in Delhi, but I�ll drink this for now. If you are here, look for Black Label before the other high octane liquors

Bos Shenanigan Stout;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Bos Brewery and Bistro;On tap at the brewpub on 4/27/06: Pours an opaque black with a dense, pillowy nitro tan head. Lightly sweet and roasty dark chocolate aroma. Body starts with a nice dark caramel sweetness balanced with a good touch of bittering hops. Finishes drier, roasty, and dark chocolatey. A good stout.
Bos Shenanigan Stout;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Draft @ Bo�s: Nitro pour. Very dark brown color with a tan head and cascade. Close to opaque.

Bos Shenanigan Stout;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Bos Brewery and Bistro;"On tap: Nice mocha aroma with light coffee. Rather malty aroma. Dark brown, virtually black with a tan head. Nice lacing. Malty chocolate up front with roasted coffee coming in the finish. Expected the house sour taste but didn�t get one. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Best of their ""everyday"" beers."
Bos Shenanigan Stout;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Draft @ brewpub. Maybe this place doesn�t do enough volume to brew a beer like this. This stuff tasted too much like butterscoth. Maybe the lines are bad. I just hope this isn�t what it�s supposed to be. Some chocolate and coffee flavors but something is off, sour.
Bos Shenanigan Stout;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Bos Brewery and Bistro;Hmm, looks like a little Guinness with a solid creamy head. If you put your nose real close to that head you can get a faint whiff of roasted barley, so faint that no roastiness shows up in the flavour profile. Instead you get cherries and bark (don't tell me you've never chewed on green bark?). needs some balance desperately, either from hops or roasty-bitterness.
Bos Spring Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bos Brewery and Bistro;"I was last at Bo's during the fall and then the seasonal fest, their ""anniversary"" saison, and a fine porter rocked my world. This time I was disappointed, particularly by this seasonal which is hard and cidery as all get out with bitter hop edges that don't seem to belong."

Bandersnatch Big Horn Premium Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bandersnatch Brew Pub;"Had this on tap while celebrating at the converted �Varsity Club� prior to the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe - GO BUCKS!! It was nice having access to the �Real Bar� in the back while nearly everyone else was drinking the AB canned shit in the rear; and was probably 99% of the reason I ended up totally tanked that night. Refreshing nose of warm spices and flowers. This brew is brown with a creamy off white head that is mostly diminishing. The flavor is sour and bitter with a long bitter finish and a moderate to heavy level of acidity. The medium body is dry and feels very astringent at the finish. This was the best of the Bandersnatch�s brews that I sampled."
Bandersnatch Big Horn Premium Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bandersnatch Brew Pub;Amber in color, nice frothy white head and sheets of lace.

Strong roasted aroma. Choclatey flavors intermingled with a hint of coffee. The twist at the end is a pretty big blast of hops. Not usually a fan of hops, But this was acceptable, even enjoyable.

Grapes, elderberry, wild honey, grains, ginger ale, citrus, floral and resin tones. Very slight bitterness, light to medium sweetness, light sourness.

Mandalay Lager;Mandalay, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mandalay Brewery;Yellow beer with big bubbles. Minimal head. Smells grainy, maybe some sour apple. Medium body...for the world�s most feeble-bodied beer style. Grainy taste with low bitterness, but more than Myanmar Beer thank god.
Mandalay Lager;Mandalay, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mandalay Brewery;660ml bottle in Bagan, Myanmar. Pours a clear amber gold with a thin white head. Aroma: Caramel malt and earthy aroma. Taste: Malts dominate. Mild caramel/brown sugar flavour from the malts. Mild corn/corn syrup flavour. Mild sweetness. Mildly bitter. Moderate carbonation. Not overly flavoursome, but pretty easy drinking. Probably was my favourite of the beers available in Myanmar.
Mandalay Lager;Mandalay, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mandalay Brewery;Straight from the bottle. Typical sweetness with low hops, some corniness. You�d think there�d be a taste for bitter beers here as there�s more bitterness in the food than most cuisines... probably some law on beer bitterness to protect a general�s business interests. I do prefer this over Myanmar beer.
Mandalay Lager;Mandalay, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mandalay Brewery;"Tasted 30/12/2016. Bottle in Mandalay. BB 04082017.

Mandalay Lager;Mandalay, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mandalay Brewery;Had this in a hotel room in Bagan. I am sorry to say this is the most horrible beer I�ve had in a while...skynku, off tastes and alcohol. Uek
Mandalay Lager;Mandalay, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mandalay Brewery;I�m a touring bicyclist and inveterate beer drinker, so wherever I travel, I will drink the local brews. Occasionally, I�ll be more than happy to do so, but on the other hand it is a bit of a chore to get a few down and renew my energy after a hot sweaty day in the tropics. Mandalay proved to be such a chore. I mean, these SEAsian countries don�t grow barley OR hops, and they are often poor countries to boot... so how to produce beer from other agricultural products at a price impoverished peasants can afford? You get the idea, crap in, crap out, thus Mandalay lager.
Blimp City Black Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Blimp City Brewery;Do you love toasted malt? You WOULD have liked this. Interesting combination of coffee/chocolate without the thickness of a stout. Unfortunate end to a brewery willing to blaze some uncommon trails.

Blimp City Black Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Blimp City Brewery;"On draught at the Geisen Haus in Canton, OH. The server was unaware that Blimp City has gone out of business. This is under the label of ""house dark"" but it is definitely the Black Ale. Pours a flat black color with a thin light beige head. Mild carbonation is apparent. Aroma of malt with some caramel. Flavor has a lightly fizzy feel and tastes of malt, coffee, and caramel. Finish is thin and sweet with a touch of chocolate. Not outstanding but still a shame to see it go."
Blimp City Black Ale;Brimfield, Ohio, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Blimp City Brewery;The aroma was malty sweet...definite chocolate and coffee throughout. The flavor was even fuller, with sweetness all around. My only complaint is that it does seem a little thin. Great brew!

In fact, strongly grainy to bready, with some indistinct banana/cream esters. In mouth, similar, with the typical Belgian yeasty bread flavour, but with a weak and metallic finish.

Caledonian Porter;Edinburgh, Scotland;Porter;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);First tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 1986. Cask, handpump dispense. Black in colour with ruby highlights. Creamy white head. Strong aroma of roast grain and vinous fruit. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malt complex gives a maltloaf base of sultanas, figs and maple syrup. Bitter hop resins add some dryness to the short aftertaste. The smooth finish is dry with hints of leather, liquorice and walnut. An excellent session porter.
Caledonian Porter;Edinburgh, Scotland;Porter;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask conditoned - gravity dispense - Peterborough BF. A black coloured porter. The aroma is slightly fudgy, and is on the sweet side with a dusting of chocolate. The taste is also a little chocolatey with some whiskey character. Also some grass late on.

Aston Manor Smooth Chocolate Ale;Birmingham, West Midlands, England;Brown Ale;Aston Manor (Eclor-Agrial);For some reason I didn't think that I would like this but I was pleasantly surprised.

Ventnor Admirals Ale;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Bottle at Tom�s Tasting, April 2009. Amber colour. Disappearing head. Poor grainy and papery aroma.

Ventnor Admirals Ale;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;A Mes rate: bottle at The Cadster�s Spotify tasting. Decent rich amber colour. Head vanished as quick as it formed. Rather raw and yeasty and seems a little underbrewed or something. Off fruity notes do it no favours either. Other than that it�s reasonable. Sorry crap rate.

Allg�uer Blues Lager;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allg�uer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Aroma is a sweet malt scent. Color is a hazy gold with low carbonation and almost no head. Taste is flat and sweet. Starting with a thin body it goes down with a flat feel. Finish comes in with a sweet German malt taste then fads out bland. This is a flat, bland, disappointment of a brew. I don�t think I will ever try another one of there beers.
Allg�uer Blues Lager;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allg�uer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Blech, not a very good German lager, very lackluster in all categories. Light hazy straw yellow in color. It�s like they took an average german lager and watered it down with dirty water or something. Almost non-existant head. Take Coors Light and add a hint of German Lager and you have this beer. The bottle is pretty cool looking though (the glass for the bottle is cobalt blue) which is what made me buy this cuz it stuck out (and it�s cheap) but i�ll definitely never purchase this one again.

Decent nose, with notes of apples and lemons. Soft and chewy mouthfeel with a nice carbonation level. Malts were a little doughy, with a pinch of yeast mixed in. Mild lemon flavors. Hops were mild (herbs, grass) and only lightly bitter, but they dried out the mouth quite a bit. Drinkable, but not really exciting.
Allg�uer Blues Lager;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allg�uer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Cool looking blue bottle. THat is about all that is good though. Paper thin head. Pale golden, slightly hazy appearance. Aroma is slight hops and rubber. Has a bit of hops up front in the flavor, and a bit of malt, but overall it isn't that great.

If I had the choice between drinking this beer again and getting genital herpes, I would opt for genital herpes. Man, this is Germany''s answer to Budweiser, only I would rather drink Bud.
Allg�uer Blues Lager;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allg�uer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Quite possibly the worst beer I''ve ever had. It is dry, flavorless and smells like strange carcinogenic polymers. I won''t be trying this again. Definetly down the drain.
Allg�uer Blues Lager;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allg�uer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Maybe a smidge maltier and more flavorful than Allgauer's Bayrisch Hell, but not much. A beer brewed for a Jazz festival needn't be complex to succeed. The music lends plenty of complexity.

Pale lemon yellow colour; Half finger head and residual soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Fair sticky lacing with very slight carbonation; Pungent smell of lager malt, with slightly choking floral, grains, strong molasses, thick bread, yeast, light lemon and grass; Close to medium sweet taste of lager malt, with light grains, floral, light molasses, strong bread, biscuits, yeast, strong lemon, strong bitter hops and grass; Close to light body. Thin, dry and fairly crisp palate; Mouth feel is pretty malty, more lager than a Pils, in a pretty thin and dry background. Strong floral, fairly grainy, very biscuity. Neat sweetness to balance the very lemony hops. Pretty nice!... Hoppiness is floral, lemon and grass in nose, and a lot stronger in taste. Bitterness is strong , dynamic and tasty for a lasting, fairly high astringent sweet bitter finish; Dry after taste, Crisp and quite bitter to mouth. Comments: This one feels like somewhere between a Premium Lager and a Pilsener, due to its rather light body and thin palate, but make no mistake it has a malty and rather wholesome backbone, and being topped with a lively hoppiness. A good one among the average German Pils, easy and drinkable."

Adnams Nut Brown Ale;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Brown Ale;Adnams;16th Oct 2018. 3rd of a pint in my local Wetherspoon (William Withering, Wellington Shropshire). Looked fine, red hue to the autumnal amber body, off-white topping. I found the aroma and taste a little strange, slightly bitter and 'off tasting' with a cobweb or two. A light nutty undertone maybe, but a beer not to my liking.
Adnams Nut Brown Ale;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Brown Ale;Adnams;Deep amber with a thin off-white head. Tastes oddly old-fashioned. Nut and caramel with a restrained bitterness and some autumn leaves. A little coffee in the aftertaste. Yeah, that's about it. Ok, but leaves my socks firmly on my feet. Quite a satisfying drink though, bonus mark for that.

Wolters Schwarzer Herzog;Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hofbrauhaus Wolters;16oz can from Crescent Liquor, Bowie. Brown-black body. Respectable enough steady beige head. Rather straightforward dark lager, medium bodied, mellow brown chocolate tones, caramel. A little bit sugary, but that is suitable for the style. A pinch this as well, more of a cheap street drinking beer than a luscious deep example of the style, but sill a whole lot more refreshing than most US examples. OK.
Wolters Schwarzer Herzog;Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hofbrauhaus Wolters;Pretty good, somewhat true to style. Straddles between boring dunkel and exciting schwarzbier. A bit of sweetness, some dryness, some smoke. Not crisp enough to be a true winner.
Wolters Schwarzer Herzog;Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hofbrauhaus Wolters;Roasted barley, hops in aroma. Dark color without head. Roasted barley, burnt crust of bread, a bit bitter in finish. Light body, medium carbonation.
Wolters Schwarzer Herzog;Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hofbrauhaus Wolters;Wolter's Black Beer has a thick, beige head, a bubbly, chocolate-brown appearance, and some glass lacing. The aroma is a dull brown bread, but the flavor is of rich, sweet chocolate, some coffee, and dark brown bread crust. No apparent bitterness, here. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Wolter's Black Beer finishes medium crisp. RJT
Wolters Schwarzer Herzog;Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hofbrauhaus Wolters;can - Very dark brown pour with a small tan head. The mild aroma has some chocolate malt. The flavor is on the sweet side with chocolate, somewhat bready malt and minimal hops bitterness. Thin. Rather bland. It's halfway decent but underwhelming.

Bardo White Lightnin;Amissville, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);Thanks to Travlr! At the (new) brewery. Grapes on the nose, but similar in smell to riesling grapes before being turned into wine. Very sweet with tiny bubbles. Great thick beige head. Alcohol is very hidden.

Bardo White Lightnin;Amissville, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);Much blacker than the typical barley wine. Nice aroma but not quite as strong as you might expect. The high-alcohol content is masked well by the hops and malt. Finish is strong and bitter.

Casco Bay Salty Petes Peg Leg Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Casco Bay Brewing;"Bottled. Amber-orange hue with just a hint of pink; medium frothy head. Nose sweeter and maltier than most Pales, but with some floweriness and orange as well; very nice. Flavor is very rich and full; hard to believe this comes from the same people who put out that thin, weak Pils I had last week. Not enough hops, really; tastes a little flat through the middle, but some good bitterness emerges at the end. A very nice effort on the whole."
Casco Bay Salty Petes Peg Leg Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Casco Bay Brewing;Flavorful pale ale. It's not the best one out there, but the flavors, are complex and intriguing

Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);This beer is both not that good and excellent. Not terribly interesting and some flat flavors, yet at the same time it has a nice sweetish flavor. But it is so so drinkable. It is one of those I�m not sure I like this but I love drinking it kind of beers if that makes any sense. Serving: Bottle
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Bronze and clear. Pleasant aroma and slightly nutty flavour. Some bitterness with a bit of maltiness. Quite a reasonable brown ale despite being brewed by Scotish Corage.
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Pours a nice clear copper/brown, about an inch of head. The head dies back to less than a quarter inch. Minimal lacing. Bready aroma is nice, but not much else going on. Sweet malty taste, a little bready, a little molasses. But mainly just sweet. A little too sweet for me. Very little hop presence. Thinner body than I expected, and a not-quite but almost medium level of carbonation.
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottled, pasteurised, 500ml. Chestnut coloured with short lasting head. Thinnish slightly sweet beer with a medicinal, pine type background, a little like a cleaning product. The flavour turns a little nutty through warming, but nothing too pleasant. I�m never sure what the Geordies see in these Brown Ales, not for me.
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Weak, thin, pallid, and altogether unimpressive. Or maybe, just maybe, Browns don�t speak my language!
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);"(Northumbrian) ""Medium"" brown colored beer with an average head. Smokiness abounds: from aromas to flavor... similar to a recently-doused campfire, but tastier... and a little less dangerous. ""Wet"" mouthfeel with a slightly sour aftertaste. Thanks to Ben, as this was in his fridge when I was house-sitting."
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottle (part of a Federation selection pack). Amber red. Malty aromas with banana skins and raisins. Sweet caramel but thin without complexity. Drinkable but as with other Federation products I have tried a sharp contrast between aromas and insipid taste.
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);nice packaging and a pretty pour the color of real maple syrup, though very clear. an aggressive decanting would produce only a svelte little head, the color of sliced banana. aroma is red plum, mars bar, almond taffy-- and also strangely like a page of glossy printing, a magazine cover perhaps. all of that is the easy part because taking a sip is about as rewarding as dropping the bottle on your bare foot. i believe i emitted an involuntary shriek or something because my dog looked up suddenly in alarm. YOW! the beer is recklessly sweet --without a license, cause or mitigating circumstance. it�s literally sugary-- cream soda, dull praline, call it what you will-- but my first �crying game� impulse was to backhand the beer for it�s deceit. even so, i drank it all-- in slightly diminishing disdain-- and to it�s credit some grapefruit tones emerged to suggest a nod of balancing hops. but too little, too late. it finished watery and still disturbingly sweet-- way too much akin to a soft drink.
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);"""Northumbrian"" in the 11.2 oz. bottle - This poured a nutty brown with reddish highlights, sporting a modest white head that soon ""haloed� the glass. It�s got a mild, caramel aroma and tastes pretty much as it smells. Finishes on a slightly tart, crisp note. Not a bad brown, but not very exciting, either. Foremost Liquors, Oak Forest, IL"
Federation High Level (Northumbrian) Brown Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Brown Ale;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);"Dark amber/ brown in color, clear, creamy tan generous head. Aroma: metallic, piney, medicinal, with a hint of nuts and butter. Light body, thin palate, sickly twang in the finish. I guess this could stand in as an inoffensive ""session ale"", except that I can�t imagine why you would want more than one of these sorry bastards. It�s an 18.6oz. bottle, and I�m bored less than 1/2 way through. That�s the point, though, something to slug down in between turns at darts. At the end of the bottle, those initial off-flavors had disappeared and the beer became more mellow, the finish more pleasant, and I didn�t hate it quite as much. Didn�t like it any better, though."
New Glarus Home Town Blonde;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours a clear golden color and topped by a bubbling off white head of foam that settles quickly to a thin film. The aroma shows notes of lemon citrus, crackers, toasted bread, and peppery spice to go with some floral notes of grass and straw that pairs up with the pale malts, earthy hops and lager yeast. The flavor follows and is nice and crisp with the lemon citrus, crackers, toasted bread and peppery spice up front and followed by the earthy, yeast notes, pale malts, and the grassy, floral hop bitterness on the back end. Medium bodied with ample carbonation that leads to a clean, crisp, and dry finish with some lingering hop bitterness on the backend. Really well done pilsener and another great German style beer from the master himself, Dan Carey.
New Glarus Home Town Blonde;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle, thanks to shrubber85, golden yellow in color, hazy soap ring foam, fruity nose, flavor of bubblegum, bready yeast, cocktail syrup, good finish

New Glarus Home Town Blonde;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;Golden yellow, transparent, with a thin white head. Complex noble hop aroma. Nice Pilsner malt on the palate with a noble hop backing. Great beer.
New Glarus Home Town Blonde;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 8/12/2014. Pours fairly clear bright golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, bread, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly dry finish, but not overly dry. Very clean on lager flavors with minimal yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is an excellent German pilsener style. All around great robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth, crisp, and clean to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
New Glarus Home Town Blonde;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;3/8/15. 12oz bottle thanks to my in-laws! Golden pour with a nice off-white head, good lacing. Doughy aroma, grassy, citrus. Nice flavor, doughy pale malts, citrus, grassy. Tasty.
New Glarus Home Town Blonde;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle. Light lemon, barley malt and hay aroma. Golden yellow with giant white head. Tangy sweet lemon, barley malt and mildly bitter grass hops flavor. Nice body.
New Glarus Home Town Blonde;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Pilsner glass. Brew smells grassy, a little citrusy, with plenty of hop aroma present. Brew has a full, yellow color with just a little bit of haziness and rendered a white 1-inch head made up of fine bubbles--looks quite lush. Taste is grassy and citrusy at the beginning of the sip. The middle of the sip revealed that the brew has a pretty full malt profile and some floral notes! Then you�re left with that perfect bitter and crisp finish. For a Pilsner, the body of the beer is quite ample, but still very refreshing. The mouthfeel has that nice bite of carbonation that doesn�t stick with you too long so you can actually taste the beer. I�ve tasted a few really good pilsners before, but this one tops my personal list. What a great brew! ""Never turn your back on your beer."""
New Glarus Home Town Blonde;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;12 oz bottle pours golden with a white head. Aroma of malts, pine and grain. Taste is sweet malts and grain. Just a hint of bitterness.

Clear garnet color with a thin head. Pumpkin pie spicy aromas with malty grainy pie crust. Medium body with light carbonation. Nice caramel toffee sweet flavors with still strong spicy pumpkin and clove same as the aroma. No trace of oxidation. After nearly eight years in a bottle this brews flavors are as strong or more so than many aged Anchor OSA�s....wow, very nice Christmas treat in July.
Orchard Street Jingle Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Orchard Street Brewery;This one has aged a bit and the spice has stood up very strong. Pours a dark mahogany with a tall off-white head. Aroma of pure ginger bread sweet with a touch of fruitbread in the nose. Taste is very thin and light bodied with much less spice than the nose let on. A bit of an herbal hop finish with still a lot of bitterness trailing behind. I thought the bitterness might have died down a bit in the older age and it may have gained a bit of body, but i was wrong.

Orchard Street Jingle Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Orchard Street Brewery;I'm not much of a fan of this brewery but since I love winter beers I thought I'd give this a shot. I sure wish they'd have advertised this as a Ginger beer as I might have liked it better. I was caught completely off-guard with all the ginger considering I was expecting something a little more along the lines of Jubelale. I gotta be in the mood for ginger and I wasn't as I tried it. Even so, this beer is average at best. If you like ginger beer you might like this, but there's far better out there. Okay, this is an average brown beer with quite a bit of ginger and very little body.
Orchard Street Jingle Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Orchard Street Brewery;Like ginger? Then I think you'll like this beer, since that's pretty much what's going on. I could not drink more than 12 oz of this, although the ginger and spice flavor is pretty well balanced with the rest of the beer. Interesting to say the least.
Orchard Street Jingle Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Orchard Street Brewery;"Aroma features malt, cloves and cinnamon---smells like the Holidays...Color is a rich brown with medium beige head and copious honeycomb lace...This brewery's sigature caramel malt profile is in evidence here, but in light measure...Mild hops and a sprinkling of spices buoy the top-end and linger through the lightly dry finish...Carbonation is suitably light...Body is medium-light---a little too light for a winter warmer...Flavors are spritely and pleasant, but again lack a measure of desired ""oomph."" Overall, a wonderful appearance and aroma highlight this offering, but the main body of work proves disappointing in comparison to the hopeful prelude."
Orchard Street Jingle Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Orchard Street Brewery;"This beer has continuously won the Xmas beer tasting at my annual holiday tasting. However, the 2002 version had very little spiciness/aroma compared to previous years. It is almost like the beer was ""dumbed down"" to make it more appealing to the masses. Great tastes of Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Allspice make this a holiday standard."
Orchard Street Jingle Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Orchard Street Brewery;This was an interesting beer, decent looking amber in color but really funky flavor. Un-identifiable really. It was okay, not at all one I would get again, and I had an odd stomach ache when I got home from the brewery.
Pyramid Unfiltered Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Truly shocked to see all the low scores on this beer. First time I had it, it was labelled as ""Happy Viking Ale"" at the apply named Happy Viking pub in Marysville, CA. As smooth an ale I�ve ever tasted, great flavor and good finish. I went on quite a search trying to find this ale again, and finally tracked it down at the Pyramid Taproom in the Oakland Airport. I was not disappointed, and it was worth the wait."

Pyramid Unfiltered Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);I, for one, do not get the haters of this beer.

The beer is a murky dark orange-amber color with a minimal off-white head that disappears quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma is fruity with notes of musty malt. Medium, smooth body with a midly tart fruit character and pale malt and lightly bitter hops flavors. The finish is clean and lightly fruity with a short tart aftertaste. Just average overall."
Pyramid Unfiltered Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Served at Outback Steakhouse under the moniker ""Aborigine Amber"" - Thin and sweet with a heavy dose of spice and a just a bit of sour hop leaf. Whaddya expect?"
Pyramid Unfiltered Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);On draft at Horatio�s restaurant in San Leandro, CA (12/27/07). I was told this was brewed by Horatio�s by the wait staff and didn�t think to ask more questions about it during my visit. Thanks to milo2 for clearing up the origin of this amber. Pours amber with tan head. The aroma is mild and vaguely malty and not really much else. I struggled to pull that out of the nose. The taste begins with a bite of hops and a hint of metal. It quickly turns rich and malty with roasted malts mixed with some light dark fruity esters. The hops almost vanish into the finish leaving a maltiness and faint dark fruitiness into the brief after taste.
Pyramid Unfiltered Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Draught at Falling Rock. Pours hazy amber with an average, frothy, off-white, lasting head, good lacing. Aroma is average malt (bread, grain), light hops (flowers), average yeast (sweat) with notes of apple and pear. Light bodied, thin texture, average duration, and a bitter finish. Short duration, light sweetness, acidity and bitterness.
Pyramid Unfiltered Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);I don�t usually do this but I am rating this one from memory. Ordered this after work for a happy hour...it went under the house beer selection served at Kincaid�s Steak House. My coworker commented how his beer looked different, given that he was not used to drinking unfiltered beers before. He wasn�t going to drink it, but then after the waitress came back and explained that it was unfiltered, he ended up drinking it. What I remember is a typical amber ale flavor but some spices added. This was pretty refreshing after a long day of work.
Pyramid Unfiltered Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Draft. Had this one at the Oakland airport under the name of Jet Set Amber Ale. Cloudy, opaque amber about the color of fresh squeezed apple juice. Very mild aroma - almost nothing there - faint maltiness with a bit of spice. Flavor is sweet and spicy with a little hop bite and pepper in the finish. Full body ad gentle carbonation. Not bad.

Capitol City Fuel;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Capitol City Brewing Company;On draft at Capitol City Brewing Co. in Virginia.

Tell Lager;Chur, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Switzerland;Review: 50cl Can of Tell Lager: ABV: 4.8% Think it came in at about 50 to 60 cents a can, as far as I can remember, but way cheaper than more established brands. On pour I got a golden colour with a large frothy head appearing, Looks like there is a bit of sediment hanging around resulting in a darkish, not clear,golden colour. (perhaps I got a bad batch?) There is a good bit of carbonation going on, the beer has a decent sized head that surprisingly stuck around and has some decent lacing. Had a nice lagery smell and was grainy, which was faint but ok. Onto the taste, it was light enough but did manage to get some nice big mouthfuls Tastes ok, smooth and easy enough to quench, albeit had a slight sour bitter note to it. Has the expected lagery taste, with light pale malts and grains, slightly metallic. Overall not too bad, considering the price of it. For a cheap beer it can do the business, just about I might add!

High Noon Hopalong IPA;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;IPA;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;"Light to medium amber-gold color. Rather slight head, no visible effervescence. Distinct hop aroma (as expected) but seems to be more of a British hop aroma, along with a tad of malt fruit. Very distinct buttery diacetyl and malt fruitiness, followed by the hops, which are not what I've come to expect in an American IPA. They are quite subdued, citrusy. Some tangy apple and pineapple in the finish. Finishes very ""wet"", also. Fairly light-bodied brew. A bit too smooth & malty for an IPA (not to mention mine had almost no carbonation), but quenching."

It looks like a fairly dark amber from what I could tell. Nice head that went down kinda quick. Lots of lacing. Smells kinda plain. Mostly malt. Tastes pretty decent. The aftertaste has a surprising bite. More full bodied than most anything from AB. Not bad, but I think that the adjunct aftertaste might start to pile up after awhile.

Red by Budweiser;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I am assuming this is the beer i want to rate, i had this at a restaurant the other night in gainesville called ballyhoo. The beer went by the name of ballyhoo amber and i asked the bartender what it was and she said Anheuser made it for them. So in the light i sat in it poured a reddish color with a thin white head, flavor was pretty subtle, it was malty with slight hop flavor, not much going on with it nothing that stood out too much for me anyways.

Couldn�t find it on here, but since the bartender told be that Budweiser brewed it for them, I am assuming this is it. I also assume that all Fox and Hounds have it and that by Budweiser, he meant Anheuser-Busch. Anyway, pours a clear amber-reddish color, with a very frothy, pure white head. Taste is pretty tame with a little caramel malt mixed with a hint of hop bitterness. This would be a good beer to drink a lot of. On tap."
Red by Budweiser;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);At the Fitzgerald�s Irish Pub in Bonita Springs Florida, we were served Fitzgerald�s Red Lager. It was later learned that this was a contract brew from Anheuser-Busch that was known there as the American Red and that it was a quote white label brew made for distribution to various pubs under their own label. It is assumed that this is that American Red. It poured a small sized head of light brown colored foamy finely sized mostly diminishing bubbles that left behind a transparent dark red brown colored softly carbonated body and a fair lacing. Its mouth feel was tingly from the start to the finish. It also had a caramel red malt aroma. The flavor was of red malt, caramel malt flavoring. It would make a good session brew with its easy drinking quaff-ability.

Left Hand Festival Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Left Hand Brewing Company;"Vibrant head; yellow-orange with gold highlights. Starts off with a mouthfeel not unlike milk - cold, smooth, and soft. Becomes a little more carbonated in the middle. Finishes with a nice dose of flavor: some ""bread-dough"" maltiness, cookie, and a little hop bitterness. Aftertaste is enjoyable and lasting... rather bitter (nice).

Carlsberg Semper Ardens Bock;Copenhagen, Denmark;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle. A clear, dark golden beer with a small, off-white head.

Fordham & Dominion Virginia Native Red;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Ruby-amber colored body with a medium thick white head.

Fordham & Dominion Virginia Native Red;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Somewhat red in colour, but basically golden. I immediately flagged down the waiter and asked if this was the correct beer, but it was. The smell was nothing great, just a typical ale. No large presence of hops nor malt in this beer, just an average amount of a decent tasting beer. Aftertaste was acceptable as well. Could use a little work, but is better than any Macrobrew at anytime of day. Tasted at RT's in Court House (Arlington), Virginia.
Fordham & Dominion Virginia Native Red;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Almost no aroma, what there is of it was vaguely sweet. Pretty tasteless initially, finishing with a bit of sweetness and ginger, but also some astringency.

Batemans Hooker;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;March 2011: Hooker is brewed every spring (for the annual Six Nations Ruby Tournament) and is currently (2011) sitting at 4.1%ABV and with a new front label on the bottles and a changed font if on cask. My 500ml brown bottle was best before 31 Mar 2012 and was drank/reviewed 7 Mar 2011. Poured into a vase shaped pint, �Old Speckled Hen� badged. The body is a light amber, clear and showing carbonisation rushing upwards to the full snowy white foaming head. Very little aroma, some hops and yeast present if you sniff long and hard enough, otherwise not a lot of anything. The flavours are a dry tasting blend of hops and unsweetened barley malts. It isn�t bitter in taste, but certainly isn�t sweet either. The dryness seemed to increase as the tasting progressed and I thought it dry in the first mouthfull! I suppose you could call it refreshing, but I found it wanting in all aspects. Almost odourless, too dry and bland in both texture and taste. The worst beer I�ve had from Batemans. I can only assume the cask version is a whole lot better.

Olbernhauer Bock Bier Dunkel;Olbernhau, Saxony, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Privatbrauerei Olbernhau;Das Bockbier startet au�ergew�hnlich mild, man will sagen hohl. Dann kommt eine rauchmalzige Note zaghaft hervor, verharrt aber dort und bildet so h�chstens einen Unterton. Es fehlt aber der Hauptton, nach wie vor ist das Bier merkw�rdig mild, einfach neutral, nicht einmal w�ssrig kann man das Bier nennen. Erst im Abgang wird das Malz kr�ftiger, w�rzig, etwas herb. Ein sehr eigener Bock, den ich in dieser Form bisher nicht kenne. Zu mild, ja. Irgendwie aber doch gef�llig. Komisch! Test vom 20.11.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 11,8,14,11,10,9 - 10,15

Neuzeller Bock;Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Bottle from Alko, Somero. Pours golden with shades of orange. Small white quickly diminishing head. Aroma of bready maltiness, citrus, alcohol and some peat. Taste is pretty much on the same line, with sturdy sweetish malty backbone spiced up by some earthy and citric notes: lemon, apple, peat and potato. Alcohol pushes through a little too much and runs over hops in the finish. Smooth mouthfeel, but a little watery body. The taste is quite nicely balanced, except for the bite of alcohol. Not at all a bad performance for a (strong) lager, but on the other hand nothing unique or spectacular.

Very palle dull gold body with a medium to big white head leaving heaps of lacing. Ooh, skunk, and some herbal notes. lemon too. Ogi had a somewhat favorable first impression (for a cheap Hungarian lager) but whatever optimism I had in the deepest recesses of my mind before tackling this one got stuck in the wall of stale dust that dominates the taste. Very light malt, some cardboard. Watery. Useless, crap. Unlike some of their other beers this might actually contain the hops. Heck, I think that the hops are on the label only to say ""Hey, this is our crap beer, hop edition"". It�s better than the cardboard and salt editions. Maybe."

Tikettes S�r;P�cs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;P�csi S�rf�zde;"My Bottom Line: This shameful semblance of a Pale Lager throws dust and citrusy cleaner together in the hopes of getting things worked out. The rest is water. Further Personal Perceptions: -A slim veil of foam covers the pale gold translucence. -There is a lot of carbonation, but it remains palatable. -There are long, mineral oxidized notes in the finish. -This starts out like a failed Svetle Vycepni, and then all descends into rusty, dusty hell. Bottle; best before 2009/02/03."
Tikettes S�r;P�cs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;P�csi S�rf�zde;Bottle. Golden colour with a small white head. Aroma and flavour of malt, hops and watery.
Tikettes S�r;P�cs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;P�csi S�rf�zde;Bottled. Pale yellow colour, minor white head. Aroma is salts, diacetyl, paper and harsh hops. Flavour is salty, malty, papery, grassy and some harsh hops in finish. Watery, and not very pleasant.
Tikettes S�r;P�cs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;P�csi S�rf�zde;Bottled (BB 02/2007). Golden color, small white head. Cardboard, malty, grassy hoppy, very cheap nose. Very watery, grassy, cardboard flavor. Very cheap, very thin.
Tikettes S�r;P�cs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;P�csi S�rf�zde;Bottled, pasteurised. Pale yellow with short head. With a risk of repeating myself, this is a low impact, sweet, malt beer. Very little hops, very little to write about.
Tikettes S�r;P�cs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;P�csi S�rf�zde;Another Hungarian that consists of maize. Pale golden. Soapy aroma with a slight herbal tone. Flat palate. Bad metallic taste, bad aftertaste.
Gillespies Malt Stout;Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fountain (Scottish Courage - Scottish & Newcastle);Bring it back! It was the best stout I ever tasted. Sadly missed. A great sweet end to it that set it apart from its competitors.
Gillespies Malt Stout;Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fountain (Scottish Courage - Scottish & Newcastle);18.01.2014, 0,44l can @ home: My father in law got me this one from a colleague of his, having used it for displaying in his apartment for ages. Best before date 27.03.1997. LOL!! Just had to test it, just for fun... Tiny bubbly shortlasting head. Aroma is slightly sweet malty, something like malt candy maybe, dark sugar, hints of chocolate and soap. Taste is very watery and slightly sweet, malt candy, dark syrup, hay, grass, hints of chocolate. Little bitterness, as watery mouthfeel as it gets. Basically it�s just bad. But given that it�s bb. date expired almost 17 years ago, and it�s only 4% ABV, it�s actually kind of drinkable. I kind of expected it to be worse than worst actually...
Gillespies Malt Stout;Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fountain (Scottish Courage - Scottish & Newcastle);First tasted this in Coanes, Johnstone in October 1995. This was in cask and NOT in nitrokeg form. Cask, handpump dispense. Dull black in colour with a thick tight creamy off white head. Slight aroma of barley grain, very short in intensity. Thick creamy mouthfeel and superb lacing throughout. Dark malts give a smooth maltloaf base with sweet raisin fruit, hints of coffee bean and bitter plain chocolate. Slight prickle of hops in the short lived aftertaste. Finish is really creamy and ultra smooth with currants, tobacco smoke and grain husks full in the mouth. An excellent session sweet stout, but very hard to find in cask form - more�s the pity.
Gillespies Malt Stout;Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fountain (Scottish Courage - Scottish & Newcastle);Sitting in the pub of a Friday evening with fond memories of supping a smooth pint of the good stuff. Wish it was still around!

Gillespies Malt Stout;Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fountain (Scottish Courage - Scottish & Newcastle);Possibly the finest stout around. Very creamy texture without being thick, making it easily drunk. Haven''t seen it for a few years though - is it still made??

Pfungst�dter Edel-Pils;Pfungstadt, Hesse, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pfungst�dter Brauerei Hildebrand;Pours clear straw colour with a white mostly disappearing head.

Kanizsai Vil�gos;Budapest, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dreher S�rgy�rak (Asahi);Tried it long time ago in Hungary. Bad beer even when speaking about Hungarian macros.
Kanizsai Vil�gos;Budapest, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dreher S�rgy�rak (Asahi);This, once good name has been rusted. It has been derogated to a redundant, unpleasant cheap beer. Better not to buy it.

Onder de Linden Gelders Ale;Wageningen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bierbrouwerij Onder de Linden;"Bottled. I long time I didn�t dare to buy this beer. I heared so many bad reports over the years that I never tasted it. The last couple of years there were no sounds at about this brewery and beers what made me wonder whether they still exsisted. And yes the do! I finally came across a couple of bottles. The labels improved very much but the beer was also surprisingly good. It really made me feel like ""this is how beer was brewed in the old days before commercialization"". Like geuze! Aroma of flowers, lemon, quite hoppt and a little yeasty. Hazy, amber color, beige head, very nice lace. Sweet, citric sour, lemon, hopbitterness (quite hoppy), wood, malty, hay, sticky and a vinegar-like burning sensation. Reminded me a lot of a good saison."
Onder de Linden Gelders Ale;Wageningen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bierbrouwerij Onder de Linden;aroma is fresh , almost like la chouffe. wonderful taste of sweet fruits but a bit watery. finish is a bit sour. overall very nice.
Onder de Linden Gelders Ale;Wageningen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bierbrouwerij Onder de Linden;"Aroma is yeasty, bit sour and hoppy. Cloudy, yellow coloured with a thin white head. Taste is yeasty, hopbitter and sweet spicy/fruity. I'll completely agree with Sigmund & Caesar; This beer is a 3."
Onder de Linden Gelders Ale;Wageningen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bierbrouwerij Onder de Linden;Cloudy golden color, short frothy head. Aroma is sour yeasty, bit spicy and hoppy. Sweet and sour yeasty taste. Bit dry and sticky palate.
Onder de Linden Gelders Ale;Wageningen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bierbrouwerij Onder de Linden;I expected of some reason this to be a Dutch copy of English cask ales, but it has a more yeasty and spicy flavour than any English brew I've had, and is also more carbonated. (But not as carbonated as Belgian ales). Flavour is otherwise dominated by rather bitter hops (but not as bitter as the barman made me expect). The colour is light brown, slightly hazy. You'd think the ABV was higher than it actually is. It is not a bad brew, but I'd prefer most English ales / bitters to this one. Still it's nice to find Dutch alternatives to the inevitable macrobrews.
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341 ml bottle @ Maxwell's Sports Bar Goose Bay. Pours a clear light gold with a large white head. Aromas are light grain and mildly sweet malt. Tastes are chalky grain and a light hop presence. Light body, smooth and almost creamy, light carbonation and mild hop bite on the tongue, medium grain finish. A macro for sure. ---Rated via Beer Buddy
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This beer is a little known gem in the Molson product line. It was aquired by Molson in the Carling merger of the early 90�s, and they got it in a similar manner some time long before that. In an era of tasteless beer drank ice cold purely for the enjoyment of the alcoholic effects, sadly this brand is little appreciated, and if you don�t get it at a very busy vendor, it probably sat on the shelf for too long. I�m not sure if the Molson still sells beer from the brewery on circular road, but this is the best way to get their little known brands and I would suggest trying it this way. Otherwise, pay attention to the julian calendar date found printed on the case when buying this.
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I was underwhelmed by this beer. Nose of sweet malt, so e fruit. Taste of metallic funk. Maybe a hint of pepper, but then strong malt. No hop character.
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Small white head over corn-golden beer, clear. Very neutral nose, like still water, muddy. Grain taste, neutral to light sweet. ""Crisp"" is the word, for better or for worse. Light bitterish aftertaste, very light body. Dull ale. Maybe �t wasn�t such a bright idea trying it, whilst watching a TV series where they were trying Saison Dupont, Saison de Pipaix and other gems... Thanks, Stef C!"
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Straight up the best lager out of the marintime provinces. Standard solid gold beer with tons of little bubbles, very smooth, creamy white crown and very impressive lacing. Good retention too. No lack of aroma here - quite sweet with over ripe nectarines or peaches, some pee - don�t matter though �cause this is a solid brew. My description for taste doesn�t entirely reflect how much I enjoyed this beer - notable background bitterness throughout, cardboard malt and a solid wheat taste. More tongue drying bitterness has made this waaaaay more bitter than I thought it would be. Some sourness and alcohol as well - contributes to the nice stomach heat I got. I like! Mouthfeel is pretty plain and a bit harsh but I enjoyed the dry, dry bitter finish that left me parched. Excellent unassuming brew that really surprised me. Is it 3.7? As far as Canadian lagers go, it has to be. Don�t confuse this for being better than a better than average Belgian ale or something like that - for me it just excels in its class.
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Dark golden yellow, no head was really produced during the pour, just some small patches bubbles linger around, wow I�ve never seen a beer that resembled urine so much mmmmmmm�� looks tasty. Malty and sweet, smells just like every other low-grade beer. The taste is all darker tasting malts and corn maybe just maybe I can detect a faint hint of hops buts its hard just like sniffing a fart in the wind. I wont lie this beer isn�t good but you could probably drink a ton of them and not get sick of it."""
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Yup. Pale golden color, white fizzy head. Grassy, sweet aroma with some cornbread. Flavor is ""meh"" with a slightly bitter-sweet finish. Definately improves with warmth. My fave macro Nfld session beer."
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours a pale golden color, darker than the average macro, but still pretty light. Head is medium and white, reasonably quick to leave and left a tiny tiny bit of lacing. You can smell the corn in this brew, and a little bit of fresh cut grass smell. There might be a tiny bit of caramel to it as well, but I doubt it. It�s a rather dry beer, with corn overtones, medium bitterness and a cirtusy aftertaste. Pretty watery, and mid to low carbonation.
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle in St. John�s. No matter what the name says, this is NOT an ale. This is a lager. Colour, taste, and probably even in fermentation, this is a lager. But as far as lagers go, this isn�t horrible. Golden-yellow, yeast and grain aroma, grain and corn flavour. It�s not mind-blowing, but it�s drinkable.
Bennett Dominion Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is one of my favorite beers when letting off steam or just hanging out with the pissants. Thankfully this beer is now availavle in Val Verde.
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Another run of the mill beer from a large brewery. This poured from a bottle that was purchased at the ""Liquor Store"" in St. Johns, NL. It poured a light straw color with a white fluffy head that dissipated quickly. This tastes just like you would expect from Labatt, very light and watery. I guess it tastes fine but a very boring beer."
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);341ml bottle from a pub on George St. Only available in NFLD as far as I know. Sweet and slightly metalic, it was macrobrew at its most representative. May have seemed better than it was because I had just finished four double White Russians at Lottie�s across the street.
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);This ale pored a crystal clear, light yellow colour with a nice, bright white, foamy head. To the nose... scents of rotten eggs and corn... mmmm, mmm! First sip was watery and had a flavour of wine. Typical white bread beer from Labatts...crap!
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Crystal clear typical lager gold, with a thin cap that disappeared before I could right this sentence down. Slight chemical sent mixed in with a ton of cheap malts and just a touch of apple for good measure, not a good smell but could be way worse. A dusty stale flavor that�s all malts no hops can be found, very surprisingly there is no bread flavor to found in this cheap ass crap lager from the east coast of Canada. The after taste is a strange flavor that reminds me of grape bubble gum that you�ve chewed for way to long. This stuff is swill but still kind of drinkable, you could find better beer any where, even in a Mexican back ally probally.
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Taste is a personal thing and Jockey Club is one of my favourite beer. I really like this beer. It�s one I can drink all night.
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);From bottle in a pub on Gerge St, St Johns. Attracted to this beer by the name and the label. The aroma reminds me of a lager. Clear, light yellow with a very thin head. Sweet and a little scenty in flavour, however got a bit watery. I actually thought this beer was drinkable, well maybe only one. Pleasnt beer I thought.
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Crystal golden colour with a thin white head. Aroma of malt, sugar and some cardboard. Light-bodied; Malty flavour with not much else. Overall, bland and horrible...funny name though! I sampled this 12 ounce bottle on 15-May-2004 at the May RB Party in Toronto, Ontario."
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Maybe I�m going out on a limb, but I don�t think it�s as bad as everyone else does. The best part: poured a beautiful pearly froth of suds on top of a nice rusty gold water. Then the head vanished to a slight lace. I could see huge amounts of carbonation. This beer looks like the beer conjured up for most everyday folks when the word �beer� is spoken aloud. Smells of hops, a light grassy aroma. A crisp mouthfeel. Nothing to write up gloriously. Tastes of a slight sweet malt, some lemon, some hoppy-round-bitter, but with the usual macro adjuncts. The worst: the aftertaste is not complimentary. It�s essentially morning mouth. Very close to most macros, but marginally better because of the awesome appearance. Not as good as Black Horse in the drinkability department.
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"You�re kidding right. Jockey�s - and everyone else - should stay away from this ""Corn on the"" club. Good as a wet liquid when the water needed refilling and between big beers - otherwise, you�re kidding right?"
Jockey Club;London, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pale golden colour, with a thin fast fading white head. Malt aroma, slightly fruity. Very thin body however with zero hoppiness or bitterness.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I had this at the hotel bar in Port Au Choix Light yellow color with a bubbly white head. The India in the name fooled me, shame on me. Middle of the road even bland golden ale.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottled. The aroma has yeast. Not good. Clear yellow body with huge white head. The taste is quite nasty as well.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341 ml bottle @ Battle Harbour, NL. Pours a pale straw with a moderate white head. Aromas are light caramel and florals. Tastes are light grains and some crystal malt sweetness. Light body, effervescent, little to no aftertaste. A little bit more character than most macro lagers. ---Rated via Beer Buddy
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Draft - Light Apple and pale malt. Clear gold with a rich white head. Light apple and not much else. Pretty tasteless.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Smells like a typical adjunct lager, maybe just a tad more presence. Appearance isn�t bad, with a decent head, good retention, and surprisingly good lacing. Tastes pretty much like it smells, certainly not much hop presence or IPA character. Light to medium body, moderate carbonation, off dry finish.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Nose of malt and grain, not much else. Taste Initial brightness and slight floral, but fade quickly into all malt. Mild bitterness. A little better than lots of the pale lagers.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This beer is one of my favorites. I am, for the most part, an ale drinker. If you try this beer, I would suggest allowing the beer to come to room temperature before sampling. It tastes best at is fermenting temperature. Excellent compliment to fish and chips. Cheers.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341ml bottle from the NLC in St. John�s. Only sold in NFLD. Not over-carbonated in the artificial sense of having that terrible acidic nastiness, but this beer seemed to be all effervesance. Is bubbles a taste? This stuff just seemed to disappear in my mouth which make for some easy drinking.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341 ml bottle. Darker than the average pale lager, but still only a pale gold. Very thin quickly dissipating white head. Medium to high carbonation. Flavor is pretty sharp, tastes slightly yeasty, slightly appley, and a lot like an offshoot of a macro beer. Very sweet, not really malty though. A little bit bitter, but not incredibly so. It isn�t bad, a good beer to drink lots of.
Molson India Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341 ml bottle. Medium carbonation. Clean golden color. A bit nutty. Reminds me of Molson dry.

Rostocker Freibeuter;Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock (Radeberger Gruppe);bottle,vintage, bbf 2009-may, i�ll be re-rating this when i get a fresh one. clear amber, smooth white head. Caramelly, malty aroma, hops are gone, slight berryish note too. quite sweet aroma. flavor is caramelly, malty, somewhat oxidized, Alc. better hidden than i feared, Quite amazing how well those germans keep themselves. Only faint vineous notes and the old hops reveal that this one is like 3 years old, and it s even a discount beer to begin with.
Rostocker Freibeuter;Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock (Radeberger Gruppe);Clear amber of color with a beige head. An aroma of malt and toffee. A flavor of malt, bisquit and a weak bitterness.
Rostocker Freibeuter;Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock (Radeberger Gruppe);Medium offwhite coarseish head doesn�t last. Reddish brown body with light carbonation. Fruity papery alcoholic aroma with oily meaty notes. Sweet-dryish malty dusty taste with roasty alcoholic wooden notes. Full-bodied. Sharpish mouthfeel with some alcohol heat. Dryish wooden papery roasty aftertaste with dandelion notes. It�s OK, but not very good. &#400.33l bottle from some supermarket in Kiel.&#41
Rostocker Freibeuter;Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock (Radeberger Gruppe);Canned. Amber colour with small white fluffy head. Aroma is alcohol, caramel malts, some bready malts, metal and also mild sugary notes. Flavour is sweet alcohol, some caramel and bready malts and that�s pretty much it. 9% in this one feels quite much burning...

Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;Lots of dark fruit, dark chocolate, some alcohol and oxidation on the nose. Pours dark brown, almost black with no head. Nice flavors of dark fruit, a touch of light tartness, dark chocolate, roasted malts in the background and throughout. Caramelly sweetness as well. Balanced, well rounded, with some light bitterness as well. Dry earthy finish. Lightly carbonated, nice and dry. Aged rather well really. Good.
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;Vintage 2006. Appearance: Pours out a dark brown, near black body with a burgeoning, light beige head. Smell: An aged aroma currently embodied by a deep vinous fruitiness and staunch earthiness. Notes of darkened barley and baker�s chocolate are secondary. Taste: Roasted barley and unsweetened chocolate enveloped in an ultra thin coating of vanilla. Eventually, a modest sweetness appears. Earthy throughout. Touch of Italian almond biscotti. A strong dark fruitiness akin to over-ripened plums. Slight alcohol warmth on the sweet, malty finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability: While I had no trouble making my Save vs. Enrapture roll, I did still find the Dungeon Master�s Imperial Stout to be pretty good.
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;22oz bottle from a trade with 11026 some time ago..... not too intriguing of a pour. close to a cola black with brown edges with a thin tan head that is quick to recess.... aroma of roasted malt and chocolate..... wasn�t expecting the flavor to hold up but it did with a sweet malt bill emphasizing the chocolate, roast, and sweet caramel notes. thin mouthfeel somewhat detracts but this is still a fairly solid imperial stout that has withstood some aging. would have scored higher had it looked better and had more body to it.
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;Botttle,this poured a nice dark black with a small tan head and a roasty malty finished and it aged well the alcohol was well hidden.CHEERS!
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;"22 oz. bottle - thanks to riversideak for sharing; pours jet black, roasty and thin; syrupy, thin texture; caramel, vanilla and mild roastiness; super thin, but decent overall"
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;22. Thanks, Riverside! Jet black. Caramel highlights. Headless, laceless, still. Sharply boozy nose, even after all this time. Some vanilla showing. Watery light body (!). Sweet, sticky mid-palate. Mild finish. Shockingly underdeveloped...may be shot by the hands of time.
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;22 oz. bottle via trade with kp - I�m not sure how old this bottle is, but since I got it from kp, its got to be a few years old. Pours a clear brown color with a thin light tan head that faded fairly quick. No lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, light chocolate, cola, and dark esters. Suprised to not pick up much oxidation in the aroma. The flavor is quite vinous with light chocolate and roasted malt. There is a tad bit oxidation in the flavor. The flavor and alcohol lingers a bit on the palate. The palate seems a little thin. Overall an enjoyable beer to drink and glad I had the chance to try it. I bet it was really good fresh. Thanks Keith.
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;Bottle shared by Crosling. Poured a deep brown/black color with a thin tan head that diminished to a ring. Aroma of light chocolate, roasted malt, leather, and hints of dark fruit. The flavor was pretty similar, with a light chocolate malt leading into a roasty middle with undertones of coffee and fruit (I detected berries, but I may be crazy). Full and smooth, not much alcohol apparent. Sort of simple, a bit sweet, but overall it was a solid imperial stout that I am glad I was lucky enough to try. Thanks Nick.
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;Pitch black with a light brown head. Medium strong smell of mocha-chocolate malts. Smooth oily mouthfeel. Very sweet taste of dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Has a chalky flavor on the tongue to finish. Sweet even for an IRS. Not much depth of flavor here, but good in its own right. Alcohol is well hidden. 22406
Hawks D.M.s Imperial Stout;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hawks Brewing;Thanks to whoever gave me this one, been sitting in the cellar for a while. Pours out black with a tiny brown head. Aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate and slight oxidation due to the age of this bottle. Flavor is complex with a nice thick mouthfeel. Chocolate, roasted malt slight dark fruits. Warming/alcohol finish. Nice
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Must afge in the bottle. Burnt coffee aroma. Dark ruby red color when held to light. Head was tan and was gone quickly. Flavor was of sweet and sour candy. Acidic finsh that I really didn�t care for.
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Thanks for the trade, TannerTavernboys! This one rubbed me the wrong way from the start for some reason. Maybe it was the seemingly random mashing of words/styles (Wheat! Bock! Winter! Applesauce!) but unfortunately this didn�t seem to gel for me. Pours dark brown with a thin light tan head and little lacing. Aroma of sour fruit and toasted malt. Medium-bodied with a sourness that permeates, making me wonder if this might have been a bad bottle. Malt, wheat and clove flavors are dominated by the sourness. The finish is dry and fruity. I�d like to try this again to determine if there are problems with the beer in general or if is what the it is supposed to be like.
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;tap at taphouse-tempe, AZ-pours deep brown amber with no head whatsoever. big spicy, fruitcake like aroma with banana and clove in there as well. lots of spicy flavors, but the alcohol is not well hidden and becomes hot for such a low abv beer. body is very low in carbonation which could have been a problem in delivering the flavors properly. maybe this keg is really old or something. wish i had it fresh from the winter time.
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Pours a brilliantly clear ruby color when held up to the light, otherwise it is a deep amber color. It is topped by a thinnish, frothy light brown head. As I pour this beer I get strong notes of banana, when I go in for a better smell I get hints of higher alcohols and fusels, as well as banana and clove notes. The taste is palate filling and sweet up front, almost like a banana cream pie. The finish is sour and salty with a dry finish that actually balances the front part of this beer despite the fact that it might be a bit infected. Along with the sour finish this beer evokes thoughts of sour cherries, and oak. The finish has hints of roasted malts, but mostly the astringent notes of burnt grain husks. I am not quite sure that this beer is supposed to be as sour as it is, the sourness is only a bit here, and perhaps it is just yeast derived, but whatever I certainly like it. This beer would perhaps be a bit unbalanced without it.
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Draught @ the 5th Annual Strong Beer Festival in Scottsdale, Arizona. Brown with a large, dense and lasting head of foam. Moderately aromatic, with hints of banana, clove, nuts and toasted malts. The flavor is actually pretty delicious and was one of the best beers at the fesitival showing notes of big, bready, fruitcake flavors and hints of banana, clove and a certain tartness and acidity that is hard to describe.
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Bottle. Dark brown color with a light brown head. A sour fruit, tart and cherry flavor and aroma. Warming. Thanks to Tim for bringing this back from his road trip.
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Interesting aroma - typical weizen banana and clove, but there is also chocolate, malt, cherries, and a hint of molasses. Very dark mahogany brown, minimal head. Flavor is spicy and fruity, with a little chocolate and roast character. Balance is slightly sweet, pretty full bodied, warming. Overall an interesting beer, kind of like a weizen-stout-bock.
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Color is dark as a moonless night with a minimal head. Very malty aroma with some hints of banana. Malt definitly leads the taste but has a smooth, sweet, fruity nutty flavor. Few hints of spices. Still it warms the heart. Nice job.
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;"heady brew great bock witha nice what lick like most rio;s it has a good ehad an a strong alcohol content which is always good a nice winter beer that is is terrific for locals like us cheers"
Rio Salado Blizzard Bock Winter Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Wow...this is one of the better Weizen Bock's out there. The aroma tells the story with banana and cloves just smacking you right up front...some forest scents, grapefruits, and roasty woodiness also apparent. It pours a dark brown to blackish color with a small dark brown head which dissipated quickly. The carbonation level is very active in this beer with bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. The flavor is definitely clovey and banana with a sweet hint of vanilla, raisins and lemony grapefruit in the finish. Perhaps a cranberry hint in there too...super fruity beer. Dry spicey ending..bittersweet..perfectly so. Nice mouthfeel, and a well rounded Bock...i liked it a lot. Thanks to mitch!

Golden; clear with no visible carbonation; head is less white (more tan) than expected. Very nice and very sweet aroma of malt with a trace of hops. The flavor is more distinctive than the aroma; it has a fine bitter-sweet mix, with a nice flavorful hit of light toasted malt and hops that passes quickly leaving a lasting but mild hoppy finish. Very nice! Medium-light body; crisp. O - my first Opat is a winner. This tasted great by itself; with some trepidation, i tried it with some sweets that came to the table before i finished (vanilla ice cream; cinnamon-sour cherry-caramel parfait) with which the beer paired remarkably well! This brewery makes many flavored beers -- including pepper, cherry & apricot -- that i am now even more eager to try."

Pours crystal clear with a thick pillow of multi textured head, heavy lacing and fast rising carbonation. Gold in colour. On the nose, light white bread, hay and faint floral honey. In the mouth fairly high carbonation gives a light frothy feel at first, but this is soon eclipsed by the high bitterness, flavours fairly similar to the aromas, slight sweetness, with a short, bitter finish. Overall, a very ordinary pilsner that would not stand out in a line up of supermarket lagers.

Aroma predominated by caramel and bread with floral honey. In the mouth, bitterness and alcohol presence from the first sip, medium texture, flavours consistent with the aromas, rising bitterness with a short finish but leaving some sugar in the aftertaste.

The beer is named after one of his novels. It is a very drinkable, light pilsner with a fresh taste. It is lightly malty with a fairly long-lasting head - very enjoyable on a lazy summer day. It reminds me of the 11 degree Kozel, but with less bitterness

Barley's Angelo's Crooked Sky Rye;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;Objectively speaking: Fruity, soft rye ale. I like: The rye spiciness which I enjoy comes out, though timidly. Mostly dry palate. Interesting fruity array (peach, pear and the likes). Soft bodied. I dislike: Frankly deceivingly simple for a rye beer and really light-bodied. Not much cerealic complexity. Not very aromatic. Timid carbonation accentuates the wateriness. More hops would have been welcome.

The taste has the dryness of the rye, a nice form of harshness and dry grapefruits. The finish continues even drier with pine needles and pine cones. A very enjoyable IPA that I wish I could get on more than just a stopping place on a long road trip.

With so many bitters in Mauldon�s lineup we had to refer to the good beer guide to sort out if this was indeed a scoop. Thankfully this wasn�t overlooked. Golden. Very strong bitter kick to it.

Barley's Bee's Wing Honey Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Barley's Brewing Company;Not a fan of wheat beers. Noticeable honey aroma and taste. The wheat flavor is also apparent The two flavors are distinct rather than blending together. Light in color but cloudy as wheat beers tend to be. I can see why people would like this, it�s just not something I care for.
Barley's Bee's Wing Honey Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Barley's Brewing Company;A good summer beer. A little light honey taste on a nice refreshing Wheat ale. Very refreshing on a hot day. A little disappointing for Barley's though. Their other brews raise the bar so high.
Barley's Bee's Wing Honey Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Barley's Brewing Company;Light and tastey! Stong on the honey - which is fitting to the name. A very easy drink - very refreshing - great in the summer.
Barley's Bee's Wing Honey Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Barley's Brewing Company;I was interested in trying this beer, but found it to not be as good as some of the other ones Barley's puts out. I like the color of the beer, but I find it to be a bit too light for this style of beer.
Barley's Ivan Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Barley's Brewing Company;Draft at Barley�s in August 2012 from notes. Pours dark brown in color with a medium sized creamy beige head.

Barley's Ivan Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Barley's Brewing Company;Pint on nitro at the Smokehouse. Pours black with a creamy tan head. Roasty malt aroma with some coffee and a hint of black cherry. Full-flavored roasty coffee with a bit of chocolate and a creamy finish. Good stuff, and missing that watery character a lot of nitro brews have.
Barley's Ivan Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Barley's Brewing Company;Black with white crowning head. Chocolate aroma, medium mouthfeel. Served room temperature which was appropriate. Nicely undercarbonated as almost all of the beers are, and therefore easier drinking as less bloated factor. A chocolate porter.
Barley's Ivan Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Barley's Brewing Company;Sample @ Brewpub: Pours a dark caramel color with bubbly, thin white head. Aroma is heavily-roasted chocolate malts and some vanilla. Hops are blatant in this brew, as this porter is almost too crisp. Some carmel undertones. Tasty overall, but lacking of the robustness and fullness of other porters I have tried.
Barley's Ivan Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Barley's Brewing Company;Firkin at the alehouse. Pours dark brown with ruby edges and almost zero head or hints of carbonation. Nice strong roasted chocolate aroma, chalky, malty - typical porter aroma but a good one. Taste is the same with a silky mouthfeel, smooth as hell, with a slightly watery and bland finish. I don�t know if the firkin covered up any faults with this but the low carbonation created a creamy and very enjoyable mouthfeel and an easy drinking brew. Good.

Aroma is roasty and sweet with some Oreo characteristics. Semi creamy mouthfeel. Reminds me of dirt pie, the shit with oreos crumbled up in a vanilla pudding and chocolate pie crust. Nice stuff.

Barley's Ol' Ron's Surly Oatmeal Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Barley's Brewing Company;Tap @ Alehouse: Pours a very dark brown with lighter brown highlights, ring of tan head. The aroma has a nice roastiness to it and smells a bit like burnt sugar. Flavor is scalded milk, rich chocolate malts, some dark chocolate and chicory coffee. There is a little bit of toasted caramel malt in there as well. Finishes like a dark coffee roast. A bit bitter.
Barley's Ol' Ron's Surly Oatmeal Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Barley's Brewing Company;Objectively speaking: A brown, sweet and globally nondescript stout saying soft in every fashion. I like: Can�t blame it of being agressive. Rather large initial head, though it quickly fades. Minimal coffee roastiness. I dislike: No filling oatmeal presence, light-bodied and rather watery. Sweet, almost sugary palate never gets sufficient roastiness to be balanced. Blatant lack of depth for a beer scoring above 3.5.
Barley's Ol' Ron's Surly Oatmeal Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Barley's Brewing Company;Dark, of course. Sweet, milky roast aroma. Sweet, a bit vacant in the middle, toasty and fruity. Fairly heavy body, but silky and watery at times. Sweet finish.
Rio Salado Cold Front Kolsch Style Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rio Salado Brewing Company;12oz bottle(10/02)-A slightly hazy golden body with a nice hwit ehead which has an aroma of malt and hops. Taste of the same with some sweetness ocming in the back end on this light bodied brew. Not my favorite style but decent tasting.
Rio Salado Cold Front Kolsch Style Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Sweet malty aroma. Hazy yellow with medium white head, head disipated to a thin layer on top of beer. Some lacing. Flavor was bitter at first but by the middle and end sweet pear and apple flavors were present. Good belch after drinking this one so it must be a good beer.
Rio Salado Cold Front Kolsch Style Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rio Salado Brewing Company;On tap. Dark copper color with a light head and lacing. Sweet, fruity aroma with hint of banana and spice. Flavor is fruity with a touch of hops and yeast on the finish.
Rio Salado Cold Front Kolsch Style Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rio Salado Brewing Company;This beer is ever so lightly hazy, it shows a full gold color and is topped by a frothy pale white head. The aroma is yeasty with a hint of spiciness that is a combination of malt and hops, I also pick up a hint of lemon. The taste is dry up front, and actually it is fairly dry throughout. It has been served quite cold, which actually makes this even a bit more refreshing. There is a soft fruitiness that reminds me a bit of banana, though not in the way that a Hefeweizen does. The finish is spritzy from a healthy dose of carbonation and it is bitter from an ample (for a Kolsch) amount of bittering hops. Over all this is light and crisp, just like a Kolsch should be, it also has the characteristic soft fruitiness that one would expect. I do wish that the malt was more evident. This beer is nice and clean, it just needs a bit more malt to balance the carbonation and hop bitterness.
Rio Salado Cold Front Kolsch Style Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rio Salado Brewing Company;"bottle- man, its too bad that this bottle of beer was very old. looking from the ratings, this bottle could be over 3 years old and its still on the shelf. When i found it, i was all excited to try it. I was let down badly. pours light orange with a small fizzy whiteh ead. spicy, citrus aroma with some sourness and actually, the aroma held up farily well. some notes of grapes come to mind in the aroma. The flavors however, were terribly oxidized to the point of overbearing sourness. From the few ""good"" flavors i get from this beer, i can tell that this would have been a fantastic kolsh (wlel its listed as an ale here, but this is definately a kolsh). I hope this brewery brews this beer again!"
Rio Salado Cold Front Kolsch Style Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Medium gold color, medium head. Lighter bodied ale.

Rio Salado Cold Front Kolsch Style Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rio Salado Brewing Company;I am not familiar with German style beers so I am not entirely sure how the should taste and look. Golden color, slight malty nose, sweet start, thin middle, slight hop flavor with more hop bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable when it is 105, but not something to write home about.

Top is light, the finish has a nice hop dry bitter taste, the moderate carbonation makes it a tad acidic.

Aroma of hop, grass, flowers, peach and melon. Medium sweetness, moderate bitterness. Light body, watery texture, average to soft carbonation.
Badger Golden Glory;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);A bit of an odd one this as the peach was quite forward and it could be said by the uncharitable that it tasted artificial. It was a rich beer and that fruity sweetness started to dominate as I made my way down the glass. Perhaps it should have been chilled to within an inch of its life? Overall, not my thing because of the sweetness.
Badger Golden Glory;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Crystal clear golden in colour. Peachy in taste. Quite refreshing, wish I had some over summer.

Guinness Bitter;Dublin, Ireland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;St. James's Gate (Diageo);0.44l can. My god! This is a crazy pour! Milky white from the can, when it settles I see a clear beautiful warming-amber body with a big fantastic creamy head. This took me by surprise, and it looks really nice! The aroma is more subtle with some thin caramel sweetness and hints of zesty fruits. It�s as near as flat on the carbonation and it has a thin oily body. Flavors are, just like the mouthfeel, typical Guinness light roasted. Also, some thin watery caramel blended with both ripe zest, a mild nutty bitterness and not really much more. A bit dull in flavor, but shockingly beautiful in the looks. 28.07.2012

Clear, nutty brown colour. Rather fain aroma of malt and caramel. No carbonation (left), very smooth, but essentially thin, mouth feel.

Aroma is toasted caramel malts and alcohol. Akin to their scottish ale, this is like adding half as many more malts, a tinge more sugar, and a lot more alcohol. Just mildly bitter.

Leopold Brothers Dunkleweizen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Much smoother than the hefe, and downright creamy in the mouth. The flavours are subtler, especially the banana, allowing some of the mellower fruitiness room to mature in the mouth.

Widmer Brothers Blonde Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Another find in the old paper. 7 or 8 years old. Described as bready, citrus, clean. Not much hop. (I didn�t really like most blonde ales, but this one seems to have been appreciated).

Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;Aroma is of light caramel, nuts, roasty. Brown, clear appearance. Light sweetness, full body, creamy, average carbonation. Far superior to the Stingray Ale. Not as widely available as the regular ale on tap. On tap at Lone Star on 7 Mile Beach. Not exported.
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;This the best beer I have tried in a long time. It reminded me of great home brew. Had I known it wouldn�t be available outside of the Caymans, I would have brought back a case or two.
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;"Hmmm... This is my first ""brooding bock beer"" (Do we need a third category?), so this requires some extra thought... The copper/brown body seems to be getting crushed by the Huge, fizzy off-white head. As the head subsides, an aroma of dusty caramel seeps out along with a mildly soapy yeast and some mineral water. Oddly, the effect isn�t totally unpleasant. The flavor is a soiled caramel sweetness, a drop of sour milk, a suggestion of of chocolate along with an earthy, fresh root vegetable bitterness that lasts long into the finish. I�m suprised that I�m not rating this lower but, as stated before, the effect isn�t totally unpleasant. Which causes me to brood. Thanks to my esteemed The LoSBD colleague frankenkitty."
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;Here we find an immense, cream-colored head atop a slight-hazed, coppery/amber body. Aroma finds prunes & cabbage to start with dusty yeasts taking hold later. Oddly tart and malty with vegetal notes, chocolate and lemon amidst earthiness. Interesting, but it leaves an overall impression of bitter lousiness. From a forgettable duty-free liquor store on Grand Cayman
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;smooth brown body and minimal white head. Some carbonation, but not too much. Had a mild caramel malt aroma mixed with some nutty notes. Taste was sweet with a mild hop presance. Really smooth but watery.
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;Draft @ Bacchus (I think) on the GC Island. Poured a clear chestnut brown color with a very large light tan head. Very nice look. Nice sweet amlty aroma with a good amount of caramel, toastiness, and nutty notes. Sweet caramel malt flavor. Light fruitness and some toffee. Medium bodied. Clean finish. I liked this quite a bit although I though it was a brown ale until I went to post the rating.
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;Hazy amber colour. Chewy, earthy, minerally, fizzy, malty character. The malts come across a little bit oxidized and chewy. This is no beach-sipping beer but it is also no complex, rich bock either.
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;Not overly Caribbean thats for sure. A bock is a nice change from the Caribbean lagers. Reddish brown with a small head. Nose of hops and caramel. Quite smooth at first and then turns to a hoppy finish. Decent beer.
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;Had this one on tap at the brewery in grand cayman. it is available there now in the bottle. Has a nice deep brown color to it and a fairly large malt presence. I dug this one as i did the other. I wouldnt drink it on the beach, but i would drink it at the bar after being at the beach all day.
Stingray Dark;Prospect, Grand Cayman Island, Cayman Islands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stingray Brewery;Nice dark color & a nice aroma. Malty caramel flavor in aftertaste but still a nice brew. Very good with seafood!
Fant�me BBB Babillard Dark;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Side by side Babillard dark and light. Thanks Dunt and Stakem. Mahogany body with a thin khaki collar. Sweet fruit, Apple juice, alcohol, funk, basement, musty. Spicy, breads, malty. Unique and intriguing.
Fant�me BBB Babillard Dark;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Back to adding reviews from Fantomefest 2014. Purchased this bottle alongside an �03 Pissenlit at a Skinner Auction. Poured into a Fantome tulip. Poured a murky brown in color with a small cocoa colored head that slowly dissipates to a ring of soapy bubbles around the glass. Nose and taste are earthy, malty, and have a slight coppery taste on the finish. Light mouthfeel with gentle carbonation and a moderate finish. Very nice dark saison, much better than I anticipated based on recent reviews of it here.
Fant�me BBB Babillard Dark;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Bottle, 07/15/2013. Here we go. Pours deep mahogany, medium fuzzy off-white head fades rather quickly, very thin lacing around the glass. Aroma is tart cherries, earthy must, light chocolate, yet dominated by vinegar, nail polish remover. Taste is a slightly more manageable with tart fruity vinegar, watery cola, earthy chartreuse-like spices, dry finish with light roast. Thin body. Well, not especially pleasant at this point, hopefully there are some better bottles out there.
Fant�me BBB Babillard Dark;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;"Here it is, a review of Saison that is likely far past it�s prime but then again seems to have taken on a far different character through the funky yeast overtones... meaning that this brew is FAR different that what is was when first released. The nose is a combination of earthy vapours, touch of dark malt sweetness and ""urine"" driven funky twang. (think the gutters of New Orleans Marti Gras here)... The taste is more of the complex strangeness, twangy and acidic as all get out but then there is a a chalky/ashy black patent malt character that makes this quite interesting. Not that I would say this ""new"" flavor profile is for everyone, but I sort of digging it has it warms. There is a LONG earthy tone upon the finish that is fully Saison in nature. Not any longer for the meek, only lovers of the style need apply to the BBB Dark Babillard. One of the most challenging brews I have had in while."
Sherlocks Home SOB;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Just went to Sherlock's Home last night to catch some of this Bitter. Straight from an oak cask on the bar, this is a serious, old-school Bitter. The aroma was very clean, with a faint hint of freshly washed vegetable. The initial taste revealed celery notes with a hint of citrus. The hops here have no sharp points, rather the whole upper end of the palate is lifted upwards with pride. The only sharpness was in the aftertaste. The end of the pint revealed a half-sweet maple flavor so subtle, that merely looking into the syrup-colored remnants, I swear, made it sweeter. If you live anywhere in (or near) the Cities, go get some this month before its gone. I'm going again in a couple of days.
Sherlocks Home SOB;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;A nice sweetness underlies the hoppy bite of SOB or Special old Bitter. I even liked it better than their regular bitter, which was a surprise. This beer is wonderfully smooth and paired very well with the Scotch egg appetizer I had. So you know if you need something to serve with Scotch Eggs at your next dinner party, SOB is the answer.
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;12oz bottle(10/02)-A yellow golden body with a huge white head and an aroma of hops, citrus(lemon), and some grass like aromas. Taste of the same with some bitterness on the back end on this fairly light beer. A decent tasting lager.
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Draught @ brewery. Pours pale yellow, thin bubbly head, nothing really amazing to look at. Very fresh aroma, lemon like hop notes, just about the most appealing light grainy nose that I�ve smelled on a beer. The beer went down very easily with a fresh zesty hopy zing, very light on the tongue but very tasty. I thought it was quite outstanding for a pilsner/pale lager.
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;12 oz bottle-pours pale yellow with a big sudsy white head. very agressive carbonation. spicy, grassy aroma with some funky lager character-pepper detected. flavors are very grassy, slighly sour and some spicy notes with a touch of lemon. The grainyness is slighly abrasive. A pretty straight forward lager that i thought wasn�t that bad. I didn�t get any diacytl here and if it was there, it was very slight and didnt detract from this beer. underrated!
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Aroma was of just after you watered your grass. Cloudy gold with small head some lacing. Some lemon flavor but also some bitterness that left it feeling and tasting like starch. Sorry not for me.
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;bottle. pale golden colour with a small head. aroma is typical for a pale lager: grass, malt, and faint hops.

Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Crystal clear straw-colored body with a clean white head. Nose is hoppy with some mild funk/sulfur but not overly detracting. Flavor is crisp and very hoppy with light citrus and butter notes. Hop quality is slightly astringent and overpowering. A fair beer, though. Thanks to Brady at Il Vicino for sharing.
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;"This, unfortunately, is the first beer I�ve tried from Rio Salado. It almost reminds me of the ""High Life"", which is not a compliment. Actually Id probably rather have a high life than a thunderbolt based on the sour aftertaste. Just not enjoyable overall."
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Appearance: a hazy, dull orange color, including scads of traveling floaties zipping about, and the head is short, white. Aroma: hoppy, citrus, lemon, slighter suggestions of honey and flowers. On the palate, some hops up front, but gone right-quick, and very mild thereafter, mild to the point of dormancy. Light body, no surprise, and very shy texture. Hops continue to make their presence felt, and the finish is pleasant, but ordinary, and brief. Not an outstanding pilsener in any respect, but decent enough a drink. I guess.
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Bottle poured a cloudy yellow gold with no head. very light hopp aroma,smelled like budweiser. Taste is bitter, not bad not great.
Rio Salado Lightning Bolt Pilsner Blond Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rio Salado Brewing Company;This is absolutely appalling! Shockingly bad! This sharp, heavily metallic lager is massively bitter. It's cloudy, too, which is usually a good thing. Truly awful and undrinkable.
Galbraith's Sirocco Summer Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Pours a lovely bronzed amber. Gorgeous nose, fruity notes, a hints of something sweet. Lovely poise between rich malt and the bitterness and a great summer thirst quencher.
Galbraith's Sirocco Summer Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Galbraith's Brewing Company;(Cask) Clear, amber golden with a small, off-white head. Fruity, lightly citrusy aromas. Medium body with a soft mouthfeel and a low carbonation. Lovely notes of fruit and caramel - and again some vitamins. Dry finish with a moderate bitterness. Lovely. 070208
Galbraith's Sirocco Summer Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Tasted 23/01/2008. Draught at the brewpub. Bright. Deep gold with an airy, diminishing lacy white head. Balanced aroma shows off subtle esters, rich malt, a little minerality, fruity hops tending tropical and a wee lick of caramel. Big pale and caramel malt character in the mouth - perhaps a bit over the top for a summer quaffer - with more of those fruity hops through the middle and that classic Galbraith�s creeping bitterness in behind. Perfect temperature and carbonation. Another splendidly made Galbraith�s pale ale. This one punches well above its weight.

Galbraith's Sirocco Summer Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Galbraith's Brewing Company;I thought this was a lovely summer beer, my only thought was that it was a bit strong for session supping in the summer heat but apart from that it had a lovely flowery hoppy nose with a sweet flowery zesty flavour followed by a lovely long bitter finish, very enjoyable!
Galbraith's Sirocco Summer Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Pint pulled at the brewpub, amber with a white bubbly head. A subtle aroma with some flowery hops. A light mouthfel, plenty of fruit in the hops and juiciness in the malt. Maybe a bit too sweet and perfumed. Not quite there with this yet I do not think, could do with a cleaner palate.

Galbraith's Bob Hudsons Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Galbraith's Brewing Company;"Cask - Galbraith�s, Auckland. A clear, golden amber in colour with a fine soapy white head. This is British bitter as it should be done. Simple, lightly hopped, lovely juicy malt body and sessionable beyond belief. Not going to knock anyone�s socks off flavour-wise but then it�s not designed to. However, in terms of precision and quaffability it�s a real winner. About as solid as you�ll get. Good grassy English hops, some earth, a bit of biscuit and yeast and pleasant mid-fruits coming through. The key here is integration and balance. Light to medium body, soft carbonation and mouthfeel with a soft intensity, modest length finish. After a slog at work, I raced here for something wet and alcoholic to neck and this slaked my thirst a good-un. It goes to show that bigger isn�t always better; as long as you�re nailing it then subtle and low-key can really hit the spot. Next time you�re in Auckland, head to Galbraith�s and the only words you�ll need are: ""a pint of Bob, please."""

Lovely nutty, earthy, biscuity and gently toasty malts complemented by a choice mid-fruit character and grassy, leafy English hoppiness. Light to medium body, soft mouthfeel and a lingering almost grapefruity hoppiness in the finish. Lovely stuff and a taste of home. That soft tangerine on the nose is a joy. Yes, this is gorgeous. Simple but gorgeous. Juicy fruits in the aftertaste. Immensely drinkable. At 5.2% it�s not an ideal session bitter but I won�t let that stop me... Come all the way to NZ and sit in an English-styled pub drinking ESB? Hell yes. It�s not my favourite style for nothing and this more than justified my preference on a rainy mid-winter afternoon.
Galbraith's Bitter and Twisted;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Served at room temp. Soft and flat, friendly caramel right through the palate and mild bitterness to finish. Must be off hand pump.

Flavorful, but a bit smoky for my tastes.
Galbraith's Grafton Porter;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Galbraith's Brewing Company;From handpull at source, a big, black pint with a cream coloured head that disappeared in short order. A nose of licorice, anise, molasses and some faintly herbal aromas that come through well in the flavour. It had a full, rich, silky mouthfeel and was just the ticket for time and place. A pleasure to be back at Galbraith�s and a bit of a favourite beer of mine.
Galbraith's Grafton Porter;Auckland, New Zealand;Porter;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Near identical structure to the ESB. Coffee and dry roast is done really well but intensity is not over the top. Again super authentic in style.

The pour is a red/brown, murky, almost no carbonation, some hanging particulates. (I found this guy in a farflung place, and the botle must be 4 years old). The flavor is tart fruit, cherries, spicy, vinegar. Slightly weak flavor, but decent. The mouthfeel is medium to thick, slick. The finish is a sour and spicy flavor, like mustard, but some fruit sweetness. Not bad at all. I�m actually glad I found this, as it is no longer made.

It ends dry with lingering sugar sweetness and fading brown sugar and dark fruit."

Calders Cream Ale;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Draft at the Highlander near Windsor Castle. Medium sized white creamy head.

Calders Cream Ale;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Tinned. Pale amber with nitrofizz. Thinly flavoured malty brew, not the worst I�ve had because it does deliver some flavour through the suds, but still poor.
Calders Cream Ale;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Extremely smooth and creamy, almost invisible aroma, a bit soapy and bitter. An everyday beer.
Calders Cream Ale;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Very nice creamy, easy drinking pint. Why 'American' Cream Ale ? ..In Scotland it states 'Premium' Cream Ale and is brewed here.
Calders Cream Ale;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Smooth, easy drinking -even if MODERATE consumption is the order of the day.
Calders Cream Ale;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Typical of a beer of this type. An unchallenging drink that, although quite creamy is a little lacking in flavour. Its fairly week flavour belies its strength. A good beer if high consumption is the order of the day.
Suntory Malts;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Suntory Liquors Limited;Tap at a cool Kyoto beer bar! Poured a clear golden colour with a thin broken white head.

Suntory Malts;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Suntory Liquors Limited;Suntory Malts - Finally find this on a Northwest flight, after seeing it mentioned on menu in flight magazine, but still no James Page, probably because they were slowly going out of business, kind of like Northwest Airlines, both based out of MN. This refreshes like a bathhouse in Siberia. Full enough body, full enough color, yet not that filling. Makes me wonder exactly who Malt is, and how to thank him/her for a nice refreshment. Not very aromatic, soft without being sweet. Went great with curried beef and salmon. Wish international flights served all the food you want like they do drinks.
Suntory Malts;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Suntory Liquors Limited;There seems to be a divided opinion on whether this is better than the Premium Malt�s. I prefer the Premium malt�s simply because it is so different from most of the mainstream beers around. That said it is a great beer. Nose is malt and grain. Colour is standard golden lager. Body is semi thin but still decent. The flavour is not as strong or herbal as the Premium Malt�s but still malty with a decent crispness. I also get a sort of bready sweetness to it. I really like this beer and although it�s not as good as the Premium it is a better session beer. I just wish it was available in Taiwan.
Suntory Malts;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Suntory Liquors Limited;Very clean beer that I had for the first time in a long time the other day. It wasn�t nearly as hoppy as I remember, but I also remember there are several versions produced in Japan using slightly different hops and malts, though it never mentions this on the can. Nice clean malt character, well brewed beer and much better than macros in the West.
Suntory Malts;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Suntory Liquors Limited;Decent mid-range beer from Suntory. I�ll echo what others have said as this having more malt flavor that many beers in it�s class and light years better than Asahi dry. A solid beer with nice flavor.
Suntory Malts;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Suntory Liquors Limited;Much better than the more prominent Suntory Premium Malts. With well-rounded lager taste and satisfying palate, this beer has none of the cloying sweetness many of the mass produced brews do.
Suntory Malts;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Suntory Liquors Limited;"350 ml can bought at YATA in Grand Century Place, Mong Kok. Clear golden yellow colour; Three-quarter finger head with crumpety white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Small sticky lacing with active carbonation; Quite fragrant aroma of full malt, with light floral, sticky molasses, thick bread, yeast, lemon, aromatic hops and light grass; Very light sweet taste of malt, with light grains, molasses notes, bread, dough, yeast, light lemon, moderate to light bitter hops and light grass; Mid to light body. Slightly slick palate; Mouth feel is full malt beer in a somewhat thin body, definitely thinner than Suntory Premium Malt�s but still above average maltyness by Premium Lager standard. Slightly grainy, sweetness is just notes, bready and doughty. Easy and nice!... Hoppiness is light floral, lemon and fragrant hop nose. Light lemon and grass in taste. Bitterness is initially low-fi but is pretty dynamic to the tongue for a neat, low astringent semi-finish; Fairly dry after taste. Quite easy and savory to mouth. Comments: I can�t help but to think this is the small brother of the rich and tasty Suntory Premium Malt�s - body and maltyness is thinner, a bit grainy palate, and slightly lesser hoppiness. Yet it still shines with fragrant floral hops, and good bready and doughty mouth feel. Given I have good access (and cheaper to buy!) to Suntory Premium Malt, this one serves as second banana. A decent lager nevertheless."

Lancaster Lancastrator Doppelbock;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Lancaster Brewing Co.;On tap at Harrisburg store. Pours a rich reddish amber with a thick off white head. Taste is malty with just a touch of hop balance to keep it honest. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Lancaster Lancastrator Doppelbock;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Although this brew varies wildly from season to season (and they appear to have changed the recipe drastically recently), I am going to rate it on the Doppelbock that I often know and love. This brew is disarmingly strong in alcohol. The taste only hints at that underneath, and it is easy to get lost in the complex flavors of the malt, fig, and dark chocolate. As of late, there is a very strong coffee overtone which I do not care for. Much too similar to stouts which over-use that. This beer goes down amazingly easily. It truly is an easy-to-drink beer. Not exactly �lagerish� as the description implies, but not too far removed. When made properly, and served in a fine pint glass with regular bar staples, this is my favorite brew in the world. It�s not perfect, but that�s what I love it for.
Lancaster Lancastrator Doppelbock;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Lancaster Brewing Co.;I thought I was getting a growler of celtic rose, but it turned out to be the dopplebock. The aroma was sweet and malty with a bit of hops, the appearance was a clear dark amber with a 2-finger head. The flavor was malty, and bitter but clean. The palate was fairly thin, average. Overall its a good clean beer, but a little to bitter for me. It goes pretty well with a scoop of vanilla ice cream right in the beer.
Lancaster Lancastrator Doppelbock;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Lancaster Brewing Co.;I was surprised that this was a nine percent beer. I thought it was good. It was smooth and I could drink quite a few of these. I nice showing from Lancaster. Try this one if you get your hands on it.
Lancaster Lancastrator Doppelbock;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Sort of a cherry wood color with light lacing,tan head. Nice piney aroma. Didn�t expect the hoppy front. Sort of like a malty pale ale. Very good, however, if you choose to eat here, they�re very proud of their mediocre food. Enjoy the beer.
Lancaster Lancastrator Doppelbock;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Tap @ LBC - Dark amberish bronze, tan creamy head.

Lancaster Lancastrator Doppelbock;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Lancaster Brewing Co.;I really did enjoy this beer, even though I only had a smaller sample of it. It was a dark brown color, almost in line with Optimator, and the malt profile was delicious. Give this one a try if you can find it.
Brewzzi Dunkel Weizen;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Golden-brown, shade darker than the Black Duke.. Rather phenolic (bubblegum) nose with that artificial candy banana. Sort of a slippery, oily texture. More candy banana with the slight toffee underneath. Simple take - it needs yeast!
Brewzzi Dunkel Weizen;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Dark amber, looks filtered. Sweet banana nose. Thin, flat palate, does not match the style. Fairly clean malt flavors with a dry finish. Not terrible, not terribly good.

ABV on this was 5.5% according to the bartender. Pours and opaque, light mahogany with no head, whatsoever. I�m not sure if this was a result of a piss-poor pull or the chemistry of the beer. I did try to swirl things up and with the same results... Lots of malts, a mild dose of hops, nutty, and bananas on the nose. All in character for the style. A crisp beer with lots of malty tone and banana. Finishes clean. Light mouth feel, with very low carbonation. Need to pick up the carbonation a bit to add some punch, and a head. I�ll try again to see if it was the server�s mistake. Other than that, a good representation.
Brewzzi Dunkel Weizen;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Pours murky hazy brown with meek off white head. It has a sweet full aroma of candi sugar mixed with some dark fruity esters like plums along with mild spiciness and pepper. The taste seems kind of thin in body to start where it comes across milder than the aroma had suggested. I get a watery prune and date sense along with sweet malts, mild caramel and Belgian candi sugar.
Brewzzi Dunkel Weizen;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft at Florida Brewers Guild Beer Fest 2008. Full rating updated as soon as I am more coherent.
Brewzzi Dunkel Weizen;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brewzzi Microbrewery;First of all I have to say that I feel right at home in a place where the first thing you notice is the brewmaster's head popping out of the top of the 650 gallon lauter tun! This beer had a nice carmel color with a slight yeasty haze. The aroma of cloves and banana is quite prevalent. Wonderfully fruitty,spicy flavor as well. I would recommend this BP to anyone visiting the Boca Raton area. Good food and above average beer.

Seven Sisters Hard Apple Cider;Sandpoint, Idaho, United States;Apple Cider;Selkirk Cider Co.;I think this was the most over carbonated cider I have ever had out of a bottle (next to french cidres of course). This didn't leave much of a positive impression on me and in fact I'm a little disappointed I drove >50 miles to find and ended up having to by an entire case of it just to try it. Damn Pennsylvania liquor laws! Luckily the case was under $20. That should have told me something then and there.

Seven Sisters Hard Pear Cider;Sandpoint, Idaho, United States;Perry;Selkirk Cider Co.;More of a D'anjou than a Bartlett flavor. Incredibly smooth without being too sweet. Low alcohol for a cider.
Seven Sisters Hard Pear Cider;Sandpoint, Idaho, United States;Perry;Selkirk Cider Co.;Not a bad cider, I prefer apple ciders and am anxious to try Seven Sisters apple, but the pear goes down smooth with a nice clean crisp pear flavor.

Slater's Supreme;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Slater's Ales;Cask @ Monty�s, Shrewsbury. Perhaps a resurrected recipe. Re-designed pump-clip, labelled as an American Bitter if there is such a thing. Not supreme anyway, but it does tick all the boxes for a bitter. Not much else to say.
Slater's Supreme;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Slater's Ales;"Cask at the Leinster Arms - Bayswater, London. Pours clear gold with a frothy, white head. Solid golden ale, with nice juicy tangerine character, low bitter hay and citrus rind, a bit of sweetening white bread. Light bodied with fine, massaging carbonation; good condition. Nicely balanced to finish with more citrusy hops and moderately sweet, pale bread. Good one."
Slater's Supreme;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Slater's Ales;Cask at The Wellington, Birmingham. Poured a poured a clear light copper with a broken bubbly white head. The aroma is grassy citrus. The flavour is medium bitter with a light malt hop bitter palate and a long bitter finish. Medium to light bodied with soft carbonation. Lacks flavour but easy to drink.

Heavily sparklered Gillette-headed gold killing all but a faint whiff of buttery pinecone. Full and slick with a flabby, orange-accented blandness. Hints of cream, pastry and pine.

Slater's Supreme;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Slater's Ales;First tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in March 1998. Cask, gravity dispense. Pale russet in colour with a thin loose white head. Slight flowery perfume noted in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malts give a digestive biscuit base with orange peel tones to the flavour. Citric hops compliment the malt well and give a citrusy fruit note to the aftertaste. Finish is quite dry with marmalade and gingernut biscuit notes. An ok session ESB and worth trying.

Mesa Cerveza Schnorzenboomer Light Lager;Cortez, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mesa Cerveza / Main Street Brewing;Very light golden, straw-like, with a very subtle haze to it. Head died out before I finished pouring. Mouthfeel was lightly carbonated, slightly watery and rather syrupy and cloying. Malt flavors were very sweet and milk-like. Almost had some nice nuances in the malts, but they were kind of hard to find and they became overpowered by the heavy sweetness and grass-like hops. Almost had a fruity thing going on. Some herbal-flavored hops, too, with just a hint of bitterness in the finish. Sweetness lingers unpleasantly into the aftertaste, without enough carbonation or hop spice/bitterness to keep it in check. Much too sweet and sticky for my buds.
Mesa Cerveza Schnorzenboomer Light Lager;Cortez, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mesa Cerveza / Main Street Brewing;Virtually no head. Body is light yellow. Aroma is lightly hoppy (flowers, herbs, lemon), lightly malty (bread, cookie), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with a light note of banana. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Smells like someone spilled a little bit of weissbier into this. It's light, no doubt, but actually kind of interesting in the aroma department.
Mesa Cerveza Schnorzenboomer Light Lager;Cortez, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mesa Cerveza / Main Street Brewing;I'm not sure if this is a lager or not but tastes like the style. White foam, light golden color (SPN 2.5 or so), slightly bready and light malt sweetness and fruitiness. Very easy drinking. Could be cleaner.

Dragonmead Dead Monk Abbey Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Belgian yeast aroma of cloves and sweetness. Dark amber red pour with no head.

Mesa Cerveza Schnorzenboomer Dark/Amber Doppelbock;Cortez, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Mesa Cerveza / Main Street Brewing;Bottle from the brewery in Cortez. Pours a very deep brown with minimal white head. Aroma of deep malty sweetness, dark fruits, and some spiciness. Taste is extremely prickly on the palate, much more like an ale than the smoothness I generally associate with lagered beers. Taste is of deep, dark cherry fruits and dark malts. Aftertaste is very dry with hints of oak....and a little pine-sol? Definitely not very to-style, but very different and interesting (tasted much different on tap as well)
Second Street Otowi Pale Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Second Street Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the Railyard location. Pours a clear orangish gold with a white head that dissipates slowly and laces. Aroma has notes of both earthy and light citrus with a light grain backing. Flavor has a nice light sweet citrus with a touch of grass and a light grain backbone.
Second Street Otowi Pale Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Second Street Brewery;Dark golden with a fizzy white head. Dry earthy cereal grain and earthy hop flavors with a mild bitterness. Not bad.

Second Street Otowi Pale Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Second Street Brewery;Pours with a fluffy head. Darker than most pale ales and a lot more floral arma.

Second Street Festivus;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Second Street Brewery;Light maroon without much of a thin grey white head. Aroma reminds me of a blow pop, and no, that is not a euphemism. Bitter hits me 1st. Has a grassy pine citrus that burns my tongue a bit. A burnt straw note is there too. Finish is more citrus and grass with some caramel.
Second Street Festivus;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Second Street Brewery;Sampler at the brewery. Pours a thin head, with loads of attractive lacing, over a clear, dark amber (SRM 10-12) body.....nose is redolent of pine, grapefruit, late pineapple.....taste early is slight toffee, then grapefruit, finishing with a pine/resin bitterness....mouth feel is medium, carbonation low. Reading the prior reviews the recipe (malt, hop bills) must have changed substantially. It has been almost two years since the last review. I got no clove, minimal roasted malt in this one. This was more of an IPA variant than a Brown. It was by far the best of tasting this day.
Second Street Festivus;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Second Street Brewery;Draught. Pours dark molasses brown with edgy off-white head. Floral fragrant hop aroma with background caramel malt and cloves. Chocolate bitter hop and medium roasted malt flavor. Medium bodied and clean palate.
Second Street Festivus;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Second Street Brewery;Light bronze body. Rich aroma of fruit, candy malt, and perfumy hops. A medium-bodied, hoppy seasonal ale with some underlying woodiness. However, the overriding feature in this beer is a strange and off bitter flavor that's literally like you ate a fistful of flowers. Flavor is much too perfumy.
Second Street Festivus;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Second Street Brewery;Some floral hues over the big oaty, malty brown ale-ish brew. Lots of yeasty influence, slightly tangy finish. Odd and likeable.

Aromas of mild caramel malts with flavors of mild caramel sweetness balanced with the slight hop bitterness.
Beaver Street Railhead Red;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Beaver Street Brewery;The fact that Beaver St and Lumberyard share facilites and beers makes it hard to get ratings in the right place. Nonetheless, this a great strong fresh hop aroma. Looks nice. This isn�t as hoppy as the aroma but has the light flavor of an amber. Quite tasty.

Beaver Street Railhead Red;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Beaver Street Brewery;Served in a pint glass from tap. Had this at the Brewery, which was a very nice place. Review from notes. 3.5 A: Clear orange amber color, though the lighting was low so I could be off a bit. No head. The pour was a bad one and the beer was filled almost all the way up to the top of the glass so I can�t tell you much more. 3.0 S: Other than a touch of crystal malt, there isn�t anything going on. Rather disappointing. 4.5 T: Delicious and complex. Light fruits with a healthy bitterness that balances well. Malts are grainy, but not overly so. Herbal hop flavor. Everything meshes so well to make a great tasting brew. 4.0 M: Medium body. Smooth and creamy with good carbonation. 4.5 D: Excellent brew. This beer made the trip up to Flagstaff from Sedona worth while. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 10-02-2009 05:15:57

Beaver Street India Pale Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Beaver Street Brewery;I went to my first brewery & restaurant this year on vacation with my family in Flagstaff, AZ - Beaver Street Brewery. We went for an early dinner -- I was excited and anticipation had definitely built up. To be honest, I was disappointed. The waitress was experienced, efficient, professional but really rushed us through and did not seem interested at all in working with me to recommend and try Beaver Street beers. I had their Hopshot IPA which the waitress explained was a combination of their IPA and Red Ales. I wasn�t impressed and she had rushed to convince me to order one of the larger sizes because it was on special. I wish I had taken the time to study the menu and get a flight of tasters. Not a great experience. A few days later, had a much better experience at their sister Lumberyard Brewery -- check out my review of Lumberyard Flagstaff IPA.
Beaver Street India Pale Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;IPA;Beaver Street Brewery;HopShot IPA - pleasant enough but thoroughly average. Balanced is not what I want in an IPA, or just a bitter aftertaste. Showcase the hops!!

Steep Canyon Stout;Glen Ellen, California, United States;Stout;Humes Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Translucent black brown color topped by a thick creamy tan head.

Steep Canyon Stout;Glen Ellen, California, United States;Stout;Humes Brewing Company;Been sitting on this bottle for years, thought it woyld be completely spoiled, surprise! Beer is at least 10-12 years old, still drinking pretty good!

Extra point overall for how it held up.

Mount Nittany Jeds Red Ale;Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mount Nittany Brewing Company;Malty aroma with hints of chocolate and fruit. A little metallic with some vapors. Red-brown beer with small white head. Medium thick body and medium-heavy carbonation. A bit sweet in taste, malty and a little bitter. Alcohol - like a watery bock. A decent little beer, but needs a bit more balance.
Mount Nittany Jeds Red Ale;Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mount Nittany Brewing Company;Once again, i have exhausted the supply of new beers down at my local bar upon ordering this puzzling offering known as Jeds Red. I was apprehensive at first to try a beer with a drunken cartoon dog on the label but its a local brewery so i said what the hell. The beer was good, not mind blowing good, but very good indeed. Dark reddish brown, creamy head, and lots of malt flavor with a slight tangy bitter finish. Quite impressive.

Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;Pours a yellow color, not completely clear and has very little head with some lace. Aroma is grassy and a little citrousy. Flavor is soft and grassy with a dry hoppy and clean finish. Light and thirst quenching refreshing. This is a pretty good pilsener.
Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;Much better than expected! Crystal clear, golden lager. Thick, creamy, white head with good retention and stratus cloud-like lacework. Soapy, grassy, white pepppery aroma. Well-balanced flavor. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Short, semi-dry, semi-sweet finish. If you like pilseners, get your hands on one of these.
Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;"Huge rocky head. Pale golden. Mildly hoppy, slightly sweet aroma. Odd earthy flavor. ""Dirty"" might be a better word. A unique and terrible beer from New Zealand."
Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;Not unlike Ringnes Pilsener. Malty and slightly hopped. I like. Good citrus aroma, too.
Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;Initial skunk turns to a grainy, lemony nose. Foamy fizzy head. Typical pils taste is highlighted with lemon undertones. Astringent finish and soapy mouth feel lost points with me.
Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;Hoppy, moderate flower citrus aroma. Pale yellow white virtually non lacing head. Sour and oily finish, blah
Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;No good. Skunky, rotten taste. Drain pour material here. I might have had a bad bottle, but I really dont like the style.
Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;The unusual thing about this beer was the stickiness of the foam. It left the glass looking like someone had scraped marshmallow cream out of it. Green bottle, so-so label, screw-off cap. Garden variety lager, a trifle skunky. A tart palate.
Auckland Pilsener;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Auckland Brewers;The first New Zealand beer I had was Steinlager. It was late August 1993, at Fogg 'n Suds (which at the time was a well-respected beer bar chain in Vancouver). It was the Kitsilano location (probably the best neighbourhood on the planet), and it was the end of August, right before I went to university. That night, I had for the first time the long-departed but still missed Okanagan Old Munich (a rare dunkelweizen that I actually liked enough to buy on multiple occasions) amongst others. Anyway, they had a contest going that night involving playing Pole Position on a big screen. All these punks today with their Halo and games that have IA and everything - to hell with that I'll take the old school games that I used to play at Chuck E Cheese anyday. Give me Galaga, 1984, Pac-Man...you're damn right. Anyway, although Grand Prix was my shit, I was decent enough at Pole Position to score third place, which was a pair of Sam Adams footed pilsner glasses. I had never heard of Sam Adams at the time. Exotic shit, that was. A year late, when I got to actually try a Sam Adams I was already geared up for it, and loved it. Now, one of those glasses didn't make it to see 2002, but the other one did. And that is what I used to pour my second ever New Zealand beer, nine freakin' years later, into. Yeah, it's a grassy pseudo-pils around 22 IBUs with some honey and grain husk notes and an off-dry finish, but more importantly, the drought is over and I can get on with those Kiwi beers at the Ratebeer Summer Party next week in peace.
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;"I really like this brown ale! Sparkling clear, deep, dark, ruby ale. Medium-sized, frothy, lightly tanned head with good retention and brussels lacing (I just like to throw around the term ""Brussels lacing"" every now and then). Very light, pleasant aroma. Nice notes of chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon. The flavor is decently balanced, but a hint on the sweet side. Chocolatey. Medium-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and light carbonation. The finish leaves the mouth feeling parched for quite some time. Great session beer at $.86 per bottle and 4% ABV. Unfortunately, it will be available for only a limited time in my area."
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;"Brown bottle, 11.15 oz/330ML, with twist-off cap. Oval lable with a dragon linking motif in the background around which are the words ""Naturally brewed Premium Dark Ale."" It has a medal printed that states it wone a Gold Medal at the 1999 Australian International Beer Awards. Imported by Wine Mates, L.L.C. in Ellicott City, MD. Website www.abgroup.co.nz Oh yeah, the beer... Pours like a Coke with a bit of a head, but not much, and some lacing. Smells malty and rather sweet. Tastes...okay. Roasted malt is the most noticable flavor with coffee and chocolate hints. It could use more hops for balance, IMO. Funny, but it tastes a little bit like a Coke, too. There's a bit of a burnt aftertaste to it. Mouthfeel is, well, about like a Coke. It's about the same thickness and carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. There's nothing offensive here and at only 4% ABV, it would be easy to have several of these while doing stuff around the house or whatever."
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;Pours a dark brown with a medium light beige head with decent lacing. Slightly fruity aroma with roasted malt.
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;Pretty roasty for a brown ale. Almost in light porter territory. Black like a Xingu.
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;I was not too sure what to expect from this one. Pours a dark if not rich brown color with a medium light beige head. Fair lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and a little fruit. Flavor is very mild which makes it both uninteresting and easy to drink. Finish is a little thin but there are some hops in it. Nothing offensive, but pretty unexciting.
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;Nose is a mixture between chocolate and cough medicine. Black body with a little hazelnut brown head. Taste like espresso, but has also the typcial flavor of medizine. Thin finish.
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;Woody and charcoal nose, dark brown color and a lovely tan head. Sharp roasted and burnt malt taste, almost like tobacco. Strong and aggressive beer.
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;Bottle. Dark brown and almost black with a laced brown head. Roasted malt aroma. Fairly light body with a grainy malt feel. Crisp with a carbonation bite. It leaves a pleasant and strong aftertaste.
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;Dark brown color, medium head. A light to medium bodied dark ale. Roasted malts, slightly hoppy. Some coffee and chocolate like flavor, slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is round, but a little thin. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Auckland Dark Ale;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Auckland Brewers;Serve coolish. This is not a porter. .......................................

CB Pilsner;Bergen, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;This is one a typical thirst quencher. Not a bad summer pilsner. A clear easy drinker.
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Hazy golden colour, white head. Aroma of malts, cellar, mushroom, funk. Tart flavour, malts, hint of cheese. Malty finish, funk. Quite old but held up nicely! (from 75cL bottle @ Grand Old Lambic Tasting, Jtclockwork's place, NJ. 2004 vintage. Thanks for sharing, Nick!)
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Bottle thanks to tectactoe for sharing. Not sure on vintage but it�s very old. Hazy gold pour with a small head that fades to a thin ring. Aromas are strawberry, cheddar cheese, white wine and musty basement. Tastes like a cheddar bomb. Moderate lemon and white wine in the finish too. Light lacto sourness. Not bad but not really my thing.
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Bottle: Semi-clear, bright amber color with a soapy, frothy white collar outlining the edges. Best Fantome clarity I�ve ever seen. Aroma has a huge wild strawberry gummy candy note with strong hints of white wine, cork, a slight touch of horsey funk, & toasted grains. Flavor has a tart bit of lemon flesh up front, followed by white grape, mild stone fruit, faint grain, & some modest lacto-like tartness. Light bodied. Tastes much different than it smells, but I enjoy both. Finishes clean, light, semi-dry. Borderline Pinot Grigio. Really nice stuff.
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;The thing about Fantome is that you roll the dice on every bottle you trade for/pick up, especially when it�s an older bottle. I traded for this recently and shared it with some folks at Dark Lord Day. With all the recent reivews being generally positive, I was really excited to finally give this one a whirl. It poured a cloudy orange in color with a half fingers owrth of head into my Greenbush taster. Both the nose and the flavor displayed a significant amount of breadiness. I didnt really get any grape, apple, or pear that others picked out and despite it�s age, it wasn�t all that oxidized, it was just very plain and bready. The mouthfeel was light to moderate with good carbonation and a moderate finish. Disappointment seemed to be the consensus on this bottle which was unfortunate. A lot of people expressed how they loved this beer before but this just wasnt good. Oh well, that�s part of the allure of Fantome I guess.
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Old ass bottle. IT is big time oxidized, some minitiness and cardboard, some spices.
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Huge, huge thanks to Ryan for this one! Longtime want. Served in a Fantome tulip. 2004. Dry, musty basement with a bit of earth. Very light bread crust. Touch of acidity in the background. Lightly bubbly. Bit of oxidation.
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;2004 bottle, enjoyed on 12/19/12. Served in a Hill Farmstead stem. Pour: Murky burgundy, with a two fingers of light tan, soapy head. Leaves some solid lacing. Head hangs around for a while. Smell: Up front, big lactic tones and some molasses. Gives way to figs and dates, and some lemon juice. Light caramel, and a light balsamic vinegar. Finishes on the nose with a lemony tartness. Taste: Follows the nose with a big lactic tartness, and lots of lemon juice. Some pear skin. A big molasses comes through, with some nice caramel. A light oak (is this aged on oak for any period?). Finishes with red wine tannins and some lemon tartness. Mouthfeel: Really light for the flavors it produces, which is really quite nice. Good carb, and the tartness is just right. Overall: Time did another Fantome well. I�m very lucky to have stumbled across this bottle and have a chance to try it. Delicious!
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;750mL bottle, courtesy of julian, pours a cloudy dark orangey brown with a voluminous white head. Aroma is a bit oxidized with metallic notes, Belgian yeast, and stale wet cardboard. Flavour of wet cardboard, cork, and other dry, construction site notes. Lively carbonation. Too bad this isn�t a bit newer as I think this would be very enjoyable fresher, but as is now, this is past its prime. Not s good.
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Huge thanks to Umberto for opening this during our epic night of drinking at the Goblin Pub in Pavullo nel Frignano, Italy. Pours a very cloudy, bright golden orange color with tangerine edges and a half finger off-white head that quickly settles into a thin ring that soon dissapears. Not much in the way of lacing. This beer has a very complex aroma with lambic, farmhouse and wheat beer notes bouncing off of each other. Lots of earthy funk with hints of barrel, wet hay and cobweb along with zesty autumnal spice, bready yeast, citrus and light fruit notes. Slight herbal/vegetal presence with lemon peel, pepper, bread and apple. Really odd combination but the nose is pretty inviting. Medium bodied and again, very complex with hints of lambic, saison, vegetable/spiced beer and wheat notes playing off of one another. Slightly tart and puckering with a decent amount of earthy funk followed by zesty spice, bread, sweet malt, light fruit and citrus. A decent amount of sourness but not harsh or acidic. More funk than anyhing else with grass, straw, hey and wood flavor. There�s also peppery spice with coriander, cinnamon and clove followed by caramel malt, apple, pear and bread. A truly unique beer. I don�t really know what to make of it because it�s so weird but it�s very complex and quite flavorful.
Fant�me La Gourmande;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Bottle purchased today at Bottleworks. 2004 vintage. Color is clear coppery color with a bit of haze. Lots of carbonation, leaves a nice snowy white creamy layer of head upon the first pour. Aroma is of cork, cardboard, raw brocolli. Possibly oxidized over the course of 8 years. Mouthfeel is smooth with good carbonation. Taste consists of wood/cork, green apples, flowery hops, and on the finish an odd (yet not completely odd for a Fantome) leathery/tobacco quality. I wish I could have tried this fresh. Not my favorite Fantome in its current vintage. If you have this, I say drink it now.

Timothy Taylor's Celebration Royal Ale (Bottle);Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Timothy Taylor's;not nearly as amazing as landlord on cask, but still a very tasty straightforward pale ale. lacks any british fruitiness. strong caramelly malt and spicy aroma. initially i thought it was spiced, then i realised it was styrian hops. the spicy, floral taste builds and builds and then coats your entire mouth in bitterness - and the great thing is the powerful, biscuitty malt is still right there with it all the way in the finish. could really kick arse on cask i'm sure. rer8: damn, this is still amazingly bitter and hoppy 6 months past best before! bumping it up a coupla points

Quite chewy and savoury mouthfeel, amazing for such a light beer; English ale at its best. No new aftertaste, bitterness fades ever so slowly away. Worthy of the Landlord people, Britains'' all-time best cask. I love this beer, and am amazed at some of the other comments."

Brakspear 2.5;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brakspear (Marston's);A combination of dry malty flavor and light hops. Very low alcohol content, but the flavor is still solid. I really like this brewery - and their packaging is beautiful.
Brakspear 2.5;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brakspear (Marston's);They say that beer rots the brain cells: I didn't realise when I bought this that the 2.5 of the title referred to the alcohol content. However, it is a quite pleasant little drink for those who wish to stay sober and yet enjoy a beer. Hoppy and bitter enough to pass itself off as something stronger. A traditional British ale, just lacking a bit in substance with a feel of tin around the mouth.
Brakspear 2.5;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brakspear (Marston's);Bottled. Less carbonated than Live Organic, which is sampled before this � slightly smaller head. Sweet, slightly hoppy aroma. As mentioned before this does taste rather thin and watery, though there is some pleasant, underlying bitterness. For a lower alcohol brew it is good, but I see little benefit in a low alcohol beer unless it is totally alcohol free.
Brakspear 2.5;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brakspear (Marston's);The good thing about drinking bland beers like Bud is that after three or four the alcohol kicks in and you stop worrying about the lack of taste. The bad thing about drinking this bland beer is that you need seven or eight before you forget how thin and tasteless it is. I can accept alcohol free beers simply because I dont drink them. This just seems a waste of a fermenter.
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;Bottled, pasterised, 500ml, ring pull cap. Clear Amber with white bubbly head. The Ruddles part of the GK brand is going the hedgerow, organic route to protect the name, but this is still a poorly brewed beer. Adjuncty flavours in the malt, almost like rice and a boiled veg note on the finish, brewed tea. Not good.
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;Could be more than it is. too flat and too little bitter to be named as one. anyway an enjoyable beer.
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;Tried this a few times a while back, there was usually a bit of a haze to it, some bottles worse than others, head retention poor as well. Those problems aside, it�s pretty much bog standrd stuff.
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;(Bottle 50 cl) Very pretty, clear amber with a small head. Vague nutty, malty notes and a marked bitter finish. Not that much going on here... 090601
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;From the bottle this is another below average bitter going around,but this time it�s organic,a pity.
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;Amber, ok head. Not much aroma, mostly something flowerish, faint. Flavor mainly bitter, only a little hint of sweetness.
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;This is OK, but it's still a filtered and pasteurised bottled ale. Organic credentials could be better emphasised by producing a live bottle-conditioned beer. However, even non bottled-conditioned beers can be more interesting in organic form because none of the standard UK hop varities are grown organically, which means that some more interesting hops, in this case Hallertau, have to be used. This has produced a vaguely spicy, but not very bitter beer and the underlying malty tones are consequently not entirely in balance. Mediocre. Bottled, May 2003
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;Bottled. Pasteurised quality and some light fizz. A good tannic tea flavour envelopes the mouth along with some nutty notes. Tastes deeper and darker than regular Ruddles, though there is a Ruddles feel about the whole thing. Acceptable.
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;An amber beer with no head. The aroma is slightly sweet and fruity. The flavor is of a good malt sweetness but a little flat. An OK ale.
Ruddles Organic Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greene King;Bottled. Reddish amber, average head. Nutty aroma. Dry and medium bodied. Fresh, soft and fruity with salty, really bitter finish. Not complex, but plain and very enjoyable.
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;12oz bottle(10/02)- A cloudy yellow with an aroma of banana, clove, and some lemon. Taste was the same with the typical hefe flavors. A pretty decent hefe from ann american brewer.
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Hazy straw color. Great citrus aroma. A nice refreshing hefe with a little tartness at the end.
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Bold banana aroma along with vanilla. Cloudy yellow body with small white head that disipated quickly. Flavor had banana and lemon at first. Toward the middle beer got a sour pear flavor with the bubble gum at the end. Good refreshing beer.
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;tap at taphouse-downtown Tempe, AZ-pours a cloudy yellow hue with a beautiful white head and AWESOME lacing. bigtime banana, lemon and clove aroma with notes of orange peal and pear. flavors were not as robust as the aroma, but were light banana and spice mostly. Even though the flavors were more subdued, i still think this is a great hefe that i guess is�nt as good in the bottle. also, some bubblegum flavors came out as the beer warmed. Lite carbonation fit this very nicely! Very under-rated and a must try on tap!
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;I liked this wheat beer. It was slightly tart, true to style and appealing in both flavor and aroma. Hints of banana, nutmeg, cornbread, butter toffee and vanilla are present in the aroma. Tastes of cloves mainly, but also nutmeg and vanilla. I really liked the mouthfeel as well. This stuff is quite good.
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Had this during one of the hurricanes that cam through the Philly area. Florida man, I feel sorry for you guys. Well this beer wasn�t that good and my future sister-in law got is for me. This was overly cloved for me. Way to tart and sweet is the best way to describe it.
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Appearance: bright, golden yellow, hazy at the top, clearer at the bottom, with a short white head that�s quick to close. Aroma: large, sweet citrus, sugar, spice, so much that it reminded me of a tripel, which is most unexpected in a hefe weizen. Oooo!! The sweet�n�citrusy sour character right up on the palate was a bit much, and not appreciated. I need my weizens on the mellower side, not so harsh with the citric acid! Grainy wheat texture appears, plays with the tongue for a spell, then vanishes. Finish is short, body on the small side. Unfortunately, this was not a hefe weizen that went down smooth with me. I hope that it was just an off-bottle, and I thank Good Sir Gusler for sending the sample!
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;this sucked,,,no head no lace sour bitter,,,lokked like beer had been sitting in glass for a week,,,bad bottle??? THIS WENT DOWN THE DRAIN!
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Pours a very light yellow color with a very small fizzy head. Aroma is unlike that of any Hefe I've tasted to date. Absolutely zero banana or clove-spice of any kind. Detected unexpected sourness in the flavor. Watery body. Maybe this was past its prime because the other raters of this beer seemed to have very different take.
Rio Salado Hurricane Hefeweizen Wheat Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Mine tastes about halfway to a lambic. It's plenty yeasty and cloudy, but the flavor just has too much sourness. Sad. I can tell this had potential when fresh.
Riverside Old Railcar Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);Reddish looks, fruity malt nose. Appley light oakiness and a little dryness run throughout. Firm maltiness. Pretty robust and hearty but just lacking a little depth for the style.
Hirter Dunkel Draught;Micheldorf, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brauerei Hirt;On tap at the source in Austria. Caramel dark pour, ivory foam with drafts while lowering. Nose: caramel hints with milled coffee, roast. Mouth: again caramel mild feel, roast prominent character, round, elegant.

Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Poured into a snifter. Burnt amber color with good clarity. White head that drops rather quickly. Aroma reminds me of sauerkraut. Biscuity, cabbage, some soy, which is odd. Cabbagey flavors reminds me of St. Patrick�s Day dinner, corned beef and cabbage. Dry mouthfeel with a mild carbonation level. It is drinkable, but the cabbage feels weird on my palate. Would be great with some bratwursts. Could it be a tainted bottle? DMS I assume.
Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;12oz bottle. Pours a light copper color with an off white head that has decent retention. Smells of grainy malts and light caramel with a slight hint of alcohol. Smooth, mild malty taste, with a mild bitterness. Not much flavor from the hops. Medium to light bodied.
Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Bottle poured a clear amber with a lingering ring of ivory foam.

Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Yellow straw pour with nice white head. Hops and malt. Better than mass produced pale ales, but average micro. I tend not to like this style very much. Rated 3/19/03
Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Pours a murky golden orange color. Aromas of citrus hops, caramel malts. Flavor is bitter and hoppy with a touch of pepper/grapefruit with sweet malt.
Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;This was a pretty good straight up pale ale. It has all the typical malts and hops. I remember having this straight off the taps at the brewery itself. It taste so much better there. Too bad they decided to change their ways and retire this one.
Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Orange amber in color, the egg shell white head dies out within a minute, leaving a thin layer of minute bubbles. Some nice lace on the glass. The aroma is malty (crystal?) with surprisingly little hop. That missing hop really comes through in the flavor and the aftertaste. Thick, almost chewy with a light effervescence. A decent brew...
Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;12 oz bottle from trade. Poured copper in color with a large frothy beige head. Aroma of grass, hay, light hops and wet grains. Tastes of very mild hops, lightly sweet, earthy, bland and not really that good.
Buzzards Bay Pale Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buzzards Bay Brewing;draft at brewery.....purely transparent medium brown pour with a thick,frothy off white head..... aroma of earthy grassy hops which make it hard to distinguish between the pils and some of the others..... flavors of mild grassy hops with a good supporting malt backbone.

Cubana 59;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;Botella 33 cl de la antigua internacional Oviedo. Lote 08. hasta 17-02-2002. (r30). Tomada en 2001. sin mucho que decir, salvo que lo �nico que merece la pena es la etiqueta.
Cubana 59;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;One of John Martin�s aromatized cheap lagers with a trendy look in a transparent longneck bottle - a particular style I can only meet with deep distrust. Which proved justified in this case: this was a clear, orangey blonde beer with thin, snow white head and off-putting aroma and taste of sugar, brown rhum, some grainy sourishness and a finish dominated by artificial rhum extract, in a chemical way, as well as cloying sweetness. Must have been one of the first tastes I had of this type of lager and like very good beers, very bad ones leave a lasting impression just as well...
Cubana 59;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;Bier mit Rum auf kubanisch gestylt...aus Belgien. Man riecht den Rum derartig deutlich raus, das ich meine Zweifel hab, ob noch Bier dabei ist. Der Geschmack h�lt sich jedoch wider jeglicher Bedenken zur�ck, am Anfang zwar eindeutig auszumachen verfl�chtigt sich der Rumgeschmack im Laufe des Trinkprozesses immer mehr und macht einem leicht herben Mittelteil Platz, der in einen sehr w�ssrigen Nachgeschmack mit lasch fruchtigem Aroma �bergeht. Die leckere, vom Rum stammende S��e und Fruchtigkeit k�nnten hier ruhig noch einmal zur Geltung kommen. F�r die Masse gebraut bekommt man nach einer gewissen Zeit ein wonniges warmes Gef�hl im Bauch, leider kommt mit dem Gef�hl auch ein letztes mal ein Nachgeschmack auf, der mich an Erbrochenes erinnert. Nun... vom guten Anfang wirds immer schlechter - schad. Ach ja: Die Flasche ist nat�rlich durchsichtig, passt irgendwie zu dem Bier. Test vom 7.11.2005, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 8,11,12,5,8,9 - 9,00
Cubana 59;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;Deep golden colour, only slight fuzz for a head. Smells sweet, fusel, slight smoke and cane sugar. Flavour is unbalanced sweet and rum fusel. Rather pretty bottle, not good beer. (From 33cL bottle)
Cubana 59;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;Bottled. Clear deep golden. Aroma of cigerette smoke from yesterday. Sweetish up front, then just empty. Though vacuum with day-old cigarette smoke may sound pretty bad this shit actually tastes worse than that. Absolute horror.
Cubana 59;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;Bottle: Poured a golden color with a froathy white head. Aroma is sour grain and rum. Taste is sweet with rum and a weak grainy finish. Drain pour material!

Cubana 59;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;Bottled 33cl. 5 ABV. As soon as I opened the bottle I almost had to throw up. As soon as tasted the beer I was even closer to throwing up. After that, I decided to throw it away. I like rum, but this beer is disgusting. Very faintly interesting, different.
Cubana 59;Genval, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Martin;Exotic aroma (with rum notes). Dark golden colour with soft white foam. Strong bitter flavor with strong rum alcoholic notes in palate. To drink once, notice it is original and forget it.
Back Road Koza Brada Bock;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Back Road Brewery;Pour from a 12 oz bottle. Nut brown hazy brew with small disappearing head. Aroma of brown sugar, caramel and a little toast. Taste is light, sweet malts, caramel, a little toast and very faint butterscotch. Faint grass towards the end keeps it from being too sweet. Overall pleasant and enjoyable.

Amber color, clear. Light off-white head low head retention and light lacing. Sour, acidic initial flavor dominates the low malt backgound.

Back Road Koza Brada Bock;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Back Road Brewery;Bottle, Koza Brada Bock. Strong spicy aroma took me by surprise. A good deal of sweet malt there mixing strangely with grass. Clear orange-amber body with a large soapy eggshell head. Sour, lightly acidic beginning, floral fruits at the front of the wave with faint bitterness and caramel toward the end. Doesn�t quite veer to metallic. Medium-thin body. Some work to be done here.
Back Road Koza Brada Bock;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Back Road Brewery;On tap only, Koza Brada: A 2nd running from the batch of doublebock then dry hopped: A clean amber hue with a small frothy head and good lace. The aroma hints of grassy and floral hops, light caramel and toasted malts, touch of fruit(apple and plum), bready and zesty yeast esters. The taste is refreshing and balanced. Bitter with a nice background of sweet chocolate malts. The finish has a metallic and malty nature. The mouthfeel is lively and clean.
Brass Belgium Lager;Bocholt, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brass Beer Company;"330ml capped plastic bottle. Clear bright yellow beer with a medium disappearing white head.

Brass Belgium Lager;Bocholt, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brass Beer Company;330ml bottle. This pours very pale amber with a thin layer of sudsy looking white foam. Looks quite dreadful. The aroma is almost non existent except for some hay like aromas. He flavour fares no better as it is thin in the mouth and leaves nothing on the palate. Not sure if the plastic bottle had any impact on this beer but it is quite horrid.
Brass Belgium Lager;Bocholt, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brass Beer Company;Big sudsy mess of white atop a bright, medium gold body with irregular, soda-pop carbonation. Drabs a thick film of white down the glass as it empties. Very grainy, rich and sweet malt nose with hints of chaff and dried mown grass. Quite sweet again in the mouth, backbone of toasted malts, a light coloured nutty praline note comes in there as is an odd hint of bacon and light, zingy herbs. Quite light on, oily in mouthfeel with light carbonation. Finishes slightly soapy and very short with a dash of shy hoping. Not much bitterness but at least it has hops, suppose. Overall, an average offering from a non-existent brewery. (33cL, 4.7% ABV, BB 23/05/12, Dan Murphy�s Bunbury)

�rni Golf (-2014);Donji Vidovec, Croatia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Hotel Golf;Dec �14. On tap at the brewpub. Finally managed to get there, thanks Ruza! Beer was dark brown bodied, seemed maybe slightly hazy, with small brownish head. Caramel and sugar aroma, some toffee. Flavor was, accordingly, sweet, without bitterness of any kind. Caramel and sugar were dominating, simple as that. Lightly acidic, too. Medium to thin body with very smooth palate and shorter, sweetish finish. Utterly simple, but not bad, clean, easy going and without any faults. Okay.

�rni Golf (-2014);Donji Vidovec, Croatia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Hotel Golf;"Enormous thanks to Davor �., Matija & Fran I think for bringing some of this handbottled to Zagreb, and Dinko for bringing another. So, first rate in 12 years, wow! Hotel Golf is, obviously, a hotel with a brewery, located by the Drava river in the Me�imurje region, a bit out of the way, but known, kinda, for being one of those rare few places anywhere where gold panning is still done. So, yeah. They only do this beer, and it was available in the bigger towns relatively close to D.V. at first (Koprivnica, Vara�din), but 10 years ago or so they stopped that and it�s, as far as I know, only available at the hotel. From what I�ve heard, the brewer uses crazy amounts of gypsum (?!) and has a ""less hops used = better"" policy. So what does that give us? The beer actually looks damn good. Very dark brown/black, with a lasting, medium sized creamy off white head. Mild caramelly aroma, quite creamy, mild caramelly taste, quite creamy, very, very soft, with, unsurprisingly, no hops to be detected. No aftertaste. So, kinda catering to the lowest common denominators, but they wouldn�t survive this long as a brewery if they hadn�t. I�d honestly expected worse - and allegedly it often is. Still damn thrilled to have had it. Shared it with several more raters that day - so the number of ratings should rise a little."

Ithaca Flower Power IPA;Ithaca, New York, United States;IPA;Ithaca Beer Co.;Bottle at a JFK Airport Bar, New York. Malty aroma with resinous hops, caramel, soft floral notes, some grapefruit. Fairly sweet, medium bitter. Body is medium. Resinous and malty, bittersweet, not bad but I don't get the relatively high rating.
Ithaca Flower Power IPA;Ithaca, New York, United States;IPA;Ithaca Beer Co.;Hazy golden-amber, compact off-white head. The aroma is rich creamy firuty caramel malts, candied citrus. Same with the taste - savoury jammy malts. The pungent somewhat harsh hop bitterness has some green grassy notes, but the malts are just too good at the rounding such errors. Nice.
Ithaca Flower Power IPA;Ithaca, New York, United States;IPA;Ithaca Beer Co.;A bit of orange and mango on the nose. A little sweet at the start like malt and honey then the bitterness comes thru. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Light carbonation makes it feel a bit flat in the long rub.

TwoRows Oatmeal Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the Allen location. The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is reminiscent of cocoa and not too much else. Overall, it is a little faint and the beer doesn�t really smell like much.

Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee, and faint dark fruit, well balanced. Flavor is nice, semi sweet baking chocolate and coffee, raison, nothing over powering, nice fresh taste.

TwoRows Oatmeal Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Tap. Weak black coffee color with some roasted malts on the nose.

TwoRows Oatmeal Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;One of the best Two Rows had to offer (which isn�t saying much). There was certainly an oatmealy flavor and aroma that dominated the beer. It might have been a little on the weak side of things for a true stoutie, but I�m a session/pale ale kind of guy so I rather enjoyed this. One of the best Two Rows offered, but like all of its brews, its Houston location, it left a little to be desired and was bland.
TwoRows Oatmeal Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Looks like an ok stout. Has no aroma. The flavor is very very watered with a hint of cherry in the finish. Who knew a stout could be so far off the mark?
TwoRows Oatmeal Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;This poured a very dark brown body, nearly black, with a slender tan head.

TwoRows Penalty Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Right now I am pulling something out of my ass for this one. I remember having it but fail to remember what it tasted like. It was most likely good, but none of the Two Rows beers really stick out in my mind.
TwoRows Penalty Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;The story on this was that the Houston Aeros (hockey team) requested a beer by this name. Get it...penalty bock. Yeah, really funny. Anyway, it was a standard American dark lager that claims to be a bock. A little caramel, some maltiness, nothing outstanding.
TwoRows Penalty Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Dude said that this beer is comparable to shiner bock....quite the contrary. This beer was more of a bock than shiner, but by no means a benchmark for a good bock. It was typical....smooth, sweet, caramel tasting....nothing special here.

City Steam Dark Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;City Steam Brewery;In short: Basic thin and watery fruity dark ale. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Dark mahogany body topped by a little ring of foam In long: Watery toffee and breakfast jam. Roastiness kept to a minimum. Nutty notes totally absent in this so-called brown ale. Malt economy mode in action. To call it thin is an understatement. Barely any hops. Carbonation appropriately soft. We drove through Hartford, the weather was shitty, we went to the City Steam, I drank their Dark Ale. Then I started to have spasms and convulsions. Boredom overdose.
City Steam Dark Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;City Steam Brewery;Light brown, off white fizzy head. Nose held soft milk chocolate tones that lay on lighter wafts of earthy sweet caramel malt. Balanced flavor begins with more chocolate and touches of watery coffee that round out to a slight hoppy bitterness. Light bodied, light carbonation, drying chocolate finish. Nothing special here�
City Steam Dark Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;City Steam Brewery;I thought it was a stout at first b/c it was rather sweet and heavy, but being a brown ale, it has other flavors in it as well which make it fairly complex. As it gets warmer, it gets alittle syrupy and flat, but it was great starting off....
City Steam Dark Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;City Steam Brewery;A brown ale with no nuts and some tofee caramel in the base. A very small touch of burnt coffee or chocolate was noticeable in the flavor and aroma. This one was most impressive in appearance with a brown-red darkness that beckoned to be consumed. Not nearly as good in flavor as in appearance.

City Steam Dark Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;City Steam Brewery;On draught at brewery 8/11/05 with Clarkvv: Caramel colored brown, mostly clear but not totally translucent, with a small beige head that quickly recedes and then dies. The aroma is caramel, chocolate, mild roasted malt, and a hint of coffee (barely). The taste is caramel, toffee, coffee, grain, earthy/grassy hops, with hints of deep roasted malt flavors and diacetyl (mild, well below levels representing a problem). Light-medium bodied, mild carbonation, very easy to either sip slowly or down in quantity.
City Steam Dark Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Brown Ale;City Steam Brewery;Came a dark brown, with a finger of thick dark tan head. Aroma was sweet, chocolaty and caramel. Flavor started with sweet caramel and chocolate with hints of sweetened grain, then turned lightly roasty, and a bit smoky. Finishes full with hints of grassy hops, but not enough to overpower the sweetness and roastiness of this beer. Not a bad beer, but I don�t think this will ever be the best beer on tap at City Steam.
City Steam Deirdre Does Donegal;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Dry;City Steam Brewery;Dark, dark opaque brown with a foamy tan head that dissipates. Roasted aroma. Nice body, for a dry stout. Medium thick with loads of chocolate malts and roasted aspects and some black malt tang. Heavier than most dry stouts, which is nice. Much better than last years drier, bitter, sourish version.
City Steam Vampire Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Tap. Tons of citrusy orange tangerine aromas. A small amount of marijuana is present as well. Transparent dark-copper color with an off-white/light tan head. Lots of citrus, orangey hops to start, turning quite bitter and harsh in the middle. Mild dry maltiness in the finish that renders this quite drinkable. Very reminiscent of some of the SoCal IPAs that I had in San Diego.

City Steam Drinking Nun;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Tripel;City Steam Brewery;Hazy yellow with a minimal head. Steady carbonation. Honeyed, toasted corn aroma? Wheaty and thick and corn syrup flavored. Medium-heavy body. Toasted malts, but loaded with corn syrup sweetness and popcorn toastedness. Cloying as well. Spicy alcohol taste is redeeming but this is bad. What happened with this one? Not the same as last years recipe, which was..uh..good.

Absolutely unchallenging in any aspect. Fairly light, clean and unintrusive. Per style this is ok. Lacking a bit on the hop side of the house. I am sure this is the money maker beer for these fine folks.

Royal Oak Irish Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Royal Oak Brewery;Poured from a growler. Thick dark black with a thin tan head that diminishes rapidly, appears to be very little carbonation present. Large nose of burnt popcorn, smoke, roasted malts, stale coffee and dark chocolate. Flavors of smoke, stale coffee with a very dry burnt malt finish. Far to smokey which really does smother any other lasting flavors.

Royal Oak Irish Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Royal Oak Brewery;The head on this beer was nothing too special, however, it looked very nice, but then again, most beers do. Aroma was good, with some chocolate hints in there. Nothing too special about the taste either, an average stout that can be found in almost any microbrew bar.
Royal Oak Irish Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Royal Oak Brewery;Definitely not the best brew found at the ROB. Although this is labeled an Irish Stout, it is way too sweet to really exemplify that style. Some thing about mouthfeel of this stout just isn't correct. It feels too thin on the palate, even though it packs a lot of malt flavor. I would go for the porter rather than the stout at the ROB any day.
Royal Oak Irish Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Royal Oak Brewery;This is your average micropub beer. You can get similar stouts nearly everywhere.
Royal Oak Irish Stout;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Royal Oak Brewery;The only other beer at Royal Oak with enough redeeming qualities that I'd try it again. It's long and dry and roasty, though without much substance.

Royal Oak 4th Street Wheat;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Oak Brewery;On tap at R.O.B. Slightly hazy yellow body. Low head retention. Too flavorless to be a Hefeweizen. Decent wheat beer but needs more banana / clove for style.

Royal Oak 4th Street Wheat;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Oak Brewery;Cloudy yellow, one of the few unfiltered beers on tap here. On draft, presented with a champagne like pure white head that fizzled away rapidly. Not much lacing, which I have come to expect from thicker wheats. Definite wheat and malts in the aroma, some citrus as well, the usual lemons, oranges common to the style. Flavor was dominated by the smooth malts, light citrus, however this wasn�t as thick as I thought it would be based upon looks. Finished strong, a nice wet hop finish with slight spiciness. Good effort, but there are better examples of the style out there in Michigan alone.
Royal Oak 4th Street Wheat;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Oak Brewery;On tap: Real light citrus and banana aroma. Hazey and an extra pale yellow with a white head.

I had an Imperial pils at the fest, I had an India Pale Lager (??), but this was just supposed to be an IPA damn it! Some citrus hops do come through after a while in taste and it settles down, but man, I found this experience almost unsettling...

Leinenkugels Amber Light;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Surprisingly nice beer. Had on tap in Kansas City at some pizza place. Drinkable lawnmower beer.
Leinenkugels Amber Light;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);This was my least favorite of the summer sampler. The malts are noticeable with a slight hop finish.
Leinenkugels Amber Light;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Had this several years ago and I remember that it was among the best light beers I�ve had.

Leinenkugels Amber Light;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Vintage 2002 (135th anniversary bottle) 12 ounce bottle. Pours a nice, cloudy, light brown with a persistent, thin, foamy, white head. Taste is of caramel, fruit, grass, citrus, yeast, apple and malt. Similar aroma. Very palatable. The body is rather thin, but that is forgiven since it is a light beer and is seven years old. Easy to drink, is rather refreshing and is a nice treat. Has held up nicely for being seven years old. For a pale lager it is rather dark and flavorful. I wish they still made it and a little dissapointed that they don�t. I might have to find another bottle and age it further.

Leinenkugels Amber Light;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Compared to other light beers, this Amber is one of the best. Pours with a light red color, and goes down smooth with a nice light taste.
Leinenkugels Amber Light;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);one of the worst beer i have ever tried, undrinkable, flavor is horriffic, still sends chills down spine when i flash-back to the waste of time trying this shit.
Leinenkugels Amber Light;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);This was a nice alternative to other light beers, and I�d put it in competition with Sam Adams Light or Amstel Light. Great color, but (not surprisingly) a watery taste. If only it tasted as good as it looked and smelled...
Hawks Super Natural Porter;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Porter;Hawks Brewing;This was killer, one of the best that I have tried from Hawks. Deep rich brown color, aroma is nutty and full of rich milk chocolate. Flavor has alot of cocoa, medium bodied and rich with some nice hoppy bitterness and just barely keeps this one being too astrigent. Almost off balance but has just the right amount of flavor for what I was looking for.
Hawks Super Natural Porter;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Porter;Hawks Brewing;Medium dark brown. Sweet nose of chocolate and mild wheat. Flavor is a weak, thin roasted malt offering. A very weak porter, according to my notes. Strong scotch finish is enjoyed, though.

TwoRows Winter Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Amber bodied with an off-white head, this has a light,fruity malt aroma (cherries & apples)with a suggestion of holiday spices. The ale�s a bit thin, but in the flavor the fruitiness continues, the spices fade from view, and there�s a faint earthy bitterness. Not sure what they intended to do here. Two Rows Brewery, Dallas, TX
TwoRows Winter Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub, Dallas Amber color. The aroma is lightly fruity, I�m hoping... but the flavor is deceiving, weak and just some caramel.
TwoRows Winter Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;"A Two Rows ""Winter Ale""--having been four years since we have record of this beer, it�s hard to say that this is the same recipe. It probably isn�t, though there is nothing in the ratings to suggest it is much different in effect. Amber/red with standard carbonation and a head tending to white in color. Malty, a hint of cherry, musty basement, a little paper mulch, and barely any spice character. More of a cross between a Scotch ale and an English bitter--moderate sweetness, lots of malts, etc. Somewhat sticky, but not hugely sweet. Vegetal in the finish, lacking robustness of flavor. (on tap, Greenville Ave., Dallas location)"
TwoRows Winter Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;I love this stuff. Tastes like gingerbread. This is the perfect Christmas beer.
TwoRows Winter Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;This beer was probably the best I had at Tworows. The aroma was raspberry oatmeal. Taste was fruit, nutmeg. Decent finish, drinkable.

Dr Hops Amber Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);musty aroma with some hops, bla, this is so basic. light crystal malt sweetness with a slight hop taste, pretty much as boaring as it gets
Dr Hops Amber Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);Where is the real amber lager and what have you done with it. Blah, boring and watered down, murky, stale and piss poor.
Dr Hops Amber Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);"Musky hops and stale malt flavor. For the beginning to the end of this bottle it went for ""eh, average amber, nothing special"" to ""eh, discusting average amber, nothing good""."
Dr Hops Amber Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);"apricot golden hazy. bathwater bubbles yield quickly. honey malt is inviting, but there is some damp lawn bag too, like composting tea bags. bought in jackson, wyo., so i guessed was fresh, alas... biscuity and apple peel flavor, but it's out of balance somehow, and surprisingly watery for such good color and opacity. it's a new brewpub, so perhaps some ""slack"" should be given, next time out west i'll try it again."

Aroma is straightforwardly malty. Flavor is heavily oxidized, sour and card boardy. Would have like to try this fresh.
Dominion Winter Brew (Scottish Ale);Dover, Delaware, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Bottled 12/6/2002- Pours thick amber tinged brown with off white head. It has a barley wine aroma. A sense of full thick malts fills the nostrels. It is toasted and sweet. The aroma has a nice presence. The feel is thinner than expected from the aroma. Sweet malt is the most noticable. A little fruityness. Dissapointed of the flavor following the plesant aroma, maybe it�s past it�s time.
Dominion Winter Brew (Scottish Ale);Dover, Delaware, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours a dark copper with a tall light tan head. Aroma is faintly sweet and malty, a bit toast, very lightly earthy. This brew had a bit too much bitter hops in the finish for my taste in a winter brew. Needed a bit more toasted malts to warm it up a bit and balance out the hop finish a bit more.
Dominion Winter Brew (Scottish Ale);Dover, Delaware, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Lovely, bright cherry red color...head is large at first, simmers down quickly... Aroma: Mmmmm....complex! A mix of fruit, spices, alcohol, and...what, you want more, isn�t that plenty? Quite a rich and invigorating aroma, I postpone consumption to prolong my time drinking it deep into the nose...really nice! A hot little hop invasion at first, that dips back, and afterward the flavor is dominated by juicy malt and fruity, but not bitter, hops. A ringing, canyish finish, like cinnamon JollyRanchers... Bottled in November 2002, could it have expired by this point, I wonder? Has some of the character of a dubbel, if that stylistic designation is to be trusted, but not enough to really make it worth caling it a ""dubbel."" Hmmm, I get it now, it is tasting more and more like a dubbel as we drink it down. But a lesser dubbel...fruitiness persists throughout, tossing further suggestions every time (cherry, melon, peach, mango, berry, grape), overall rich and tasty! Nice, tasty brew from Dominion! I would put it in my regular rotation, if I could!"
Dominion Winter Brew (Scottish Ale);Dover, Delaware, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Bottled on Dec. 06, 2002. Malts and cherry in the aroma. Reddish-brown with very little head. Strong cherry flavor, hint of hops in the aftertaste. Finishes nicely.

Dominion Winter Brew (Scottish Ale);Dover, Delaware, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Dark Brown appearance with a good sized head and generous lacing from a very fresh keg. Aroma was a little nutty and a little spicy with some hints of nutmeg. Texture was dry and the initial flavor had a light bitterness to it (lcs).
Dominion Winter Brew (Scottish Ale);Dover, Delaware, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);I look forward to this one every year. It is a very malty brew. Malt nose and taste are dominant. More yeasty than some of their other brews. As is typical of winter ales there are hints of various spices. Just the right amount of stickiness is left after you swallow it.
Dominion Winter Brew (Scottish Ale);Dover, Delaware, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Dark brown, very large head. Aroma full of coffee. An unusual roasted side. . . A nice plateau forms from the head, flavours of smokey chipotle, wood, did south western monks brew this? Some chocolate and good malts.

Black label with a mysterious red dot and two hard working fellows carrying a barrel of beer (Porter I presume). Pours clear, dark Maroon with a small white head. Settles as patchy layer of foam unable to cover the surface of the beer. Very moderate Lacing. Aroma is fairly sweet with a medium strong, citric sourness lurking in the background. Caramel and brown sugar partly balanced by lemonade-ish citrus. Light carbonation. Quite thin, oily, almost flat texture. Flavor has strong sweetness bordering on being sugary. Followed by a more moderate, medium strong sour bitterness. Lingers for surprisingly short while. Very sweet but lacks some depth and density. A little odd but strangely refreshing citric edge.
Lausitzer Porter;L�bau, Saxony, Germany;Porter;Bergquell Brauerei L�bau;Flasche im Supermarkt. Dunkles klares Bier mit viel Schaum. Aroma: Hopfig, Malz rieche ich erst mal nicht . Beim zweiten etwas zu finden, aber sehr versteckt und nicht identifizierbar. Sonst nichts. Geschmack: Mit viel Wasser verd�nntes Malzbier. Metallisch. Etwas Ahornsirup.
Lausitzer Porter;L�bau, Saxony, Germany;Porter;Bergquell Brauerei L�bau;Sampled from 0.5 l bottle, best before June 2019. Clear, deep ruby with a thin, frothy, almost stable, off-white head. Very faint, sweetish-malty aroma of caramel. Quite sweet, malty, moderately bitter taste of mainly caramel with some burnt sugar and traces of licorice, followed by a short, moderately bitter, a little metallic finish. Thin to medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Pretty bland but drinkable.
Lausitzer Porter;L�bau, Saxony, Germany;Porter;Bergquell Brauerei L�bau;Bottle - Darkish brown with initial thick slightly pink head. Sweet berries aroma. Ok mouthfeel. Very berry tasting but not as sweet as initial aroma. Not a porter at all - a fruit beer all round - sweet but drinkable.
Lausitzer Porter;L�bau, Saxony, Germany;Porter;Bergquell Brauerei L�bau;Sorry, but this so-called porter is a joke, right? I could excuse the fact that you can actually see through it - but the aroma is just flat malt, and the taste is water, sugar and the faintest ghost of something that might have been bitter when it was alive.
Lausitzer Porter;L�bau, Saxony, Germany;Porter;Bergquell Brauerei L�bau;Geruch muffig, leicht s��lich fruchtig. Antrunk malzig, sehr s��. Die Schaumkrone f�llt sehr schnell ein. Man schmeckt ein bisschen den Hopfenextrakt raus. Leicht muffiges Aroma, leicht bitterer Abgang. Die Caramellnoten sind unverkennbar, ebenso das Sauerkischaroma. Es ist vielleicht nicht jedermanns Geschmack - und sicherlich spielt es auch nicht in der Liga der Top Biere, allerdings finde ich hier so manche Bewertung einfach nur unprofessionell und unn�tig. Den Porter w�rde ich pers�nlich als ein Malzbier f�r Erwachsene beschreiben und ihn - �hnlich wie bspw ein Honigbier - als kleine Leckerei f�r ab und zu mal einsortieren.
Lausitzer Porter;L�bau, Saxony, Germany;Porter;Bergquell Brauerei L�bau;Porter ist das sicher nicht. Schon eher ein Malzbier. EInfach nur ein s��es S�ftchen.

Wadworth JCB (Cask);Devizes, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wadworth;Thin foam over a copper color ale. Some hop aroma and a fruity hop taste. Realy fresh summer beer with a thin body that enables you to drink large amounts of this beer.
Wadworth JCB (Cask);Devizes, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wadworth;[Cask at Sweeney & Todd�s Pie Shop, Reading] Amber with a small white head. Slight carbonation. Smells like a farmyard (so it�s a true Waddy�s, then!). A spicy hop tingle at first with biscuity overtones. This is soon ovetaken by more farmyard, before sweet malt and autumn fruit arrives. There�s some sweetness in there, but nicely balanced against a robust bitterness in the finish. Not a bad ale, and certainly far better than the insipid bottled version.

Hook Norton Hooky (Bottle);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hook Norton Brewery;"From Jun 2008 Purchased at Wilburs Total Beverage in Ft Collins Colorado. I was looking for some low alcohol English Bitter brews and this one was the first that caught my eye. No indication of its age on the bottle but it pours a clear light gold with a 1 finger head of foam. Very good head retention and there's some good lacing. Smell wise, it fits the style very well. Some sweet malty tones and a more than adequate nose of fruit. Seems promising. The taste is nice. I get big flavours of biscuit up front followed by some fruit and some lemony hops that comprise most of the finish. Good medium mouthfeel for the style and the carbonation is light. Hmmm....this is pretty tasty however ""old"" it is and I find it very drinkable. Still, I doubt that the bottle I'm drinking from would be found to be impressive by my cousins from across the pond. It just doesn't have that ""freshness"" factor that I look for in all the brews I try. Oh well, a 3.6%abv brew *is* very delicate, to say the least, and the fact that I enjoyed it probably says how good it must taste when sampled fresh. It's a good one, for sure."

Royal Challenge Premium Lager;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Bottle from Bangalore courtesy of Nav, drank at The New Penguin, week 11. Pours lazing gold with a fleeting white tuft fast becoming a halo. Something of a mineral, phosphorus-laden aroma in the regional English ballpark accompanied by weak lemon sherbet and bags of lovely glue-like glycerine. Decent weak lemony flavour at first moving swiftly into stale hay, envelope, licked stamp, Disprin and matchbox. The stale cardboard and pea-like meaty vegetable flavour is pretty hideous as it warms. It�s not going to trouble my top 5000 but a perfectly serviceable adjunct-laden drab global lager if drunk sufficiently chilled.

Haywards 2000;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);"Like with Cornfield, a bottle from Foremost Liquors, Oak Forest. ""Mfg: 3/2001� and smells it: skunky taste pours out. Thin, clingy head stays in. Still a little darker than the usual American piss, but not by much. Smell settles, not surprisingly, to the sherry notes of oxidation. Taste is hard to describe, because there�s no little of it there. Thin and watery, even the bubbles in it don�t perk it up much. I think it�s mostly grain, but they�re so indistinct, they might as well be corn squeezin�s. Are we surprised there�s no hops? And I poured this into a glass which just held some Delerium Tremens, in hopes of taking the edge off. Now the odd thing is, I�m sure this store only started carrying Indian beers a year or two ago. So how they�d get such an old stock of bottles. Well, you can see why I�m not saving this for Rating #2000."
Haywards 2000;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Looks like a sick man�s urine with some bubbles on top. The thankfully faint aroma has some grainy malts to it, but is mostly sugar and tin. Thin. Tastes watery and grassy and sweet and metallic. Odd. The 5000 was so drinkable.

Haywards 2000;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);looks like carbonated apple juice w/ a small white ok lacing head. smells of light rotten apples some malt.. and just not good.

Haywards 5000;Mumbai, India;Malt Liquor;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);All these other reviewers breaking it down, completely missing the point of this beer. This beer is a punch in your face. You drink 1 can and you will be knocked out from the inside. This beer is MADE to go with some spicy, tasty non vegetarian food (think BBQ, Indian, Chinese) and it is MADE to knock you off your feet in 1 can! You are not supposed to savour this beer, you are supposed to enjoy it as a token of good times, where it perfectly complements the taste of food.

Haywards 5000;Mumbai, India;Malt Liquor;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Golden beer, poured into a pilsner glass from a pint bottle. Barely any aroma, mainly malt. Taste is too sweet corn, finish is nasty harsh sweet malt. Imagine people drinking 10 million cases of this.

Marston's Saddle Tank (Cask);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Marston's;Cask. Pours amber with gold lights. Thin white top. The taste is what is known as balanced. One detects bitter hops and toasted malts. Aroma is ever so slightly malt rather than hop. Palate is soft with light carbonation. A session bitter. For a long time I foolishly assumed that this was a sister pub to the Trent Navigation and hence a Navigation pub that had Pedigree et al. as a safety tap for the old guard. But no it�s Marston�s. With a liking for Jennings and Brakspear. Great location and some good live music but the latter eclipse the beer in these craft times. Anyway the bitter is cheap and sessionable.

Berliner Pilsner;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);(500ml can, 0.79EUR, Berlin) AROMA: very light nose, maybe some grain, maybe some wet cardboard, hard to say APPEARANCE: clear pale straw yellow, quite light, but an inch think airy foam head which died down to a dirty layer. TASTE: pale malt, grain, some noble hops, hint of sweetness and dairy, toast, coffee grounds. easy bitterness PALATE: light, smooth, ok fizz, nice balance between soft/light flavors, easy to drink, minimal harshness OVERALL: this may be one of the most drinkable german Pils I have had this week. nose is quite weak and the beer is pretty pale ... but it gave a bit more head than usual and even though the tastes are muted, it is well-balanced and non-imposing. far from a robust Pils but if you want a smooth drinkable pils/lager that does have hints of flavor, this could be a more than occasional friend.

Purchased at a department store (?) and brought back to sample. I�m putting one of the glasses provided in the room to use, not exactly a Pilsner glass. A firm pour gives a heavy head of pure white foam on top of a lemon-yellow body. The nose is no surprise, grain and lightly citrus. More of the same with the taste. Straw, water, hops and a fair bitterness. What more to say? It�s a Pilsner.

Jarre Creek Ranch Heffer Wizzen Golden Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jarre Creek Ranch Brewing;Had this beer on 3/27/2001. Aroma is a sweet malt scent. Color a slightly hazy gold with good carbonation and head. Taste smooth and sweet. Starting with a medium body it goes down smooth with a sweet feel. Finish is a dry malt flavor.
Jarre Creek Ranch Heffer Wizzen Golden Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jarre Creek Ranch Brewing;Jarre Creek Ranch Brewing is in my own backyard and I never knew it until my grandfather passed a bottle of this along to me. It took awhile to get past the idea that this beer was coming out of a cow�s urinary tract thanks to the handy graphic printed on the label. I now understand why I never really paid any attention to the fact that a brewer had snuck up on me in the last few years. If their publicity is muted, so is their beer�s flavor. Their Heffer Wizzen ale pours with absolutely no head, save for a few white, fizzy lily pads of carbonation. The golden ale is darker than gold, more of a well ripened pumpkin orange, and well clouded, suggesting a deeply flavored beer within. A tinge of honey wafts from the glass, along with sweet blood orange and hops, which is then acutely polished by a heavy alcohol vapor. A stinging smell of cleaning chemicals also tags along, ruining the synchronization the other aromas so carefully built and leaving me a bit more hesitant to give it a drink. My caution is affirmed when the taste mirrors the smell. The very slight honey flavor returns, this time paired with corn syrup and bustling carbonation. The vigorous bubbles might be a little overwhelming, but they at least contribute to the suppression of the cleaner agent taste which has nearly disappeared, leaving this Golden Ale a very simple, very light and very boring ale, but not as repugnant as I had expected. Still, too bare for my tastes, but could be a good teaching tool to a Hefeweizen neophyte. Now if only they could get a new label artist.
Jarre Creek Ranch Heffer Wizzen Golden Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jarre Creek Ranch Brewing;Bottle.

Cotleigh Peregrine;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Porter;Cotleigh Brewery;500ml bottle (Ales by Mail) Sweet caramelly aroma, some black tea. Nice dark mahogany, small tight head. Kinda watery palate, carbonation a bit high for me. Pleasant dry bitter malts in the taste, and leaves not much apart from black tea tannins. Doesn�t hook me.
Cotleigh Peregrine;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Porter;Cotleigh Brewery;Bottle from Sidmouth Wines, Sidmouth. Clear, extremely dark red ale with no head. It�s a steady porter that�s easy-sipping without a stated character.

Cotleigh Peregrine;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Porter;Cotleigh Brewery;Bottle, Beers of Europe. Reddish brown colour. Unusual one this. Some slightly thin toasty malts and an earthy ashy bitterness. But the whole dominated by a slightly sour flavour - I see other reviewers refer to salty and licorice as well. I can�t believe this was deliberate - it was a bit weird for sure and not that nice.

Rebellion Red;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rebellion Beer Co.;6/4/2019. Bottle from Rebellion Brewery Shop, Marlow Bottom. Pours dark amber with a small off-white head. Aroma of light toffee, malt, fruit, caramel and sugar water. Medium sweetness with light bitterness. Moderate body, water texture, average to fine carbonation. Bit disappointing.
Rebellion Red;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rebellion Beer Co.;"""Bright"" bottle, bought at the brewery. Rebellion is an absolutely great brewery - very popular and highly expert in the craft. However, I wasn't really impressed with this one, which is one of its core selection, other than in its truly ""red"" appearance. Nothing wrong with it overall, but nothing really great, either. The Cascade hops aroma is so well ""balanced"" out with the Goldings, that you can't really smell or taste anything subtle within it. It's a bit mass-market, a bit too sweet and pudding-like. It goes down easily, but for a craft ale I think it really needs an edge and a bit of spice to give it some much-needed character, and shouldn't be this smooth."
Rebellion Red;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rebellion Beer Co.;500ml bottle. Poured a clear copper colour with a frothy white head.

Rebellion White;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rebellion Beer Co.;The wife is out with friends, so I�m having a random, weird beer tasting evening: first up an English brewed Witbier! This brown 330ml bottle (5%ABV) was best before 10 Mar 2011, drank and reviewed 28 Jan 2011. Poured into my Westmalle chalice. Good looks, pale orange, cloudy and headless after ten seconds, just like a regular Witbier. Strong clove aroma, with a bag of mixed spices thrown in too, impressive smell. I�m not a huge fan of this style, but this tastes and feels as good as the much loved Hoegaaarden in my eyes. It has that coriander/orangey edge to it as well, different and pleasing. A good start to my evening, hope the Armenian Lager is as good!

Draught House Hammerhead Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Draught House Pub & Brewery;This is an excellently subtle brew. What a stout. Very interesting rich chocolate in color. Head looks like milk chocolate smoothie. Smells dry, fruity and slightly chemically. Apricots really come through in the nose. It is overwhelming. However there is a slight chemically bouquet on the nose. Brew itself tastes very apricoty. Deep rich dark malts, nitrogen and dried apricots and cherries. Exquisite. G-rat
Draught House Hammerhead Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Draught House Pub & Brewery;I'm alway's taken by surprise with brewpubs.

Subtle aroma from minimal tan foam of sweet malt, smoke, and toasty earthiness. Taste is lightly sweet with a more pronounced hop bitterness. Hint of diacytal butter as well. Very thin bodied with a watery effect on the tongue. Alcohol heat apparent and finishes on the dry side. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. More reminiscent of a dry stout then the expected cloying sweetness of a scotch ale.
Granville Island Scottish Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Pouring a dark burnished brown with burgundian highlights in the body and a light beige coloured head. The head albeit shortlived gives a few intriguing lacing rings to the glass. The initial aroma is a bit intense up front with noticeable roasted and peated malts and a slight smoky ash scent. An overall malty aroma lacks an overall balance with a big blend of robust dark malts. The flavour profile has mild sweetness with toffee malts and rich creamy pudding flavours. The peat and smoke is lacking in the flavour despite the mild presence in the aroma. A bit of spritzy carbonation towards the finish with moderately hop bitterness rounds out the flavour rather well. A nice lightly smoked brew with rich malts throughout and a good balance. Overall, a nice solid brew.
Granville Island Scottish Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);650 ml bottle. Pours a dark mahogany/red with little head. Aromas of biscuit and toasted malt. Flavors of malts, light caramel, light vegetable, and toast, plus a little butter and nuttiness. Not bad, but not impressive.

Aroma is quite mild for the style with some caramel and very little peat or smoke aromas. Taste is mellow but pleasant with some caramel and light bitterness and hints of smoke. Light to medium body with mild carbonation. A very subtle Scottish ale, which is easy to drink, makes a good session ale.

Give this to your mother when she asks for a beer and you know she hates your micros. I cannot believe that this is the **** that Cheval Blanc chooses to send Ontarians at the LCBO.

E. J. Phair Pilsner;Pittsburg, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;06-Mar-08 (12 oz bottle) While this is a very flavorful pilsener, it�s extremely sweet. Additionally, the sweetness of the bready malts is enhanced by the strong, floral character of the hops. While the malt does have that rich, malt character of Czech pilseners, the sweetness is the overriding factor. The palate is medium-bodied and lacks the clean and crisp mouthfeel that pilseners are known for. Sweet and very floral fragrance in the nose with a lightly hoppy background aroma. Pale golden in color and slightly hazy. Small, white head dissipates fairly rapidly. Second attempt with this beer, and I�m still not too fond of this offering. 09-Sep-04 (12 oz bottle) I�ve yet to taste a floral Czech beer, and this one is so floral and yeasty, it doesn�t even seem remotely to emulate a Czech style pilsener. I�m not sure I�d even consider this a pilsener at all as it doesn�t really fit into any of the classic pilsener styles. It�s flavorful, lightly malty, quite sweet, and moderately bitter, but I�m so overwhelmed by the sweet, floral, yeasty nature of this beer, everything else seems way in the background. The palate is medium bodied and the antithesis of clean and crisp. Extremely floral fragrance in the nose with a lightly hoppy background aroma isn�t unpleasant, but certainly not to style. Pale golden in color and very slightly hazy. Large white head has excellent retention and leaves plenty of thick, dense lacing on the glass, so at least this is an attractive beer. (6, 4, 4, 3, 9 = 2.6)
E. J. Phair Pilsner;Pittsburg, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Golden, smooth, citrus, bready, slight sweet malts, and a little bit of hops. Clean and crisp.
E. J. Phair Pilsner;Pittsburg, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;To start with, I am not a pilsner fan, but it was hot, and Pete�s Brass Rail didn�t have too much that sounded good to me at the time, so I got a sample of this and a few others. I ordered a pint of this one after tasting it. Pours typical Pilsner pale gold with tight bubbles creating the same type of head. The nose was a bit toasty and biscuity, as was the smooth, clean flavor. Highly drinkable and deserving of a higher score.

E. J. Phair Pilsner;Pittsburg, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;I got this beer as a gift in a sampler pack. It is a very light golden color with a little haze and a strong head. There is a classic pilsner aroma and a fairly crisp taste on the tongue before getting a hint of sweetness. All in all, it�s pretty average, although it would probably be more enjoyable on a warm day.

Has a fruity malty aroma with some hoppy citrus hints. Sweetish malty fruity caramel flavor with some hoppy hints. Has a sweetish malty fruity hoppy finish.
E. J. Phair Pale Ale;Pittsburg, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;On tap @ the brewpub. Pours clear gold with thin copper core and micro thin off white head. The mild aroma is crisp citrus hops mixing with a slightly roasted and sweet malt component. The taste has a very brief pulse of sweet malts before citrus hops plunge in. The hops begin with tasty late addition hop flavor and finish increasingly bitter. It ends dry with lingering citrus hop bitterness into the after taste. Solid tasting Pale Ale where the hops remain restrained and not really moving out of style IMO.

Phair Brewing Company;"courtesy of Per - hazy golden-amber colour with a robust and creamy pale beige head, nice lace; charming fruity hoppiness with notes of apricot and grapefruit, very soft and creamy mouthfeel, quite low carbonation, sweet with a moderate bitterness; long fruity finish (peach comes to mind) - velvety and balanced"
E. J. Phair Pale Ale;Pittsburg, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Bottled. Clear amber,firm head. Rich citric aroma of tropical fruits (pineapple and lychee?). Sweet and caramelly with tounded mouthfeel. A quite bold and full sized pale ale. Long resiny bitter finish. More powerful than thirst quenching.
E. J. Phair Pale Ale;Pittsburg, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Clear amber orange, HUGE HUGE head, didn�t see this one coming. Gentile pour had some overflow. Aroma is fairly unique for the style, sorta like a blond ale. Herbal, grassy hops with a lighter fruit bouquet. Ligher malts than typical, got some bread and caramel. Medium to light body, moderate to low bitterness, somewhat watery. Interesting take, but just didn�t click with me.

The beer is clear, light/medium caramel with a small. frothy, white, mostly lasting, quickly diminishing head. Clingy lacing.Delicate and floral for a PA.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, herbs, grapefruit), with a note of ginger. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. A fairly solid little brew, actually. Nice hop character and some unusual gingery spice notes as well. Nice balance that isn�t the usual crude high-alpha attack on one�s mouth. Enjoyable.

E. J. Phair Pale Ale;Pittsburg, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;12oz bottle acquired in trade with DarkElf (thanks!). Poured a deeper and cloudy amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, oranges, citrus and lemon peels. Tastes of caramel, juicy oranges, and citrus. On the sweeter side.

Florisgaarden Pomme / Apple;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;You can achieve a similar beer at home by tossing apple concentrate into a standard ale.
Florisgaarden Pomme / Apple;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Auch ein Apfelbier kannte ich bis zu diesem Bier hin nicht. Es wirkt ordentlich nach Apfelringen mit deutlicher S�ure. Aber das hefige Hintergrundbier bleibt doch erhalten. Ich finde es nicht so �bel -aber ich esse auch gerne Apfelringe.
Florisgaarden Pomme / Apple;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;15-Dec-13 (330-ml bottle: Purchased 09-Feb-08 for $4.99 at Ledger's Liquors in Berkeley, CA) This apple beer pours a hazy, golden body with half an inch of white head that settles to a bubbly ring, leaving a few rings of lacing on the glass. The nose is pretty much just spiced apple pie and yeah, that's it. Taking a sip, it tastes like spiced apple pie too, with a background flavor that tastes like the bottom crust. It's fairly sweet and somewhat sugary, but there's a touch of tartness to at least help provide some contrast, but in the end, this is just drinking apple sauce. The beer is medium bodied, though sugar certainly adds to the perception of weight, and carbonation is medium. Overall, this is very simple and one-dimensional, but I suppose it's fun for what it is.
Saverne Panach� (formerly De L'Ami Fritz);Saverne, France;Radler / Shandy;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbr�u (Karlsberg);Bottle sample at a tasting at Max's place. Thanks Tom L. Golden, tiny bit of foam. Cheap lemonade, sweet, sugary, faint graininess, light-bodied.
Saverne Panach� (formerly De L'Ami Fritz);Saverne, France;Radler / Shandy;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbr�u (Karlsberg);0,25 l bottle. Pours crystal clear golden with small almost immediately dissipating white head. Aroma is artificially fruity, lemonade and some corn. Taste is medium to heavy sweet. Body is watery, texture thin and carbonation average. Finish is short and sweet, some light fruitiness.

Saverne Panach� (formerly De L'Ami Fritz);Saverne, France;Radler / Shandy;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbr�u (Karlsberg);Bottle, 0.25l. Clear yellow pour, instantly vanishing soapy white head. Nose is artificial lemonade with slight herbal notes. Thin and watery, soft carbonation. Sugary sweet taste with slight lemon tart. Aroma pretty much same as the nose - carbonated lemonade with subtle herbal touch. Something in the aroma reminds me of Desperados, but it's quite faint. Sticky mouthfeel, quite sugary. Overall, somewhat refreshing lemonade. But even so, quite artificial and mediocre. Not even a trace of beer in this one. Meh.
Saverne Panach� (formerly De L'Ami Fritz);Saverne, France;Radler / Shandy;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbr�u (Karlsberg);Enjoyed: Poured from a bottle into shaker glass. Appearance: Deep golden colour with no head. Aroma: Corn, something sweet. Palate: Watery body, soft to medium carbonation, Taste: Sweet, corn, hint of lemon. Overall impression: Not so good, too sweet. If it has something with beer, it is cheap beer.
Saverne Panach� (formerly De L'Ami Fritz);Saverne, France;Radler / Shandy;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbr�u (Karlsberg);Bottle 25cl from Cora. A clear yellow beer with low head. Nose is on barley sugar with lemon notes. Aroma on lemon and kind of sweet biscuits, so sweet body, low carbonation. Bit strange for a radler but pleasant.
Saverne Panach� (formerly De L'Ami Fritz);Saverne, France;Radler / Shandy;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbr�u (Karlsberg);Bottle 0,25L. Adding this one just to add radler/shandy to my style list. Looks like blended tea with some carbonation. Aroma also reminds me of tea, some herbs and lemon here. Flavor is very sweet with some lemon and orange. There is no trace of a beer, if you ask me. One of the worst drinks I ever had.
Saverne Panach� (formerly De L'Ami Fritz);Saverne, France;Radler / Shandy;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbr�u (Karlsberg);Pours a clear light yellow color, topped with a very small white head that immediately disappears. Fruity aroma of artificial lemon. Taste is sweet and sugary (but not to excessively), citric. Drinkable and refreshing, but doesn�t really have much to do with beer.
Saverne Panach� (formerly De L'Ami Fritz);Saverne, France;Radler / Shandy;Brasserie Licorne / Karlsbr�u (Karlsberg);Bottle from Interspar (Ljubljana). Clear liquid. Light body, medium carbonation. Very sweet. Taste like artificial lemon aroma with some beer and sparkling water.

Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Verrrrry chain brewpub like with this one... Aroma is stale caramel and nuts, as is the taste... Medium carb. Nothing complex or distinguishing about it.
Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. (Susan�s Fine Wine & Spirits) Santa Fe, NM. Dark mahogany color with a tiny off-white head. Mild sweet brown sugary malty aroma. The flavor is dry wood, peanut skins, brown sugar and sweet malt. The kind of brown ale I don�t like.
Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Starts of well with a nutty aroma but the taste is unbalanced and the hops can�t really enhance the weak body. I had higher expectations.
Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Longneck. Clean label. Aroma is at first a bit yeasty and sweaty from the bottle. From the glass, it�s malt, cereal and lagery. Light molasses and straw notes, alt-like, lightly sweet, lightly bittered. Medium body. Cherry pits and straw on the backend. Not going to set the world on fire, but very drinkable and sessionable. Thanks to PorterPounder.
Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Amarillo, Tx - Party Stop Liquors - 12 oz bottle. Pours a medium brown with a quickly fading light off-white head. Aroma is pleasant, slight nuttiness, a hint of chocolate. Flavor has some slight nutty accents, a touch of molasses, some brown sugar. Mouthfeel is thick enough.
Peak To Peak Apex Mountain Amber Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lonetree Brewing;Had this beer on 9/29/1999. Aroma is a sweet malty scent. Color is a pale brown with light carbonation and head. Taste is rich and malty. Stating with a smooth medium body that goes down with a malty feel. Finish is a full malt flavor with a light bitterness and mild hop flavor. It�s very well balanced brew
Peak To Peak Apex Mountain Amber Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lonetree Brewing;Head is initially small, fizzy, off-white, fully diminishing. Body is hazy medium amber, moderate density of tiny particles. Aroma is lightly hoppy (grass, flowers, citrus - orange), lightly malty (light bread, caramel). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Pretty lightweight and a bit too sweet, but inoffensive.
Scheldebrouwerij Bon Vivant Triple;Meer (Hoogstraten), Belgium;Tripel;Scheldebrouwerij;Moderate pineapple aroma. Hazy, amber/orange color, off-white frothy head, good lacing. Sweet, moderate full, very fruity (pineapple). Long sweet sparkling finish. If you like sweet triples this one is very good.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Pours quite black. Very malty flavour with little subtlety. Sweet malt finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for Android
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;330ml bottle into glass. Very active head, a real gusher. Nose is milk chocolate. Massive soapy tan head slowly recedes. Great deep red colour with champagne carbonation. Fizzy in the mouth, good body. Finish is smoky, a little chocolate, then sour fruit. Quite similar to Tooheys Old. Tasty.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Bottle to glass. Nutty, malty aromas. Looks fairly average. Sweet milk choc and bitter burnt toffee in the same mouthful. Little bit on the gassy side. An interesting little blend. Maybe again.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Excellent balance of sweetness and bitterness, with great aromatics. Unfortunately the specimen I had was way over carbonated, which was a real shame. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed this guy.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Nice gentle malt aroma. Black cloudy colour with good head. Strong on hops with coffee tones. Heavy body with medium carbonation.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;From a 330ml bottle on 5/5/2011. Pours a very dark amber with a modest head. Smells mainly of sweet caramel malt. Has an interesting flavour, beginning with sweet chocolate, caramel and toffee, which is quickly followed by an intense and long roasty bitterness. The carbonation is fine and the body is relatively light. A good beer, and a little harshly treated on here.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Pours very dark brown with ruby highlights and a large lasting head. Nose shows caramel, milk chocolate and roasted malt. Quite sweet smelling. Some nutty hints also show. Flavours are dominated by roasted malt with little of the complexity shown in the aroma. Some sweet caramel comes through towards the finish. Carbonation is much too high and the body feels watery.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Bottle. Darkish brown with a light beige head. Aroma of toffee, cocoa, roasted malt and grass. Taste has plenty of toffee but the roasted malt is not lost. Nice distinct bitterness comes into a finish that�s still quite malty but not very sweet. Pretty tasty blend of Gippsland Gold and Hatlifter.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;bottle. great beer. Lovely head. some bitterness and caramel. deep brown, not overly carbonated.
Grand Ridge Black & Tan;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Stout;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Bottle 330ml. Nice beer. Aromas of apple, liquorice, milk, and a hint of chocolate.

Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;A - Honey A - Amber with lasting creamy head T - Sweet with slight bitter finish P - Full bodied with medium carbonation O - This is a beer I have always enjoyed...
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Draught @ Milestone�s in the Vancouver airport. Pale yellow, faint grainy aroma. Sweet grainy palate, rather bland.
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Draught @ Milestone�s as Palomino Honey Red - Nice color but lacked head, too sweet for its own good. Pleasant enough to drink, but only recommended for beer newbies or my wife.
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Amber-orange with no head or lace. Lots of honey and caramel in the nose, but that�s it. Taste is muddled by too much honey. Watery with some malt flavour. Has a syrupy mouthfeel that resembles old cola...flat and unflattering in every way.
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Draught at Milestone�s. As �Palomino Honey Lager�. Pours a clear bubbly orange with an average size diminishing white head. Aroma�s mild and dull with sugar, light hops, somewhat fake honey and a hint of grain. Watery flavour of fake honey, grain, malt and only a hint of hops. Light to average bodied. I�ve had worse Canadian �Honey� beers, that�s for sure, but this is still pretty mediocre stuff.
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;I�m pretty sure this one isn�t retired completely, I had it at the rum runners pub last night in Kitchener. And it wasn�t all that horrible. Nice aroma with honey being very evident. The taste had sort of an unpleasant skunkiness to it, but other than that it was enjoyable.
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;not very good. very very sweet, way too sweet. it was like taking a macro pale lager and dumping in whack of sugar water. very thin, not enjoyable at all.
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bronzey-red with white lace highlights. Smooth and malty flavour with a touch of hops. With food, this one went ineluctably down the gullet no questions asked.
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Unfortunately, not in keeping with what I�ve come to expect from Brick. It does carry forth the Brick-typical absentee head, but this one also carries a somewhat unpleasing smell and far too much carbonation. I�ll go out on a limb and assume perhaps the place I tried it on tap - Big Daddy�s - had allowed it to age and become somewhat stale, but that�s not going to convince me to try it a second time. Flavour is mostly just carbonation, but you�ll find a bit of corn and grains alongside a tinge of honey. Sadly, I�ll recommend a pass.
Brick Honey Red;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Waterloo Brewing Company;Tap at Moxie�s in London, Ont- It�s not really red first of all, but more of a light amber, almost dark yellow. A medium sized with froth sits a top. Mildly hoppy aroma with soapy and caramel aspects to it. Sweet corn and caramel flavours are teamed up with grains and a mild bitterness. About as expected.
Steamworks Blitzen Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Tripel;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Taster at the brewery. Pours a golden with a white head. Aroma is flowery, fruity, and somewhat similar to Belgian Saison. Similar taste that is again very close to Belgian Saison with hoppy bitterness, moderate sweetness and some honey notes. It is decent, but fairly hard to drink even the full taster.
Steamworks Blitzen Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Tripel;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);"Bottle, shared with Parksy and others. Medium golden, average white head with decent retention. Sweet and boozy with strong yeast esters; precisely the profile of this style that I dislike."

Steamworks Blitzen Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Tripel;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Pours a clear golden, with a quickly dissipating tiny white head. Aroma of sweet lemon candies, subtle tropical fruit, and strong boozy yeast. Incredibly thin mouthfeel, almost no carb. Very sweet finish, slightly vegetal. This was rough.
Steamworks Blitzen Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Tripel;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Hazy gold with a small head. Moderately spicy and slightly dry finish. Fairly light bodied with no alcohol burn, I would drink it again.
Steamworks Blitzen Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Tripel;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);"Sold as ""Steamworks Blitzen Belgian Tripel"". Smell of yeast, some hops.

Steamworks Blitzen Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Tripel;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);2015-04-05. Dark yellow body with a nice white head. 3+ Aroma of sweet pale malt and dryish alcohol. Flavour is similar with a sweet pale malt core, dryish lightly bitter finish. Moderate alcohol character. Smooth average plus bodied palate. Decent, relatively mild for the style but enjoyable. Bottle from the LCBO, Toronto.
Steamworks Blitzen Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Tripel;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);"Now called ""Blitzen Belgian Tripel"". Pours a light golden colour with tiny clear particles that float around, but the overall brew is clear. White head with decent retention and some light creamy lacing. Good spiciness in the taste with the Belgian Ale and fruity-grainy malts. Alcohol is well-hidden with just a slight warmth. Grainy aromas with hints of grass and spices. A real easy-drinking Belgian Tripel that I would have again. Wish I could try this just a little less filtered."
Steamworks Blitzen Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Tripel;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);650 ml bottle from LCBO. Pours a clear golden colour with medium white head. Aroma is fruity, grainy malts. Taste is same. Pretty good.
Fort Garry Pale Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Fort Garry Brewing;On tap in the Winnipeg Airport. Has a brownish body with copper notes and okay foam on top. Smells of a very macro lager with sweet fake malt hints, cardboard sugar, that kind of smell you smelled from the couch at your drunken uncle's house when you visited him as a kid in 1983 to watch the Jets in the playoffs. Flavour is smooth fake amber malt and nothing else. Full on the mouth and completely uninteresting, but approachable for those who live in fear of craft beer.
Fort Garry Pale Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Fort Garry Brewing;Bottle. Amber color, creamy off-white head. Smooth, malty flavor with some floral hops. Medium body, medium carbonation. Not bad.

Fort Garry Pale Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Fort Garry Brewing;Bottle at a bar in Winnipeg. Golden, light head, malts and grass? Not a great choice.
Fort Garry Pale Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Fort Garry Brewing;Solid take on Fort Garry's popular Pale Ale beer with a zest of bitter hops added to it.

Very easy to drink. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Fort Garry Pale Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Fort Garry Brewing;My hopes weren�t high for this. But it was decent. Pours a dark golden with lots of white head. Aromas of grains, tropical fruit. Flavours are sweet and juicy. Tropical fruit mostly. The hops used really elavate an otherwise average beer. Earlier Rating: 12/25/2011 Total Score: 1.6 This is unspectacular in almost every way. crisp, and easy drinking are some of the better things i can say about this beer. As far as Manitoba brewed pale ale�s go, stick with half pints st.james pale ale.
Fort Garry Pale Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Fort Garry Brewing;Growler sample shared with northropfrye. Faint aroma of musty clean straw. Clear golden colour. Disappating head. Taste of musty straw with a slight hint of a floral element. I like it.
Fort Garry Pale Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Fort Garry Brewing;Light pale orange body foamy white head and some lacing. Slight pine, citrus and perfume aroma. Taste is sweet malts and a touch of perfumy hops. Not bad, but could be much hoppier. Earlier Rating: 8/8/2011 Total Score: 2.6 Bottle. Nothing special here. A nice quality pale ale with nothing noteworthy in the flavour.
Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;On tap at the Winnipeg airport. Has foamy beige head but rather fast disappearing and a reasonably dark brown body. Smells of very sweet lager barley, all smooth and sugary, no rough edges, like a ball bearing sinking in water. Flavour is a kind of weak earthy barley with vegetable notes. Wet on the mouth, no crispness, and that vegetable character lingers. This is an awkward mess, wonky would be the best word to describe it.
Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;This was back before the Craft Beer Explosion. Now that there's so many great options, fort Garry has kinda been forgotten. Decent dark ale with no overbearing notes. Subtle hints of coffee and nuts. Syrupy texture. If a restaurant's 'local craft' selection includes bud light and this, I'll choose this every day. You know what restaurant I'm talking about.
Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;Dark, low hops flavour, good tasting, good aroma, would purchase again, available in cans
Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;Kamloops 23/7 2018. 47,3 cl can bought on Via Rails the Canadian. Dark and golden can telling me this is a Dark English Mild Ale. Pours dark deep brown with small white head. Settles as thin, almost transparent, patchy layer of foam. No lacing. Aroma is intense and dark. Sweet caramel, dark chocolate, Tanned leather, tart, sour and sharp notes. Soft carbonation. Creamy, velvety, thick texture. Flavor has medium sweetness followed by somewhat stronger tart bitterness. Aftertaste is sour, tart berries. I would�nt exactly call it mild. A suprisingly tart dark beer which works good with lunch on a Train.
Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;Cleanly made brown, it's at the very high end of the roastiness for the style and relatively dark. I think this is also underrated on ratebeer. Can from LB. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;Dark brown color, aroma is rather bland. Taste is a little chocolate, caramel and coffee but nothing really stands out. Mediocre dark ale
Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;Aroma is roasted malts, caramel, molasses and fig. Some light coffee beans. Taste is roasted malts, caramel and coffee. Finished somewhat watered down yet a bit creamy. Appearance is a clear amber with a thin pearl head that retains quite well.
Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;Easy to drink dark. Light roast and some caramel. A hint of dark chocolate. Black pour with ok head. Thick consistency. Bittersweet finish. Tap.
Fort Garry Dark Ale;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Brown Ale;Fort Garry Brewing;341ml bottle. I can�t comment on the pour - it was from the bottle at a wedding. The aroma is a mix of nutty and chocolate malt notes, with a little spice in there. Light spice hops up front lead into a nice, malty body, with milk chocolate and nut flavours. The finish is a little on the sweet side, and lasts pretty well. All in all, quite an enjoyable brown ale.

Flavour is similar, grainy undercurrent, floral notes. Average palate. Meh, pretty inoffensive for the most part, it actually has some hop character, though its not a hop character I personally like. More flavour than many light beers. A mainstream lightly flavoured brew. Bottle from MLCC, Winnipeg
Fort Garry Premium Light;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Not the worst replacement for a macro beer that I have had. Poor yellow coloured body, with a little light head. Minimal taste but not harsh, a light malt.
Fort Garry Premium Light;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;"341ml brown bottle. Yellow colour with a noisy white head which dies quickly. Nose is grainy, light bread. Tasty is also quite grainy, some hay notes, mineral water, faint lemon. Dry finish. Thin body, high carbonation. Basic lawnmower beer, better than most macro ""lite"" beers."
Fort Garry Premium Light;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;33 cl bottle, Winnipeg, MB, Canada. Slightly hazy, noticeably carbonated. Very minimal head. Primarily straw aroma, sweet taste with a mild pepperiness on the finish. Okay for a light beer.
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;341ml bottle pours a pale golden color with a small white head that does leave a little lacing. Aroma is slightly grainy with some grassy notes as well. Taste is a light malty sweetness with a mild hop bitterness that finishes quite harsh. Overall, just another mediocre lager style brew that is nothing special.
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Bottle from trade. Pours a pale gold spritzy lager with a smallish cap in the glass. Cap retention not great but does lace the glass. Faint nose on this some boiled grains not much else. Tastes pretty much like it smells, kind of bland, thin malts clean hops show in the finish, clean but bland, not what I look for in a pilsner.
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;"Cloudy gold color. Smelled malty and sweet. Flavor was not as bitter as you would expect for a ""pilsener"" but in the end this was very drinkable. Tasted more like a German lager than a pilsner, but is was very quaffable."
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Hazy beige/dull dark straw sort of colour. Grainy, creamed corn aroma with doughy overtones. The flavour is doughy, lightly sweaty, with more creamed corn and a bit of footiness. Low carbonation. Poor attempt - misses at being a mainstream lager and misses at being a craft beer.
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Bottle (thanks to piscator34 for the trade). Corn/barley malt aroma. Medium golden color with small head. Corn malt flavor with light hops. This seems more like a pale lager than a pilsner to me - not bad but nothing special.
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Lots o� carbonation, but not too flavourful. Good beer to have with a meal though. Could become a standard in the fridge.
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Medium gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Some sulfur aromas mixed in with a bit of malt. The dominant flavor is the Fort Garry house malt, which has a cookie dough quality to it. There�s a strange somewhat bittering green quality as well, which doesn�t really seem like hops. Except for the colour, this beer is not even close to what a pilsner should be. Would it kill these guys to use some aroma hops?
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Sampled at the Matheson open house last night. Standard pils pour....very light translucent gold color...small whitish head. Light grassy aroma, flavor is more of the same but maybe with a light malt/hop mix in there. Hard to say. Bitter finish arrives quickly as I chug the rest to move on to something better.
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Kind of waterey & thin for a pilsener. Almost instantly headless with lazy carbonation, this golden drink has a soft, sweet grassy aroma. The flavor is a mild malt sweetness and a dusting of hop bitterness. The finish is, well... wet. Bridgeview Liquors, Bridgeview, IL
Fort Garry Frontier Pilsener (until 2013);Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fort Garry Brewing;Light clear gold colour with thin white head. Pretty much no aroma. Flavour-wise a little bit of a surprise. Lite sweetness and a little hop finish. Overall pretty thin, but clean.

Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;I believe this is from TWSP. It's been in the fridge awhile. Golden. Aroma is honey, a little funkiness. Flavor is honey - not overly sweet, and almost an apple-like flavor. Simple, but drinkable.
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;Bottle from Total Wine and More in Reston, VA Aroma: honey, grapes, floral Appearance: clear golden, no head Taste: medium sweetness Mouthfeel: still, oily feel, medium body, long finish Tasty
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;Chaucer's is one of your lower end meads. Chaucer's is not a bad mead, but it doesn't compare to the quality of mead you get elsewhere. A common complaint I hear with Chaucer's mead is that it is not viscous enough, it's less of a honey taste and more the taste of a thin wine. The bottle design is simplistic. It it a good beginner's mead, to introduce someone who is used to wine into the world of meads.
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;Sample from a bottle at Hy-Vee Oktoberfest. Poured clear straw, no head. Aroma of honey, herbal, flowers. Taste was medium sweet, honey, sugar.
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;Bottle. Clear golden yellow. Smells of honey and spice. Minty. We did not add the spice bags in. Some alcohol warmth on the nose. Flavor is similar to apple juice, honey, sweet for sure. Warmth is present after the finish.
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;Light golden color. Aromas big honey. Flavors big honey. Highly sweet but delicious. Pretty mono-toned but tasty. Tried with the spiced packet it came with, which made it even better. (consisted of cinnamon, spices, orange peel and clove). Drank at reunion 7/22/16.
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;750 ml. bottle with mulling spices packet attached. Threw away the packet and drank at room temperature. Look is clear golden and still. Nose is white grape and mildly earthy honey. Flavors of vanilla, honey and white grape. Medium body is smooth and dessert-like, but not cloying. Dangerously well-hidden 10.5%.
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;Sampled at 3rd annual RI Brewfest. Clear yellow appearance, with an aroma of a moderate honey with some floral hints. Flavor has a lot of sugar, with the honey and a mild floral. The alcohol is well hidden. My only negative is the thinner �watery� body. Thinner than most meads. Not knowing the cost per bottle I would say this is more of a bargain type mead.
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;Aroma of honey and notes of orange. A straw yellow pour preceeds a taste of honey, and orange, ad some florals. Overall, this is one of my favorite meads.
Chaucers Mead;Soquel, California, United States;Mead;Chaucer's Winery;Aroma of white wine, honey, acidic. Brilliant golden honey color. Sweet, slick , cough syrup like texture, somewhat dry finish. Eucalyptus, honey, orange blossom

Youngs Brown Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Brown Ale;Young's;275ml bottle (Snow@ChrisO) Has a rather odd aged aroma. Rather unsurprising, given its ~22 years of age. You can tell it was at one point a sweet brown ale. But the taste has suffered a bit with age. Dull. But thanks for sharing it, it�s a lesson not to age 3.1% beers 22 years!
Youngs Brown Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Brown Ale;Young's;Bottle 275ml. @ ChrisO Snow Tasting. [ Vintage ???? ]. Clear medium brown colour with a average, frothy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, caramel, oxidide, light bread, nutty, dark fruit. Flavour is moderate sweet with a average duration, bread, oxidide. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft to flat. 20+ years and only 3.1% not bad. [20130120]
Youngs Brown Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Brown Ale;Young's;"Bottle at the ChrisO Snow Tasting, London - thanks to Chris, I presume. Pours clear ruby with a fine, off-white foam. Big oxidised aroma, light caramel. Light sweet flavor with semi-dark malts, raisins and toffee. And of course there�s an overriding character of oxidation. Light bodied with fine carbonation. Moderate dryness in the finish, some dusty caramel, cardboard. It isn�t completely bad when you consider this beer�s age (20+ years, I would say) and that this is NOT a beer I would ever consider aging; but it certainly isn�t good, either."
Youngs Brown Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Brown Ale;Young's;Bottle at ChrisO Snow Tasting, thanks to Chris. Nice to see waxing was popular at Young�s back in the day.... It pours deep brown with a small white head. The nose is musty, oxidised, wood, but actually has some dark fruit in there (prune, plum & cherry). The taste is not so good... cardboard, old wood, musty, oxidised, and a hint of caramel/brown sugar with a dryish finish. Not much to it really. Glad I tried it, but it was a challenge to get through a small serving.
Youngs Brown Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Brown Ale;Young's;Bottle, big thanks to Chris at Chriso Snow Tasting 20/01/13. Wax seal - god knows how old this is/was! Mid brown with a thin off white head that clings to the edge. I don�t blame it - bet it thought it would never be drunk! Nose is malty, nutty, wood, oxidisation evident and no surprise, background boozey notes. Taste comprises malts, heavily oxidised notes, treacle, syrup, sweet sugary meh meh. Medium bodied, a surprising amount of carbonation for the age of this bottle, sweet finish. 20 years old perhaps, just about palatable but glad to be sharing this 275ml bottle !
Youngs Brown Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Brown Ale;Young's;Bottle at Chriso Snow Tasting. Brown clear thin white head. oxidised aroma. some vague brown syrupy stuff. i drank it. its the vest i can say
Youngs Brown Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Brown Ale;Young's;275ml bottle from Shropshire. Vintage 1990. Opened with a healthy hiss, and then poured with a generous head. I looked in the bottle and there is a decent ring of yeast at the bottom - when the remaining beer is swirled over the yeast it foams up nicely. This must have had a dose of sugar in the bottle in the tradition of the Southern England bottled milds which were termed Brown Ales. Foamy carbonation in the mouth with a taste of milky chocolate. Really quite lovely. As the bitterness came from the roasted malt this doesn�t have much in the way of hops, so hasn�t suffered from aging at all. Indeed there�s a pleasant creamy softness to it all. Firm dry finish with chocolate giving way to coffee and then to a smoky tea flavour such as lapsang souchong. Perhaps a little simple, and without the exciting sweetness it would have had when younger, this is like Mann�s Original Brown Ale or Mackeson Stout but with the seriousness and maturity that comes with age. Damn good.
Kotayk Lager;Abovian, Armenia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kotayk Brewery;the aroma is malty and herbal with shades of grain, hay and some grasses... the taste is malty and cereal with notes of grain, straw, white bread and some grasses... the aftertaste is dry and bitter...

It has a horribly unnatural sour aftertaste and its more like they dumped razzmatazz in it after brewing, rather than brewed with fruit. Perhaps the sour taste is the downstream taste provided by all the upstream sewage plants that ALL dump and overflow into the Schuylkill. At over $40 a case of cans, it doesn't work. Maybe $18 it could be sold along with the Four Locos. ---Rated via Rumors Bar Pottsville, PA 570.622.8687
Manayunk Schuylkill Punch;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;From notes: Poured clear coppery-red, with a 2-finger bone-colored head. Light aroma of berry, with a woody note. Body is on the lighter side, yet lightly syrupy. Dry finish. Raspberry flavor, but more restrained than expected, with an earthy note at the back.
Manayunk Schuylkill Punch;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;Really pungent berry aroma, ruby red color. First sip is fruit, but with a very dry finish. Not sweet at all, which is welcoming, but there is a sour note here that is really distracting to me (for some reason).
Manayunk Schuylkill Punch;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;"Hazy dark reddish brown with a thin rimming off-white head; soft sweet light aroma of raspberry; flava is of tart fresh raspberry jam and hints of wheat; feels light crisp fizzy almost ciderish; finishes softly sweet mainly tart just like a fresh red raspberry with some notes of wheat; this is much better than the Schuylkill Punch of a few years back"
Manayunk Schuylkill Punch;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;Reminds me of a water down New Glarus Raspberry Tart. Aroma and flavor are spot on. Raspberries are huge in this. Tart but sweet. Love the contrast. Beautiful looker. Just a very thin body.
Manayunk Schuylkill Punch;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;Attractive 12 oz. can. I usually like Manayunk products but not this one. Very thin body with, as indicated, a tart but somewhst sweet flavor. Some folks may like this rather unique product but, for me, it was a drain-pour.
Manayunk Schuylkill Punch;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;Light, slightly malty, with a candy-like fruit aroma. Thin at first, then a tart fruit flavor, leading to a bland finish.

Manayunk Bohemian Blonde;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Manayunk Brewing Company;on tap at the brewpub - super pale in appearance. Just ok compared to all of their other beers. Better than a mass-produced light beer though.

Manayunk Bohemian Blonde;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Manayunk Brewing Company;Dumbed down pilsner that is more of a miller lite clone then anything else. Light pale malts and minimal hop character. Light bodied. Nothing off, just nothing to enjoy.

Bath Gem (Bottle);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bath Ales (St. Austell);500ml bottle in 2015. I don�t know quite what it is about this beer, but I really don�t like it, and I never have. In bottle or cask. There�s a weird musty, but somehow sugary sweet aroma to it and the flavour really echoes that. I just get big candied peal mixed with cardboard.
Bath Gem (Bottle);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bath Ales (St. Austell);Thanks minutemat for sharing! (Euro Summer Santa 2019). Clear amber body with a minimal vanishing ivory head. Aroma is fruity, floreal with biscuits and caramel notes. Taste is malty (caramel and toffee). Mild floreal and hoppy note.

Bath Gem (Bottle);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bath Ales (St. Austell);Bottle from CO-OP, South Wales. Lightly fruity with a malty body and smooth finish. The taste of a malted milk dunked in a cup of tea, brewed and bottled.
Bath Gem (Bottle);Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bath Ales (St. Austell);Bottled chilled. What can I say about this wonderful bitter Amber, from cask to bottle always hits the spot. Perfect balance of bitter to malt on the palate with a satisfying finish. In a new world of ipa I still feel classics like this are hard to beat, highly recommended especially if you can find on cask.
Manayunk Melissa's Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Manayunk Brewing Company;Amber and well-topped. Hoppy malt nose. Well bittered, hefty malt goodness. Great substantial lager to accompany dinner.
Manayunk Melissa's Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Manayunk Brewing Company;A pretty odd beer. Deep amber-copper color, creamy colored head, slightly fruity malt aroma and flavor with a nice balance. Seems like a Vienna lager but too big for style.
Manayunk Melissa's Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Manayunk Brewing Company;Amber hue with a bone tinged head. Clean looking with a slight hop nose. Decent hop/malt balance. Decent, but unimpressive.
Manayunk Melissa's Lager;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Manayunk Brewing Company;Pretty average lager, copper color, little to no head, similar to a Yuengling's but maybe not as good
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Cut and paste all these mass produced beers would have a hard time telling any of them apart
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Basically a watered down version of the original, just cereal grain on the nose, a hint of skunk, very light, not much flavor.
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a light clear golden with a small head. Aroma of corn and sweetness. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is just another light calorie pale lager. Better than expected.
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can from discount bin. Just thin watery malt and corn soda, higher abv than most light beers.
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Poured a light gold with a small head and lace. Not much aroma. What�s there is mainly corn/grains and malt. Taste was similar with corn/grain adjunts predominating at the start and a mild hop finishes it off. Palate was a bit thin. Overall, a typical macro-light that is similar to other Pabst �lights� that are brewed in Milwaukee by Miller.
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Harder to find these days. Better than a lot of light beers that are out there. I�d take it over Bud Light or Miller Lite any day. It actually has some TASTE for a light beer...and okay taste at that. Too bad Heilemann ended up going under...Miller seems to have no interest in even selling this beer unless they have to.
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Sampled at friend�s party and not much different than the full strength Special Export. Pours a light golden pale blonde brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves behind a film and white ring. Aroma of light corn grits, citrus hops and a touch of green vegetables. Taste is light bodied, well carbonated with a popcorn malt flavor with a slight bitter character. Finish is crisp clean cut and no aftertaste. A very watered down lager. Remember to serve this at about 35F degrees or colder.
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Served in a green bottle. Skunky-flavored beer originally from LaCrosse, Wisconsin. Staple of my college and early post-college days. Golden, small head, skunky beer smell that let you know it was there. Quite quaffable, actually. Watered-down version of the original.
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I keep trying to get my friends to drink better beer but they like the cheapness of this one. Tastes of water and butt.
Heileman's Special Export Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I couldn�t agree more with antisnobJP. This is one of those beers (Point Special is another) that people bitch about as they guzzle can after can on a hot day.
Rock Bottom Scottsdale Gila Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Scottsdale;(tap) From Scottsdale... well, it said it was this places speciality or something, but I thought it rather average. It was quite fine to drink, a decent pale ale, but I guess I was hoping for something better.
Rock Bottom Scottsdale Gila Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Scottsdale;Scottsdale: Light copper color with a lacing head. Very little hop presense, especially for a pale ale. Very uninspired.
Rock Bottom Scottsdale Gila Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Scottsdale;Amber color. Little head. Slightly sweet aroma. Start slightly sweet also. A little thin for an IPA. Finish was hoppy wuth a good bitterness. The marketing stuff says it is citrusy....I did not pick that up.
Rock Bottom Scottsdale Gila Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Scottsdale;"Pours a nice amber color, what head there was, beige, fair lace, malt nose, the start slightly malt sweet, the top thin, the finish was over carbonated, dry, acidic, but had a nice ""Hop Head"" finish or it would have been a total loss."
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Road Runner Brown Ale;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;(on draught at Rock Bottom Arrowhead). Pours a clear mahogany with a khaki head.

Just weird.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Road Runner Brown Ale;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Pours mahogany brown w/ a medium sized head. Nice residual lacing. Malty, mildly sweet aroma. Medium nectar w/ ample residual effers. Very mellow w/ mild nuances of malted cocoa. Posseses a strong flavor impact. The finish is bittered nicely.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Road Runner Brown Ale;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Had this at the Ahwatukee location. Maple syrup color with a good head and lacing. Heavy, sweet malt aroma. Flavor is sweet malts with a light roasty finish.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Road Runner Brown Ale;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Full malt aroma, a little hoppy in the end. A pleasant smooth character a little light in the mouthfeel. Finish was dry and then bittersweet. The no carbonation from the cask made this more enjoyable I think, too drink.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Road Runner Brown Ale;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;(tap) I rated this 1.8 on Jun 11... Hmm, I had it again and am increasing the rating. This really hit the spot after playing golf, maybe not overflowing with flavor, but a good beer to drink, solid malty character.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Road Runner Brown Ale;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Scottsdale: Dark copper color and a light nutty aroma. Semi-sweet body is thin and watery. This is an easy-drinking beer, but is dull and uninteresting.

Rock Bottom Arrowhead Road Runner Brown Ale;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;"Brown Ale. A head that didn't stick around too long. Sweet malty/toasty nose. A fairly sweet beer that was pretty thin. A good amount of bittering in the finish. Nothing spectactular. The pizza they make with it though was good ;)"
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Road Runner Brown Ale;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Deep brown in color, beige head and quite nice lace. Nose sweet, caramel, lightly toasted grains. Sweet front, the top thin, the finish had a nice bit of hops, dry, moderate carbonation, slightly acidic, maybe a bit to sweet.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;The best beer they offer. Good head, not too thick. Chocolate and toffee hints. No lasting flavor kills the rating. A great way to end a dinner if you still have room.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Pours dark and rich with chocolate and roasted aromas. A little thin for a great stout...lacks depth. But good smooth stout, if you like it a little sweeter.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Pours midnight brown w/ ample froth. Good head retention w/ full, residual lacing. Aroma has a defined molases component. Medium nectar w/ silky residual effers. This is very creamy. A dry stout w/ defined molases playing a big role. Mildly roasted. Moderately bitter leathery hops showing through. The finish is bittered w/ leather and lingers a while.

Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;This beer is a deep dark brown color with a hint of ruby around the edges when held up to the light. It is topped by a creamy brown colored head. I smell aromas of burnt caramel, lightly roasted coffee and dark chocolate. This beer is soft and creamy up front with a bit of sweet malt that moves to a roast coffee note and then finishes with a hint of astringent roasted grain huskiness. This is a nice, light quaffable stout.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Had this at the Ahwatukee location. Black with a nice thick head and lacing. Roasty chocolate aroma. Flavor is roasty chocolate with a smooth creamy finish. Body is a bit too watery.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;tap at brewery-pours almost black with a big foamy tan head. big char/roast aroma-pretty one dimensional. lots of burnt notes here. flavors are similar, but the body lacks sufficient depth. flavors are bigtime char and roast. not bad, but not great either. probably the best beer at this location.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;"{Ahwatukee), Pours your typical dark stout with minimal head. Decent fresh malty roasted aroma. Average mouthfeel, a little sweet and creamy. Like Gusler said, ""begginners stout."""
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;(Ahwatukee) R.B. Very dark pour, the head diminished quicker than I would have liked. Thin mouth feel, with good amounts of roast espresso, coffee, and burnt malt flavors, some creaminess, and overall somewhat unfulfilling. Very drinkable, but not outstanding.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Saguaro Stout;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;(tap) Typical stout. The head was not as frothy as other stouts I've had. It had the nice deep color stouts have. But alot of stouts have, this lacked in much character or flavor, quite a thin beer.
Vail Pale Ale;Vail, Colorado, United States;IPA;Brewing Company of Vail, Inc.;as hoppy an IPA as i've tried....i thought this beer was pretty darn good...
Barley's Hefe Weiss;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Barley's Brewing Company;7/25/03: on tap at the smokehouse, served with a lemon. pleasant lemon aroma. cloudy, lemon yellow body (possibly a bit too yellow for the style). some lacing. wheat taste with only a slight bite (i think that a hefe should have more of a yeast bite than this one has). overall so-so.
Barley's Hefe Weiss;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Barley's Brewing Company;An opaque yellow body with a thick, white head. Some lacing. Smells of lemons, yeast and bananas.

Barley's Hefe Weiss;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Barley's Brewing Company;This beer poured a cloudy straw color. It formed a nice white head that didn't hold but left some nice lace. It had an aroma of hops and some citrus. The flavor was of hops and very light hint of citrus. It had a light finish. Overall, not an extremely hoppy beer, which I like.
Barley's Hefe Weiss;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Barley's Brewing Company;Pretty good for a Hefeweizen - but I must admit, I'm not a big fan of the style. I don't care for my beer to be served with a lemon! Next they'll want to stick a little umbrella in it!
Barley's Hefe Weiss;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Barley's Brewing Company;Similar to Pyramid's Hefeweizen. This is a light, clean pineapple colored beer with a fruity aroma. Served with a lemon.
Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;What an interesting beer. Maybe too gimmicky for some, but I thought it was spot on for a sweet stout/dessert beer. Really strong iced coffee and cream nose and tongue. These weave well with the low alcohol to deliver a flavor unlike any I have had before. Well nuanced and fun.
Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;tap. black with small head. huge coffee -- i�ve had other stouts with elements of coffee, but this is way more coffee forward. dry finish. smooth.
Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;Location: Draft at the Brewpub, Princeton, 11/17/13, as Small World C&C Stout (listed at 5.7%) Aroma: The nose is full of dark coffee along with some roasted and burnt malts Appearance: It pours a dark brown color with a smooth and creamy brown head and heavy lace Flavor: The flavor is heavy coffee, not particularly sweet, but quite roasty and a little burnt Palate: This one is very smooth and creamy on the mouth with a pretty much flat carbonation Overall Impression: I thought this was a pretty solid beer. It has a really nice, smooth, almost cask like feel to it, but it is served very (probably too) cold. Nice beer for fans of coffee fronted stouts, and very drinkable at around 5%.
Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;Pours dark brown with a creamy tan head. Smells of coffee (from Small World), dark breads. Taste is sweet, mildly bitter - coffee with cream, sweet cocoa.
Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;A: Pours pitch black with a creamy, Guinness-looking head.

Seems really balanced and delicious T: Lots of lactose, coffee grounds, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, and light cocoa MF/D: Smooth, creamy, medium body, velvety texture. Really drinkable and sessionable at 5%
Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;On draft at Triumph in Princeton. Pours a coca cola brown with a creamy beige head. Creamy beer but the coffee flavour could have been more robust. Weak aroma of coffee and not much else. Flavour of watered down coffee, malt, milk, sugar. Really bland flavour.
Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;"On tap at the Triumph Brewing Company in Philadelphia, served in a shaker. Pours deep black with a creamy tan head. Head has great retention and lace. On the nose, the aroma is primarily coffee, with burnt malts, herbs and a touch of earth. The flavour is coffee bitter throughout with a slight sweetness. It is nearly balanced, but it accomplishes this with coffee; the hops are hidden. The finish is clean. On the palate, is it full in body with a creamy texture and slight carbonation. Overall, this is not a great stout. It is too light in body, so that it feels watery and empty. It also overdoes the coffee--I feel like I might get a caffeine rush! A larger malt profile would be nice. 2010-08-02"
Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;Nitro Draft @ triumph princeton. Black pour with some tan head. Sweet chocolate and coffee aroma with some light cream essence. Bitter coffee and chocolate flavors. and lactose flavors.

Triumph Coffee & Cream Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;11th October 2008. GABF. Smooth palate. Toasted malt. A little bit of cream but not much. A little porterish. More cream please!
Longshore Lager;Garden City, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Longshore Brewery & Pub;This beer deserves some credit. It's partially cloudy and has considerable color. Massive flavor for a lager, yet mild enough to be consumed in quantity. Nice aroma, too. The Saaz is muted but the Munich malt is clearly present.
Longshore Lager;Garden City, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Longshore Brewery & Pub;Amber color, decent balance, below average lager ..........................
Marthas Vineyard Pub Draught Ale;Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewery at Marthas Vineyard;I bought a sixer at Hatch�s package store 2 yrs ago. i enjoyed this beer. gosh i wish they could make it again.
Marthas Vineyard Pub Draught Ale;Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewery at Marthas Vineyard;"Deep orange- iron rust/ cloudy- yeasty; Nice sized head with alrge bubbles?!; Aroma is appetizing in an unsettling way- like your own farts. Lots of action on the tongue- malt, nild hops, metal, coconut (I hate coconuts), all in the first sip. Possibly a bad bottle. BLAH!"
Marthas Vineyard Pub Draught Ale;Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brewery at Marthas Vineyard;Auburn color with a well maintained off white head. A rather fruity and somewhat caramelly aroma. This ale starts off very bitter on the sides of the tongue and moves to being somewhat malty as the finish smoothes out. The last of a case bought last year on the Cape. I'll be in Falmouth looking for this again in December!
Golden City Centurion Barleywine Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;From a 22 oz bottle, different label than in your stock photo. Poured into a Caracole Saxo chalice. Pours amber-copper with minimum head and lace...in fact there was barely a fizz when I popped this cap. Minimal carbonation and moderate mouthfeel. Flavors of rich malts, caramel, sorghum, sweet prunes and raisins. Overall big and rich and sweet...bottle may have lost the appropriate carbonation.
Golden City Centurion Barleywine Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;"""kinda sorta doesn�t work as a barleywine - the weird mix of citrus and vanilla/caramel/oak makes it not fit the style, per se. but - as an overall beer, it was quite tasty and unique. the feel was excellent."""
Golden City Centurion Barleywine Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Hazy copper with a thin ring of head. Aroma is strong and malty boozy, with some burnt caramel and rich nutty stone fruit. Flavor is just a bit too hot and bitter, with some earthy floral hoppiness throughout and a big boozy malt backbone. A great and flavorful sipper, just a bit 2-dimensional and hot.
Golden City Centurion Barleywine Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Dark orange, brownish amber and hazy with a small head. Malty caramel aroma with light alcohol. Sweet, strong and lightly bitter. Medium to full body with a oily, creamy texture and low carbonation. Finishes on the sweet side. Nice, my favorite GCB to date. Update: 2013 vintage. Similar to the above. Rich, malty and smooth. Good English style barleywine
Golden City Centurion Barleywine Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Well-aged bottle (2008), provenance unknown. Copper-amber pour, oxidized hop nose as expected for the age, sweet honey and raisin, slightly sour, some alcohol burn. Pretty tasty all in all.
Golden City Centurion Barleywine Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Pour out of 12 oz bottle, dark ruby red almost brown with thin ring of off white head, aroma brings notes of big toffee, caramel, some dark fruits with hints of raisin, touch of heat in there as well with a hint of earth and nutty notes as well. Taste is a mix of sweet caramel, toffee, and a nice vanilla note, some even slight marshmallow notes with fruity dark fruits, hint of cocoa powder and chocolate notes as well, hints of some slight earth finishing fairly sweet, but little to no heat on the taste. Pretty nice! Would like to try one with a year or two of age.
Golden City Centurion Barleywine Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Golden City Brewery;Bottled. A hazy amber beer with a thin beige head. The aroma has notes of over ripe fruits. The flavo ris sweet iwht notes of malt, caramel, alcohol, and over ripe fruits.

Hofbr�u M�nchen Dunkel;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Hofbr�uhaus M�nchen;500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.5%. Dark, dark brown reddish amber, pretty clear though. Good-sized head, fair duration. It's a dark lager and it smells like a dark lager - imagine a typical lager aroma shifted down an octave (or two!) - damn thing nearly smells like toasted soda bread. Low-moderate carbonation. Grassy lager hops and there's a lager malt in there too, but also roasted malts and toffee malts, biscuit malts and maybe even a bit of chocolate in there to boot. Classic dunkel, itself a classic style. Very enjoyable, as a somewhat sedate drink - no song and dance in this glass. The German equivalent of an old-school brown ale. Has lager's refreshing aspects while bringing a multiplicity of malts to the table. This style really ought to be more popular outside of its homeland! Pleasantly thick mouthfeel lets you savour the nuanced sweetness and malty flavour, but unlike a stout it's got more hops, and light and refreshing ones at that.
Hofbr�u M�nchen Dunkel;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Hofbr�uhaus M�nchen;Bottle from the Offie, Leicester, drunk at home. Mid-brown and translucent with a quickly dissipating beige head. Light aroma of chocolate malt, caramel, carob. Tastes sweet like most Dunkels, but there's an almost immediate bitterness, yielding notes of berry skins, bittersweet cooking chocolate. Light mouthfeel, carbonation is medium to heavy. I'm liking this one.

Saranac Mountain (Berry) Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours an amber body with a thin lacing. Sweet berries with a malty backbone and a dull dry finish. Still pretty bland despite the name.
Saranac Mountain (Berry) Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Well what can I say? It�s a fruit beer. Pours an amber body with an average sized head and some lacing. Nothing really stands out. Aroma is sweet, somewhat malty and full of berries. Raspberries, blackberries and pretty much whatever other berry you can think of dominates the flavor. It is pretty smooth though, without the tangy sour mouthfeel fruit beers tend to offer, but it�s still the worst of the Saranac�s I�ve tried so far. I guess I just don�t like fruit beers... or anything that can possibly resemble a wine cooler.
Saranac Mountain (Berry) Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. Pours a light amber color with a medium white head that diminishes quickly. Very strong berry nose and cherry, smells amazing. Taste is very fizzy and pretty flat but a decent overall flavor. A decent summer beer in my opinion overall.

Saranac Mountain (Berry) Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Yeast aroma and a little like butt. Amber color, no head. Yeasty berry flavor with alcohol, but not very beery. Not very good either. There�s an average amount of hops on the palate, which is the best thing I can say about this beer. I doubt it�s a freshness issue since I had a fantastic hefeweizen from the same summer mix pack.
Saranac Mountain (Berry) Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Of all the beers in the Summer Sampler 12 pack this is the only one that I would care to have more of. Its fruity, but not to sweet. As good as I could have asked for with a fruit beer.

Lovejoys Doom Vanilla Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;You've got to be kidding me! This stuff came from the same place that brewed all those beers whose samples I could barely finish?? Quite nice! Yes, it is a somewhat feminine stout, but it's honestly quite good. Prominently vanilla, which fades into a more coffee flavor in the finish. The only beer from LJ's I've had so far that I'll buy a glass of. I might even go for a growler if I didn't have so many bottles of homebrew in my fridge that I'm not too eager to drink.

ReaperAle Mortality Stout;Lake Elsinore, California, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;ReaperAle Brewing Company;Tasted on 12/29/11 from a 22oz bomber bottle purchased at Binny�s Lincoln Park. Pours a completely opaque, nearly black, dark brown with a thin tan head that recedes to nothing more than a thin collar of lace. The nose is milk chocolate, smoked malt, dark chocolate, coffee, and a sour, lactic aroma. The flavor is more sour than anything else, with lemon juice, with all of the classic chocolate and coffee stout notes underlying, and some light dust and smokiness. The body is pretty thin, and somewhat watery, with lively, fizzy carbonation, and a long sour lemon, dark chocolate, coffee, dusty, and smokey finish. Normally I wouldn�t rate a beer that is this obviously infected, but I have had this beer several times over the past few years from what I assume to be different batches (there is no batch info anywhere on the bottle), but it has been soured every time, not to mention, it is still pretty enjoyable.

Rio Salado Monsoon Maerzen Amber Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Aroma of dried fruits and some what malty. Light amber color with white head and some lacing. Flavor is balanced for this one. Malts seem to hold back the hops, otherwise this one would be too bitter for me. Smooth on palate.
Rio Salado Monsoon Maerzen Amber Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Body color is similar to iced tea. Aroma and flavor are dominated by a burnt diacetyl quality. Some toasty malts underneath and fairly hoppy, but the diacetyl kills this one. Poor rendition of the style. Thanks to Brady at Il Vicino for sharing.

Is this a belgian beer? i taste lots of candy-ish yeasts. Wierd! This has no marzen characteristics.
Rio Salado Monsoon Maerzen Amber Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Appearance: a muddy amber color, the body accompanied by various floaties swimming around, and the bubbly, white head is large at first, but short-lived. Aroma: clean, and empty. Taste: sweet, and a little sour, too, not at all what I�d expect out of a marzen. Citric acidity leads the flavor profile, and, frankly, ruins it These flavors balance out a bit, as we drink it down, but, ultimately, it�s not enough. This brew doesn�t quite cut it. Thanks, though, to Gusler for sending it out. (P.S. Reading other reviews lead me to believe that I have an inferior sample, somehow? Anyways, I calls �em likes I drinks �em!)

Capitol City Helles Lager;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Capitol City Brewing Company;A slightly substandard generic lager. While this has a bit of a hop backbone, it's a pretty flavor-challenged brew. Has a mite of skunkiness that gives it some flavor, however good that might be. The palate is actually a mite on the creamy side, which I didn't expect but did somewhat enjoy.
Capitol City Hefeweizen;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Capitol City Brewing Company;On tap at Capitol City, Downtown location in July 2006. Cloudy straw colour.

Aroma is sweet malt, light fruits, banana, alcohol, and very mild spice. A little odd but not terrible. Flavor is very sweet for the style with pale malt, banana, pear, and fruity esters, mild spicing, white grape, and a touch of Belgian yeast. Not very similar to the good Belgian versions of the style, but definitely enjoyable. Palate is sweet with medium-body and some boozy warmth. Overall a below-average tripel but an above-average beer.
Capitol City Belgian Tripel;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Capitol City Brewing Company;Location: Draft Postal Building Location - From the sampler glass and ordered a full one too, 3/7/09.

Capitol City Belgian Tripel;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Capitol City Brewing Company;"Draught at the Capitol Hill location. I�ve come to learn that getting the tripel in a DC brewpub is like watching a car crash; it�s not pretty, but you just can�t stop yourself from ordering one. Well, to be perfectly honest this was only my second one. After the triple car pileup in the DC Chophouse yesterday, I had high hopes for this being some sweet redemption; not quite. While this one seems to probably be in the ballpark of the attenuation they were going for, (not complete syrup like yesterday) it was still way too sweet and messy for a tripel. Lighter yellow color than the InaugurAle, with a thin white head that quickly and completely went limp on me. Doughy, almost dirty, sweaty yeast, and corn sweetness in the aroma. Sweet, sugary flavor with a little cleaner yeast flavor than the aroma, some chalkiness, fruit, and honey. Medium bodied with some stickiness. Something tells me the yeast in this one were not well-loved. They didn�t seem to completely finish what they started and put some weird flavors in."

Beer Works West End Wit;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Beer Works;Honey coloured and cloudy. Faint wheat aroma. Smooth palate with a good balance of carbonation. Nice flavour of oranges and wheat though. Very smooth finish. I found this beer to be more like an American wheat than a Belgian. Decent, but I've had much better witbiers.
Beer Works 9 Alarm Amber Lager;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Works;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a light brown color with a bar pour�s kind of slim off white semi-foamy head that dissipated at a moderate pace. Trim lace. The aroma had some caramel/toffee malts, light nuts, some bready/yeastiness. The flavor moderately leaned towards the sweet side through the prior mentioned aromas. Bready sweet aftertaste with the same sort of finish. The palate was somewhat close to medium bodied, perhaps a tad under with a decent sessionability about it. Decent carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, decent easy drinking amber lager worthy of having again preferably with food.
Beer Works 9 Alarm Amber Lager;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Works;This dark lager pours reddish and offers a nice feeling of sweet malt. This malt then gives way to the hops that allow for a nice crisp balanced finish.
Beer Works 9 Alarm Amber Lager;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Works;Sample from tap at the brewpub in Canal street. Pours red with a light brown/off-white head.

Spotty lacing. Aroma of crystal malts and a bit of hops. Light body with a sweet malt flavor offset by hops. The finish is creamy and sweet with not much aftertaste. Overall I am firmly in the ""Where�s the fire?"" column."

Beer Works 9 Alarm Amber Lager;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Works;Amber golden color, I was told this was actually a bottom-fermented brew. Some bitterness of finish, and some flavor, but only marginally more than the general urine-yellow lagers.
Beer Works 9 Alarm Amber Lager;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Works;Very different beer. IT's called an amber, but it really tastes like something between an ale and a belgian white. Creamy palate, but very strange spice in the flavor. Not a big fan
Beer Works 9 Alarm Amber Lager;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Beer Works;Cask Conditioned. Cloudy dun brown appearance with a huge beautiful head. Head had texture of whipped cream and stayed for the whole beer, leaving thick lacing. Highlighted the creamy palate overall. Interesting spicy aroma. On first taste, a very intersting beer. Still spicy, fruity, with a fairly bitter finish. Couldn't keep it up though. A harsh minerally water taste came through, the bitterness lost its edge, and became very bland. Recomended purely for the palate.
Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;Draught at the Empire State location. Copper colour. Sourish(milky acidic), fruity nose. English Style hops dominates the flavour. Fruity, light bodied. Dry and crisp(Maris Otter?). Light bitter finish.
Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;On tap at Empire State location. My favorite of the five seasonals on tap. Poured a clear orange amber. Aroma was spice almost cloves with orange underneath. Taste was like a crisp clean breath of cold air. Started light then went deeper. Had a woodsy taste that moved into black cherry with some slight hoppiness and a taste of copper to it and then a burn again on the aftertaste with almost a sense of chestnuts underneath it all and spice coming through near the end. Would drink again JUST to try and sort out all these flavors.
Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;"Thanks to my wfe and daughter who brought me back a growler of this brew from their trip to NY.

Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;Draught @ Times Square Location: This was a good steam beer. It pours an amber color, with a bit of an off-white head. It had lots of lacing. There was a slightly floral, spicy aroma. There was also hints of sour fruits in there also. The taste was dry, with a hint of hops. A very solid steam. Made for session drinking!
Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;Very good! A surprise, a solid beer for rounds. Good beer to hold a conversation over. I tend to like this style, however. Somewhat of a whiff of smoke on the taste of it, good brown color and appeasing feeling it gives to your throat and head as you sip. This one makes you feel like a manly beer drinking conneisseur. Empire State location.
Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;Crystal clear, bronze/copper lager with a small, creamy, off-white head that leaves a thick, creamy lace. Very pretty. The nose is earthy, woodsy and grainy much like a steaming mash tun. The aroma and flavor are well-hopped with notes of pine, grapefruit rind, hay, wheat and grass. Medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, crisp, bitter finish.
Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;All the Heartland beers I have sampled were on draught at the Heartland Brewery Chop House in Times Square, New York.

Predominantly nutty roasted taste with a pleasant hoppy floral finish.
Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;Faint aroma, but what's there is hoppy and citrus. Quite orange-peel bitter and woody. Initially dry and then finishes sweet. A little unpleasant penicillin note in there that kinda killed the beer for me. Decent mouthfeel. This beer got fumbled somewhere in its execution.
Heartland Old Faithful Steam Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Greenpoint Beer Works;Golden color with a nice white head. Very FRUITY and light. Would drink again.
Heartland Stumbling Buffalo Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Old notes, from maybe 2007. The aroma is nutty, cola, brown sugar, caraml.

Heartland Stumbling Buffalo Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Hazy chestnut. Interesting beer, smother and good. Odd candy aroma, like root beer and caramel, with some interesting flavors. Some bite and bitterness, some sweetness too and all-around curious, but not bad. (on tap, Heartland Brewery, Union Square West, NYC)
Heartland Stumbling Buffalo Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Pretty much an average brown ale, the typical brown color, had a decent lacy white head, the usual charactertistics of a usual brown ale, nothing too special about this one
Heartland Stumbling Buffalo Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Aroma was non-descript, maybe slightly malty. Brownish red in color, smallish white head. Flavor is malty and slightly sweet, but palate is a little thin. Overall an ok brown.
Heartland Stumbling Buffalo Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Nut brown, with filmy head that clings to the glass. Faint vanilla and roast aroma. Grapefruity, but pretty well balanced. Medium hoppy finish. A 'clear' bitter flavor to it.
Heartland Stumbling Buffalo Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Murky deep red, not particularly brown. Nose is very malty, bit spicy and sweet. Significantly drier than expected based on the nose, good hops with a nice, bitter bite. Reminds me of a scotch ale, has that smoky-peaty character. Plenty of malts.
Heartland Stumbling Buffalo Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Very hoppy/bitter. Not my cup of tea. Nice color and aroma, though........

Cinnamon, nutmeg, biscuit, chocolate, red fruit, dried fruit, bit of banana. Quite a light body doesn't suit it great. Nice.
Emerson's Taieri George;Dunedin, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle. Pours dark copper. Aroma fruit cake, honey and metal. Taste is cloves straight off the bat. Its a touch sweet, again like fruit cake. Very minimal bitterness. Good body and not too cloying or heavy but still, not that drinkable. One to share on a cold night Id say.
Emerson's Taieri George;Dunedin, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml 2017 vintage Dark brown/black with OK head. Aroma is spice/brown sugar. Sweet palate with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon and raisin and a smooth finish. I�d best describe this one as Liquid Hot-cross Bun. Yummy.
Emerson's Taieri George;Dunedin, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);2014 vintage. Pours deep dark ruby red, almost opaque, with thin off-white head. Aromas hit immediately of sweet cola, carrot, juicy raisin and nutmeg/cinnamon spiciness. Flavour is very similar, with distinctive cola aspects, something I�ve never tasted in a beer before, but it works splendidly. Like the description says, very reminiscent of hot-cross buns. Mildly bitter aftertaste with cola coming through again. Delicious, will definitely be drinking again!
Emerson's Taieri George;Dunedin, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Aroma, first hit was like a long-forgotten chewy, orange-flavoured sweet from childhood. Put me off a bit, it was so sugary. Then the spices came on, like they say, hot cross buns, cola, cinnamon, nutmeg, some vegetal I can�t put my finger on. Taste is same. Full mouthfeel, now with raisins and christmas flavours. Very cola-like finish. Much more enjoyable than I expected.
Emerson's Taieri George;Dunedin, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle (2012 vintage). Appears hazy deep brown with reddish highlights and a firm cream-white head. Aroma is spicy with notes of cinnamon, cloves, orange peel and raisins on top of dark chocolate malts and alcohol. Palate is smooth and rich with the complex flavours of the nose coming through nicely before a dry spicy bitter finish. Body is fullish with a just right carbonation. A superior strong spiced ale from this admirable Kiwi brewery.

Emerson's Taieri George;Dunedin, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);After cleaning my computer screen and changing my pants due to this bottle exploding when opened I finally get to rate this beer. Over carbonated. Nice spicy nose and deep rich colour. Never been a big fan of the flavour profile though, hence the poor rating here. Did I mention over carbonated and the bottle exploding? Never going to get a good rating after this.

Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Pours like Old English furniture polish. Somewhat more carbonated than some of their other stouts. Head is chocolate ice cream brown. Aroma is of well toasted blueberry Pop Tarts - lightly sweet, fruity, browned. Foam is metallic. Slightly tangy, blueberry, roast. Finish is a little astringent, and the body isn't as sturdy as some of the other stouts in the mixpack - Oatmeal, Too Cream.

Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Pours a dark black with a great ambitious creamy head that stays the course for some time.

Aroma a ar�ndano por un tubo, malta torrefacta, chocolate y algo quemado de fondo que capto en algunos olfateos y en otros no, quiz� ahumado. Sabor a ar�ndanos, muy potente, con ligera acidez, perfectamente calibrada, malta torrefacta, cacao, chocolate, recuerdos muy lejanos de caf� al final del trago. Final que no considero licoroso, aun bebiendola caliente, alcohol perfectamente integrado. Toques torrefactos y ligeramente quemados en postgusto, junto con ar�ndano. Interesante ser�a decir poco.

But the worst thing (and on balance this was quite drinkable) was the corny, super grainy way it warmed up. Hmmm. Not too crisp and clean.
Lighthouse Lumberjack Amber Ale;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);"Great mouth feel but really not very flavorful. Sean was reaching hard to find those sesame tones. I also feel he spent an inordinate amount of time studying the label in order to give you all a ""proper"" description ..."
Lighthouse Lumberjack Amber Ale;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);You really can't comment on this brew without mentioning the titillating label on the bottled version. I hear the brewer's wife modeled for it, but I suspect they augmented her natural endowments somewhat. If not for her well placed suspender straps, this thing would be soft porn brew. Before you fall all over yourselves trying to get a bottle, though, here is what it drinks like: rounded, toasted sesame malt flavour in a decent body - not as substantial as the label might suggest, but a decent body, to be sure.
Lighthouse Lumberjack Amber Ale;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);Probably the best beer they have. If you are a fan of heavy beer, this is their best.
Lighthouse Lumberjack Amber Ale;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);Good amber beer. One of the more pleasant one's from my perspective. I have had both this and their Salt City Slugger and have thought both are excellent. Haven't had the Broken Putter yet. Strong flavor from an amber.
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub on Hilton Head. Called ""Reggie"" there - although this may be a slightly different batch, am still lumping together. Lightly fruity. Citrus. Some biscuity malt. Decent. 13"
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;"At the brewery. Actually called ""the folly"" And it's a doubleipa. Pours murky yellow. In your face citrus and pine hops. Mellows out after a few sips. ---Rated via Beer Buddy"
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;Part of the sampler in my recent visit. This was the worst of the bunch (perhaps tied with the Pale Ale, but I am too lazy to add the beer). Possible infection does not help the case for this brew. Light grain/cereal with some notes of light butter and mild hops. All in all the would have been a drain pour had it not been for the only 2 ounces I received in the flight. Based on other reviews I apparently had a bad batch of a already mediocre beer. Which makes me kind of upset that they sold me the beer.
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma and flavor have some sweet citrus, floral notes, dry toastedmalt with mmoderate bitterness to the finish. This just seemed to be lacking compared to other local IPAs on the island.
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;Narrow pils glass sample, approximately 3 oz, draft at the brewpub in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The pour is a light haze orange golden with a white head and a bunch of thick lacing. The aroma is soft floral and citrus orange hops. The taste is bitter, dusty grain, then the orange citrus fruit sweetness. The palate is medium to light bodied with soft carbonation and a dry mineral bitter finish. Just an OK IPA, didn�t use or manage the dry Bitterness that well.
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;Draft - pours deep gold with white head and good lacing. Flavor is grassy, floral and a tad piny. Bitter in moderate fashion.
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;On tap. 6.3% ABV. Hazy golden pour with a fluffy white top. Scent is citrus and grainy. Taste is citrus with a piney bitter finish.
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;Draft sampler at the brewpub. Nice hoppy/grapefruit/malt aroma, small white head that slowly left with good lacing, clear golden hue, light body, satisfactory hoppy taste with fair malt balance. Tasted on July 8, 2012.
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;Enjoyed on-tap @ the Hilton Head Brewing Co in Hilton Head Island, SC for $5. Tapped from the non-labeled silver tap handle into a 16oz Pint Glass. Aroma- American hops are first to hit the nose and then has a very sweet and malty background. An average IPA aroma is found here. Appearance- Received with a .5 finger head that dies very quickly. Has a clear, golden body with some copper included. Leaves good lacing behind. Flavor- A faint dry hopped flavor is the first thing I notice. Malts are stronger than the hops coming in very sweet. Light-Medium bitterness. Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, sweet, and tons of wheat on the finish... Not sure I can appreciate this. Watered down as well. Overall Impression- The aroma and appearance are well done but then the American IPA taste and mouthfeel just isn�t there. You can be cheap on the crystal malts while brewing the beer but not the hops when it comes to this style... Definitely reminds me of Schlafly�s Yakima Wheat which isn�t close to the style.
Hilton Head IPA;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hilton Head Brewing Company;The aroma has hops, but fairly indistinguishable hops. The appearance is nice - copper colored with a fluffy white head. The flavor is of more indistinguishable hops ... grassy? It also lacks the malt to balance it. Not a fan ...
Hilton Head Summer Wheat;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hilton Head Brewing Company;Coppery, a little thin. Wheat�s aren�t my favorite and this did nothing to win me over either. But it wasn�t really objectionable either. Just not much there to speak for it. Weak tasting.
Hilton Head Summer Wheat;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hilton Head Brewing Company;Has a light copper appearance, just a litle bit of a wispy white head. No real aroma detected. Has a muted banana-like flavor with a little bit of bubble gum action going on as well. Rather bland overall.
Hilton Head Summer Wheat;Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hilton Head Brewing Company;American style wheat beer. Not very complex, and looks a little watery. Decent thirst quencher, though the aftertaste is a bit chalky.
Foxburg Inn Silver Fox Red Amber;Foxburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Foxburg Inn on the Allegheny;Sampled on draft at the Allegheny Grille (formerly Foxburg Inn) this beer poured a dark brown color with orange highlights and only a touch of a tan head that faded quickly. The aroma was light fruit and cola. The flavor was cherry, cola, tangy sour nut and a bit of wood. The finish was medium length tangy nut, fruit and wood. Medium body. Decent.
Foxburg Inn Silver Fox Red Amber;Foxburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Foxburg Inn on the Allegheny;Draught. I had to recheck with the waitress to make sure I was drinking the original Silver Fox Red Amber that I had heard so much about. My wife�s iced tea had more head. Minimal aroma from virtually no carbonation. Taste wasn�t bad, something like caramel malts, with hardly any hop bitterness. The waitress said all the beers served were headless! I was extremely disappointed.
Foxburg Inn Silver Fox Red Amber;Foxburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Foxburg Inn on the Allegheny;Draght. Great color once again as it poured a light ruby with not much carbonation and a diminishing head. A little malt sweetness coupled with slight taste of hops, but not much. Finished OK with a smoothness that forced me to try another. Not bad stuff. Great place to overlook the Allegheny River here in Western PA.
Foxburg Inn Silver Fox Red Amber;Foxburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Foxburg Inn on the Allegheny;Nice red/amber color. Limited head retention. Slightly sweet and malty. Not highly hopped. Smooth carbonation. Weak but clean aftertaste.
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Light everything. Almost no taste, aroma, malt presence, or hop presence. Generic in every way.
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Light aroma with an equally light flavor. Pretty ordinary pale lager but lacks the weird fruity flavor some cheaper pale lagers pocess.
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Smelled like cake batter. Had some dryness to it, fruit, grain, and bakery. Looked no different than any macro. A little unusual flavor but nothing offensive. Slight watery mouth feel. Extremely quick finish. The flavor disappears immediately upon swallowing.
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle: The aroma is light and consists of grain, mustiness, and a touch of straw. It pours a pale yellow with a half inch white head that lasts a minute or so. The flavor starts lightly sweet with a touch of corn. The finish has some faint grain and grass notes. Pretty bland and pretty close to tasteless. Light bodied with lightly fizzy carbonation. Nothing offensive, so I suppose it could be an okay thirst quencher on a hot day.
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Corn aroma. Pale yellow, headless. Light lemony tartness, weak malty finish. Weak.
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pillowy white head. Sweep hoppy aroma. Almost tastless aside a slightly sour fermented backdrop that is just enough to let you know you�re not drinking a club soda. A snap of tasty hops jump out towards the end of each sip, but it�s brief...very brief. Would be great for a college kid to throw in the line up somewhere between the 3rd or 4th Bud Light.
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);From bottle. Stale metallic aroma, with some corny notes and oxidized hops. Light sweet pale corn-malt notes. Pale yellow clear, dull, with thin white foamy dissipating head. Medium-light watery body with medium-high carbonation. Starts a bit sweet, with corn and mild pilsner malt. Light carbonic acidity and mild fruity hops to it. Finish is lightly sweet, fairly clean, with a mild bitterness. Mostly dull. Reminds me a lot of the pale lagers of Europe. Cold is better for these.
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);"Location: 12 oz bottle from Trader Joes (Short Pump), 12/14/09 Aroma: Aroma has some stale grain, crackers, some floral Appearance: Pours a clear, pale yellow color with a wispy white head Flavor: Taste is weak, some sweet macro-like flavor, very mild hops Palate: The body if this one is very light, almost non-existant Overall Impression: I didn�t realize when it said ""ordinary"" on the bottle they were making an attempt to compliment their beer, but ordinary would certainly be a compliment to this weak attempt at a beer. It will remind most of your standard macro swill. Don�t bother..."
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);"Very mediocre. ""Ordinary"" is hardly something to shoot for among beers, but this didn�t even stand equal to most ""ordinary"" beers I�ve tasted. Thin, watery, and more reminiscent of a BMC beer than something you�d expect to find amidst a decent selection."
Frugal Joes Ordinary Beer;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle. 12 oz. Honestly, one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. Pure garbage. Aroma smelled like straight urine. I had to pour it out. Avoid at all costs.
Crossroads Extra Pale Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;August Schell Brewing Company;Pale golden color,small white head that gave a pathetic shot at hanging around but failed.The aroma was weak,fruity and mild hops with a slight thin feeling aroma for the style.A bit of a lemony citrus taste mild malt at best with a mild hop presence.Over all this is a weak version of the style.It was a poor attempt but worth atleast trying once and little else,don't go out of your way to find this brew but for me this was a decently priced brew from the beergeek.FREE,due to screw up on my order.
Crossroads Extra Pale Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;August Schell Brewing Company;Pale colden color with white head and some lacing. Slightly cloudy. Nice aroma with a touch of fruitiness. Taste is well balanced, noticable hops and a bit of fruit in the finish.
Crossroads Extra Pale Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;August Schell Brewing Company;5/1/03: bottle. slightly cloudy body with a golden yellow coloration. stinky hop aroma-very distinctive. sticky lemon-honey tasting with a lingering hop flavor. there is a touch of bitterness in the finish.
Crossroads Extra Pale Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;August Schell Brewing Company;Yucky yellow pour, semi-thick head. More of a lager feel to this. Not a good APA.
Crossroads Extra Pale Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;August Schell Brewing Company;Another below-average Trader Joe''s beer. I am glad these were available as 77 cent singles. This is easily the uglist APA I have ever seen. It pours a dark yellow with a medium thick off-white head. Some effervescence but the strange coloring really threw me. Aroma is lightly hopped not unlike a regular Lager. Flavor is really bland and uninspired. Chicago deserves a better tribute beer.
Crossroads Extra Pale Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;August Schell Brewing Company;"You can always count on Trader Joe's to stock a fine selection of boring beer. ""Extra"" pale? Should be ""incredibly"" pale. Looks like a lager, light gold. Nasty scent, smells a bit skunky, like a bad pilsner. First taste is like a cheap lager, bit tart and sour. Finish actually gets some expected pale ale hoppiness, though not much. Really tastes like someone tossed a few hops into a bucket full of Stella Artois. Blech."
Crossroads Extra Pale Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;August Schell Brewing Company;It's a funny combination of hoppy and watery. Not bad for a cheap(ish) local brew.
Rio Salado Tornado Helles Bock Pale Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;12oz bottle(10/02)-A golden body with a decent head and an aroma of malts. Taste the same with some sweetness. The alcohol was hidden very well. Nice tasting brew.
Rio Salado Tornado Helles Bock Pale Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Courtesy of Boackyhorsey. Huge sourdough bread aroma. Cloudy orange with a big two ginger head that stays firm as you drink it. Sour fore with some sweetness in the middle, orange citrus, and a crisp abrupt finish. Alcohol is well hidden as it does not feel at all like 8%
Rio Salado Tornado Helles Bock Pale Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Bottle. Had an almost stale malty aroma. Gold color with decent head that dimmished to a thin layer on top of beer. With thin dimmishing heads on beer seems to bring a lot of lacing, this one didn�t. Sweet hop flavor that went down good on the palate. Decent beer.

Rio Salado Tornado Helles Bock Pale Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;"Bottle. Pours a cloudy (barely but noticeable) neon-yellow/golden color with a medium head that fell to a nice layer of lace. A few bubbles continually floated to the top, but it did not look to be over carbonated. Initial aroma is very fresh, very light and subtle sweet malt, with ever so slight hints of fruit, and wet hay. The alcohol is masked very well for having 8%. Flavor is quite sweet; good hop (flower buds) flavor, strong malt base, and a yeasty tangy finish. It all works very well, and is quite refreshing to drink. Body is medium, and the carbonation dances on your tongue, it might swallow a little chalky, but still a very solid beer. Would Buy Again."
Rio Salado Tornado Helles Bock Pale Lager;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Clear golden color. Sweet fruity-malty aroma. Sweet initial taste almost cherry-like. A little bitter on the palate, semi smooth on the mouthfeel. Interesting character. The aftertaste lingers. Different yet somewhat appealing.

Draught House Special Brown;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;One of the better Draught House beers. Not great but above average for a brown ale. Goes down very smooth.
Draught House Special Brown;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Not at all bad, but nothing special. I would drink this before a newcastle for sure. Pleaseantly sweet malt taste with slight notes of caramel. Easy finish.
Draught House Strongbow IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Ohh man I get sooo excited when I know they�ve got his bad boy on tap. Its an IPA on nitrogen. Weird right!. Probablydisgusting right? Not a chance. Pours a lovely pale straw color with a giant massive foamy head. Nose is of lavender, rose, saffron and even a bit of hops just ever so slightly bitter on the nose. In the mouth it is exquisite. Malt dominates at first. Vanilla character followed by a nice robust straw flavor. This fades into a slightly bitter hop that is really more floral than anything else. Excellent brew grat
Draught House Strongbow IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Draught House Pub & Brewery;One of the best beers to come out of this place. Floral hops finish this beer with a nice transition from the malty beginning.
Draught House Strongbow IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Perhaps the best appearance of any beer ever. Huge head that had a multi-colored thing going on, It was white on top, then tan, then the beer was amber. The tan part faded in about a minute but it was still cool. Unfortunately the appearance was the only remarkable part of this beer. The mouthfeel was almost slimy like their century ale, and the hops were floral but weak in both the aroma and the flavor.
Draught House Strongbow IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Very good IPA. Had a slightly malty start, then the hops came out. The hops were grassy and floral but werent overpowering....they had a nice flavor. Finish wasnt overly bitter too.
Stout Bros. Optinator Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Stout Brothers Public House;A very malty, dark stout. Full head, very easy drinking and a nice finish. Another quality beer made in Milwaukee!
Vermont Pub Old Vermont Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"On tap at the pub. Clear straw color, small diminishing head. Pleasant sweetish grainy aroma; flavor has more hop accent than malt, though there is significant sweetness upfront. At the end it turns fairly bitter for a lager; it is altogether average or slightly below throughout, and should be avoided by those who do not wear backwards baseball caps and do not think of drinking simply as ""get hammered"" time."

Thirsty Dog Irish Setter Red;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Bottle. Nose a little vegetal, a little weedy (not the kind with THC). Pour deep and hazy blend of reddish amber and brown, abundant carbonation and a large but airy and foamy beige head. Taste lightly sweet, lightly dry, medium bitterness starts slow but sneaks up on you, harsh dark caramel with interesting scored notes, and the sweetness transcends fruit into hard candy. So a lot of aggressive caramel malt, which works well here, but a little herbal-grassy clash. Full body picks up cloy with volume. Not a disaster, but it�s a hard pass. [2016.08.03: 2.6]
Thirsty Dog Irish Setter Red;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle - $2.49 at Total Wine & More in Greenville, South Carolina. Appearance: Pours a clear, dark reddish-copper body with a reluctant, stray, off-white head. Smell: Fairly neutral aroma, small touches of toast, brown sugar and a thin measure of earthiness. Taste: A thinned taste of toast with a little grain backing. Lightly sweet with some hints of dry brown sugar. A mixed, vaguely berryish fruitiness. Very minor hops, softly earthy and just a bit spicy with near nil bitterness imparted. Fairly relaxed, mild finish that�s a wee bit drying. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation. Overall: A refreshing, easy-going, harmless red.

Thirsty Dog Irish Setter Red;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. This beer has a roasted malt aroma that matches nicely with the reddish / amber color of the beer. The head is a medium sized tan colored head.

Thirsty Dog Irish Setter Red;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light pear/apple, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light pear/apple, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light fruity yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Nicely clean with well restrained yeast ester notes in the aroma and flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Irish red ale style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

Thirsty Dog Nut Brown Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Pretty decent sweet malty flavor. I�ve had better versions of this style, but I sure wouldn�t turn down another one of these if offered. Had this on tap in Canton also.
Thirsty Dog Nut Brown Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Pretty uneventful beer - harmless and acessible to the masses. Weak nose, pale brown color, sticky head. Roasted malt taste burried deep in a thin body. Candy-like sweetness in the finish.
Thirsty Dog Nut Brown Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;very nutty. Iffy on the ale part, but at least they tried. I could drink this because i like the style, but the beer itself did not impress
Thirsty Dog Nut Brown Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Sweet nutty flavor, some carmel, the sweetness almost taste fruity, moderate body. Oily mouthfeel. I thought this was Okay, but not one that I go out of my way to have again.
Thirsty Dog Nut Brown Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Slightly watery version of the clasic brown ale. Still decent with slightly sweet malts coming in. Faint nose.
Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Solid beer! Very dark and toasty. Very full flavor without being syrupy or overly thick. Nice.

Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;On draft at J.B. Quimby's. Aroma of roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is mildly sweet with a bitter finish
Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;From Aug 2007 Yet another sample I got in trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! It pours from the 12oz bottle a very dark brown with some reddish hues and a tiny head of foam that dissipated quickly. There's just some spotting and a little bit of lacing. The smell has a nice roasted and caramel malt nose to it. The taste starts off with a good chocolate malt flavour and it's pretty sweet but then the roasted malt moves in and cuts down on the sweetness a bit and that improves the taste and drinkability for me. I pulled this straight out of the fridge, not my usual modus operendi, so I'm going to take small sips and see what happens when it gets closer to room temp. It's now warmed up some and nothing's really changed. I'd have to say that this is a pretty good sample of the style, not overly complex yet a solid interpretation and I'd gladly drink it again if I was offered one.
Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Light, sweet chocolate coffee aroma, pours dark brown, medium mouthfeel, bitter malts on the back of your throat, mild toffee sweetness throughout, more like a health bar followed with some coffee. bottle.
Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;A solid porter. Faint aromas of dark chocolate. Flavors of water coffee, some mild dark chocolate, earth, and woody notes. Earthy, dry finish is semi-sweet. Oily mouth feel. Enjoyable.

Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Brown, moderately heady pour with reddish hues. The aroma has a kind of cherry fruitiness at first along with the roasted sweet malts and a low hop profile. The body is light to medium and smooth. The taste also has a sweet cherry-like character with a slightly fruity short lasting bitterness to end.

Thirsty Dog Raspberry Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy pale golden/straw/light pinkish color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers.

Aromas of juicy/lightly tart raspberries, fruit seeds, peach, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, lightly toasted bread, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness.

Light dryness from bitter/tartness as well. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/grainy, and slightly acidic/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.9%. Overall this is a very nice fruit beer. All around nice robustness and balance of raspberries, pale malt, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful for the low ABV, and never watery feeling. A very enjoyable offering."
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle at home. Love the aroma. Strong scent of raspberries. Watching the light carbonation bubble in the glass upward this medium straw like color beer is refreshing. You can taste the raspberries in this easy drinking beer. Overall this is a nice beer and would be great at a summer picnic. Lightly malted, lightly hopped.
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Pours a clear pale pinkish yellow with a thin white head. Very nice sweet and tart raspberry aroma. Thin body. Taste is light and not as good as the smell. Raspberry falls flat. Not as good as I expected.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This draft brew from the brewery poured a large sized head of foamy finely sized long lasting off-white colored bubbles that left behind an excellent lacing. The body contained average carbonation, was transparent and light yello brown in color. Its aroma contained notes of mild hops. Its mouth feel is initially smooth asnd was very smooth for an IPA but came on strong in the finish Its flavor contained caramel hoppy notes. A very average brew.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;IThere is something about the flavor of their beers that I just don�t like. that being said I feel as though this is the best of a buch of mediocre brews. It has decent flavor with mild hoppiness and a slightly dry finish. Overall-OK.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Dayton draft. Aroma was hoppy in style with IPA with a sweet tone. Flavor was complex hops, malt and a medium sweet finish. Medium in body and was a very pleasing brew.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;On tap at Dayton location. Piney, fruity, and grassy hop aroma. Very hazy orange-amber color, off-white head. Nice hop flavor, piney and citrusy, moderately fruity, caramel malt comes through, solid bitterness. Medium-full body, smooth. Not a bad IPA.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;(Dayton) Hazy amber body with off-white head, nice lacing. Aroma is moderately sweet, floral, caramel. Taste is moderately sweet, floral, chocolate, caramel. Watery light-medium body. For some reason, the body and taste seem at odds with one another.

Medium sized ivory head that mostly diminished, fine-medium sized bubbles, good lacing, uncarbonated, and cloudy. Malty, hoppy, sweet aroma. The flavor was sweet, caramel, malty and hoppy. Tingly, hoppy mouthfeel. Light body.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Underrated - a classic English fruitiness (Fuggle?) and toasty malt - of course this is not a regular IPA - an appealing and well-put together, minerally version.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;On tap at the Dayton location. So this is an IPA, and Hoppus Maximus is an English Pale Ale? Something seems screwy. In any event, this beer lacked character IMO. Looked just like Hoppus Maximus in the glass, with a clear copper body and a medium light tan head. In contrast to Hoppus, the aroma here is subtle, with earthy hops and caramel. The flavor is actually malt-dominated, with classic Thirsty Dog caramels and light fruit interplaying with the rather subdued English hops, which left an earthy, slightly bitter aftertaste. Although quaffable this is not a very distinctive brew.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Stinging hoppiness in the middle of the taste profile from an odd blend of hops. No wonder the hop aroma comes out in the nose. Not a good IPA at all - just not convincing.
Thirsty Dog Robinson's English Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Not much of an aroma. Tasted more like a Pale Ale to me. The bitterness was light even for an English IPA. Some acidy on the finish

Bert Grant's Anvil Head Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Had this beer in 12/5/2001. Aroma is a fresh hoppy scent. Color is a nice golden brown with good carbonation and a nice head. Taste is hoppy, mild and smooth. Starting with a easy medium body it goes down smooth with a nice hop flavor coming out. Finish is mild with a creamy malt flavor with fresh hops and a slight bitterness. Overall I feel it is a good drinking beer but just not fresh and crisp enough for a Spring brew.
Bert Grant's Anvil Head Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;From a 12 oz. stubby brown bottle with a blurb about the ale on the back label and no freshness date. Made a good appearance, poured a semi-hazy amberish copper with a foamy off-white goldenish head that reduced to a thin, bubbly lacing. Had a caramel malty aroma with whiffs of citrus/fruity hops and a bready yeastiness. Good carbonation and a slick light to medium bodied mouth feel, good drinkability. Had a big citrus fruity hop taste, a mellow bitterness, with a underlining sweet bready maltiness and a crisp soft sour finish. A decent Amber Ale from Grant�s, not their best hop-upped ale, but very drinkable.
Bert Grant's Anvil Head Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Bottle: Aroma is bready with moderate cookie maltiness and a touch of flowery hops. Pours a transparent amber with a yellowish off-white head that diminishes quickly. Toffee flavors up front are instantly dominated by a sour and nutty hop finish Not what I was expecting in an APA.
Bert Grant's Anvil Head Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;got this in a trade and cannot remember who sent it. thanks any way. from the bottle , poured a copper ambe with off white head. aroma malts and hops, caramel, hints of grapefruit. flavor, malts, caramel, some toffee, floral hops, a little on the watery side but not to bad.
Bert Grant's Anvil Head Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;"Not really sure what this one�s trying to be, but it does not possess the qualities of an amber ale; not that that is a bad thing. Pours an almost brown color with a decent heda. Smells citrussy with some grapefruit undertones. Finishes floral with some wildflower like qualities and some tastes I cannot quite place."
Bert Grant's Anvil Head Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Started a beautiful cauldron or rusty orange, fomenting into a solid overcast of head. Interesting aroma, almost pepperoni-like. Quite metallic tone on the palate (is the anvil IN the beer?), a sweet and sour hop-malt balance and a spicy little finish. Pretty good ...
Bert Grant's Anvil Head Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;An excelent head on this one, with a nice amber color. Good hop nose and taste. Caramel malts and barley come into play wuickly. There is a playoff between the sweetness of the caramel and the sour of the hops, which makes for a very good beer.
Bert Grant's Anvil Head Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Cloudy amber... beige head... sweet aroma.. light body... light creamy palate almost watery.... nothing to redeaming about this beer.

Maribo Classic;Maribo, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);Coarse foam that quickly flares out to small foam islets. Aroma is malt and dark caramel, but in a slightly synthetic manner. The taste is caramel, a little light bread and again a synthetic malt. The hops bitterness is flat and moderate and adds no rescue to this too sweet beer. The overall impression is discount and bad raw materials. Not a beer I would recommend.
Maribo Classic;Maribo, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);"Marielyst 21/10 2017. 33 cl bottle from Meny. Black label with the mandatory mug of beer and a handful of medals. Pours clear light amber with small white head. Settles as thin layer of foam barely covering the surface of the beer. Moderate Lacing, Aroma is quite generic and exactly what I would expect from a cheap Vienna which usually goes under the description ""Classic"" in Denmark. Grainy and sweetish with caramel and brown sugar. Sourish notes. Medium carbonation and thin watery palate. Flavor is medium sweet with only very light bitterness for balance. Aftertaste is sweet caramel. What could be expected from a cheap Danish Vienna. Not too bad when you drink it cold."
Maribo Classic;Maribo, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);Been there done that. Clear golden color with a decent white head. Moderate intensity in the aroma. Medium body and an ok carbonation. Tad sweet and a moderate bitterness. Some sweet Danish fruits (corn), kind of bready and grassy flavor. [Bottle from a local grocery store in Copenhagen, Denmark]
Cascade First Harvest Ale - 2013;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Having to rate this from memory as it is now retired. So I will simply say that I had this at the brewery whilst on holidays and liked it so much, that upon returning to the mainland, I ordered a case as soon as it was available. Great beer, reminiscent of an IPA but not as potent. Hops, fresh hops and more hops.
Cascade First Harvest Ale - 2013;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);On tap at kilsyth club bad micro aroma deep amber in colour white head taste is ok simlar to fat yak but for an annual release a little too boring

Cascade First Harvest Ale - 2013;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);2013 batch on tap at the brewery. Made with fresh hops, which is reflected by taste. A strong hoppy aftertaste released strong citrus flavours and hop bitterness. Some lemon and grapefruit. Dark yellow in colour, light bodied with medium carbonation. A better effort for a large brewery like Cascade.
Cascade First Harvest Ale - 2013;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);2013 Limited Release. Poured a clear dark amber colour with a two-finger light beige coloured foamy head that collapsed slowly and provided soap suds like lacing. Medium carbonation as seen by lots of small to medium bubbles forming trails. Aroma of slightly sourish malt. Taste initially of malt sweetness followed by a mild hops bitterness, much like many other macro-brewery lagers. Light body, bordering on watery. Long mildly bitter finish. Worth trying once.
Cascade First Harvest Ale - 2013;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);2013 Vintage. On tap. Pours a dark amber with a good deal of foamy white head. Nose is grapefruit hops and some floral notes. Taste is lemon, grapefruit, some residual malty sugar and a crisp biscuit finish. Body is watery and thin. The aroma is passable but the taste is just boring and generic. Honestly, I�m not sure who they�re targeting with this beer. It�s the sort of thing that has potential, but after trying it once I now know to never have it again. They could have built a sort of cult following with this one, but instead they put in their standard level of effort ie. none.
Waddenbier Dubbel (Wattenbier Dunkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Friese Bierbrouwerij;oude rating, toen van tap in Uitwellingerga, proeverij, verder niet te veel van opgeschreven toendertijd, was ook niet zo bijzonder dus. maar heb toen de hele serie wel geproefd, noteer ze dan nu ook maar als zijnde �gedronken� ga op �t gemiddelde zitten om de boel niet te verstoren
Waddenbier Dubbel (Wattenbier Dunkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Bottle in Schierminnekoog. Probably my favourite of the three Waddenbiers I tried there but not great either. Buttery and yeasty. This beers have a medicinal feel to them. Bitterness in the finish.

Brauberger Zwickelbier;L�beck, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauberger zu L�beck;Pitcher from the brewery. Big but semi lasting white head. Cloudy yellow color.

Brauberger Zwickelbier;L�beck, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauberger zu L�beck;Orange amber with white fluff head.

Daves Doppelgold;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated August 2006. Pours a golden-amber colour with a big off-white foamy head. This one stays a while and leaves decent lace all-around. Big alcohol nose, which is weird for not so high on the ABV chart. At least, the alcohol does not show in the taste. But then again, not much is there. Mild sweet malt, mild grain malt and mild corn in the aftertaste. Acceptable for swill, but trying to much to be fancy Bavarian-style and overpriced.
Daves Doppelgold;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);damn i forgot i had this, kinda yellowish thin head nose is a little grassy, kinda musty. Flavor is kinda malty, kinda boring
Daves Doppelgold;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Pours a clear gold colour with a thin bubbly head. Grainy malt aroma. Slightly sweet malt taste but no great ""world renown european hops"" flavour jumps out at me. Lingering oiliness on the tongue."
Daves Doppelgold;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Slightly fuller lager than usual. Mainly malt oriented .Light aftertaste. Medium bodied beer.
Daves Doppelgold;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Slightly pale golden hue with a off white head. Very small scent of malt, mostly hops. The taste starts off surprizingly smooth with a somewhat balanced flavour of malt and hops but ends quick to a watery, cleaning solution, generic, commercial beer. Definately not the worst beer I have ever tasted. Sure as hell not the best.
Daves Doppelgold;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bright golden coloured brew with good carbonation. Head is thick to start but dissipates pretty quickly. Aroma is overpowered by alcohol content. Yes, 5.9% isn't that strong, but it's enough to kill this bouquet. Pretty hard to make out the reported Bavarian Hersbrucker hops in the flavour as well. Doppelgold is not one of Dave's better beers. (Is it that tough for a North American brewery to come up with a decent German lager or pils??) Check out Dave's Honey Brown instead... much, much better. (341ml bottle)
Daves Doppelgold;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A nice, tight, off-white head sits atop a dark golden beverage. The grainy nose displays a sinus-clearing show of alcohol, with hints of malt and lemon straining out of the glass. Texture seems a little flat and thin on the tongue, while the flavour profile is thick with alcohol and not much else. Considering Doppelgold is only 5.9% alc./vol. � not overwhelmingly high when you think about it � there is a dizzying amount of sweet, heavy alcohol dominating the entire experience. Built for indiscriminate guzzlers looking for quick, cheap buzz.
Daves Doppelgold;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);dave get out of the beer business and get back to the grocery store, ur beer is shit

Daves Belgian Blonde;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);There is nothing belgian about this at all. Pretty weak try at this one guys.
Daves Belgian Blonde;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Sure beats me what is belgian about this beer. Maybe they used a little bit of belgian two rowe malt - wow! whatever. This is a simple light pale ale that is using the word belgian to shore up sales.
Daves Belgian Blonde;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);May be fuller and fruitier than a regular blond, but does not bear any resemblance to a true Belgian-style product
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Very dark in colour, but only a lightly toasted flavour. More sweet than bitter. Very smooth. Quite drinkable if served ice cold.
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Well, it's dark. That's about all this beer has going for it. Sweet and harsh. I guess that's where the ""massive"" comes in."
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);this is dave's worst beer product, even though his other one's are very shitty as well. People dont drink daves. Only bums drink Daves beer.
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Absolutely horrible. Wanted to puke halfway through drinking it it tasted so bad...massively horrible is more like it.
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);All the massive irishmen I have met in my life would be sickened by this beer... Dave, get out of the business!
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I agree with dhurtubise on this one... ouch Dark... Irish I don't know about that
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Nice try dave. Typical of this guy to make a cheap beer and sell it cheap under the pretense that it is a premium product. Dark, sweet, lightly hopped. I wouldn't have it again.
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);dark colour, fine lace coffee aroma, toasted, smooth........................
Daves Massive Irish;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Mild-tasting, but with a pleasing dark malt palate. I'm not sure that 'massive' is the operative word.
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341ml brown bottle. Golden colour, somehwat frothy white head. Grainy aroma, corn? Fizzy, highly carbonated, gassy. Some grainy malt flavours, bland, no hops. Not that enjoyable, and not IPA.
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);First beer I ever had. All I remember is that I hated it. I almost never drank another beer because of this one, it deserves ones across the board, simply because of that.
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Boo! Everyone is right, this is worse than keith�s. And that is tough to do. What was Dave thinking when he gave this stuff the green light? Almost no taste of hops, and the slightest aroma possible. Rough!
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Old rating: Comparable to mainstream beers like Keith�s. A bit more fruity malts.
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Where all those hops go? That golden lager, ahmm pale ale was strikingly similar to all those pale lagers I had that night.
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It's an IPA like Alexnader Keith's is...in name only. No real hop flavour or aroma to speak of, just a pale bland beer with no aftertaste.
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Okay swill,but kind of sweet. Decent enough on a hot day. I took a chance at this stuff since the last Dave's product I bought had a spider floating in it. That was the Cream Ale. This has a mild alcoholic taste to it... not a long lasting head. Sweet aroma just copy of Keiths thats all I can say. Competition.
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);with daves face on the bottle, to pale ale. this beer is calling for me to throw-up.
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"I think Dave wants me to puke! This is really a half-arsed effort; I want my money back! It isn''t Pale Ale but a blonde... and a terrible beer to boot! Overcarbonated, weak and finishes like a sweaty-sock."
Daves India Pale Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is worse than Keith's..................................................
Daves Scotch Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);this beer sucks, dave made it. good news is their taking daves product out of the beer stores.
Daves Scotch Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Middle of the road, but not bad from Molson. I would buy it again...........
Daves Scotch Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);transparent red-amber colour, big head, aroma almost not distinctive, flat taste - boark ...
Daves Scotch Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"I was impressed with the lovely reddish-brown colour of this beer. This all-malt beer also contains some peated malt, perhaps just enough to give it a woody dryness. Crystal malts also make an appearance and the beer does, to its credit, transcend the typical ""mainstream lager with slight modifications"" character of so many big brewery attempts at craft beers"
San Miguel Especial;Barcelona, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Spain (Mahou San Miguel);Nice color and taste, high graduation without really tasting it, to be industrial is a good choice
San Miguel Especial;Barcelona, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Spain (Mahou San Miguel);I tried the asian edition. Quite a good simple beer. Blurry thick. Simple but not bad.
San Miguel Especial;Barcelona, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Spain (Mahou San Miguel);Puszka. Aromat ledwie wyczuwalny. W smaku to, czego si� spodziewa�em - eurolager.

Taste: Light bitterness with light sweet notes. Palate: Light body with thin texture and average carbonation. Short sweet finish. Overall: Refreshing. Very soft features and easy to drink. Average beer but not metallic or alcoholid memories.
Premium Cristal (Peru);Lima, Peru;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Backus y Johnston (AB InBev);Pours clear, pale golden, with a full, white head. Aroma is corn syrup and straw. Taste is corn syrup, moving to light clove and a hop overtone. Finish is oddly hoppy. Not a beer I'd look to drink again.
Premium Cristal (Peru);Lima, Peru;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Backus y Johnston (AB InBev);Pale golden with a white head - Malt aroma - malt body with just hints of hops to balance - Malts in the finish with just hints of hops - This was just ok

LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;On draught at the micro-brewery tavern/campground near Unity, Wisconsin. Pours a clear copper amber brew with a thick off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some spotty lacing and off-white ring. Aroma of caramel malt, some roasted nuts, flowery hops and a touch of toffee. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with flavors of caramel malt, fruity apples/pear, some flowery hops and a touch of mild spice. Finish has a good balance of malt and flowery hop aftertaste that quickly turns to a crisp and clean cut finish. The crisp finish from the brewery�s new location water is a major improvement from the past batches.
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Dark copper color with no head. Muddled aroma that seems to be some grains, but nothing stands out. Taste is earthy, actually pretty spot on to being a wet pile of leaves. Cardboard starting to creap in.
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with hopdog, thanks Steve!) Amber waves of grain and corn are the feature of this mediocre red ale. It�s lightly sweet and caramely, somewhat toasty, and I don�t think there are any hops in this beer whatsoever. The nose is all cheap smelling corn. Light-medium body, but this beer gets watery in a hurry. Medium amber body is a bit hazy, but I can clearly see that there are no carbonation bubbles rising through the beer. Barely a filmy layer of head forms during the pour, and that quickly fades to a tiny ring. Frankly, this is one of the worst red ales I�ve ever tasted. It�s like drinking a golden ale with food coloring.
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;A thin-bodied amber brew with a filmy off-white head, this has a sweet caramel aroma with rotting apples thrown in for snicks. The taste is a weak caramel malt with the slightest hint of a non-hop bitterness. With selling points like that, it�s no wonder there�sno commercial description. Thanks & a tip o� the pint to El_Borracho and RAYBOY01.
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Poured a medium and cloudy amber with virtually no head. Kinda of a skunky cabbage aroma. Tastes like water with a slice of lemon in it. Very thin. I�m on my way to dump this one out...
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Watery texture, underwhelming on all levels...flavor was weak, forgettable, caramel hints, no hops detectable at all. Will not try it again.
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Light amber with a small head. Not much in the way of aroma. I tried this right after the lager they make and other than color there is not much difference. Possibly good for pounding when out on the boat catching walleye, eh der!
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Dark orange, almost amber colored body. The aroma is sweet apples with cheap tobacco and some earthy dirt. The taste is light toffee and oak with some roasted and salted peanuts. The body is a little thin for an amber. However, this is a very accessible beer that is still interesting. This would be ok as a lawn mower beer.
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;"Copper color ale with an off-white head of thick bubbles. Aroma is mild and malty. Flavor is somewhat flat but still fresh and ok; bitter, coppery and oaty. Finish is unpleasantly flat; in retrospect I can see cardboard in there like some other ratings."
LogJam Swede Saw Red;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LogJam Microbrewery;Bottle - pours a nice off white, thin head over a deep red brown beer. Aroma of sweet malt and some roasted character. Nice roasted flavor, even a bit of a burnt bite. I like this beer. Did they use some lightly smoked grain. It seems like it. A little thin on the end, but really malty and warming.
Independence Scotch Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Independence Brew Pub;"""Cask conditioned. Poued a nice dark copper color. Smalled creamy head which left good lacing. Not sure if it was cause it was cask conditioned but almost no carbonation. Mouthfeel was smooth, kind of coated the tounge. Aroma was of sweet malts and yeast. Flavor was of hops and sweet malts. Had kind of a sweet bready aftertaste. Awsome beer. """
Independence Scotch Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Independence Brew Pub;Very dark for a scotch ale. Almost black with a thick head. Looked more like a porter or a stout, but when I tasted it, there was definitly the character of a scotch. Lots of malty sweetness. Very different from what I am used to in a scotch, but I liked it.
Independence Scotch Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Independence Brew Pub;Draft at the brewpub during the Eagles victory over the Giants. A bit dry and hoppy for a scottish ale, lots of roasted barley more in line with a porter. Overall a bit off balance.
Independence Scotch Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Independence Brew Pub;Pitch black with a thin tan head. Slight lingering hop bitterness on the palate. Not as malty as I would expect from a scotch ale and I would liken this more to a porter.
Independence Scotch Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Independence Brew Pub;Rich creamy head, kept that great head throughout the entire pint, blackish color, had a very distinct sweetness on the nose & at the start of the taste, a malty-type of aftertaste, I'm not usually one for Scotch ales but this was great
Altes Tramdepot Schwarzbier;Bern, Switzerland;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Altes Tramdepot;"Draught at ""Altes Tramdepot Brewpub"" - Bern. Deep brown color, good fizzy aspect, elegant and solid head, little nut color. Fresh malty notes with rumors of roast wood and cereals. Refreshing and little bitterish taste, good alcoholic balanced and pleasant malty final."
Altes Tramdepot Schwarzbier;Bern, Switzerland;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Altes Tramdepot;"very dark brwon colour, small brown tainted head, malty, caramel nose, slightly sweet with a late bitterness, short dry caramel finish; a modest roastiness shows up while the beer is getting warmer - not much character"

B�re-Br�u Burton Ale;Bern, Switzerland;Red Ale - Irish;B�re-Br�u;"Amber ale, misty, nice head. Very nice hop aroma, lightly floreal; some caramel too. In the mouth, the first impression is the hop, strong but not aggressive, aromatic; then some malt with light caramel, completely overwhelmed; finally the hop strikes back, aggressive, bitter. The palate is aromatic, strong and long, maybe too much bitter, but with an interesting hint of nuts and bitter orange. Beers of Switzerland"
B�re-Br�u Burton Ale;Bern, Switzerland;Red Ale - Irish;B�re-Br�u;pale reddish colour, few head, nice lace, pineapple, floral and caramel aroma, very creamy and smooth, full with a decent bitterness, long dry hop aftertaste

Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Soft coppery body and okay foam, very vague hops on the nose. Flavour is mostly malt and a hint of hops. Full enough on the mouth. Way too malty even for an old school IPA, and actually really hard to differentiate from their ESB. When it's a total crapshoot and even the waitress can't tell (and even brings over an extra sample of the ESB so you can make sure), well.....
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;On tap at Sailor Hagar�s, pours an opaque dark orange with a medium beige head. Nose brings out medium strength hops, some metallic notes, and crisp biscuity malt. Flavour is quite astringent, with a very harsh hop bitterness dominating everything. Nothing refined or pleasant about this. A little abrasive.
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;On tap at Sailor Hagars. Pours a solid amber with creamy white head that lasts to the bottom of the glass. Aroma has pine and grapefruit/citrus hop notes. Flavour is also very hoppy but with enough toffee malt character to balance it out. Lingering bitterness. Decent but a tad underwhelming.
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;"Draught at Sailor Hagar�s Golden color; creamy head. The aroma is lightly fruity, at least this one has some aroma, from Sailor Hagar�s. The mouthfeel is quite dry, but there is a good toffee flavor, a very strong bitterness, with a good share of hop oils and resins, and bitter orange peel. Solid."
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;650ml Bottle purchased at Sailor Hagar�s. Beer has good body and hop bitterness. Pronounced grapefruit flavour. Overall, this is an enjoyable IPA and more than worth trying.
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;The Sailor Hagar�s IPA was undoubtedly better when it was brewed on premises in North Vancouver. However, it remains one of the finest BC IPAs. Reddish-orange color. Strong nose with distinct hops and grapefruit notes. Citrusy throughout the bouquet and the taste too.
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;(Draught) I found that they were sold all out of the bottled version so I was lucky to find this on tap. Pours a thin, beige head with an orange-amber body. Nose and flavour of sweet English malts and bitter PNW hoppiness. By far the best beer at the Hagar. Too bad the bar is SO unimpressive...
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Was one of my fave�s when it was made by Gary Lohin. It was BCs best IPA. I still like it but the recipe has been tweaked by Fab & Franco at Howe Sound. Here�s a secret - all the contract brews at Sailor Hagar�s are exactly what�s on tap at Howe Sound - just a different name. Compare the ratings! That said, it�s served with a creamy head, great lace, hops now less citrusy than before, thinner in the mouth.
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;An orange beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet hoppy with hints of caramel. The flavor is nicely hoppy, and the alcohol burns slightly on the tongue.
Sailor Hagars Bengal IPA;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Very light orange, off-white head. Floral and piney nose, sweaty average floral hops hide most of the maltiness. Barky, lasting oily hops bitterness, woody and annoying. Light bodied feels mysteriously sticky. Average..
Ragutis Special;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Fine, not bitter, one of the best from Ragutis. Only in cans................
Ragutis Special;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Yellow color. Fizzy, little hops, slightly bitter..........................
Ragutis Special;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Medium gold, hop touch, slight fruitiness...pretty bland. Pass on it.......
Willimantic Limited Edition IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Hazy unfiltered peach. Pine sap aroma, incredibly intense. Medium bodied, loaded with hops. I mean, holy crap this is like drinking hop juice. Bitter Chinook hops and light citric notes. An IPA lovers dream, although terribly unbalanced. Who cares. If you need a hop fix Willimantic is the place to hit for primo IPA's.
Willimantic Mail Sack Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Imperial;Willimantic Brewing Company;This beer is an Imperial Stout by style, brewed with eight different malts and barley, and coming in at a mighty 8.8% abv. Imperial Stouts are big, robust, roasty, high octane brews that were brewed by British brewers in the 19th Century to be drank as a winter warmer in the brutally cold conditions of the Baltics and Russia. They are rich, decadent brews with intense aromas, flavors, and alcohol punch. Main Sack Stout is a stellar domestic example of this style, and one that would please even Ivan the Terrible. Mail Stack Stout is served in a 10oz brandy snifter and pours to an ink black color with a thick, dense, cinnamon colored head, with a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is amazingly complex with a multitude of aromas. Dark chocolate, espresso coffee, piney hop aromas, licorice, and peppery waves of alcohol heat flood the nostrils. The palate is rich and decadent, with layers of complex malty and estery flavors. Dark chocolate, sweet malt, burnt currants, fig, licorice, espresso, and treacle flavors all lay heavy on the tongue. The consistancy of this beer is oily and viscous on the tongue as it slowly glides down. Mail Sack Stout finishes with more big complex flavors up front, then ends with a roasty, hoppy, soothing, warming burn that lingers. Once again, Willimantic Brewing has stunned me with one of the most impressive Imperial Stouts I have ever tasted.
Lion Brewmasters Autumn Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Amber orange colour. Citrusy hop aroma. Spicy, slightly citrusy mild hop flavour with a solid malt backbone. A little too solid, I would like the hops to come to the forefront a bit more.
Harrington's The First of the Summer Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle, pours a hazy light gold with a large white foamy head. Strong aroma of ginger and cordial. Spicy, but thin palate. Ginger, lemon, apple and raisin flavours, but with cardboard malt in the finish. Not for me - do others really like it that much?
Harrington's The First of the Summer Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);(Bottle 50 cl) Cloudy, pale golden with a small, white head. Aroma of honey, ginger and oranges. Medium body with rather sweet fruits and honey and also some ginger. Ends fairly dry. Actually quite balanced and refreshing - and very summery. 040208
Harrington's The First of the Summer Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Golden, slightly green very hazy body with a small head. Fruity aroma with ginger. Citrus and ginger in the taste. Small and plenty of boubles. Citrus and ginger aftertaste makes a very light feeling.
Harrington's The First of the Summer Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle. A rocky white head sits atop a clear pale straw yellow brew. Large fresh almost ginger ale type fragrance with contrasting flavours. Biting dryness, spices and definately the Elderflowers though I would have almost said dandylions. It�s an eclectic, different pick-n-mix type brew - I�ll go out on a limb and suggest that while many won�t, I think it�s not too bad...
Harrington's The First of the Summer Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Perhaps a bit harsh in my comments but this is a fairly pedestrian golden ale style. Well constructed nevertheless. Light malts, faint honey, and a nice elegant spice finish. Not miles away from Coopers Pale and Sparkling, at least to my tastes.
Harrington's The First of the Summer Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);The colour was pale amber gold, and there was a light head. The aroma was strong fruit and ginger coriander. The taste had strong spicy ginger, and there was a crisp light hoppy finish. This was a quite fresh beer with strong fruit, and it was quite crisp.
Harrington's The First of the Summer Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Very floral with strong corriander aroma. Tangelo hits first in the flavor with corriander finishing. Little vanilla or elderflower presence.
Harrington's The First of the Summer Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Nice golden-orange colour. Vanilla is apparent in the aroma. Interesting flavour: citrusy (but not like a witbier, you can really taste the tangelo), and pretty sweet, not much hop balance at all.

Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);500ml bottle BB 9/3/2017 Aroma is all sweet spicy fruit cake. Poured dark red/brown with decent head. A mild bitterness is followed by a delicious smooth mellow rounded finish with warming sherry/brandy barrel overtones. The best from this brewer.
Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Rzadko spotykany u nas styl, s? nawet dodatki toffee i wanilii. Nieco zbyt s?odkie, ale ci??kie, oleiste i warte wypr�bowania. Mimo wszystko dost?pne u nas whiskey stouty moim zdaniem s? lepsze.
Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I think that is is a bit good. Clearly the brewer is in some kind of rebuild rebadge reimagine, but this has many of things that you might look for in a beer, inviting and welcome about of bitter, fantastic amount of roasted chocolate dark malts and a lovely sweet over-note, which not being a bourbon drinker I�ll make it hat. The finish is soft and lands well. I�m really enjoying this and it is possibly the brewers best.
Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A pleasantly surprising brew that is full bodied and well balanced but add a subtle hint of hard liquor to keep you guessing. One of my favourite beers from this brewer.
Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I saw a description a few minutes ago that describe a beer as looking like Coca-Cola. This applies here except that it has been poured over a significant amount of rum to account for the thick latte coloured head. Smells of cocoa, dates, dusty carob dark sugar and molasses. Flavours similar with cola coming through now that the idea has been planted in my head. Some bitterness arising reminiscent of dark chocolate. A lengthy, pleasing finish. Another look a few years after the first trial sees me think this is quite a bit better. Quite a bit better.
Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"500ml bottle purchased and consumed in Christchurch, NZ. Pours clear and dark reddish-brown with a very good beige head. Feel: Medium-full body and nicely smooth; medium and rather lively carbonation. Aroma: appealing and fruity, with raisins, dates and dark roasted grains plus a hint of smoke. Flavor: similar to the aroma with plenty of dark fruits and a hint of smoke, but with some hops showing in the finish and aftertaste and a hint of bourbon. Very good balance. O: Excellent. One of the better NZ dark beers . A big dark ale without real high ABV. Recommended."
Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Pours a dark red colour with a thin white head, malty aroma with the bourbon in the background, the taste is sweet with malt but the bourbon does not come through in the taste, with a dry finish.
Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);weird, i had this only two days ago but it was obviously nothing special (either great or terrible) because i can hardly remember anything about it. malt and alcohol are the two things i remember. it was good, anyway.
Harrington's Big John Special Reserve;Christchurch, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Had this sitting in the fridge for a while now. Pours a deep bronze with reddish tinges down the side of the glass. Small light tan coloured head. Falls away pretty quickly. Looks a little lifeless in the glass. Aromas are not too bad. Some dark stone fruits, a little sweet caramel, hints of vanilla and some alcohol surprisingly given abv. Not too bad. Taste is dominated by nutty grain and more of that alcohol. Somewhat sweet. Thin mouthfeel.
Pink Elephant McEllies;Blenheim, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pink Elephant;Hazy dark orange appearance. Very sweet malty aroma, malt carries throung into the palate and ends slightly bitter.

Pink Elephant McEllies;Blenheim, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pink Elephant;Clear light brown. Sweet malty rich coffee aroma. Much richer taste, fruity, and alcohol comes through slightly. Good body, goes downsweet with a bit of alcohol.

Pink Elephant McEllies;Blenheim, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pink Elephant;Light brown, amlmost reddish hue. Wonderful milk chocolate aroma with flavour to match. Light to medium bodied. Not super complex, but an incredibly balanced rich, chocolatey Scotch Ale with a wonderful silky smooth mouthfeel. This goes down very easily despite its strength. Damn good!
Three Needs Stickebier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"At first I thought this must be the same thing as the Alt; but upon tasting, then going back and looking at my rating for the other, I must conclude this is a different beer and one of the better offerings from this pub. A smooth brown semi-translucent color is topped by a reasonable and lasting head; aroma is not strong in the smoky bar, but caramel and earthy malt notes do come through. Very well balanced in flavor and on the palate, quite sweet (caramel caramel) and somewhat fruity but with plenty of hoppy zing and a big kick on the back end. Good body. A pleasure."
Kreuz-Bier Helles Naturtr�b;Spiez, Switzerland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gasthausbrauerei Kreuz;cloudy blond with a fine head, nice lace, fruity (apricot) and hoppy nose, slightly nutty, full and tart, decent bitterness, dry hop finish with notes of apricot - this beer needs to get warmer to let the aroma coming out properly
Kreuz-Bier Dunkelweizen;Spiez, Switzerland;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Gasthausbrauerei Kreuz;dark amber colour, fine creamy head, nice lace, aroma, of blood, quite flat and slightly tart, metallic finish - something went wrong with this beer and it has no analogies with a dunkelweizen
Lagunitas B2K;Petaluma, California, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Bottle courtesy of Greg Koch at our stop at the Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens on 08/03/2008 on day three of RBSG 2008.

Poured chunky but a clear amber color with no head. The aroma was of apples and brown sugar. Sweet smell with alcohol fumes running up the nose. The flavor was sweet and malty. Sugary with a full body and sticky mouthfeel. Warming in the throat.
Lagunitas B2K;Petaluma, California, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Sampled at the 2008 RBSG from a bottle from Greg Koch Cellar. This Eisbock pours a medium brown color from a 12oz bottle. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is caramel, fruity and sweet. The hops are earthy. It�s kind of a bit past its prime and the oxidation is evident, but it seems to work here, it makes the sweetness much more evident. Carbonation was good. Very smooth tasting. Hides the 12.5% very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Lagunitas B2K;Petaluma, California, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);12oz bottle at Stone during RBSG. Dark brown. Thick. Nice buttery malty aroma. Very nice. Sweet. Delicious.

Lagunitas B2K;Petaluma, California, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);sweet malt and fruit nose. with some hop presence, weird for style. warming brndy and madeira notes almost portlike at the finish.
Lagunitas B2K;Petaluma, California, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Murky brown color with smallish head. Aroma of light roasted malt and mellow hops but thats all thats mellow about this magic elixar. Why would they possibly discontinue something this good? Tastes of over ripe oranges, brown sugar and espresso round it out. Magic on the lips.
Lagunitas B2K;Petaluma, California, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Brown sugar gone wild. Very sticky palate. Clingy, long-lasting head. Citrus/caramel notes.

Lagunitas B2K;Petaluma, California, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Mahogany color. Impressive head for this much alcohol. Some apricot aroma and flavor. Stong caramel flavor. Slightly sweet. Brown sugar? Full body. Quite bitter. A friend I was with saw 1.070 and 12.5% ABV on the label and thought there had to be a typo. I didn't realize this was an Eisbock when I drank it. It all makes sense now...

Carbonation moderate (high for Asian beers), slow and fine. Aroma is of slight malt and sweet honey; alcohol well hidden. Taste is quite sweet with hints of honey and alcohol burn; alcohol burn increases as it warms and over-powers everything. Light to medium body. Smooth with an alcohol burn on the finish. Not nice."

Sailor Hagars Grizzly Nut Brown;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;On cask at Sailor Hagar�s, pours a clear amber with a medium bubbly beige head. Aroma is quite medicinally sweet, with artificial sweetness and cough syrup. Flavour is thankfully better, but still bringing out some medicinal notes, sour toffee, and some English malt. Is tho how it�s supposed to taste? Not good at all.
Sailor Hagars Grizzly Nut Brown;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Sample at brewpub. Pours a dark brown colour with thin ring of off white foam. Aroma has some prominent malt but lacks a nuttiness. Taste is reasonably malty but again the nutiness is lacking. Okay.
Sailor Hagars Grizzly Nut Brown;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Hand-pump at Sailor Hagar�s Brown color, creamy head. Light caramel and very light butterscotch aroma. The body is weaker than expected, there is caramel flavor, low bitterness. The hand-pump allows for lower carbonation, which is better for me. Simple but easy to drink
Sailor Hagars Grizzly Nut Brown;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Re-rate 10 years later at the source. It's dark brown with good creamy head, okay biscuit on the nose though it does come across as watery. The flavour is more sweet biscuit with a big watery streak. Medium finish but not fulfilling. Simple and simplified, needs more attention to its style but probably works for the coughing 75 year old next to me whose tastebuds are shot from several decades of heavy smoking. September 2009 - Bought as a bottle quite awhile ago. Lives up to its name quite well, lots of nutty flavour in this one, some malts, but really too nutty a flavour for my tastes. Comes across as a little artificial, and low alcohol content doesn�t help me to get tipsy to enjoy it more either. Still okay, just not great.
Sailor Hagars Grizzly Nut Brown;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Decent nut brown: not sweet as some can be, but then again it�s not got any distinctive flavors either. Quaffable and pretty good.
Sailor Hagars Grizzly Nut Brown;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;(650ml bottle) Purchased at the Sailor Hagar�s Off-Sale for ~$5. Lasting foamy almond-coloured head with a ruby body. Pleasant roasteed malt and slight coffee flavours. This is a good contender. I like the solid beers made by Howe Sound.
Sailor Hagars Grizzly Nut Brown;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Very dark porterish colour with ruby and mahogany notes. Has a thin light brown head. Sweet blackstrap molasses and treacle aroma. A vineous sherry-like aroma. Cherry and black current fruitiness with port-like notes as well. Not like any other brown ale that I�ve had. Tends to become cloying, but is still a well-crafted beer. Based on the description I�m reading I think this is a totally different beast from what others were drinking when it was still brewed at Sailor Hagars.
Sailor Hagars Grizzly Nut Brown;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Dark brown body with little head. Flavour is nice and nutty but a little thin. Finish is dry.

De Cam Oude Geuze;Gooik, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Geuzestekerij De Cam;Taster, many thanks to Werckmeister! Golden-orange, clear body, with a medium, fluffy, yellowish head. Aroma of cheesy funk, basement, some horse blanket, lemon, apple, wood. Tastes similar, with some more ripe stone fruits. Medium, slightly creamy mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. Finishes dry, musty, wooden, moderate citric, with some green apple, some basement. Really tasty! Not the most complex Geuze I've had, but so balanced, with a great, rustic character. Lovely, diverse funk notes, which are my highlight here, while also interesting fruit notes. Score: 8 / 4 / 8 / 4 / 17
De Cam Oude Geuze;Gooik, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Geuzestekerij De Cam;Barwa z�ota, piana du�a. Aromat owocowy, cytrusowy, dziki. W smaku mocno wytrawny, kwa�ny, sporo winogron, siano, nuty dzikie. Fajne pifko.

De Cam Oude Geuze;Gooik, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Geuzestekerij De Cam;Refrigerated 75 cL bottle poured into a glass. Clear golden with white head. Aroma is funky, medium body, low carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is funky and dry.
De Cam Oude Geuze;Gooik, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Geuzestekerij De Cam;(750ml 2016 bottle from boxbeers, I think) Pours nearly clear pale orange with a big head of fine eggshell foam that piles high and lingers with lace. Aroma is musty and funky but has a bright fruity core, with notes of oranges and pit fruit, citrus peels, ample wood, dried leaves, blue cheese, some barnyard, nice spike of lactic tartness. Flavour is smooth and less tart than the nose implies, notes of mandarin, sweet apple and yellow plum (or some other pit fruit?), soft lemony lactic acidity, minerals, dry grass, just a little wood giving a leathery drydown. Lingering notes of oranges and pit fruit. Medium bodied with rather high effervescent carbonation. A rather soft geuze, especially on the tongue where the funk is less present, but the surprisingly bright fruit character was a treat.
De Cam Oude Geuze;Gooik, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Geuzestekerij De Cam;0.75 bottle in Craft Room. Lovely tangerine and sourness in aroma, wine barrel, wild yeast, mold. Bit hazy amber color with medium sized white head. Barrel, mold and sourness. Medium body, completely flat. Long sour aftertaste. Nice!

Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Handpull cask at the Vernon Arms, Liverpool. Golden brown. Clear with a tight off-white head. Aroma of raisins, caramel, browned toast. Sweet, fruity taste, very malt-led. More bitterness in the finish, with Garibaldi biscuit in the aftertaste. A passable stronger bitter.
Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Pours a brown colour. Taste is malty with some sour vomit like taste. An ok bitter
Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Picture of the late undersung national treasure Pete Postlethwaite on badge. Not a bad ale, but can�t call it an apt tribute. Quite thin, sweet, not much depth of flavour. An alright session ale however, fairly typical of coach house. Similar to Post Horn.
Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;On cask at Wheatsheaf (JDW), Stoke. Pours amber with white head. Erm, strange bitterness with a hint of toffee. Very thin and typical of Coach House in my experience.

Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Cask@lychgatetavern, wolverhampton. Amber beer with small head and good lacing. Aroma of mild hops. Taste is a little bit of hops, bready, malts and a touch nutty. Average beer.
Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Served on cask at the Sussex Arms, Twickenham Green into an English half pint jug (Jan �12). A little background, this beer was brewed as a tribute to the great English actor Pete Postlethwaite, who died in January 2011 born in Warrington home of the Coach House brewery. Poured to a mid golden/amber colour with a small white head that held up fairly well through drinking. A floral, hoppy, grassy aroma attacks the nose - good all round sense attack! Quite a dry and hoppy beer, less flowery in taste than aroma but still a little floral flavour in there. Also a sweet and light malted flavour. Mouthfeel is adequate, not full bodied, not thin - just right, dry and bitter in the aftertaste, perhaps more than the floral/hop aroma and taste would suggest. Overall - a decent tribute to a favourite actor of mine!
Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Cask at Bon Accord, Glasgow (14 Jan 12) - pours hazy golden with a slighlty hoppy aroma, very smooth and sweetish and a pleasure to drink
Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Cask @ 3 Judges. Clear golden colour, white head. Aroma is slightly hoppy, and slightly malty. Very subtle, but at the same time not watery. Hints of glue. Very sessionable.
Coach House Postlethwaites;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Cask@Oliver Twist. Reddish-copper brown, good off-white head. Sweetish flowery hoppy nose. A bit strange hop profile, woody-grassy, a bit out of balance. Long hoppy aftertaste. Extra point to Pete Postlethwaite, cool actor!
Adler Brau Bucky Brau Barley Wine;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;"Bottle that is at least two years old and found while digging through my ""cellar"" and cost me $1.59 at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee. Served in my Stone RIS snifter: A muddy reddish brown color with a small frothy tan head that produced moderate lace. The aroma has lots of fruity esters, caramel malting, candi sugar and some spicy hops. An inviting nose and I got interested is what would follow...then came the taste... what is that? Starts with a quick dash of sugars and malt but then a surprising winey acidic nature pops up. Lot of oxidation in the flavors as well leading me to think of this as more English Old Ale than Barleywine. The finish is sort of peppery but really more papery and blends away to nothingness. Despite the negative comment, this is not really bad, just not expected. The feel is slightly sticky and more mellow than most of the genre. In the end, this is a forgettable beer but not regrettable."
Adler Brau Bucky Brau Barley Wine;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;"Slightly murky fiery red body, no head. Aroma is fruity and sugary with some cherry, apricot, and pineapple. The flavor is bizarre; lots of pineapple juice (sweetened), heavily sweet malt, and hot alcohol. Where are the hops that other raters mention? The body is full and sticky. Horribly unbalanced in my opinion. Shame."
Adler Brau Bucky Brau Barley Wine;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Hmmm, didn't know what to make of this brew-was it supposed to be a barleywine, or an old ale, or a spice/herb/veg brew? It was like the transexual of brews in my opinion. Very fruity nose-palate was somewhat like DFH rasion d etre, but definately not as good-finish reminded me of Flying dog Horn Dog barleywine, just without the carbonation. A wierd brew-definately not my type of barleywine(SN bigfoot and Avery hog heaven are my types!!)
Adler Brau Bucky Brau Barley Wine;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;This has a very sweet, somewhat floral aroma with a hint of cherry. Very rich dark brown in color. The body is sweet, sour, syrupy and complex, but also confusing. It has good flavor but is unbalanced. Kinda tastes like a cross between a traditional barley wine and a Flanders red.
Adler Brau Bucky Brau Barley Wine;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Year unknown. Slightly hazy dark ruby. Thin tan edge head, loaded with tiny bubbles and lasting til the end. Very light carbonation. Aroma of alcohol, strawberries, resinous hops and sugared caramel. Medium thick body, quite viscous. Hearty and filling caramel malts with a hoppy overtone of pine sap. Malt depth is thick and sweet, almost cloying and sticky. Strawberry-like fruitiness. Body thins a bit as it sits and this balances itself better than when it began. Obvious alcohol in the aroma is hidden well within the thick body. Finishes with an increase in sticky fruitiness and juicy hops. A decent Barley wine from an unheard of brewery.
Adler Brau Bucky Brau Barley Wine;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;"Formerly known as ""Bucky Red"". A deep ruby color with minimal head - typical to style. Floral, malt and alcohol fill the aroma. Warming, fruity and estery. If any fault a bit thin in the mouthfeel. A nice barley wine."

Central Waters Lac Du Bay India Pale Ale;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Not a bad ipa. Definitely drinkable but nothing really stands out about it. Hoppy but lingers a bit long.
Central Waters Lac Du Bay India Pale Ale;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Moderate grassy and earthy flavors followed by a pithy earthy hop bitterness. Not much malt character. Maybe a hint of burnt bread but has a watery and thin mouthfeel. Some burnt character. But like a burnt rubber.

Pink Elephant Rajah (-2006);Blenheim, New Zealand;Porter;Pink Elephant;Brown colour. Chewy toffee & earth aroma with hints of molasses. Soft, chewy body with slight raisin and molasses. Malty...sweet but quite soft in the finish.
Pink Elephant Rajah (-2006);Blenheim, New Zealand;Porter;Pink Elephant;Bottled. Very dark brown. Papery roasty malt aroma. Dryish with firm but clean malt back bone, Lightly oxidized, but still with a lot of malt flavours intact. Low bitterness.
Pink Elephant Rajah (-2006);Blenheim, New Zealand;Porter;Pink Elephant;Nice dark colour, almost porter like colour. Aroma is sweet, molasses with some light spice. Malty taste, some roastiness but thins as you continue. Nice flavour but a little light.
Pink Elephant Rajah (-2006);Blenheim, New Zealand;Porter;Pink Elephant;Pours black with a ruby tint and an off-white head. Plenty of coffee in the roasty aroma, along with some notes of chocolate. The body is lighter than expected but grows into a bitter coffee finish.
Pink Elephant Rajah (-2006);Blenheim, New Zealand;Porter;Pink Elephant;Tasted 18/05/2005, retasted 16/01/2006. 330ml bottle from Regional Wines and Spirits (both times). Near-black, garnet tinted, dark ale with a thick, lasting, tan head. The chocolate malt nose jumps out at you superbly, reminding me of an unsweetened cocoa drink. There�s also hints of vanilla bean, caramel and roasted coffee in this pungent nose. Also get soft floral notes and sweet tobacco. Good flavour that balances sweet malt with a chocolatey, roasty, bitterness. More of that fsoft floral hopping. Fritha picks some minty hints from the hops (good girl, she�s getting better). Mouthfeel is right on medium body and is a little tingly from being the slightest bit overcarbonated, for me. Finish is relatively dry and the palate is slightly powdery. Lovely, delicious, worth consuming (in moderation, of course).
Pink Elephant Rajah (-2006);Blenheim, New Zealand;Porter;Pink Elephant;Nearly black in colour. Vinous aroma (similar to Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout). Winey flavour, with a slight tendency toward roast/burnt malts towards the finish. Relatively light bodied with a thinnish mouthfeel.

Harrington's Wheat Beer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Slightly hazy pale yellow colour with a fluffy white head that looks like molten marshmallow. It looks good enough to drink (which is reassuring). The aroma is driven by a lemon scent with faint basement yeastiness and some ground coriander. Cantabrian�s not gonna like that! The flavour is again light, dry and lemon citrussy. It faintly gains that yeasty character as it sits on the tongue and there�s a soft banana and clove that comes through in time as well. It�s a pleasant surprise this beer and I�m forming a shortlist of people to introduce it to. It does what it says on the label: clean, crisp and refreshing.
Harrington's Wheat Beer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Again sold as a weiss beer. Light pineapple colour and a lasting bubbly head. Sweetish of pineapple and esters.

Foggy pale ""wheat colour"" that gets cloudier towards the end of bottle. Average short lived white head. Aroma of wheat really. Smooth wheat dominating initial taste, with a longish bitter finish. Yeasty/banana flavours in the mix. Almost a soapy taste in mouth after drinking this but gets better the more you have."

Harrington's Wheat Beer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);ecz is right that this had little flavour besides wheat, making it taste just like breakfast cereal. but it was 10am and we'd had nothing to eat so it did seem appropriate. maybe it was my empty stomach, but the alcohol did seem particularly warming and dominated the finish
Harrington's Wheat Beer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);slight banana in aroma otherwise the only flavour is wheat. nothing else, it's like eating cereal, which is not without its pleasures i guess. cardboardy, stale, thin and fizzy. bit of a letdown, i thought harringtons were gunner be good for some reason.
Harrington's Wheat Beer;Christchurch, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);cloudy straw colour, nice tight head. spicey mild bitter tatse..............

Dragonmead Larrys Lionheart Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Dragonmead Brewery;Poured up via nitro tap at the Dragonmead brewpub with a clear copper body, off white head and thick sludgy lacing. The aroma offers up bready and mineral notes as well as some spicy hops. The taste is smooth and pretty yummy with citrus, spicy and floral hop flavor slowly building toward hop bitterness. To about midway it picks up mineral notes.

Dragonmead Larrys Lionheart Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Dragonmead Brewery;Not as distinctive as their other pale. Light taste. Refreshing. Little hop taste.
Dragonmead Larrys Lionheart Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Dragonmead Brewery;very average with a bland taste to it. none of the beers here have very good aroma. this one has no aroma or taste. not very good.

Faust Walters Brown Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;On tap at the brew. I�ve had this a couple of years ago...in fact it was the only beer on tap, just like this time...but I couldn�t recall if I liked it or not. Pours a mahogany red with a good head. Nice bubbles. Nose is typical malt with a nutty, roasted quality...along with chocolate and dates. Flavor was roasted chestnuts with Fig Newtons. Was a bit thin, but has good coverage considering how slick it is. I was surprised by this beer...even if they only had one.
Faust Walters Brown Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;Clear light brown with a thin white head. Sweet caramel and slightly earthy aroma. Toffee flavor with a hint of chocolate. Clean but boring.
Faust Walters Brown Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;Awesome brew.I was hooked on pint #1. It is local only, and only on tap. It is extremely flavorful. Nice round taste with fruity, hoppy fullness. It finishes great, and no gas! lol I am not sure I have had better. It is very rich in color, dark brown, but not black. Very high head due to the tap, and is carmelly sweet, but not overdone. This is a great brew. If you are in town for Wurstfest, you need to stop in for a pint. RERATE: They had a new batch come out last week. I was very disappointed. One of the factors that has to be considered in a brew pub beer is consistency. The new batch was very bitter, and less flavorful. It still had the robustness and berry/maple feel, but the bitterness was painful. Man I was in love with that last batch! lol
Faust Golden Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Clear gold in color, ample carbonation level. Aroma is weak grain and straw, nothing more. The flavor is really isn�t much different base tastes like German Pils malt with the straw and grain. Body is real light and thin. What more can I really say about a Golden ale? With this one nothing more.
Faust Golden Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;Draft at the source, from notes. Hazy pale yellow color, medium white head. Aroma of peppery hay. Taste is wet straw. Light body.
Faust Golden Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;Golden pour with a white head. The aroma and flavor are quite buttery with a hint of grass and biscuit malt thrown in. Something is wrong with this batch. Would like to try again.
Faust Golden Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;Well... this is the only regular Faust brew that I�ve never had. Time to drink it. Light, but bright, golden yellow in color, it has a thin, almost soapy bright white head. The nose shows some nice, stiff hops and pilsener malts, leaving a great overall aroma that�s fresh, refreshing, and flavorfully light. A pilsener-like malt flavor and soft bitter finish shows up soon after it enters the mouth, with the in-mouth flavor made up mainly of a fresh grain and soft palated, sharp flavored, very distinctive hops. It�s slightly thicker than your average Texas golden ale. I like it! Tops my list of golden ales.
Faust Golden Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;Clear gold pour, Aroma is light fruit and hops. Flavors of grain, light hop. Boring.
Faust Golden Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;Clear and golden in color with a thin white head. Mild, slightly fruity and grainy aroma. Basic grain and slightly caramel flavor. Rather thin overall.
Faust Golden Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;I am not a blond fan, and this one is not anywhere near my top list. It is bitter and very sharp. The color is very light blond. It has a high head, like the Walter's Brown, but is not flavorful or strong enough. I am prejudiced towards lighter beers, so take my words with a grain.
Faust Amber Ale;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;"Definitely hoppy, but I am not a fan of the flavor. It could be that ""light beer"" problem I have. It is not exceptionally round in flavor, or deep in texture. I am not a fan."
Faust Dullahan Irish Stout;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;(Draught) Pours an opaque black body with a small tan head. Aroma of peat, licorice, and roasted malt. Flavor of lactose, roasted malt, peat, and cocoa.
Faust Dullahan Irish Stout;New Braunfels, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;The Faust Hotel & Brewing Company;"This was one of the worst beer experiences of my life. Me and the girlfriend stopped here on the way back from Dodging Duck in Boerne (a respectable brewpub). We walk in at 430 after calling to find out that the brewpub opened at 400. But, upon entry, we noticed that the lights are off and there isnt a soul in the place, not even a bartender. I go to piss and tell the gf to figure this out. When I come out, my gf was talking to a 40 some odd year old bartender woman who was obviously a heavy smoker, her face looked like a catchers mitt. So, I cautiously sit at the bar and ask which beers are available. She goes into some long story about how the place undergoing a change in management and they temporarily halted beer production...all they have is one....the stout. I agree to try this beer. The old hag pulls the tap handle and walks away. I hear air coming through the tap, see periodic sprays of foam. At this point, I shit myself. Are you serious?? The lady walked away to let the lines fill up with this crap. She finally comes back with a plastic pitcher and fills it with a steady stream of foam. I interject with, ""I'll just try a sample, how about that""?....the old bag smiles with her pitcher full of foam, now with a 2 inch layer of liquid at the bottom. She takes a metal ice scooper and scoops foam out of the pitcher til most of it was gone! She pours the stout into a small glass and gives it to me. Beads of sweat had developed on my head as I looked down at this scary nectar of Fausts Brewing Company. I take a swig...blah...not bad, just an average brewpub stout. I look up and leatherface says with a thick Texas accent ""It's kinda like a guiness"". I give her a patronizing smirk and a nod of my head. I look down at this 4 ounce glass and decide to go all out and finish it with one gun. The girlfriend was speechless this whole time--ready to go. The only signs of life she had were the looks of fear when leatherface made random yawning grunts when in the back. I slam the glass on the table when the old bag asks if I want a pint of it. I acted as if I was seriously contemplated whether or not to get a whole pint of this garbage. I, of course, denied leatherface's offer, threw a dollar on the bar, grabbed gf's hand and left. I do not plan to ever visit Fausts again, even once they have new management, I never want to see leatherface again."

HardCore Golden Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);A really good cider, better than its over-produced and excessively tarty competitors.

HardCore Golden Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);On tap at the monthly Dec. Boston Brewery tasting. This was my first ever alcoholic cider and i really like it. Very smooth on the palate and gong down. Nice faint apple aroma, flavor was sweet and something else accenting the taste, maybe oak? Very nice, i would definitely like to try this again, but they do not sell it in my area (MA/RI).
HardCore Golden Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);Bottle, 35 cl. Clear yellow with a green touch, no head but some fizzy bubbles.

HardCore Golden Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);Disappointingly flat...(just my bottle?) Nice rich ripe apply aroma. Good sweet golden delicious flavors...with a clean crisp finish. But this needed a LOT more spritziness to be considered really refreshing.

Brakspear Henry on Thames;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brakspear (Marston's);Unusually strong for a hot weather summer ale, perhaps Brakspear know what a British summer is really like. It tastes simular to their old ale and bitter.
Brakspear Oxford Best;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brakspear (Marston's);11th September 2002 - Cask-Conditioned - . Tea colour. Hoppy aroma.

Dry bitterness pervades through this beer with a heady peppery overnote. Obviously a play on hops but the flavour could have been fuller. Fair try though.

Goose Island 14 Year Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Thin head atop a deep almost reddish copper pint. Sweet apples and some faint spices in the nose, almost like baked apples. Little to no detectable carbonation and a perfect blend of malts with a tiny bit of hop end make this very easy to drink. It felt very light (if that makes sense) in my mouth, and the pint disappeared very quickly.

Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;355ml bottle. Pale yellow colour, foamy white head. Aroma is grain malt, a little bit of lager funk and actually some hops. Taste was much the same. Impressed they actually put some hops in a light beer. Palate was a little watery, as is expected, but no more than anything else in the style. Lots of carbo. Overall, pretty good for a light. Stacks up well against other low cal beers like the 67 and even holds up the the non-light version.
Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;341 ml bottle from the brewery. AP clear golden, overcarbed, quick white head AR almost nothing, some sweet grainy 2 row FL touch of powdery malt, touch of peanut shell, finishes anoyingly dry PA over carbed and super dry, might be the dryest light lager ive ever had OV much better options in light lager catagory
Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;Bottle- Thanks Dave! A sparkling golden pour unleashes a foamy but short lived white head. Nose of grains, grassy hops, some biscuit, slightly fruity. Taste is sweet grainy malts, a bit of grass/floral hops, lemon. Quick, fizzy finish leaves no aftertaste whatsoever. Not all that memorable.
Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;"[2476-20090829] Bottle sample. Petrol sweet straw yeast aroma.

Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;essentially a light version of the blonde. the blonde is fine and so is this i guess. taste is subdued. yellow. yawn.
Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;Draught @ The Brewery: Chalk a higher score up to lower expectations. I wasn�t a fan of the blonde so I wasn�t expecting much from a lighter version of it. The head stuck around longer this time, with a very pale yellow colour on the pour. Flavour was more subtle, and thus to me, more enjoyable. A touch more sweetness, which offered more going on than the blonde. I feel the same way here as I do in the Corona vs Corona Light battle - go with the light, it offers less to be disappointed about.
Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;"Bottle (341ml). Poured bright pale slightly bubbly gold with a minimal white head. Not surprisingly, smells just like the ""Natural Blonde"" only lighter - corn, dry grain, a little harsh. Taste is probably nicer than the blonde - similar, sweeter, but less harsh - very watery mouthfeel, still has that unpleasant aftertaste - acceptable lawnmower/fishing trip beer only."
Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;. Fizzy initial pour. Their regular blond may be better, but the taste is OK for a 4% beer. Thin mouthfeel, some hops and a bit of malt. I would have this before a Molson or Labatt, but it is pretty plain. Thanks for the sample Pootz/Pootzboy.
Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;Much like the non-light version, except thinner. Even more pale in colour and bland in taste. A step up from a macro light, but nothing else.
Amsterdam Natural Light;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Amsterdam Brewing Company;2009-08-29. Crisp pale yellow body with a small white head. Aroma of grass and straw, pale malts are light, touch of grainy oddness. &#40 6+&#41 Flavour is thin, straw, grainy pale malts, touch of cardboard. Average to light palate. Meh. 6/3/4/3/10 Bottle at Beer Bistro 2003. Wasn�t impressed with it at first, but it finished nicely. A mediocre beer, but an exceptional light beer 4/3/4/2/9 - 2.2
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;Can as gift from Canada. Deep golden colour with a white head. Aroma malty and citrus. Taste light to mid bitter. Medium body.
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;Light grains if anything. Clear gold with a decent white head. Crystal malts and a touch of hop bitterness.
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;Aroma is honey, clove and citrus. Taste is light sweet malts, honey and a mild earthiness. Sessionable, yes.
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;Color �mbar y aromas maltosos con ligeras notas de caramelo. Adem�s, se perciben los aromas c�tricos y pin�ceos de los l�pulos. En boca, es muy fresca con notas c�tricas de toronja y un final seco que facilita tomarla una y otra vez.
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;473ml can. Pours a clear medium amber-copper with a medium, creamy, long lasting, off-white head that leaves curtains of lace. Sweet, mild aroma of caramel malt, grain and light orange peel. Sweet flavour of caramel malt, bread, orange peel and a hint of grapefruit with a mildly bitter finish. Light body with a thin, watery texture and soft carbonation. Disappointing. Very under hopped and lacking bitterness. Much more like an amber ale, not terrible just boring.
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;Tasty, refreshing. Clean finish. Ok, like but not love. Color is pleasant. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;I just can�t seem to find a big rock beer that I like. The highest abv session IPA I�ve had with the least amount of flavour. Bit of citrus aromas and taste but mostly watery and boring
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;"Upon opening this beer is very aromatically hoppy, more wild sage scent than citrus; it reminds me of summer in the prairies. Taste wise its quite average though, though it isn't the horrible flavour of orange rinds that so many hopped beers posses these days, so it has that going for it. It's an ok drink, but if you can get something better, I would suggest that."
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;On holiday in Canada a 473ml can amber coloured body with a off white head and a spicy malt hops aroma a spicy sweet hops dry bitter taste with a bitter finish
Big Rock Session IPA (India Pale Ale);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;ISA - Session IPA;Big Rock Brewery;Can. Intense yellow-orange, small white head with poor retention, no lacing. Aroma of sugar, hard candies, honey and a touch of spices. Taste of sugary malts, cough syrup and herbs. Total miss for the style.
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);1L glass bottle pours a golden color with a fast dissipating white head. All I will say about this one is that it is one of the worst beers I have ever tried.
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);"Obligatory malt likra purchase for the long weekend at the lake. Actually looks quite decent-- deep golden with a dense, creamy, lasting white head that captures the gently falling ashes from the stirred-up fire pit, like grey cinnamon dusting a beer latte. Aroma is corn syrup and bananas, no alcohol that I can smell (but I�m fighting campfire smoke, and I�m basically shitcanned at this point anyway). Smooth, sweetly malty, warming. Would I buy this again? Fuck no. Was it a decent malt liquor? Sure. But that�s like saying ""That�s the best gas station burrito I�ve ever had""."
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Golden and clear with minimal head. Corny grassy aroma. Lots of malt, a touch of grain and a little alcohol. Decent for a malt liquor.
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Corn, banana, alcohol and grain in the nose. Clear golden body is topped by a decent white head that lasts and laces well. Very sweet flavour shows off plenty of corn, some wacky fruity esters and some alcohol. Grainy in the aftertaste. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Sure it`s well made. Still don`t really care for it though. Bottle sampled with BeerPrince, CapFlu and Oakes.
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Slow carbo, gold colour, thin head. Big alcohol on the nose, with some slight crystal malt chewiness and plenty of creamed corn. Full body. Noticeable hop crispness. More chewy maltiness. Everything in balance, and it still retains that kick-you-in-the-nuts character a malt liquor needs to have. A rating to style would be in the high 4s. As it is, this is a remarkably high quality forty.
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Dark gold. Starts with a good head and maintains a nice white film. Aroma starts out like high alcohol fuel and then indeed a banana scent comes out. As it sits more of a dirty fuel scent is common with hints of the banana. Relatively full bodied and at least when cool drinkable. Tastes like high alcohol, grain and banana traces. Alcohol burns the ears. Even as it warms it is drinkable. Not a great beer but a great malt liquor, easily my highest rated.
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Insanely good malt liquor, im a black bull man but i have to admit that this 40 blows black bull out of the water, you cannot even taste the 9% and its very cheap even compared to other malt liquors, pound for pound this is about as good as beer can get, im proud to say that this is brewed in my home town
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);1.18Liter bottle = 40OZ. Looks exactly as illustrated in the picture. First of all this is lowest priced alcohol of any kind I�ve seen in Alberta. Chilled in -20C/0F weather, opened bottle, aroma isn�t offensive. Took a sip, this is suprisingly drinkable. I can�t believe this has 9% alcohol init. Zero head, fruity taste(not honey), moderate carbonation, almost no aftertaste. This is cheapest beer in the market at $3.20 per bottle of 40oz. I need to drink few more to find any adverse effect.
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Thanks to my future sister-in-law for the one. 1.18 liter bottle. Pretty good. Smooth malt flavor that I wasn�t expecting. Wasn�t harsh. Alcohol was good also at 9%.
Great Western Extra Gold;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Golden beer with a small white head. Pleasant bananas in aroma, almost like a wheat beer, or a hefe. Light fruity taste with pleasant malt. Nice bodied. Actually a very decent malt liquor, aka, Saskahootch. Thanks to the capflu.

O�ujsko Cool;Zagreb, Croatia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Zagreba�ka Pivovara (Molson Coors);Una delle migliori birre analcoliche che ho provato , dal odore e persistenza della schiuma non si distingue molto della classica birra lager , veramente un buon compromesso per un 0,5% di alcol

O�ujsko Cool;Zagreb, Croatia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Zagreba�ka Pivovara (Molson Coors);Bottle at a restaurant in Umag. Looks just like a typical lager, though smells and tastes very weird, something like a malt+butter+sugar combination, pretty bad.

O�ujsko Cool;Zagreb, Croatia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Zagreba�ka Pivovara (Molson Coors);50 cl. bottle. A clear golden coloured beer with a white head. Aroma and flavour of malt, grain, fruit and a bitter hoppy finish.

Innstadt Hell Kristall Export;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Innstadt Brauerei;"Bottle from an ""Auchan"", Bp. Golden colour with a nice, fine poredand slowly collapseing head on its top. Grainy, yeasty, bit watery nose. Flavour�s malty/bready, the aroma has mainly a malty character with some grassy and yeasty undertones. The finish is herbal and light dry. Texture�s unfortunately kinda thin, but apart of this it was better than expected..."
Innstadt Hell Kristall Export;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Innstadt Brauerei;Bottle, 4.8%, Hungarian version. OK fruity aroma. Clear golden colour. Very small white head. Mild malty flavour. Medium bitterness, slightly rough. Not bad.
Innstadt Hell Kristall Export;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Innstadt Brauerei;Bottle brewed by Ilzer S�rgyar, purchased at a Kaisers (Spar) store in Budapest, on Rakoczi ut I reckon. Poured a yellow body with a small head that disappeared fast. Light grassy nose, slightly acidic and sweet. A note of sweet maltiness, a bit eggy, covered with an unimpressive bitterish light hop presence. In the end passes as refreshing because of the light bite and bitterness, but I was a bit underwhelmed in the end.
Innstadt Hell Kristall Export;Passau, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Innstadt Brauerei;Bottled (BB 12/2008) Brewed by Ilzer S�rgyar, Hungary. Pale yellow color, small white head.

Soproni Klasszikus Vil�gos S�r;Sopron, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Hung�ria/Soprony Brewery;Pale golden color, weak white head. Corny, malty nose. Taste is corn, some malts, and slightly hoppy. Medium body, light carb. Average hungarian mass lager. Could be better.

Soproni Klasszikus Vil�gos S�r;Sopron, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Hung�ria/Soprony Brewery;"Exactly what you'd expect a Hungarian lager mass produced by Heineken to be like.

Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;22oz bottle. Admittedly, my family said this was likely a year or two old. Gushes then pours a murky sepia with tons of off white head. Nose isn't great, raisins and caramel. Flavor is caramel and butterscotch, lots of sweetness. Finishes cloying. Woof.
Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;This review is for the bottled 22 oz. As a great restaurant with great values, I want to love People's Pint's bottled beer, but all their bottles taste uneven and uninspired. Their selection might have been new and interesting at one point, but the competition is fierce. It's time to step up their production methods to make a beer that travels well. I suppose the poor taste could have come from an issue in bottling / distribution, but seeing as the point of purchase is about 15 miles away, I doubt it.
Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;Taster at brewpub. Pours light brown with a white head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Fairly malty and fruity on the nose and tongue. Finished clean. Quaffable.
Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;Enjoyed from a pint glass. Poured a dark, cloudy amber color with a minimal head... Expected a bit more of a hoppy flavor, but was sweet and malty instead. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;This draft brew from a beer festival poured a medium sized head of foamy fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a uncarbonated transparent red brown colored body. The mild aroma was hoppy and caramel malt. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of caramel hops and malt. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.
Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;"Slightly hazy burnt copper and brownish body with a very thin tan head that fades very fast - almost no head/carbonation at all. Very nutty, earthy, caramel and a slight hoppiness, but a very strong scent - nice. Medium-bodied; Flat taste, almost no carbonation; Strong nutty and caramel flavours dominate with a light hoppy touch of pine and herbs and a mellow earthiness at the end. Aftertaste shows some burnt caramel and a little hop bitterness. Overall, an okay beer, but the lack of carbonation and sheer complexity make this hard to say it�s a good beer. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Colonial Spirits in Acton, Massachusetts on 23-September-2010, sampled at home in Washington on 11-October-2010."
Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;07/2007: From a 22 oz bottle. Pours a deep orangish-red color. Brownish head that goes away rather quickly. It�s hazy and deep. Dark and more thick than a regular ESB. Has a roasted pale ale scent. Like a pale, but burnt. There is also a hint of deep berry smell. There is some minor mustiness but I�ll chalk that up to storage rather than the craft of the beer. Does smell a bit like a basement, though, I have to admit. Pale malt taste with a toasted/dry ending. Slight taste of bitter hops. Much more burnt roasted taste that I would have expected. Also some dark berry which balances some of the roasted and bitter flavors. The finish is dry and actually a little ashy. A bite comes at the end, and one that�s not altogether welcome. Overall it�s not a bad brew. It�s a bit stiff and somewhat dry. Surely a darker ESB.
Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;Very deep amber coloured beer. Thin white head. Aroma is quite sweet and malty. A touch of caramel and some soft light cocoa. A touch of soft earthy hops as well. Flavour is pretty pretty solid as well. Sweet and toffeeish but there aren�t any off-flavours. A lingering sweet caramelly finish with a little bit of light stickiness. A decent, if slightly too sweet, sessionable beer.
Peoples Pint Hope Street ESB;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Peoples Pint;My Bottom Line: Toasted and caramelized malts benefit from sturdy, spicy hopping and firm leafy bitterness, building a resolute pint of Extra Special Bitter. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam sits atop the nearly clear copper. -Even though the flavor profile is much hoppier than their Pale Ale�s (which is not usually the case in the USA), I found it to be still balanced. -The mouthfeel is healthily lean and softly carbonated. -The hop bitterness is both leafy and earthy. On tap at the brewpub.

Bowen Island Blonde Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bear Brewing;A very basic light beer. Not much nose or flavour but easy to drink. Why breweries insist on these beers I will never know, perhaps cheaper to make then a good porter or IPA?

Granville Island English Bay Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);The initial strength proves superficial towards the end.

Okanagan Spring 1516 Bavarian Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);355ml can @ Kelly's Cabin. Pours a clear golden colour with a medium white head. Nose is lightly grassy, touch herbal, and a biscuity malt. Flavour is pretty much the same. Light bodied, nice carbonation, and a mild sweetness with soft bitterness.
Okanagan Spring 1516 Bavarian Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);On tap at Oscar's Pub in east Vancouver. A pale amber beer with a modest pale head and a faint hop and malt nose. A 16 ounce pour in a tall cylindrical glass. Lightly hopped and the malt is light and slightly sweet. It's listed as a Dortmunder/Helles, but truth be told, it's not noticeably different from a pale lager. Refreshing if it's very cold, and one's very thirsty, else not so much. 2.7
Okanagan Spring 1516 Bavarian Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Draught at the Museum Tavern, Bloor Steer, Toronto. An easy drinking lager. Not too sweet and some bitterness. Drinkable but not great.

Okanagan Spring 1516 Bavarian Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Draught: This one pours a clear golden color. There was a thin white head that left minimal lacing. Very light nose. Faint malts. The taste is OK. No real bitterness or sweetness. Some malts. A basic industrial lager, but better than most of its American brothers.
Okanagan Spring 1516 Bavarian Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Pours a thin white cap and has a pale straw coloured appearance. Weak lacing. Light aromas of citrus hops, wheats, very grassy. Flavours are mildly sweet, mostly malts, crisp, and herbal hops. Light mouthfeel, prickly sensation. Excessive carbonation. Not bad just nothing special really.
Okanagan Spring 1516 Bavarian Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Draft. Clear yellow body, big white head. The aroma is funky and the taste is horrible. There are thousands of beers like this around the world. Why even sell it?
Okanagan Spring 1516 Bavarian Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Faint hazy dark straw color with lots of activity. Slightly frothy white 2 finger head, lasting around 5 minutes, but producing very good amounts of lacing. Flavors of fresh barley, caramel, buttery floral and herbal hops. Highly sugary, a little syrupy, with roasted spiciness. Smooth medium body with crispy carbonation. Light finish, lingering caramel sweetness and grassy hoppy notes. Overall good quality craft. Inviting smell, decent flavors, nicely balanced and accessible. Feels like a quality malty pilsner. Although a little thin, flat, and lacking some freshness.

Archers Spring Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask-conditioned @ Black Boy, Winchester. Grassy citric hops. Some malt character. Refreshing with growing bitterness.
Archers Spring Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask, Royal Oak, Sevenoaks. Nice pub with interesting carved figures of historical characters around the bar. Beer is a light amber. Lovely lemon and tangerine flavour. White wine with a touch of vinegar aroma. Soft fruity finish lingering briefly before ending on a softly astringent note. Decently refreshing with enough complexity to keep interest but not to overwhelm.
Archers Spring Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);"Perhaps my mood was still in the winter season, but this light-colored ""spring ale"" was far too plain.

Cains Liverpool Lou;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cains;Interesting but not especially rewarding beer. No head, with a watery palate. Lightly hoppy, with a flavor late in the finish that I couldn't place--clover, perhaps? (Had on tap at Bookbinder's Arms, Oxford)
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;On tap at BAR in a pint glass. Pours amber with an off-white head. Aroma of toasted and pale malts, some floral hops, and some dough/bread. Flavor the same with a decent blend. Average texture. Not bad for the style.
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;Tap. Pours clear dark yellow with a small, fizzy white head, short retention with spare lacing.

BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;Draft at the source. Clear golden color. Aroma of subtle white pepper. Taste is black pepper, light straw. Light body.
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;Easy to put down a couple pitchers of this one. On draft at brewery. Paired well with pizza.
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;On the light side, but fairly clean. Has markings of a session beer if you�re looking for something refreshing. Finishes off a little sour.
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;Pours a bubbly clear yellow with white lacing. Aroma is diacytl, butter and almond. Mouthfeel is slippery.
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;Pours pale golden with small fizzy head. Grainy with a strong caramel sweetness. Malty flavor, but kind of skunky. Not very crisp and sort of muttled. Hoped for a blonde to be a little more refreshing.
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;(Draught) Pours a clear pale yellow with a small off-white head. Aroma of honeycomb, toasted grain, and nuts. Flavor of toasted grain, cereal, grass, subtle honey, and delicate florals.
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;My Bottom Line: Toasted and caramelized cereals overcome the herbal hops and their bitterness in this easygoing Blonde Ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the nearly clear gold. -While the first half of the sip is pretty sweet, the second half can be said to be well dried out. -Once again, the nose is very timid and not enticing. -All of their beers had a level of sweetness that is not necessary in session ales of the sort they brew. On tap at the brewpub.
BruRm Toasted Blonde;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;BruRm @ BAR;On tap at the BruRoom Brew Pub. Poured a lighter golden color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas and tastes of grains, citrus and a matly sweetness. LIght lacing left on the glass.

BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;Taster on tap. Pours a clear medium amber color with thin head. Aroma light hops. Flavor has a nice hoppy bite on the front, mellowing to a medium bodied balanced salt finish. Good beer for eating pizza. Just enough character to stay afloat. Overall, a well-behaved and balanced ale without a lot to distinguish itself.
BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;On tap at BAR. Pours copper with a lacy head. Aroma of caramel and pale malts plus a little bit of floral and piney hops. Flavor the same. Average texture. A decent pale ale. Edit: Dec 2014. Better this time. Hoppier. Moved from 3.3 to 3.5.
BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;Pours a heavily filtered dark orange, with no lacing. Aroma has hints of metal, but predominantly pince, resin and grapefruit. A somewhat biscuit malt component balances the hops out. Hints of diacytel.
BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;Pours a slight dark yellow with a very thin light white head. If I inhale really really deeply I might get a slight hop every once in a while. Some hop character on the tongue but it doesnt linger.
BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;My favorite and least flawed beer from the BAR. This is overall a pretty well balanced pale ale with solid hop/malt blend. This was the only beer I had from the night that had a pleasant aftertaste of bitter hop zing. This was a little bit on the watery side, but overall not bad.
BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;"In short: A basic refreshing brewpub pale ale. Uninspired but well brewed, I can�t complain. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear golden blonde body topped by a small off-white head with good lacing In long: Nose of standard pale ale (light C-hops kind of nose). Taste has some citrus fruits, soft caramel, light grapefruits notes. Mild bitterness with a light tartness. I�ve had a pale ale like that 100 times before. I cannot fault it for anything. It was a hot day and I drank my pint in 10 minutes. I liked it. Inoffensively drinkable. It is what it is. The BruRm brewpub is right next to the prestigious Yale University. It was kind of weird for me to see all these high class kids sitting in a pub at 4pm working on their laptops. I sat in front of one, opened my laptop, looked at him and said �I sank your battleship"". Good times."
BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;On tap at the BruRoom Brew Pub. Serviceable cascade lke pale. Golden yellow body with lace sheets down the glass. The aroma is hoppy, but also malts. The carbonation is right there. Good orange citrus flavour, good drinkability.
BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;My Bottom Line: Fruity yeast and hops scent this thin Pale Ale�s mild caramel malts, leading to light wooden hop bitterness. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam still laces atop the golden clarity. -The nose is not appealing at all. Very low on hops, and there was some window cleaner (chemical) aspect as well. -Carbonation was smooth and the body well rounded. On tap at the brewpub.
BruRm Pale Ale;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BruRm @ BAR;On tap at the BruRoom Brew Pub. Poured a deeper golden color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, citurs, and a little earthy. Tastes follow suit. Light lacing left on the glass.
BruRm Presumptuous Porter;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Porter - Baltic;BruRm @ BAR;Pours dark brown with some off white bubbles. Smells of licorice, roasted malt, ash, chocolate. Tastes semi sweet with a nice bitterness that results in a dry, chocolatey finish.
BruRm Presumptuous Porter;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Porter - Baltic;BruRm @ BAR;Deep dark plummy brown. Thin edge head. Little if any carbonation. Vinous aroma laced with burnt caramel and coffee. Thickish body for a Baltic Porter loaded with bittersweet prune notes and light caramel and dried coffee beans. So quaffable despite it's size. Finishes drier and slightly more intense in the vinous fruit quality. A true to form Baltic Porter here in Connecticut. Well done.
Dick's Lava Rock Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter;Dick's Brewing Company;Bottle: Deep brown ....see-throu when backlit, small tan head. Aroma of melted chocolate and cocoa. Taste is slightly lactic, roasty dark chocolate malt. A bit of earthy bittering. Pretty nice, overall.

Dick's Lava Rock Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter;Dick's Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a very dark brown color with a moderate tan head that quickly disappears. Nose actually seems a little sour to me, with just a hint of roasty and chocolate flavors in there. Taste is also a bit sour, which was surprising to me. Fairly smooth, but not all that tasty.
Dick's Lava Rock Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter;Dick's Brewing Company;Reviewed 06/23/10 poured from bottle to new belgium tulip A: deep brown on pour. obvious yeast cake in bottle. low carbonation avg for bottle conditioned beer. deep brown, the beer is difficult to assess given the depth of color. Light, velvety head translucent. Ongoing ribbon presumed on cap at center of ale top. S: I could smell the chocolate, coffee, roastiness of ale while pouring into glass. full bodied and rich, slight hop pine scent in background. T: Thick, rich. lacks normal astringency i taste in many porters. Slightly burnt aftertaste. M: rolls over tongue and foams slightly. Leaves creamy, slick coating on tongue. D: good beer. one of my favorite porters. Always recommend when asked about micro porters. Serving type: bottle 12-20-2010
Dick's Lava Rock Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter;Dick's Brewing Company;Very tasty. Smokey up front but sweet malty finish. Slight coffee twinge in the midst of it all. Really a great beer to have in the fall. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Pink Elephant Rogers Reserve;Blenheim, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;Pink Elephant;Copper color, slight haze, cream colored head. Fruity malt and hops go well together, orangy along with some bready flavors. Medium bodied. Pretty nice.
Pink Elephant Rogers Reserve;Blenheim, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;Pink Elephant;Thanks to Sammy for this rare beer. Sampled with Tim and Rudy. Vinous, alcoholic, fruity aroma. Kind of smells like fermented cow corn ethanols. Moderately hazy copper color with a whitish head. Very tea-like flavor to start, turning sweeter and caramelly.
Pink Elephant Rogers Reserve;Blenheim, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;Pink Elephant;Thanks to Sammy. Nose has tea and orange, sweetish malt. Flavor has orange, bread, malt, tea-like. A solid English Pale - I�d like to try this one fresh.

Pink Elephant Rogers Reserve;Blenheim, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;Pink Elephant;pure enjoyment from this brewery. Well hopped, malt, great with a multi-course supper. Quite drinkable and complex. Sadly the last of 5 great beers from this region brought back by Douglas D
Pink Elephant Rogers Reserve;Blenheim, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;Pink Elephant;I found this beer to be very similar to the Mammoth, with just a litle less of everything - less alcohol, a bit less hop and malt taste, and not quite such a funky aroma. Would make an excellent session beer.
Pink Elephant Rogers Reserve;Blenheim, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;Pink Elephant;some pretty damn good yeast they've got going there. sweet stonefruit aroma. hint of butterscotch schnapps and then some pepperiness and a slow bitter finish with some self raising flour
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;"14-Jan-12 (330-ml bottle: Gift purchased at Pembroke Wine & Spirits in Wanaka, New Zealand and received 23-Dec-11, thanks Melissa!) This beer pours very hazy and amber-brown in color, with half an inch of creamy, pale-tan head that settles to a thin, nearly unbroken layer, leaving plenty of spotty lace on the glass. In general, it's not especially aromatic, but the nose is dominated by somewhat sweet, very toasty malts that smell like bread crust and a bit of earth and mushroom. The earthy, toasty malts are the focus in the flavor as well, as lightly sweet, toasted, cereal malts have a distinct flavor of bread crust and honey, while the grassy hops are gently bitter and just a complementary, background flavor. For me, that's good news because it's very malty and very delicious. The weight is medium, carbonation is light-medium, and though a bit sweet to the taste, there is enough toasty dryness on the palate that the sweetness is held at bay. As such, it's a very drinkable beer, one that makes you think it's a session beer, but the 7% ABV will sneak up on you. I know it's ""only"" a brown ale, an oft-maligned style, but I'm really enjoying this!"
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;From notes. Bottle. Hazy orange brown color, medium tan head. Aroma of raw bread and licorice. Taste has light spice, burnt caramel and toast. Interesting.
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;Bottled. New Zealand holiday 2011-12. Old notes. The aroma has raisin, some spice. Clear, red-brown coloured beer with an off-white head. The taste is sweet, has caramel, raisins, plum and some clove. Good.
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;(Bottle) above average beer. Nice brow to dark amber colour, thick white-brown head. Caramel, malt and brown sugar with little bit of syrup in the aroma. Caramel and sweet background. Bitter with earthy undertone and warming alcohol finish. Full body, medium carbonation.
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;For me, a swing and a miss. I�ve avoided this for a while but it�s been in the fridge and demanding attention. All the flavour via the caramel and that�s not good enough,
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;very sticky fruits in here, which is nice, but the hop bitterness in this one seems a bit off. but otherwise the deep caramels are quite nice, along with that stickiness.
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;Flavoursome & full with just enough bite to make a statement without overpowering. Almond notes with a lemon undercurrent. Very enjoyable. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;Aromas of sweet malt and roasted nuts/chestnut. Loads of sweet thick caramel malt character. Very rich, one for the armchair
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;Big beer from Mr Pink. Good deep colour and this shows through in the beer. Little raisony in the palate
Pink Elephant Mammoth;Blenheim, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Pink Elephant;Definitely not my style. Shocking taste, too bitter and floral, a seemingly unnecessary abuse of hops. The beer seems to have its legion of admirers though, by the scores below. I was actually eager to love it, but I must say that I found it disappointing, to say the least.

Star Three Horses Beer Pilsener;Antananarivo, Madagascar;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brasseries Star;I have purchased this beer, at one small cr�ole shop, place de l'Aligre, Paris. Drinking and judging it, at Pr�laz, Lausanne, october 2018. The body is yellow/gold and clear, average carbonation, thin and white foam. It is aa common and rather poor lager for mass people that you could find from all over the world. There is nothing to see with a pils, it sounds more a poor lager with corn giving a poor taste at the palate, metalic and dry, poor quality of hop.
Star Three Horses Beer Pilsener;Antananarivo, Madagascar;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brasseries Star;Golden and clear with a small head.Slightly hoppy but nothing really distinctive about it apart from being country number 98.

Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;Yellow gold, bright, watery and almost still with no head. Not exactly screaming at me right now. Weedy and grassy nose with a hint of salty brine and cardboard. Hmm.... Gassy, carbonic, watery thin and lagered of all life. Really close to soda water. It could be the first beer I�d admit a lemon wedge would actually enhance. Very little here at all. (33cL, BB 28/10/15, Luckies Liquor, East Vic Park)
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;Keg - Edison�s, Mona Vale. Poured a clear, lively golden yellow with a small, slowly fading white head. Aromas of grain, corn, grass and lemony hops . Light to medium body, medium to full carbonation, firm mouthfeel and a short, soft intensity bitterness in the finish. Crisp and refreshing with some malt sweetness to balance.
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;OLD NOTES JAN 17, 2004 Has a corny malt aroma. A few hop notes, as well as a few light sweet caramel malty kind of flavours came through. Nothing special, but not bad for your average lager. Easy and decent price.
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;Not a bad beer but nothing spectacular. Good with a juicy hamburger or pizza. --- Beer in my belly makes me hoppy.
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;I was expecting something pretty ordinary, but got something pretty decent. A hearty pour gave me a beer with an orange body and a medium sized head that didn�t last or lace much. An initial aroma of lychees (!) was followed by some pineapple and caramel malt. The flavour is quite inert however, with not much bitterness and a bit of sweetness smoothing it out. A medium body, with a good carbonation level. A pleasant surprise, especially considering it�s 10 months past it�s best by date!
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;Bottle-Poured a nice thick white head which left some minimal head and lacing. Nice golden colour with a malty hay aroma. Initial taste was sweet & fizzy on the palate but a bit dry in finish I had tasted this beer a couple of years ago and was not impressed but having revisited it today i have changed my opinion. Not a bad effort certainly a different taste to some other aussie lagers. Would have again.
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;Bottle: Sigh..... Sometimes things can be so predictable. Here we go then: Pale gold with a thick white head - looks good, there�s no doubt about that. Add to this the initial aroma of freshly mown grass that greets me as the cap is popped and things are beginning to look good. Unfortunately the lawn mower had been trimming the verge above a mid-sized cliff. Let us just say that things go decidedly down hill - the aroma fades to a mettalic passionfruit and pineapple salad. OK, nothing particularly wrong so far, but as it warmed this aroma profile morphed into an unmistakable �urine-from-a-dehydrated-person� smell. Urghh! Right, so forget the aroma let�s see what this tastes like (hopes are dim now): Crisp, cool lemony hops notes lift in the beginning (so far so good). Some very faint malt notes too (not much... did they actually use any?). Crumpff!! We hit the valley floor - any pleasantness in the flavour spectrum gives way to a spicy, rough bitterness with (again) that overbearing mettalic presence. Ah, the vicissitudes of Pale Lager. Where would we be without them.
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;Pale golden, clear, medium head. Above average for the Aussie premium lager market, but still pretty boring. Is it worth paying the extra over, say, VB or Castlemaine XXXX Gold? It sepends on how discriminating you are, but I�m not sure that it�s a big enough difference. I�d probably just spend the extra and buy a solid european lager.
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;Botled. Golden colour, clear, brief head. Grassy aroma with a whiff of grapefruity hops. Sweet and firmly malty with clean mouthfeel and a fair amount of hops, resulting in an orangey flavour and a pleasantly bitter finish. Nothing spectacular, but a solid, well made lager.
Stockade Premium Lager;Smeaton Grange, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;BrewPack;"Above-average Aussie ""premium"" lager - but the average is depressingly poor. Straw colour, moderate head. Plenty of malt in the aroma. Fruity taste - apples probably - crisp and refreshing. Some bitterness but no real finish, unfortunately. (Bottle)"

Head is little stable, non adhesive. Aroma: very sweet, sugary, some banana, spicy touch, almonds. MF: ok carbon, medium body. Taste: very spicy, orange peel, almonds, marzipan, bit sweet. Aftertaste: sweet, malty, bitter touch, sugary. Weird, tastes as if it�s already 3 years past expiration date, but it still has almost a year to go.

Hakim Stout;Harar, Ethiopia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Harar Brewery (Heineken);Got this at Nile�s Ethiopian restaurant in Orlando. Wanted to try something from Ethiopia since I was there. They had a lighter beer which was 4.5%, and since this was in the 5% range and was a �stout� I went with Hakim. Had a medium brown appearance, far from a dark brown or black which I expected from a stout. Taste didn�t resemble a stout, actually reminded me of drinking Newcastle or honey-brown. Had some caramel and coffee in the flavor, but was probably average at best. Tried something new, but for the price charged felt like I was better off ordering a Beck�s, or just drinking soda and water.
Hakim Stout;Harar, Ethiopia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Harar Brewery (Heineken);Not a stout but really a dark lager. Only had in draft in Ethiopia where it takes a welcome change from standard pilsner-type beers. Often known locally as Obama.
Hakim Stout;Harar, Ethiopia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Harar Brewery (Heineken);"Caramel and toffee malts, a touch of milk chocolate in the aroma; brown color, small tan head; lots of caramelized malt flavors, including demura sugar, molasses, hints of anise; medium body, smooth; I think this is my first Ethiopian beer and I really like this for what it is... Not quute stout, but lots of interesting malty flavors."
Hakim Stout;Harar, Ethiopia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Harar Brewery (Heineken);Bottle at Ethiopian restaurant. Hmmmm, super brown copper color. Pukey caramel sweet malts. Same as the amber beer.

Hakim Stout;Harar, Ethiopia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Harar Brewery (Heineken);Perhaps this is an unfair rating, but I was just remembering that i used to always get this at the Ethiopian restaurant near my house and thought it was interesting if nothing else. They don�t carry it anymore, and this rating doesn�t say anything of interesting, but its a pretty decent beer for y�know...ethiopia.

Hakim Stout;Harar, Ethiopia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Harar Brewery (Heineken);Poured from bottle, pours more of a dark amber brown than anything, wouldn�t think stout just looking at in in a glass, the aroma is of sweet malt and roast, the flavor is pretty weak, some sweetness at first with an off finish, metallic almost, meh.
Hakim Stout;Harar, Ethiopia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Harar Brewery (Heineken);Poured from 330mL bottle. Clear mahogany brown with dissipating beige head. Sweet malt, molasses, dates on the aroma. Caramel and dark fruit flavour with molasses. Very light watery body. Should not be called a stout.
Hakim Stout;Harar, Ethiopia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Harar Brewery (Heineken);This is honestly, my favorite beer I have ever tried. I travel internationally 9 months of the year and have gotten into the habit of trying local beers everywhere I go. Yes, I have even been to Ethiopia. I was so excited to find the Ethiopian restaurant near my home carries it. It is truly fabulous. Every friend I have brought to try this beer love it. It has a very special, unique taste, unlike any other beer. If you are really into beer, you may not appreciate its taste. If its hard for you to find a beer you love, then you�re going to dig this beer! REally, the best I�ve had, anywhere in the world. Its special!
Rio Salado Summer Typhoon Cherry Weisse Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Courtesy of Bockyhorsey. Strong aroma of cherries with a touch of sour twang. Red with a two finger head. looks like a raspberry lambic in the glass. Sour cherries in the fore. Light bodied with a bit of a lager crispness. Tart, sour and dry in the finish.
Rio Salado Summer Typhoon Cherry Weisse Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Bottle found at a liquer store that had some dust on it. Aroma was of a fermentented cherry and malt. Dark cherry color body and big pink head. Head diminished to a small one but stayed with drink till finish. Flavor was light on the cherry side. Some tartness and seem to have a malt backbone. Dry aftertaste on the palate. Need more cherry for me, but dencent drink none the less.

Rio Salado Summer Typhoon Cherry Weisse Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Pours a brilliantly clear copper color with an off white head. The aroma is a mixture of wheat, sour yeastiness, and a hint of cherry, though it is definitely fruity. The taste is dry and slightly acidic in the finish and the cherry flavor is light, but definitely contributes something to this beer. This is a very light and refreshing beer, enjoyable in its refreshing simplicity.
Rio Salado Summer Typhoon Cherry Weisse Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rio Salado Brewing Company;nice red color with head thet fades fast. tart bitter sweet taste with that tagny bite at the swallow. good beer,,would drink a 6 pack at one time,,maybe one a day.
Rio Salado Summer Typhoon Cherry Weisse Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rio Salado Brewing Company;There's a pinkish cocktail called a Shirley Temple and this beer reminds me of it because The Typhoon Cherry Weisse is soooo very, er,...RED! Hint of cherries in the aroma. Taste is of a strong tartness, almost lambic in its sourness. Light ale body with lots and lots of tart cherry flavor. It's actually quite decent and it's a pity I'm not sipping it in the heat of the Manhattan summer rather than in January. The creepiest thing about this beer is its pink head, which looks a bit like that of Cantillon's Rose de Gambrinus. Enjoyable if you like a tart beer. Thanks GEOBRAU!
Rio Salado Summer Typhoon Cherry Weisse Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rio Salado Brewing Company;i love rio salado there a local brewing co so i support therm whenever possible, buit this ber sucks watery cherry taste and its color is kinda vile..sorry i just dont like this stuff
Rio Salado Summer Typhoon Cherry Weisse Ale;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Cloudy pale lightly earthy red in color with a thin, tight pinkish-grey foamed head that faded fast, leaves low lying patches of lace. smell is faint of wheat and cherry tartness, not to much to it. Taste is mighty fine easy, smooth crispness of wheat and malts with nice acceptable amounts of cherry tartness and souring, the real kind, not arificial, at least it seems that way anyway. Smooth and light crisp medium body with excellent souring tartness lingering from midway throughout and into the finish leaving a slight souring dryness for a bit.

Why the hell is this rated so low? It�s nice! Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, smoked hickory, smoked meat, and earthy hops. The flavor is also smoky and meaty, with notes of hops, chocolate, dried dark fruits, metallic notes, and a metallic sharpness. Medium bodied, with low carbonation and a smoky, metallic mouthfeel.

Flossmoor Station Zephyr Golden Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled at the brewpub. It poured a clear golden/yellow color with a white head. The aroma was floral, citrus and some cereal grains. The taste was of lemon, sweet grainy maltiness, crisp and refreshing with just a touch of bitterness. Decent.
Flossmoor Station Zephyr Golden Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Just incredibly average. They might have tried to make this unique but not enough.
Flossmoor Station Zephyr Golden Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On draft at Flossmoor, poured a light yellow color, aroma of hay, light earth, light lemon, and some grain. Flavor follows suit, ok beer overall.

Very light mouthfeel but pretty boring overall.
Flossmoor Station Zephyr Golden Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;There is so little to this beer that it�s hard to rate. Little taste or flavor, it is almost like a Coors Light.
Flossmoor Station Zephyr Golden Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at Flossmoor Station - brewpub. Cloudy yellow - white head. Flowery, wheaty, candlewax, fruity, straw, light rice, light herbal, light body and finish.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Had it on tap. It was a dark chocolate brown color, not much of a head. chocolate, malty, and whiskey is the best way to describe it. It was good.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;09.29.05 GABF Dark, dark brown is nearly opaque even in this tiny sample glass. Little head. Loads of chocolate all around, only noticable bitterness seems to come from heavy roasting, yet it�s not heavy bitterness. Mostly it�s chocolate and cocoa flirting with the palate and sticking to the teeth and lips, sticky and oaty. Warming indeed, it�s as boozy as that DFH Old School I keep getting samples of, but, well, uh, not at all similar. Cheers, this stuff rocks. I think they ran out fast.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Liquorice and grape notes are strong in the roasty aroma with plenty of sweet, thick chocolate character. Opaque brown body is topped by a decent tan head that recedes to cover. Deep, rich, thick chocolate flavour with light fruity and roasty notes but chocolate is the diva in this ensemble and lingers on the tongue seemingly endlessly. Medium full body is velvety smooth and thick. Some pleasant alcohol warming is apparent. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;GABF- Pours deep black with a deep brwon tightly knit head. Caramel ad chocolate nose. Huge body. This is one of the most caramely beers I have ever had. Really great. Don�t know if I could drink it every day but this is awesome. Only thing lacking is a little more complexity.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Pitch black, wearing a good light brown head. Certainly woody in the nose, but this is not dominant, the whiskeyish undertones remain at the complement level. The most intense flavors remind of double concentrated espresso and cocoa through soily and woody roastiness. Interesting mango and prune nuances don`t quite push it to world-class level, but certainly sets it apart from the trend followers out there. Medium bodied, oily vanilla laden texture, well contained alcohol heat. Top 50? I think not, this is just a straightforwardingly well made imperial, focusing and roasty, but certainly not one of the most complex, to me anyway. I had to go back 3-4 times after Stephen convinced me I underrated it, he was right I must say, perhaps it would grow on me if I had a full snifter, but I can�t compare it to stuff like Jaywalker that makes you watch the ceiling from the first sip.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Nice and dark and black. Vinous, inviting nose. All kinds of stuff in attendance, with multiple dark fruits, silky caramel, aged wood, smooth bourbon, rich chocolate, and aromatic vanilla. Roasty-bitter finish with an incredibly rewarding aftertaste. AWESOME ... I loved it.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Nose-smells like a cold brownie.

Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;GABF 2005. Fully opaque black body with a persistent creamy tan head.

Flossmoor Station Imperial Eclipse Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Tap @ Great taste of the Midwest- Pours a very dark brown, no head.

Sainsbury's Kiwi Organic Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sainsbury's;Pasteurised bottle from Sainsbury�s. Nice golden colour, fizzy head dissipates quickly. More subdued typical whchwood aroma than others, with tangy citrus hop character more dominant. Light mouthfeel and good hop finish. One of their better efforts.

Sainsbury's Kiwi Organic Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sainsbury's;Standard wychwood nose with golden hue and a white foamy head. Highly hopped taste that is long lasting and bitter. Better than most Wychwood beers where the sterile taste and blandness rules.

Sainsbury's Kiwi Organic Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sainsbury's;Wychwood is a wonderful brewery - starting off in 1983 as a microbrewery, it now produces a wide and complex range of draught and bottled beers which are increasingly available in most supermarkets. This recent organic ale has the typical Wychwood depth of strength and flavour. The hops are very evident - deliciously dry with a flowery burst: hints of rose petals and geraniums. These hops come from New Zealand (hence the Kiwi name). But there is a satisying malt sweetness coming through all the time - marmalade and brown sugar. A very robust and delicious beer.
Sainsbury's Kiwi Organic Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sainsbury's;A bit fruity - a little dry other than that not really much going on........
Sainsbury's Kiwi Organic Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sainsbury's;Amber coloured moderate head and condition.

Sainsbury's Kiwi Organic Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sainsbury's;Amber beer with a fruity, hoppy taste mixed with bitterness and coffee. A Wychwood brewed beer I actual liked.
Great Lakes CBC Symposium Beer;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Bottled for the Craft Brewers Conference for 2002 in Cleveland, AND MY # 500 BEER!!!!! I hope this isn�t terribly oxidized since the bottle was only full 1/4 of the way up the neck: Golden honey color with a very short lived white head. Clarity has improved greatly since I had it on tap @ the CBC in May of 2002. Probably having to do with sitting in my fridge for almost 3 years. Ginger still very apparent as is cardamom. Some plummy fruit and pepper from yeast as it warms. A lightly floral character (probably from the chamomile). A lightly grainy malt pops in, but is mostly drowned by the spices. Flavor is majorly ginger...STILL!!! Well balanced, chamomile has the flavor of chamomile tea! Light clove flavor from yeast, slightly sweet finish and aftertaste which is still ginger. Very light fruitiness is like dried apricots. Very crisp finish. Lighter medium body, dry m/f, higher carbonation, and well hidden alcohol. Overall a very tasty beer. Not your typical saison, but good anyway.
Great Lakes CBC Symposium Beer;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Thanks Kujo! Not much of a Saison, but very enjoyable beer anyway. Honey colored, small head that dissapates to none. Aroma is sweet, cinnimony, alspice, coriander. Mine tasted like a spicey pumpkin pie minus the pumpkin. No alcohol flavor to speak of. Slightly tangy finish.

Pours a dark golden yellow, clear and still with a dense creamy beige head, full lacing. Aroma is airy, very light with some faint lemon cake, sweetcorn. Very much an airy aroma. Body is light and smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is biscuit, rusk, crispbread, touch of carpet underlay and faint sweetcorn with a long understated bitterness. Plain but I do like that simple breathy malt character. You need to appreciate subtlety to enjoy this one. An everyman beer that can be consumed in large quantities. (4-4-5-4-13=3.0)
Adnams Regatta;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Adnams;Quite a light easy drinking pint. Lemon overtones and keeps it's head well. More of a summer beer than one I would drink in winter.

Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;Golden pour. Floral spruce hop nose. Taste is standard lighter bodied IPA. Rated 10/21/04
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;I have never seen such a head from a bottled beer--thick, tan, four-fingers thick. The lace is just as thick, and sticky too. The color is dark copper, close to a brown ale. It�s also very clear. Close to perfection! Complicated aromas of malt and hops. It has an almost cinnamon sweetness. Awesome dry hop smells waft as the head recedes. Now, I�m detecting strong crystal malt (burnt sugars) aromas. Nice. Starts like a brown ale: dark malt sweetness that quickly captulates to soft hop flavors providing a nice balance to the brew. It is a smooth transition. The aftertaste is all hop which lasts a long time. Dry and moderately carbonated, this is a very good beer.
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;some bite. worth the money. Similar to samuel adams but perhaps more body and less balance. really enjoyed this from a bottle with friends during a BBQ in Somerville, MA.
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;12oz bottle-pours a foamy tan head and amber color. Aroma is medium malt, medium hops. Taste is medium malt-caramel, medium hops-flat bitterness. Maltier than a standard IPA approximates a standard PA.
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;draft - Pours amber with a medium sized head. The nose is of pleasant citrus hops. This ale is lightly carbonated and has the bold hops taste one would expect from the style. The malt balance is decent and the finish is dry and lingering. It�s not a great IPA, but it�s not bad either. Try it.
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;A pleasant dark caramel colour with a long-lasting peaky tan head. Strong citrus start with a bitter finish.
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;Poured a reddish brown color with a thick tan head that left a clear body with some yeast in the bottom. The nose is caramel, funky citrus hops, and a soft candy aroma. The taste is acidic upfront, it has a tart bitterness that smacks your palate around. Their is a sour presence that is pretty strong, the date on the bottle is 7/06 but maybe this went before its time. The finish is bitter grapefruit and leaves a slightly tannic quality on the palate.
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;From the bottle. Pours a surprisingly dark orange-brown with a fizzy off-white head. The aroma is somewhat mellow, peaches and apricots, some orange/pine hops. The flavor is disappointing, strongly metallic walnut-shell bitterness instead of the delightful hop resins that I�d expected or at least hoped for, mixed in with heavy-handed cola malts and some slightly rancid pecans and. The biggest problem comes in the mouthfeel, though - the beer is badly overcarbonated, making it prickly and unpleasant to drink.
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;The IPA pours a dark amber color with a fizzy, white head. Body clarity is clear. Aroma is of moderate flowery hops, which are very nice and airy. Where this IPA really shines is in its� taste. An unexpected curve is thrown in with this one, as there is a slight coal taste and a creamy texture that remind us of a porter. Initial taste is slightly bitter, but it is very mellow for an IPA. That slight bitter continues tbrough the finish. Light to medium weight on the mouth, with a dry and oily finish. This is not an IPA for a bitter IPA lover, but it is a great change from the usual IPA. A good blend of an IPA and a porter.
Concord IPA;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Concord Brewery;Red amber ale with a thick moka head. Herbal, green hops in aroma and sweet malt. the same is found in mouth, lots of grassy hops, nutty notes, but could do with some more malt to couterbalance. Mondial 2005.

LogJam Lager;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;LogJam Microbrewery;Poured a dark gold with a little hint of orange. The thin whte head stayed around.

Very lightly hopped. A decent beer.
LogJam Lager;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;LogJam Microbrewery;not much aroma. i say there is a bit of a honey flavor, but cornfield says corn syrup. he�s probably right. amber color with no head, no matter how aggressively you pour. a bit oily with a sugary aftertaste.
LogJam Lager;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;LogJam Microbrewery;Pours a hazy pale amber with very little head. It�s actually a little low on carbonation to start with. Mildly malty aroma. Slight grassiness. The flavor is mostly malt, but definitely watery. Finish is a lingering finish. Not bad, but doesn�t really seem a very graceful lager.
LogJam Lager;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;LogJam Microbrewery;Weak, watery, off-tasting, a little sour, leads me to wonder if this bottle was slightly infected, however I wondered the same thing with several other of their beers.. Needless to say, I was not overly impressed !

LogJam Lager;Unity, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;LogJam Microbrewery;There seems to be a quality control problem at this brewery, since the eleven reviews preceding mine are all over the board.

(3.0)
Mauldons Cuckoo;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mauldons;Hand-pulled pint in my local Wetherspoons on 22nd June 2016. Like some others, I found this �a little off�. Looked fine, old gold/amber body, full, lasting head. Strange aroma, hops and maltiness within the nose but sulpher like esters too. Taste similar, decent enough blend but again something not quite right.
Mauldons Cuckoo;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mauldons;Handpull cask at the Townhouse, Ely. Honey brown and clear with a big white head and lots of lacing. Smells of apples, brass, rust. Tastes bitter with a fruity hint and some vinegar. Harsh almost acrid finish. Not all that pleasant, I�d wonder if it was off but I�ve never had an off beer from this pub so I think it�s just not very nice. I really,really struggled with this one.

Mauldons Cuckoo;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mauldons;Tasted this in the Salt Cot, Saltcoats (JDW) in May 2013. Cask, handpump dispense. Pump clip shows a cuckoo? but it looks like a blue version of Lichtenstein�s Oriole to me! Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white creamy head. Slight note of fruity lychees in the short floral aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malts give a zesty fruit note of citric fruit with pink grapefruit and gooseberry dominant. Cereal flavour evident in the bitter hoppy aftertaste. Finish is tart with sweet notes fleeting. An ok summer session ale but I would stick with Black Adder!

Coral;Camara de Lobos, Madeira, Portugal;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Empresa de Cervejas da Madeira (Heineken);On tap on the rooftop of the Castanheiro Hotel in Funchal. Wow, what an amazing view and beautiful island. Speechless. Beer looks like a pale lager... straw golden. Good effervescence. White head. Nose is grainy like your standard domestic offerings. Taste follows suit but I'm definitely going to overrate this slightly because of the setting. Grainy sweetness with just enough bitterness to let you know this contains hops. First Portuguese beer rated!
Coral;Camara de Lobos, Madeira, Portugal;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Empresa de Cervejas da Madeira (Heineken);Served ice cold and fresh from tap a sunny day at the waterfront in Madeira. The occasion might have some influence here, but I find it rather decent and refreshing like most other macro lager when served at the right premises without any faults. Nothing special, nothing extra, just another thirst quencher but nothing wrong. Would not do any effort to taste it again, but if the choice where between this and Heineken, Carlsberg etc, and I was in Madeira I would go for the local one.

Slottsk�llans Roslager;Uppsala, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bread of the fragrance. Otherwise pretty scentless. Taste is a bit malty but with most alcohol taste, I think. Quite poor at the time. Bitterness, there is plenty of. A heavier bitterness that finishes the beer back in mouth for a long time. This beer did not appeal to me at all. Follow me @ Kung av �l @ Facebook for more pictures and ratings.

Whitbread Best Mild;Preston, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);440 ml can sampled in 2007. Reddish brown body with a medium sized beige head. Not much aroma, some caramel malt. Flavor has very light roasted, mild caramel malt and that�s more than less what there is to taste. Not much bitterness, thin watery body and short aftertaste.
Whitbread Best Mild;Preston, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);440ml can. Brown with a creamy persistent head. Little aroma - bit of malt & caramel. Ditto flavour. Sweet and smooth but very uninteresting.

Whitbread Best Mild;Preston, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Can. Clear, copper body, and a beige head. Malty-sweet aroma, with caramel, but it is quite weak. The same goes for the flavor, but it is a bit more evident. Considering the low ABV, it is a nice one, but I would prefer it beefed up a bit, and a fuller body. (070914)
Whitbread Best Mild;Preston, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);(draught keg in Baiborne Lees) not retired apparently. Dark brown with hints of red, small off white head. Malt aroma. Mild biscuit malt flavor. Actually not a bad session beer - I think it�s underrated here.
Whitbread Best Mild;Preston, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Unretired, 440ml can(s), Morrisons. Pours deep ruby with a creamy yellowish head that sticks around. Biscuity malt prevails with notes of chocolate and malted milk. The subtlest hint of roast and just enough sourish woodiness to keep you lifting the glass. Creamy palate. Shames bottled beers twice its strength. More 2.6% beers please that don�t compromise on body or flavour. Tasty Mild.
Whitbread Best Mild;Preston, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);"440 ml can - ""brewed and distributed by InBev UK Ltd, Luton"" Dark brown with almost no head; a spicy malt aroma; sweet, thin and malty in the mouth; almost no body; slightly bitter aftertaste. Not unpleasant."

Smooth and fairly malty, sweetish/grainy finish. Ok but nothing great..prefer draught mild, but those are thin on the ground around here.
Whitbread Best Mild;Preston, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);(draft) No head at all, but somehow managed to have very good lacing. A hint of caramel in the flavor. A slightly lagerish finish but not too fizzy. Not bad at all.
Whitbread Best Mild;Preston, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);"Canned. A decent aroma of caramel and maybe some sweet toffee. The appearance is a buttery brown with a creamy �smoothflow� head. The taste is difficult to find as it is very thin. However there is a little caramel sweetness as it warms up. It�s a bit like a sweet Shandy Bass in a way; beer for the playground."

Whitbread Best Bitter;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Keg. The Bridge Inn, Preston, Dorset. Brown with a thin foam. Aromas are toffee and brown sugar with dark treacle. Flavours are mixed fruit of some sort with sweet treacle and a light nuttiness. Slightly herbal with a cardboard and pepper finish. Mediocre.
Whitbread Best Bitter;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);From the archives: Had this one from many places on tap when I was in England. When you choose a bitter for the evening, that was a good choice for me. Drinkable for the price and looked OK.

Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Shaftebury Brewing Company--Summer Solstice Ale--2000 12 oz. Bottle. 4.50% ABV. (2.75 / 5.0) Pilsner Ale. Very clear light golden color. Light lager like Saaz hop front. Very similar to domestic lager in taste with light fruit ale hints. Light bodied, tasty, nice hops. Clean light hop balanced finish. Sampled 7/5/2000.
Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);I don�t ordinarily like Shaftebury, but this was okay. Pale golden colour with a faint chill-hazed appearance and a disappearing white head. Pale malty aroma, light floral hoppiness and some bready yeastiness. Flavour is actually pretty good, decent amount of malt and a clean finish. A fairly quaffable summer beer.
Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Yellow with hints of honey, wow, please don�t amaze me. I guess it would be Ok in the summer, but I can think of a few more hefes I would rather drink.
Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Not bad...poured a golden yellow, but the head went south quickly. I agree with Tipsy McStager on this one...very weak palate. Mind you, it IS wet, it IS beer, and it ISN'T American!
Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);stinky, foul aroma. Pours a golden yellow, carbonation high, head mid range. This kind of tastes like a fruit beer, except all the fruit is rotten. Very weak palate and unusual aftertaste. Shaftebury is a brewery you want to avoid except for their cream ale.
Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Golden amber body with a small off white head. Aroma was lightly malty and little else. Taste was sweet but thin. Finish was spicy and not really enjoyable.
Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Sparkling golden amber. Fast fading off white head. Nutty nose with light malt taste, but cigar butt off taste
Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Pleasant aroma as I poured the glass. The aroma died out quickly. Light but lasting head of white bubbles. For a light summer ale it has an intriguing spice flavour that I cannot place. ALmost a ginger taste that lingers. This weird taste takes it out of the summer guzzler category but not sure where it takes it to. As it warms the aftertaste is almost soapy. Very interesting and worth a sample but can't say I see a fit as a regular beer. SECOND BEER AND I CANT GET PAST THE SPICE AFTERTASTE!
Shaftebury Summer Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);I haven't had this one since last summer actually, but i'm going to go out and grab some (it comes with a free pint glass)
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;A really basic pilsener. Really rather sweet taste. Texture is fairly thin and watery. Not a whole lot going on here.
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;Vancouver 25/7 2018. 47,3 cl can from BC Liquor Store in Valemount. Yellow can with a fence positioned on top of a landscape with a Lake in British Columbia. The person who designed this Can seems to be quite confused. Pours clear yellow with medium-sized white head. Settles as 1 cm thick layer of foam completely obscuring the surface of the beer. Substantial Lacing. Aroma is not especially intense. Sweet malts, butter. Moderate hoppiness. Grassy. Medium carbonation. Thin, lively and prickly texture. Flavor has medium sweetness. Followed by stronger bitterness. Aftertaste is bitter. Lingers shortly. Simple pilsner-style beer. A tad sweet but nicely balanced by a notable bitterness.
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;Golden clear lager with sudsy medium head. The head persists. Purely malt aroma profile with bread, cereal, and some hay. Lightly sweet with just the barest hint of hop bitterness. The body is medium and the finish short.
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;Can 0,50L. Courtesy of my cousin Tony. Crystal clear, golden color with small, creamy, white head. Aroma of grain, hay, toasted malts. Light sweet flavor with some crispness and light bitter finish. Medium body, dry texture and slick carbonation. Decent pilsner, good as a thirst quencher.
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;Deep golden frothy white head. Virtually no nose with a bit of cereal. Very malty and lackluster
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking semi-hazy yellow color with a decent transparency about it. Light carbonation was seen rising to fill a slim fingered white foamy head. Light ringy lacing clings and then slides into the beer. The smell had some sweet corn and cereal / graininess to it. The taste was mainly sweet through the corn with a long sweet aftertaste leading to a wet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a good sessionability about it. The carbonation was pretty smooth as it seemed barely there. Overall, not bad, definitely do-able, but I think it may have been a little old as the carbonation seemed just a bit too smooth.
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;Pretty well balanced and flavourful for a Pilsner. A nice crispness to it with bread, hops, floral flavours. A nice bitterness at the end.
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;Can @ AirBNB Arts Colony. Pours a slightly hazed golden color with a finger of white foam. Aromas of butterscotch, bread dough, and popcorn. A lot of grain husk and flowers, too. An interesting fruity ester component...apricot? Flavor is sweet and bready. A lot of butterscotch as well. Hints of cracker and caramel popcorn. Some light floral and earthy hops. Mild bitterness. Not bad.
Tree Kelowna Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tree Brewing;Tree brewing�s kelowna Pilsner. 4.8% drunk from the can. �2.60$ for a 500ml can. Pale gold pour, thick head. Light malts, crackery aroma. The taste is light grains, crackers, bread crust, sharply bitter finish. Meh it is ok, though it has an odd earthy nutty character to it. It is a pilsner made without pilsner malt - not to style.

Nat Bailey Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Nose is very bready with some hops, flavour is dirty bread, dry. Metallic. Not good. Tastes like an EPA.

Nat Bailey Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Fairly bland in both nose and palate. Has some caramel and malty flavours but not much else.

Nat Bailey Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);"Draught Served in a frosted glass, uh. Hazy amber color; small creamy head. Remarkable for its absence of aroma and flavor, and bitterness; a new achievement."

Nat Bailey Pale Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Decent level of head and an amber body, vague aroma of malts Very drinkable, but very simple. A reasonably good choice if you�re at a White Spot restaurant and need something with a burger.
Phillips Hop Circle IPA (formerly Phillips IPA);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Phillips Brewing Co.;Can. Just hazy amber with an inch of white head. Aroma of grapefruit, bread crust, gentle fresh cut pine. Medium bodied. Resin, some citrus, bread crust - guess I would have preferred just a little cleaner but it's characterful and engaging. Brief, decisive bitter end.
Phillips Hop Circle IPA (formerly Phillips IPA);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Phillips Brewing Co.;Pint draft at Taps Beer Bar in Kuala Lumpur. Appearance is a hazy orange gold, topped with a finger of white froth which does not persist for long before retreating to a thin ring. Aroma is floral and piney hops, followed by a distinct caramel malt note. Taste is similar, lightly sweet, piney, but above all a sweet caramel flavour which persists for a long finish. Mildly bitter only, light to medium bodied. Distinct taste, nice brew!
Phillips Hop Circle IPA (formerly Phillips IPA);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Phillips Brewing Co.;Orange pour, small off-white head. Orange, pine, and caramel, sweet. Not bad!
Phillips Hop Circle IPA (formerly Phillips IPA);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Phillips Brewing Co.;6.5%ABV. IPA. Tapped out deep gold. 12�SRM. Nose has aromas of pine, citrus peel, and spruce. There is also a good full malty funk. As it warms, the spicy, fresh herb aromas start to emerge suggesting cilantro and parsley. Mouthfeel is juicy and round. Full and pleasing. Palate has flavors of barley toast, fresh biscuits. Hop flavors are aggressive featuring resin, sap, and alkaloid type flavors that suggest poisonous plant extracts. Finish is lingering with a deep resinous, ponderous sappy bitter that is almost oily. Overall, a really nicely balanced IPA that has a kick-in-the-groin deeply resinous bitter finish, which is likely to be the enduring impression of this beer. For me, it was the grain bill that was the unsung hero on this allowing the ponderous hop profile to be slowly and continuously tasted.
Phillips Hop Circle IPA (formerly Phillips IPA);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Phillips Brewing Co.;35,5 cl Can @ Bier Kraft, Seville, Spain. Hazy amber colour with a medium size white. Aroma is hops, citrus, pine. Taste is hops, citrus, grass, malt. Medium body, average carbonation.

Aromas of hops, lemony, and oranges. Flavours are very citrus oriented. Oranges, grapefruit, mild lemon with mild floral hops and very mild malts. Nice warming sensation.

Molson Old Style Pilsner;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Crystal clear yellow color with steady carbonation that allows the rentention of a nice white head. The aroma is hay and grain with a sweet corn note. Ok pils.
Molson Old Style Pilsner;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can't put my finger on it as I had a Pil tonite. You have to slam it back. If you nurse it and go around the 15 minute mark with it, it starts to go flat. Plus colder the better.
Molson Old Style Pilsner;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);For a cheaper Pilsner in bottles or tall boys I find this beer really good for it's price range compared to other major Pilsners around it's price range. The bottle logo is awesome, the beer is refreshing. For a cheap beer it's not bad at all.
Molson Old Style Pilsner;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"I'm also rating this in terms of it's ""cheap beer"" status.

Molson Old Style Pilsner;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This beer is great. Im trying to boost the rating. You guys are rating it all wrong. Its a damn good $2 tallboy when compared to others.

Molson Old Style Pilsner;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A super can from 8th St. Liquor store in New Westminster. A very pale beer with generous white head and a faintly sweet malty nose. Very lightly hopped and malted, but not overly sweet. It calls itself a pilsner, but RB lists it as a pale lager, which really it is. It does not have the bright crispness of a Czech pils. I give it 2.3
Molson Old Style Pilsner;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Goes great with palm bays (palm breezys) keg stands, douchy pool parties and dumping your girlfriend over txt because she's taking time away from ""da boiz"""

Molson Old Style Pilsner;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours a huge foamy, bubbly white head which gives off thick patchy lacing. Has a straw coloured appearance. Mainly grainy and wheaty aromas. Very light roasted malts. Some hints of corn adjunct used in this one. Flavours are pretty much same as aromas. Just lots of corn, grains and wheats. Very mild sweetness. But something about it makes it real easy to drink and has just enough flavour. Sort of a mild, flat, prickly mouthfeel. Light and smooth, not much else. Awesome old school/retro label on cans from the old Lethbridge, Alberta brewed beer.

Snipes Mountain Sunnyside Pale Ale;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;Clear amber, small white head. Aroma of leather and dry leaves. Sweet caramel, smoky ham, light on the hops. Balanced to the point that the hops never really come out until beyond the finish.

Sweetish malty finish with some light bitter hoppy aftertaste.
Snipes Mountain Sunnyside Pale Ale;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;Had at brewery and in my opinion this was the worst beer they had. Pours hazy bright orange with slightly bubbly white head. Smells literally like nothing. Flavor very light and watery with slight piney hop presence. Has the taste of a beer that maybe at one time was good until grain and hop prices went up. I think they cheaped on this beer to cut costs.
Snipes Mountain Sunnyside Pale Ale;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;12 ounce bottle from By The Bottle in Vancouver, WA--Poured a dull golden-copper body with a medium white head.

Aroma is hoppy. Appearance is hazy gold with a low white head. Flavor is balanced but starchy and resiny, more so in flavor than texture. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low carb texture. Overall, well balanced but too much towards the IPA side.

Snipes Mountain Porter (4.35%);Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Porter;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;12 ounce bottle I am always open to new porters. This one had some hallmarks of a West Coast style release but still was fairly unique. A couple of flaws mar a better experience. Even so I�d think I would not turn down another bottle if it came in a trade. Aroma / Appearance - The creamy black pour clings to the sides of the glass. The dirty head was the color of wet sand with slow legs. Almonds, black coffee, and plummy undertones drive an oily and sweet presence. Flavor / Palate - Dry coffee, prunes, and teases of smoke rub against the tongue. There is a brief sour tang before the sweetness takes over. I wasn�t excited about the beer to the point where I wish I had another but I�ve had worse porters.

K�l;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);These other reviews have no idea what they're talking about. Its actually a smooth beer
K�l;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"Cheap, cheap beer. Now I know all the micro/craft brew loving, IPA drinking, ""what pumpkin beers do you have on tap?"" hipsters have and will savage this beer because it's soooooo lowbrow, but here's the truth- it's beer. You know- grainy stuff, water, yeast, hops, cook it, put in can, chill, drink. Beer has never been (until recently) broken down in agonizing detail by self-styled gourmands of the art of the craft brew.. It's beer. Beer. BEER. Find some drinkable beers, buy the cheapest and enjoy. This is drinkable beer. I would wager that if it was $13 for a six-pack, had a presumptuous name, and was brewed using an old world fermented yeast strain that was discovered in a 400 year old Scottish pit toilet, millennials would be frothing over it wherever they congregate to froth over things. But it's not. It's just a good cheap beer."

K�l;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);355ml can. This is inoffensive and at 18 bucks for 3 cases of this stuff you get way more bang for you buck than you would with natural light. This is better and cheaper than natural light.
K�l;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Oh it�s bad, so so bad. so so so so bad.

K�l;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at Festival Foods in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. Pours a clear straw blonde brew with a fast dissolving white head that dissipates nearly clean with a thin film top. Aroma of corn grits, grassy hops and some burnt charcoal. Taste is light bodied, well-carbonated with flavors of watery corn grits and some front lawn grass and dandelions. Finish is watery and quite metallic. It�s getting into the drain pour category.
K�l;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Has no taste. Well, ok, it does but it sucks. I remember when beer like this was great because it was so cheap. I have learned the ways since then.
K�l;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);About as bad as it gets for beer, agree with prosqtor, it will get you drunk and if it�s cold it tastes decent. makes for a good shower beer i.e. getting a little more water into it doesn�t matter.

K�l;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);This stuff is rotten! We drank this in college at the Kul Duel.

Vail Beaver Tail Brown Ale;Vail, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Brewing Company of Vail, Inc.;I just found this in the database. This is one of the beers that got me into real beer back when I was living in Vail. At the time it was called the Hubcap Brewery (same address), probably around 1991 or 1992. As i remember it, it was thick and chewy. With a chocolate maltiness but then I was drinking MGD back then so what did I know. It a shame Hubcap never made a go of it. If you ever climb Mount Everest look around on the summit for a Hubcap hat, there used to be one there.
Vail Beaver Tail Brown Ale;Vail, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Brewing Company of Vail, Inc.;Little head atop a murky brown liquid. Some sugared apple notes in the nose.

Golfers Choice;Schw�bisch Gm�nd, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Engel Brauerei;Can. Great packaging. The can has neat graphics and the resealble blob top makes this a nice item to put on your shelf. The beer itself was pretty average at best. Yellow, overcarbonated, with a moderate white head. Buy this for the can, not for the beer.
Golfers Choice;Schw�bisch Gm�nd, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Engel Brauerei;"Clear yellowy appearance, heavily carbonated, moderate head formation. Funky fruity, herbal aroma. Sweet fruity aniseed/mint candy like flavor, sugar prevalent throughout. Spritzy carboantion provides some cut thrugh along with a graininess from the malt, but the bitterness is very light. The can says ""imported German ale"" and although that could be for legal/import reasons I wouldn�t call this a pilsner. Really I�m not sure where it fits in but it�s definitely better than what I thought it was going to be. I bought it for the can which is original for sure."
Golfers Choice;Schw�bisch Gm�nd, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Engel Brauerei;I was surprised with this beer. the depth of flavor was more than I expected, the aroma was malty with some woody undertones. Not a bad beer at all.
Golfers Choice;Schw�bisch Gm�nd, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Engel Brauerei;Head is initially large, fizzy, white, fully diminishing.

Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately bitter, lightly acidic. Finish is moderately bitter, lightly acidic. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Quite a shock...I've been passing up this kitschy can with the ridiculous name for years now, embarassed to be seen buying such a silly thing. But lo and behold, we have here a clean, very well-balanced, bitter yeasty Bavarian-style pils with a decent body. Despite all the yeast, not much acidity exists, much to my delight.

More milky chocolate notes, up front in the mouth, with some caramel; a bitter middle with background esters, and a lingering astringency in the roasty finish. Woody aftertaste that makes me think of twigs. Medium weight, just the slightest touch over-carbonated and lots of lingering flavour. A very nice stout, easily drinkable and quite complex."

Soft and well carbonated in the mouth. The flavor is a sweet caramel/toffee with a hint of chocolate, yeast, licorice, pepper, and other spices.

Slightly cloudy and very fizzy golden/orange beer with a fair head on. Fairly nice yeast and hops aroma, a hint of fruit. A nice hop blend, bitter and quite complex.

Vale Edgars Golden;Brill, Buckinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Vale Brewery;Sampled this golden bitter in Esquires, Glasgow (JDW)in February 2009. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear pale straw in colour with a thin white open head. Faint dry dusty hops in the thin aroma with a hint of fresh green apples. Pale malt base gives refreshing almost weiss stle flavours with sweet fruit notes of overipe gooseberry and kiwi fruit to the fore. Could not detect any lemon and grapefruit flavours though? Distinct wheat/maize notes as the metallic tang of hop resins seep into the aftertaste. A dry bitter finish. An ok golden ale but lacking the complexity of similar strengthed golden ales like Harviestoun Schiehallion of Houstons St Peter�s Well.
Vale Edgars Golden;Brill, Buckinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Vale Brewery;"1)Bottle from The Wine Cellars, Lutterworth. Brassy gold with a low, patchy white head.

J�mtlands President Lager;Pilgrimstad, Sweden;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;J�mtlands Bryggeri;Bottle from hotel in �stersund. Aroma is grass, citrus, lager. Used to be one of my favourite lagers, it is still definitely a good bet in my opinion. Taste moves from occasional delightfulness to a bit soapy. Overall, decent :) Retried. Maybe I have become meaner, rating taken down overall by 0.1. Agree with above comments that it is almost a delicious lager but something not spot on. Appearance an almost bright yellow. Incredibly smooth beer however, strong bitterness coming through this time. Bottle from same place. Re-rated, bottle at Plaza bar �stersund. Smooth. 2.9 to 3. Bottle. Aroma of roast lamb this time mixed with lager. Appely finish. Its a decent pilsner. 2.9

John Harvard's Espresso Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the Wayne location. The beer menu had this listed as their �Organic Coffee Stout�. Poured a dark black, with red edges and a smaller sized tan head. Aromas of coffee, roast, and light chocolate. Tastes of coffee, roast, light vanilla and chocolate. Nice bitter coffee finish. I�m a sucker for coffee beers.
John Harvard's Espresso Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);[Wayne, PA] Poured an opaque black color that had a medium sized, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of straight coffee bean. That�s about it, same with the taste with a bit of roasted malt, and chocolate, but with a dry, bitter, somewhat astringent finish.
John Harvard's Espresso Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);I have had this one several times at the Monroeville PA location. Draft only it pours a thick dark black color with almost no head. The aroma is light coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick and rich. The flavor is bitter but less so than I would expect from this style as this is surprisingly sweet. The coffee is noticeable but not overwhelming. The beer drinks easily and pleasurably begging for a refill.
John Harvard's Espresso Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap - DC. Deep dark browns and blacks, small creamy brown head. As it warmed, I got notes of roasted black coffee, chocolate, cream, with some light vinous notes as well. Flavors of dark coffee and chocolate dominate, but some citric hops shine thru to keep a nice balance. Medium to full-bodied, pillow soft carbonation, silky, semi-bitter, coffeeish finish. ABV around 6.7%. Very good stout.
John Harvard's Espresso Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);(DC) Creamy brown head atop black body, lovely lacing. Aroma is medium sweet, coffee, chocolate. Taste is medium sweet, strong roasty coffee, light chcolate. Medium body. A good beer, but the coffee elements are a bit too strong for it to achieve excellence.
John Harvard's Espresso Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);I had this with lunch, and I would like to try it again when I am just having a stout for a stout. Very dark appearance and roasted aroma, but the flavor it this and creamy, with the frothy head it is almost like drinking an espresso drink. I await the next time I am near a John Harvard's, so I can try it again.
John Harvard's Espresso Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);a solid sweet stout. The expresso was barely tastable, but the stout was light and creamy.
John Harvard's Espresso Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);WOW...I think this was the best beer I had on my trip to Boston. This stout from the Famous John Harvard''s Brew House was excellent. It was a dark rich brown in color, had a coffee like smell mixed with the drak small of a stout. The rich creamy foam made this brew look ever so appiteasing. When you taste it is like a smooth rich cool black coffee but not as harsh as that would be. it has the taste of coffee and hops and malts. Like Cambells Soup Umm Umm Good!

Nog Eentje Tripel;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Helder bier met mooie schuimkraag. Biologisch bier met suikervervangende Stevia, resulteert in weinig smaak maar toch droge afdronk met bitterige mondgevoel.
Nog Eentje Tripel;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Organic beer low in sugar and calories, made for a company which promoted the sweet but very low calory Stevia plant as a replacement for sugar - we�re clearly in the health beer atmosphere here. Very far fermentation resulted in an indeed utterly dry beer with very low residual sugars, but unfortunately there is not much taste left either. Too thin and too barren for my taste, with not very stable head either.
Nog Eentje Tripel;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle from Delhaize supermarket Pours clear blonde, huge white head that fades fast. Smell is bit... sour ??? Some twisted maltyness . Quite weird, and I cannot put my finger on it ... sweaty ??? Taste is sweet . The funk that I could not place in the smell , def comes from the grains . Not sure what they used, but it tastes weird . Horsestables come to mind, as well as metallicness, and sweetness . Really funky, but not at all like brett . Sourness ? Not quite, but almost .. very weird and unique . Other tastes are bitterness ( a bit ) , sugar , maltsweetness . Overcarbonated , as in most Belgian beers . The name means �another one � , I don�t easy will say that after drinking this . The name is quite fun ( being in a bar , many people will accidently order this ! ) , too bad that is the only reason people will ask it - cause they don�t know what it is ....

Bank Top Haka;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bank Top Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Bar Fringe, Manchester 24/08/2002 A golden bitter which poured very lively. Plenty of hops and a bitter finish that lasts.
Bank Top Haka;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bank Top Brewery;NERAX '02 Laughing my ass off at reading Volgon's comment,because I have the exact same sentiments about this beer.In fact I was one of only two people in a group of about seven,that would even take a sip of this,everyone else couldn't get past the aroma.
Bank Top Haka;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bank Top Brewery;On cask NERAX '02: The talk of NERAX '02, well at least the beer that everyone was saying to stay away from. It had some weird almost skunky taste to it. Most of the people I talked to said 'It's skunked, stay away'. I talked to one of the people working there who assured me it wasn't skunked and was supposed to taste that way. Hmm. With a flavor that makes most people think that a fresh beer is skunked, this could pose some serious competition to Heineken. Interbrew better buy these guys out and put them out of business before the green bottle drinkers of the world find out about this one.
King Continental Lager;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;King Brewing Company;MIBG Fest: Lighter in color than expected. Saazy and sweet - good malt - good body - I thought it was a fair attempt at a Classic German Pils.
King Continental Lager;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;King Brewing Company;They claim this as a cross between a pils and a helles, but it really is an attempt to reach a wider audience. Nonetheless, it could be a good transition brew - it does have some hop action, however faint, and a fine soft mouth to its fair body. Otherwise, the malt just slips away into banal American Standard blandness.
Unibroue Terrible;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Quadrupel / Abt;Unibroue (Sapporo);330ml (thx, Alex M.!). Appearance: dark brown with a tan head. Aroma: nice vinous and dark sugars, some raisins and plums. Taste: along the same lines, some booziness. Overall: good Belgian Strong.
Unibroue Terrible;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Quadrupel / Abt;Unibroue (Sapporo);Surprised I never rated this one. This one is in a regular sized bottle from a six mix pack, rather than the standard 750 that this usually comes in. Even with a careful pour this one went 90% thick tan head. When it finally settled down, you get taste sweeter molasses, cloves, a little nutmeg, a little dried stone fruit. It the type of beer you have to be in a mood for, but it's a nice one.
Unibroue Terrible;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Quadrupel / Abt;Unibroue (Sapporo);Bottle shared. Dark brown color, full sized mocha colored head. Aroma and flavor malts, sweet, lightly raisins, some light sourness in there. Hmm not a fan. 6-3-6-3-11.

Unibroue Terrible;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Quadrupel / Abt;Unibroue (Sapporo);A strong beer, drank 750ml bottle poured in a celebrator glass. Pours a dark black amber with a medium head. Initial taste is mildly smokey, with an aftertaste or burning that fades to a sour coffee sensation with a hint of bitterness. Lovely beer, drinks like a 5% abv.
Unibroue Terrible;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Quadrupel / Abt;Unibroue (Sapporo);750 ml cork and crowned bottle. Nearly opaque dark brown color. Firm creamy beige head. First sip yields notes of dark dried fruits and sweet roasted malts. Midtaste brings hints of plum, fig and calvados. Finish is pure plum sauce and church chatter.

Unibroue Terrible;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Quadrupel / Abt;Unibroue (Sapporo);Pours nearly black with a thick, foamy head that recedes quickly. Aroma is dried fruit and spice (cinnamon, plus something else - maybe clove). Taste is at once plum and brown sugar, warming to various spices, especially clove, as well as some light roast.

Unibroue La Fringante;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Unibroue (Sapporo);First impression is a beer with a unfiltered fluid, and nice air foam. The aroma is nice hoppy and a perfect fruity aroma. The taste is fruity in a hoppy way. It starts with a strong bite of alcohol and bitternes, and then the sweet fruits in the aftertaste, which makes the beer in a good balance.

Unibroue La Fringante;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Unibroue (Sapporo);First impression is a very sparkling beer with a foam that is almost too perfect! Beads of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and foam build up at all times below the crown. Before I lift the glass to your nose, I can already sense a fruity aroma spread. It has a good and promising aromas of ripe fruit and citrus, coriander and other gentle spice. The taste is sweet as light syrup, but mixes fairly quickly with a tart flavor of green apples. Hop bitterness is not much, but instead have the aftertaste very pleasant and as a stop-filled basket of fruit: apples, lemon and light summer berries. Palate is top notch and the mouth feeling is sparkling so it�s a completely delight.

Snoqualmie Falls Perfectly Great Amber;Snoqualmie, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snoqualmie Falls Brewing Company;"It�s a perfectly GOOD amber...but I would not go as far as to say ""great"" and here�s why...on tap at the brewery, pours a murky brown amber in color, minimal head, absolutely no clarity in the glass...African mudwater. Aroma hints at light roast nuts and slight citrus. Tastes like a fairly tame and well-mannered amber ale, nutty malt, light citrus hops with notes of hay and grapefruit. Suspended yeast definitely adds to a fuller mouthfeel yet an ugly looking pint. Fruity esthers carry it through the finish. A very casual american amber ale, not extremely hopped or high gravity like some."
Snoqualmie Falls Perfectly Great Amber;Snoqualmie, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snoqualmie Falls Brewing Company;Pint @ The Traveler. Inoffensive though ultimately unmemorable amber. Pours a pretty copper color. Taste vaguely malty, but mostly just watery. Should have ordered Loco Red instead.
Snoqualmie Falls Perfectly Great Amber;Snoqualmie, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Snoqualmie Falls Brewing Company;Bottle sampled at Bottleworks. Aroma and flavour of pale malts and mild hops. Quite weak.

Bullant Bock Bier;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Inchant Brewing Company;A very short lasting light brown/tan coloured head sat atop of this dark ruby coloured bock beer. Initial aroma that I picked up was liquorice then changing to a meaty broth. Sweetish coffee taste with plenty of fruit thrown in for good measure. Medium body with a slightly creamy texture.
Bullant Bock Bier;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Inchant Brewing Company;I dunno about plax ecz, but this one sure had some nice beer flavours, aromas, palates and overall impressions. Perhaps Vegemite I reckonz. I like the weird old pissed fart on the label. In conclusion a nice beer for the festive season. Bottoms up!
Bullant Bock Bier;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Inchant Brewing Company;Dark brown in colour, small spritzy head. hot spicey coffe flavours. Can smell the chillies and this hides it bitter after taste.
Bullant Bock Bier;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Inchant Brewing Company;Almost opaque brown with a medium size short lasting mid-tan head. Passion fruit, roasted malt and coffee aroma - no chocolate anywhere on this one for me. As it warms the ester/actone ratio increases somewhat. Medium crisp body. Medium sweetish fruity, coffee and lighter bitter-sweet roasted malt flavours. Not really very bock like - but not like anything else either. Sweet black coffee finish and slightly fruitier aftertaste. It left me feeling a little like the guy on the label - confused!
Bullant Bock Bier;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Inchant Brewing Company;"Eczematic says it best ""mixed up tinned fruit salad"" and ""no frills cooking chocolate"", well said, and all this points to the fact that it is quite artificial tasting, dryish finish, slightly burnt malt flavour."
Bullant Bock Bier;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Inchant Brewing Company;Deep amber-brown colour. Toffee-butterscotch aroma. Thinnish palate. Pretty fruity flavour (strawberry, cherry). I'd prefer more malt and hop flavour. The yeasty esters seem to dominate this beer.
Bullant Bock Bier;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Inchant Brewing Company;says on the label that it tastes of chocolate and fruit salad and indeed it does. can respect it as it tastes like no other aussie beer
Bullant Bock Bier;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Inchant Brewing Company;Very weird. mix up tinned fruit salad, no frills cooking chocolate, fried banana, and wash it down with plax.
Bullant Bitter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inchant Brewing Company;Coppery amber colour with a very little head. Caramel raisins and honey aroma, very little bitterness but overall I quite like it.
Bullant Bitter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inchant Brewing Company;Pours dark amber-brown with basically no head. Aromas of roasted grains, caramel, and fruitcake(??).. Very sweet taste, thin body with a little tingle of bitter afterwoods.
Bullant Bitter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inchant Brewing Company;Medium amber coloured, not much head. Sweet almost caramel aroma and flavour, too sweet, sticky palate. Not refreshing at all.
Bullant Bitter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inchant Brewing Company;Medium dark amber cola like clear with a medium small size short lasting head, Amusing roasted caramel honey fruity (watermelon and passionfruit) aroma. My first observation on tasting is where is the bitter? Flat dry ginger ale softdrink like body and palate. Light fruity/floral nectar sweet and faint bitter flavours. Soft sweet soda-pop finish. Disappointing.
Bullant Bitter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inchant Brewing Company;a nice bitter finish with a full hop palate, tastes better than it looks, and the aroma leaves a lot to be desired, but the flavour makes up for it
Bullant Bitter;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inchant Brewing Company;Kind of strange tasting ale, slightly fruity and dry hop finish, and a tad bitter, its drinkable, but it kind of missed the spot with me.
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Bottle. Pours bright golden color, clear, with a medium rocky white head. Aroma is lemon, malt, straw. Flavor is some lemon, malt, honey, grain. Good for the style.
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Tap. Pours to a clean golden body with a white head. The aroma is silage and not very good. The flavor is icky. Grains galore and nasty lager yeast flavors. Man, I can do without this one. Thank God I only had a sample. Had I decided on a glass, I�d have wanted my money back. Unappealing palate. Was not that good.
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Tart lemon earth aroma, spritzy with aged hops and grain husks. Percolatingly hazy golden, with a rocky cream of white. Flavor a very plain and longingly sweet sugary malt over a light body of lemon dust. Malt is clean, but very plain and subdued, however tending a few distant esters and some background yeast notes. Bright and refreshing. Not much depth or character, which I find unfortunate in the this example. It�s almost too americanized for me. But, cleaniness appreciated and light euro hop parch provides welcome balance to the finish.
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"It�s a great example of a Munich Helles. I�m not sure if I like it better than Hacker Pschorr�s fine Edel-Hell, but they are close. one of my favorite styles of beer. not a ""light beer"" at all but a specialty lager with lawnmower malt flavors and nice fresh tettanger hop flavors. Superb summer lager."
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"12 oz bottle: Rated a while ago! Crystal clear deep golden body w/ a lasting white head. Aroma is of clean grainy and toasty malt, a light DMS, also a bit of malty sweetness in the aroma. Clean flavor, well balanced throughout w/ a sweet, malty finish. Toasty malt dominates w/ no hop presence. Lighter medium body, medium carbonation, smooth m/f. Overall a good beer, I�m actually a bit surprised they are discontinuing this one! Not their best, but this would appeal to the non ""good beer"" drinkers in Cleveland!"
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);I don�t usually enjoy these soapy german style lagers. But this one is very good. The color is nice and golden, witha decent head. The aroma is strong of hops. And the flavor is full and ends witha very good bitterness. A very good lager.
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);One of the very best dortmunder�s I have experienced, which is saying a lot because I don�t particularly enjoy these types of beers. I didn�t pour this one, so I can�t speak of its color, however, the aroma was pure and clean, as was the finish. The taste was very smooth, flowed like honey, although not as sweet as honey. So that really isn�t an apt comparison.
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);I don�t think this is a lager at all. It�s more of a hefe-weizen. It�s very citrusy, with a small head. It�s tasty, but I don�t see how it�s labeld a lager.
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);I dont know if I have any more to say, Great Lakes is simply a great brewery and I enjoy all of it, great job!
Great Lakes Locktender Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Figured I�d better try this one last time before it was too far past freshness date on the bottle. Blonde pour with a foamy white head. Not much retention or lace. Mildy malty aroma, with grassy noble hops. Bready malt profile with slight spice and a hint of fruit from the hops. Clean finish with the slightest hint of yeast. I liked drinking this at Jacobs Field. Too bad this didn�t sell better, or it would probably still be in the bottling rotation. Now, where�s the Barrel Select Pils bottles?
Avalon Kiltlifter Scottish Ale;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Avalon Brewing;Great chocolatey, nutty, textured aroma. The falvour, however, is one-dimensional being heavily nutty and a tad dry.
Avalon Kiltlifter Scottish Ale;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Avalon Brewing;Sparkling deep amber,thin head. Roasted carmel malt nose. Burnt carmel flavor
Avalon Kiltlifter Scottish Ale;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Avalon Brewing;"Brick amber; peaty, assertive, roasty nose. Firm maltiness, quaffable though, slight toffee note, more smoke lingering, dry finish. Good flavour, needs a shade more body and malt to back it up."
Avalon Kiltlifter Scottish Ale;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Avalon Brewing;A dark ale with a kind of roasty taste to it. No over whelming hop content and not very strong.
Avalon Twin Lions Golden Ale;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Avalon Brewing;Sparkling gold,thin white head. Malt nose. Medium bodied clean malt flavor.
Avalon Twin Lions Golden Ale;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Avalon Brewing;"Light copper; light earthy hops, bread crusts on the nose. Interplay of warm biscuity malts and crisp, earthy hop notes. Light on the IBUs (between 16 & 18). Almost lemony finish - mix of US and English hops, which I usually do not recommend."
Avalon Twin Lions Golden Ale;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Avalon Brewing;A very nice Ale to enjoy while trying some of their dishes. Great spot too.
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;341ml bottle sampled many years ago poured a dark brown color with a finger of off-white head that left some sporadic lacing on the glass. Aroma was caramel and light chocolate with some roasted grains. Taste was malty sweet with a surprising hop bitterness in the finish. Light to medium body with adequate carbonation. A refreshing and flavorful brown ale that was thoroughly enjoyed.
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;Body is medium brown with a nice tan head that laced pretty nicely. Aroma was sweet and quite hoppy. Flavour is quite sweet with a caramel flaour to it. Finish is sort of dry but the feeling in the mouth is quite acidic.
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;Brown colour. Thick head. Sweet aroma out of the bottle. Stronger hops than expected. Body is a little thin. Decent but unspectacular beer from thes small brewer.
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;Slightly hoppy aroma with a fruity tinge. Pours amber brown with a thin head. Palate is a bit thin. The finish is also a bit light. An ok beer for casual quaffing but not a standout.
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;Along the spectrum of brown ales, from Rogue's flavorfulness to Newcastle's mildness, this falls about midspectrum. It's sweeter than most and yet has a mildness that could make it a session brown.
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;I''m not a fan of brown ales, but I didn''t mind this one. Light carmel malt nose. Malt flavor throughout, no noticeable hops
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;Really liked this. I swear I'm getting a hint of caramel in it. Much better than a Newcastle. Crisper and better flavor. Excellent!!!
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;Big fan of Bear Brewing.....................................................
Bear Brewing Brown Bear Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Bear Brewing;"Brewers never admit it, but I think this and their lager have been dumbed down over the years. At first, this was a fine, hoppy ""American Brown"", kind of like what Pete's Wicked used to be. Now it's not as hoppy, and the malt is lacking that hint of smoke I used to enjoy. It's ok, but a simplistic beer and not as good as when these guys first came out and people were actually excited about them."
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;I'm not sure how old this is, but since the last review was in 2016, I'm guessing I've had it awhile. Purchased at Albertson's in Bakersfield. Clear orange/amber color with a fluffy and persistent white head. Not much in the aroma other than nice toasted malt. Taste is also toasted malt and a clean, dry grain flavor. Earthy, slightly spicy, dry leaf bitterness follows this and balances the maltiness really well. Finishes with a light caramel sweetness and lasting dry bitterness. There's nothing extreme or intense about this beer, but it's a very well constructed and balanced traditional IPA that's flavorful and tasty. I'll try to drink it a little fresher next time!
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;Bomber courtesy of IrishBoy (Thanks Richard!) poured a clear golden amber with a lasting creamy ivory head. Aromas of biscuit, pine, dankness, light earthiness and light grapefruit. Palate was light bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of biscuit, dankness, pine and a hint of grapefruit with a smooth dry bitter lingering dank piney finish.
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;Great nose that showcases the hop well, as does the flavor. Avg body but as expected. Solid.
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;Draft. Big Centennial hop aroma of flowers, also of honey. Flavors are orangey honey with some nutty bittering at the finish. Solid.
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;Very unique IPA - Intense malt profile combined with great Hops! One of my all-time favorites! At 6.5 ABV, the Bomber is a nice solo drink to enjoy while food-prepping!
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;I like Centennial hops, so I think well of this beer. Good citrus and tropical fruit nose from a healthy foam. Amber color with medium body. Flavors are a little too sweet but hops are still noticeable. Finish is also slightly sweet.
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;Amber pour with a white head. Nice citrus hop nose. Some grapefruit, a bit of orange, and a light peach note. Plenty of pine, a mild malt sweetness, and a hint of floral hops. There is a bit of a grassy note to the flavor. Some pie bitterness, grapefruit, and orange peel. Moderate malt sweetness on the palate as well.
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Unclear amber, tiny head. Aroma-grains, citrusy hops. Taste- sweet malt, spicy and floral hops. Light-medium body, dusty aftertaste.
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;Growler. Deep orange pour. Citrus aroma. Very nice hop aroma. Flavor is sweet malt. Some cotton candy. All followed up by a calming American C-hop bitterness.
Lengthwise Centennial Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;IPA;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub. Clear medium orange with a 1/2 finger yellowish white head, good retention. Big grassy citrus hops and light pine hops behind, with a solid lightly sweet clean caramel malt backbone. The flavor has the caramel turning a little honeyish, with the hops otherwise staying the same. Dry finish with bitterness at a 4. Light carbonation with a medium body. Very good IPA--more of a regular IPA than a West Coast. . .

Wye Valley Braveheart Bitter;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Bottle conditioned. This one went down really well, right down the sink. Initial ripe fruitiness in the nose developed into a sourness in the mouth that decame undrinkable after a few sips. I have now tried enough English bottle conditioned beers to have spotted the reason why so many of them are undrinkable. If I can spot it why can`t the producers of these beers?

Metallic smell, a bit sour with a good hit of liquorice. Sweet taste with a bit of sourness on the finish. Watery body. Liquorice, malt vinegar and oak chips in the aftertaste.

Goed voor een pilsener.

Castle Rock Elsie Mo (Cask);Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Pint off cask at the Lord Abercrombie. A rich golden ale in a very English style, with lots of malt and not much at all in the way of hops. It had more oomph about it than many other golden ales, but it just wasn't that exciting. Perfectly drinkable though.

Hi-Five Premium Lager;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);"Good buttery czech style hop aromas, sweet body with a fruitiness that seems out of place. A strange off flavour develops that reminded me of the taste of an Indian ""whiskey"" I once had. Once was enough. Still better than some indian lagers I`ve tried."
Buckhead Buck Light;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Pretty substandard, really. The waitress said that Buck Light was comparable to Bud Light and I couldn�t agree more.
Buckhead Buck Light;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Draft @ Alpharetta. Color is almost white with a nice malty aroma. Taste had a nice grain feel and taste to it with a touch of smokiness and mellow malts. Lively mouthfeel with an obviously thin body. I usually dismiss these types of beers but I liked it.
Buckhead Buck Light;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);You know this was refreshing light and easy to drink, but had very little character to speak of. A microbrew that will appeal to the unpalatable rolling rock types. Re rate: This beer has gotten a little bit better than I remember it, a refreshing light beer with a solid malt backbone and some light grassy hop notes. Actually really good for a light beer.
Buckhead Buck Light;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Thirst quenching and easy drinking and beats the macros for what it is trying to deliver - definitely not a blond ale though - but more complex than an American Standard - subtle hoppy flavor going on here. Not my first choice at Buckhead - but needed to add to my list - and was pleasantly surprised. Good beer to introduce a novice beer drinker to the joys of craft brewed beer - which I did. Clean and clear and nothing offending here - no real aroma or thick head.
Buckhead Buck Light;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);I guess that they are brewing this to offer BudMillCoors drinkers a beer that won't shock them too much. Straw gold color and highly carbonated. This one pales in comparison to this brewery's other offerings. Most of the women at the bar seemed to enjoy it though.
Buckhead Buck Light;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);For a light beer, it's not bad at all. It just pales in comparison to the brewery's other fine offerings. Hoppy and slightly funky nose. Very pale gold. Clear, sweetish slightly watery flavor. Palate 'light' and a little watery.
Buckhead Buck Light;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Note: I tasted this at the Alpharetta, GA (metro Atlanta) location. Cloudy yellow with an orange tint. Head has unusually large bubble, but it fades to a thin small bubbled foam later one. Very citrusy, mild spiciness with some estery notes getting stronger towards the bottom of the bottom. The fuzzy mouthfeel from the carbonation (similar to Chimay Red) makes it a little more difficult to drink that it should for such a light beer.

Buckhead Red Hills Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);A beautifully copper ale that is one of the finest session beers I�ve ever had. I could have drunk endless pints of this stuff. Mild, flower aroma that is reflected in the taste. An unobtrusive hop and a pleasing malt balance. This is a gorgeous beer. Very similar to Atlanta�s Dogwood Pale Ale. Loved it!

Buckhead Red Hills Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Deep red color with a medium thick head. Sweet caramel malt aroma, and the taste to match it. Very light hoppiness. Delicate and slightly spicy, and the best of the year around offerings from Buckhead Brewery that I�ve tasted yet. Goes great with their prime rib.
Buckhead Red Hills Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Dark leatherized ruby. A nice head fades slowly but completely. Just looking at it, I probably would have guessed a brown. The aroma and flavor wouldn't have dissuaded me either. Warm malts, a slight hop bite and a tad tart. The flavor is come cocoa, caramel, slightly metallic hops. Good beer, but the aftertaste drives down the overall quality.
Buckhead Red Hills Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Expected a Killian''s clone, but was pleasantly surprised. Lot going on in this brew - nice copper color - fruity undertones, malty finish.
Buckhead Red Hills Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This was the dregs of the vat, so I'll need to re-rate someday. Strong bittering, mild caramel. Wood in the finish, and the dregs bittering threatened to overpower anything else towards the bottom of the glass. I've liked their other amber beers better.
Buckhead Red Hills Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Beautiful dark amber color with a lasting head. Very well balaced flavor. One of my favorite beers.
Buckhead Aspen Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);A nice well balanced amber ale, that is not overly heavy on the toasted malts. A solid malt character and some refreshing cascadian hops. Very nice caramel and toffee flavor.
Buckhead Aspen Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Wow Im still finding notes from the Atlanta Pub Crawl! A reddish orange appearance with a moderate head. Aroma was floral with a citrus tone. A slightly bitter flavor with a huge malt background. This was quite the hoppy amber ale. Enjoyable brew and one that would be a good session ale.

Buckhead Aspen Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Nice hoppy surprise. Clean, crisp citrusy aroma.

Buckhead Oktoberfest;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Gold Medal all-around winner at the Georgia Craft Brew Challenge Pours beautifully - like a pumpkin-colored caramel soup.

Buckhead Oktoberfest;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Caramel, malt and Cascade/Centennial hop nose. Orange-tea color with quickly fading head.

Buckhead Hop Island India Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;IPA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Best of the Buckheads so far. Aroma - thought I was in a South Florida grapefruit warehouse - nice and citrusy to say the least. Flavor was the same - and lasted throughout. Hoppiness was not overwhelming though in that it did not leave a bad aftertaste. Nice copper color appearance as well. Buckhead has really improved itself in the last year or so I must say.

After romancing over Guinness for many years before I know what I was missing, I realized that sweet or milk stouts are my favorite form of that venerable style. But now I�ve sampled the supremely coffee-and-dark chocolate-accented Black Diamond Stout and suddenly dry stouts are again an option. Great, rich color; fabulous aroma, wonderful mouthfeel (though not all that dry). This is a phenomenal beer."
Buckhead Black Diamond Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Well balanced flavor that is dominated by roasted chocolate malt. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Coffee flavors come through in the finish.
Buckhead Black Diamond Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This was an aswesome dry stout. Not overly dry or overly sweet. Perfectly balanced, with just a little too much carbonation. Lots of coffee, creamy roasted richness and subtle dark chocolate flavors in the aftertaste. This one really leaves you wanting another pint.
Buckhead Black Diamond Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Came from the tap with low carbonation, and an attractive dense black appearance appropriate for the style. Aroma heavy on roasted coffee, and the taste was also dominated by roasty nutty flavors. There was a faint undercurrent of bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel was dry and medium thick. I downed my pint quite easily.
Buckhead Black Diamond Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);(Nitro) Deep brown with riby highlights, produces a creamy tan head and very good lace. The aroma has a lactic sourness, burnt malts, caramel, floral hops, and dusty yeast esters. The taste reminds me of bittersweet chocolate with that noticeable lactic twang which works well on the nose but not the palate. The finish has nutty, coffee grinds, and bitter notes. Thin-bodied with a sticky quality but too fizzy. The sour taste overpowered the mocha and made this beer not fully enjoyable.
Buckhead Black Diamond Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Pours an opaque black with a thick pillowy tan head with good lacing. Mild aroma with a touch of tartness and roasted malt. Body is thin, sour, and disappointing. Finishes somewhat malty and tart. It looked so good, but just didn't taste that way.
Buckhead Black Diamond Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Black appearance with a moderate head and good lacing. Chocolate and coffee flavor with a hint of smoke. Medium bodied with a bitter finish. A good dry stout.
Buckhead Black Diamond Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This is a fairly uninteresting stout, I thought. I had it on tap at the brewery, and it was nitro tapped. I don''t know if they changed it since the other reviewer tried it, or what. It was quite watery for a stout (kind of dark amber red colored), though the flavors were quite good. Some chocolate and malt flavors, with a bitter aftertaste. Not bad. Overall, it just wasn''t that great though.

Buckhead Ten Point Porter;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Porter;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Excellent porter from the Alpharetta location. Very dark body is almost black, but with reddish brown light around the edges. The chocolate-milk foam head is soupy and leaves behind a nice lacing. The aroma is chocolately, with a burst of grassy hops. This perhaps could use a little age to get rid of the grassiness, but it�s not objectionable. The flavor is very low in bitterness, with a full, but not quite rich chocolate malt taste. Very drinkable.
Buckhead Ten Point Porter;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Porter;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This stuff was great and definitely something I could drink over and over again. Not very consistent from glass to glass though. The first glass was just chock full of chocolately goodness while the later glasses were like drinking a cup of coffee. Very roasted and nutty, incredibly creamy and rich, full of flavor.
Buckhead Ten Point Porter;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Porter;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Maybe I got the bottom of the barrel - but this did not do a lot for me. Almost skunky in aroma and flavor - will try again on another visit - hardly rates as a porter except for the dark color.

Bredaryds Chocolate Stout;Bredaryd, Sweden;Stout;Bredaryds W�rdshus;Bottled (from old bottle at the brewpub. The lady brewer popped one of these, as they had a tasting in the evening, where it would be opened, so I got a 4 cl taster). Quite much pitch black colour with small brown head.

Bredaryds Chocolate Stout;Bredaryd, Sweden;Stout;Bredaryds W�rdshus;From an old bottle (2003) at the brewpub. Unfortunately, it hadn�t stood the test of time but had a clear acidity to it. Great aroma though with dark chocolate and dark fruits.
Bredaryds Chocolate Stout;Bredaryd, Sweden;Stout;Bredaryds W�rdshus;We were offered a bottle of this brew from 2003 on April 25, 2009, as the end of our fantastic beer tating. When I smelled it my thoughts ran wild, oh my god! Very rarely do I smell a beer and immediately think I do not want to taste it, because the taste can�t be as perfect as the smell! It wasn�t. Unfortunately it had gone sour, though in the back you could still hint a nice chocolate tone. How I would have liked to try this at it�s peak, it must have been amazing! Thank you very very much to Petra at the brewpub to go the extra mile and giving us this free sample, it was most excellent and awesome service! Black color, brown head. Chocolate, roasted, sweet scent. Also alcohol and wood. Very very very nice! Acidic taste, also chocolate. Medium mouthfeel, low bitterness.

Bredaryds Chocolate Stout;Bredaryd, Sweden;Stout;Bredaryds W�rdshus;Draught @ the brewpubPitch black coloured. Brown fluffy head. Coffee, chocolate, fruit and light spicy aroma. Was just what I had hoped for. Flavour of strong coffee, chocolate fruits and hops and unfortunately a very irritation sourness in the background. Probably because its an old keg (the brewpub just opened after 2 weeks holliday and the waitress said the beer had been on the tap for quite a while). Has a nice and creamy end. Would love to taste this fresh.
Bredaryds Chocolate Stout;Bredaryd, Sweden;Stout;Bredaryds W�rdshus;The best chocolate stout I have had! Simply fills your mouth with a balanced taste that last very long

Tun Tavern Wicked Wheat;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Tun Tavern;This is more likea Belgiun Wheat beer than a Weizenbock but nothing to write home about. I�m just going through my notes from the NJ Brewers fest and there�s not much on this stuff.

Thick body, fat and chewy. Loaded with banana, cloves and soft crab apple tartness. Sweetly fruity aftertaste. The best and most impressive brew I sampled. True to form and downright incredible, despite the low(er) ABV and the fact the server thought I wouldn't like it. Guess most people send it back. Idiots.

Tun Tavern Highlander Ale;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;Tun Tavern;1/2 gallon growler. Semi-hazy chestnut. Foamy tan edge head. Moderate carbonation, a bit excessive. Serious sugar daddy malt aroma. Medium body, lightly airy. Caramelly sweet with a noticeable alcohol spiciness. Soft nuttiness. Light tangy peat flavor. Effervescence lightens as the brew sits. Finishes a little drier but still hefty and solid. Very impressed with this little brewery, considering they're the only one in town. They have no one to compete with and still maintain a high standard. My hats off.

Basil Ts XXX Summer Brew;Red Bank, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Birravino;On tap at Basil Ts Red Bank. Super clear faint yellow virtually no head, looked like BMC. Sight aroma of cereal grains and hops. Flavor is similiar and very bland. I guess this is their Coors Light option, it�s drinkable I guess.
Basil Ts XXX Summer Brew;Red Bank, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Birravino;Clearest light blonde. Quickly fading white head. A very simple, most accessible ultra-clean golden ale. Kinda bland really, its hops remain inaccessible and the malt bill is simplistic and very thin. Barely grainy, tiny bodied.

Basil Ts XXX Summer Brew;Red Bank, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Birravino;Tap. Pours a clean yellow with a minimal head. Slight citrus aroma on the nose.

Buckhead Southern Belle;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this beer. After hearing the waitress extoll the virtues of its golden hue (true) and honey notes (where) I was struck by the blandness of this beer. Nothing to note in any way, shape or form. I could have been drinking water. Not even any skunkiness to displease, just nothing or more correctly, not anything. A blank slate.
Buckhead Southern Belle;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Has a faint floral aroma - but hard to detect. Light Golden appearance - little to no head - lots of bubble action. Sweet honey flavor very apparent - makes for a very delectable ale. A bit of grapefruity hopiness rounds it off nicely. Excellent buttery mouthfeel. One of the better on es from Buckhead - has not been on tap in quite a while. Had at the Tallahassee location.
Buckhead Southern Belle;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Buckhead makes some surprisingly good blonde ales. The Buck Light is a surprisingly flavorful blonde ale despite it's super light appearance. This one was a bit darker, but definitely within the style. The head was nice and soupy and hung around for a bit. Crisp straw malt is bigger than you'd expect from the style with a slight sweetness. Not as much honey flavor as I expected, but not a bad beer. Gets points deducted from being boring though.
Buckhead Southern Belle;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Mild lemon/hop aroma. Very yellow with little head. Mild lemon and honey flavor with solid palate and caramel finish.

Buckhead Hefeweizen;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Served much too cold to me at the Alpharetta location, in the totally inappropriate pint glass, with a wedge of lemon stuck on the rim to add insult to injury. The beer itself is slightly cloudy with a tiny head, which is completely atypical for the style. At the sub arctic initial serving temperature, the beer lacks a lot of phenolic character and comes across as overly sharp and bitter. As the body warms up, it gets more of the clove flavor coming through, but by that time most of the beer is gone. Little to no banana or other fruit taste here, and almost no creaminess to speak of. The tart lemon peel taste is however nicely represented. Passable offering on a hot summer day, but will disappoint the purist.
Buckhead Hefeweizen;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This one isn�t so cloudy as most and that detracts from the appearance. It�s a pale coppery color with a bit of haze. the head is ok, but not huge. The aroma is nicely clove-phenolic, less estery than that. The wheat is big, cereal-like and crisp in the flavor. Very refeshing hefeweizen.
Buckhead Hefeweizen;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This is what it's like to get hit by the banana truck. Good mouthfeel, vanilla, banana and that wheat twang. I'll have to re-rate someday as I'm doing this one from distinct memory.
Buckhead Hefeweizen;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Bright gold and cloudy. Distinct banana aroma. Flavor is smooth and balanced with a lingering sweetness. Overall a very good wheat beer.

Buckhead Wilderness Wheat;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Fizzy, hazy, rosy-apricot colored. Understated raspberry flavor, with sour-citric west coast hopping. Finish was smooth for the most part, with hop bitterness hanging on through the mid-term. Well-balanced for a specialty brew.
Buckhead Wilderness Wheat;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Funky aroma - akin to day old socks - faint reminiscense of rasberry. Cloudy, orangerish appearance makes up for the aroma however. Faint rasberry flavor lasts throughout - a little bit too artificial for my taste. Will give another try sometime.

Buckhead Winter Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);The head is full and a bit soapy in appearance. The body is a dark brown, hazy, but showing hints of red. The aroma is richly malty maybe a little alcohol, but it covers that well. The flavor is very earthy and rich, but not cloyingly sweet. You notice a little heat after you swallow and that's the only time the alcohol fully reveals itself, although it does add a slight peppery bite to the flavor that balances the rich malty flavors out nicely. Nice.
Buckhead Winter Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Enjoyed this with lunch -made me not want to go back to the office! More like a dopplebock than a Scottish Ale in my opinion - reminds me of Celebrator. No real discernible aroma - just a pleasant maltiness. Cola colored with light brown head with a fair amount of lacing. Alcohol is hidden well until the last 1/4 but by then - who cares! Flavor is malty with a bit of hoppiness to balance it out. Detect raisins and prunes. Overall - an excellent brew by the fine folks at Buckhead.
Buckhead Winter Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);A huge, warming beer. Very sweet and peaty, with complexities that come out as the beer warms and as the ABV kicks in. Roasty and toasty. Deep ruby brown with lacey head.

Z Street IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours amber with a thin white head. Smells of citrus and perfumy. Tastes resiny and bitter with some caramel on the finish.
Z Street IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle. Pours a murky amber with a thin white head and good retention. Aroma was hoppy, with sweet citrus. Tasted very hoppy with East Coast hops and the citrus hits in the aftertaste. The palate was full bite and carbonation.
Z Street IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle. Light amber / gold pour with some white head. Aroma is citrusy and a little malty. Toasted malt, citrus hop, and earthy hop flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and light, but the hoppiness is a little metallic. Slightly dry finish with a little bitterness.
Z Street IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;murky orange with a white head that leaves some lacing.nice hoppy aroma and flavor.a bit under rated i.m.h.o.
Z Street IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"12 oz bottle from Alldaydrinker; nose of flowery hops with some light pine and background caramel; hazy copper with a medium straw head; flavor of light to moderate hop bitterness and a little caramel balance."
Z Street IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;An above average IPA with three hops: Cascade, Centennial, and Kent. Bitter and full bodied, a good palate cleaner. Golden peachy colour with moderate white head. Fresh and refreshing. Some leafy mintness in finish. Appropriately carbonated.
Z Street IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Poured yellow with a medium head. The notes of hops on the nose seemd a bit grassy. Teh mouthfeel had a deep bitterness with a long bitter finish but some odd metallic flavors.
Z Street IPA;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle. This poured bright yellow-orange with a massive barrier of rocky, firm foam protecting the beer below. Little aroma can penetrate this fortress of foam, but eventually there�s a bit of a fruity, grassy waft. Onto the tongue, the initial impression is a very dry and acidic hoppiness. As I go, the bitterness mellows a bit but still rears its head as the final bit of aftertaste on every swallow. Added to the earthy hops is a caramel appleyness. Could�ve done a bit better with the balance on this one, as it comes off a bit harsh. This would still pair nicely with my wife�s spicy humus or some nice firey chicken wings. (#3101, 9/23/2007)

Hindustan Bombay Beer;Mumbai, India;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hindustan Breweries;Bottle. Really quite disgusting. Vegetable water, cardboard and glue. All those people who give bland products like Ice Lagers a score of 0.5 should really try something as foul as this to realise that bland is still drinkable. Third world lagers can be so offensive as to be genuinely revolting rather than simply tasteless. I don�t know what this is made out of, and I really don�t care. One thing is for certain, I am not putting any more of this abomination in my body.
Hindustan Bombay Beer;Mumbai, India;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hindustan Breweries;A strange cardboard flavour was present which was quite distracting. The bottle claims that it has won a lot of medals at various beer exhibitions.Perhaps for being different especially if you are a cardboard fan.
Hindustan Bombay Beer;Mumbai, India;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hindustan Breweries;"Dull gold colour, dull malt aroma (with plenty of adjunct evident - rice?) , dull flavour and dull thin mouthfeel. Dull in fact. No hop presence at all. Poor stuff. Mine was called ""Bombay Beer"" and 4.9%, but I�m assuming it is basically the same stuff. Hardly worth setting up a new entry for anyway. It may have pilsener in the name, but no way is this a pilsener - more like a typical, hot climate pale lager. 650ml bottle from Tesco. BBEJuly 2004."
Hindustan Bombay Beer;Mumbai, India;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hindustan Breweries;might have been nicer cold. malty and with no real hops in there. still, after 2 hours walking around delhi trying to find a beer it was satisfying

Classica von Wunster;Milano, Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Heineken Italia;Clear golden color, little white head, little cereal and malty aroma, no taste...hint of bitter...watery. Cheap and crap.
Classica von Wunster;Milano, Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Heineken Italia;Pleasant fresh hoppy aroma but largely went downhill from there, malty, quite corny, not particularly clean tasting or enjoyable.
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Draft sample at MBGSF from old backlog notes. Pours a clear copper color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale toasted malts, caramel, light resiny and citrus hops, mild bitterness, meh.
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);"Devil�s Peak IPA is supposed to be their ""monster"" beer offering for the big flavored beer aficionado or, perhaps blatant hopheads. Unfortunately for them, ""big"" apparently means ""bitter."" Deep orange in color, it has a thin, watery body and very low carbonation. The nose is pungent herbal and, using a selection of domestic bittering hops, it�s very dry and bitter from the initial sip to the long, dry, never-ending finish. There�s almost no balance, as bitterness overwhelms any sense of malt or sweetness. Did I mention it was bitter? Serving type: on-tap"
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);sampled at MBGSF�10 - caramel malts, dry piney hops with a touch of citrus. Nothing to write home about, but solid.
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Tap sample at brewpub. Poured clear copper color with an average fizzy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate citrus and earthy hop aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium bitter flavor with a medium smooth bitter finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable brew that went well with my calamari app.
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Surprised at the low rating here- This is a citrusy ale with a clean smooth finish-- The aroma is outstanding and the finish is as clean and balanced as any IPA with a 6.8% ABV would or could be! Truly a fine IPA and worth trying.-All this is a most relaxed setting! You will not be disappointed!
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Part of sampler at brewpub. Pours clear copper with small white head. Aroma is hops, pine, citrus and caramel malts. Flavor is light hops, caramel malts and some citrus and very light pine. Not the most hoppy IPA I have had. Good amount of malt. Nothing special.
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Poured from firken. Nice citrus hop aroma. Nice hoppy flavor (grapefruit) with an average malt backbone with some sweetness. I enjoyed this thorougly. I was pleasantly surprised considering the 33 percentile it falls into here. Maybe they changed thier recipe or maybe the firken is the way to serve it. I for one recommend as an excellent example of style and american hop showcase.
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);A copper / amber appearance, some lacing that sticks and a lasting head. Tons of hops which are a little overpowering. Smells of citrus and pine from the hops, but still has some sweet/malt smell as well. The flavor is a little more balanced than the smell. Not too heavy, good mouthfeel and an enjoyable hoppy-bitter finish/aftertaste.
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Aroma is grapefruit. Taste is of very citric hops with a fair amount of malt sweetness to balance it out a bit. Palate is thicker than many IPAs. This is on the bitter side, even for the style, but I enjoyed i very much. Nice example of a West-coast style IPA.
Copper Canyon Devils Peak Ale;Southfield, Michigan, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Strong citrus/pine hop aroma. Pours a clear orange/amber with a quickly fading white head. Nice grapefruit hop punch at the beginning of the beer, fading into a touch of caramel. Long bitter finish. A very drinkable IPA.
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Now here?s the funny thing... yes, this beer was like a Flander?s red, and I loved it. Nice sourness. Well... the brewer changed. It?s good, but not the hidden sour gem. Deep red, balanced malt now. No discernible anything else.
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Growler shared by bvc. This is in no way shape or form an alt. There is no way in hell. Nose of cherry balsamic, wood, some funky off notes - it literally smells like a flanders red or something. Tangy off aromas, some dark fruit I guess. Pours brownish, no head or lace, minimal carbonation, flabby, kind of bad looking. Flavors of cherry balsamic, funky off notes, a little wood, a little medicinial, tangy lingering notes. Still I feel this is mislabeled or something happened and the wrong beer was filled but this is in no way a fucking alt. Almost uncarbonated, flabby, slick mouth feel. Undrinkable. Fuck what the hell happened here?
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Growler from in recent growler swap. Now this growler came with a �CC Alt� on the cap. Sender told me that is was Copper Canyon Alt, but that the bartender told him that is was the Alt with Brett in it. I contacted them to ask if they had another beer listed with Brett in it, and they told me they do not use Brett. So shame on the bartender for trying to pass this off for something it isn�t and shame on the brewery for putting an infected beer on for sale. Pours a clear walnut amber tinted brown with very flabby white head that is minimal with a very aggressive pour from the growler. Very tart nose (not in an intentional or good way), fake cherry, apple, bubblegum, tannins, chalk dust, some medium roasted malt undertones. Thin body, little carb and what is there is loose. Cherry, tart, slight balsamic, hints of wood, crushed aspirin in the finish. Nothing alt about this beer, it is infected and undrinkable.
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Their Copper Canyon Alt is one of their signature offerings, as one could surmise by the name. A perfect brown in color, this has a thinner body than a typical brown ale, more in the direction of a traditional northern German Altbier it�s supposed to be. There�s a lovely roasted caramel nose, and lingering glass cling that measured the sips down the edge of the pint. The balance was exceptional with a clean, sweet barley finish as this was definitely one of their better offerings and a solid above average brew. Serving type: on-tap
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Draft sample. Poured clear dark brown color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate balanced toasted aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met.
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Part of sampler at brewpub. Pours dark amber with small white head. Aroma is caramel malts and some nuts. Flavor is caramel malt, toffee and some nuts. Average body and mouthfeel. Middle of the pack of the beers I had tonight.
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Maybe they have improved this since the last reviews, but I really enjoyed this. It had a nice amber-red look to it with just a ring of head around the glass. Aroma and taste was of caramel malt, possibly Vienna as well, and noble hops. Very well balanced and perfectly carbonated.
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Not one of their better beers, mild hop flavor with little to no malt, to thick and almost syrup like consistency, nothing special.
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);On tap: The aroma consists of moderate caramel and nuts. Transparent amber with a small off-white head. The flavor is pretty simple with moderate caramel and roasted nuts with a mild grassy hopped finish. Easy drinking, but nothing special.
Copper Canyon Alt;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Deep amber in color with a small white head, as served. Rich toasted and caramel malt aroma with a hint of roasted corn nuts in the finish. The flavor is malty with some upfront bitterness and a lingering toffee-like sweetness. The body is okay, nothing noticably exciting or disappointing. This beer is okay to drink, but not one I�d order regularly.
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Excellent lacing and long lasting head. Rich dark gold. Slight hop presence... almost like a pale, pale ale. New brewer, so I�m wondering if the recipe for this changed from earlier.
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);"Their Northwest Gold is really a pretty standard training wheels light ale. It has a very light body, accompanied with a mild noble hoppy bite. It�s very clean and very high in carbonation. With its light blonde, straw color, it was every bit the imitation ""macro"" offering for people who don�t like beer. With that in mind, it�s clean, crisp and surprisingly not a bad effort. Serving type: on-tap"
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Draft sample. Poured clear amber color with an average white fizzy head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate hop and malt aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium bitter flavor with a medium bitter finish of moderate duration. Drinkable soft brew.
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Part of sampler at brewpub. Pours light golden with white head. Aroma is sweet corn and grains. Flavor is grainy with some light corn and malt. Rather boring and your average macro substitute.
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);On tap: The aroma is lightly sweet with moderate grassiness. Transparent gold with a minimal white head that leaves behind sporadic lacing. The flavor has some light lager sweetness with a touch of citrus. The finish is moderately grassy. It is boring, but about as good as you can expect from a house golden lager.
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Clear light gold color. Maybe a tiny bit of barley or wheat on the aroma. Little head. Has a medium light body with a tinge of sour hops, and a fluffy, doughy finish. Aftertaste is decent though, it tasted like I was chewing on some wheat, which was about the only flavor I could really find. Again, not a bad flavor, just not much of any flavor.
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Golden and highly carbonated with a faint nose of wheat fields and leaves. Grainy first sip, lively mouthfeel and quite a thick body for a presumably thin selection. Taste really went nowhere, staying grainy and bland. Hints of dryness at the end. Not offensive or too harsh, or too thin for that matter.
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Good head and nice lace. Golden Color with a clean smooth taste. .........
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);This one is their microbrew for the masses and it manages to capture rather well the typical beery standard lager taste in its fuller ale body. Cardboard malt, some hops at close.
Copper Canyon Northwestern Gold;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);A refreshing golden ale. Nice hop taste on the finish although rather unspectacular. A thirst quencher rather than a taste to be savored.
Copper Canyon Wheat;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);Good head with a nice lace. Expected color and typical flavor, but a strong fruity aftertaste that sneaks up on you.
Copper Canyon Wheat;Southfield, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Copper Canyon Brewery Restaurant (MI);This is the second straight brewpub where the best beer I've tried was the wheat. It may be the season, or it may be that I'm finally being won over, because I used to despise wheat brews. Anyway, this comes on with a rush of citrus and finishes pleasantly spicy, with a decent body in between. A strong effort.

Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;"From Dec 2007 I got this bottle also as an extra in a trade with JDV. Thanks again, Deniz! This pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy rusty brown with a small but stubborn head of foam. The smell is of apricots, caramel malt, and a touch of hops in the background. Smells nice. The taste is well, tasty. Apricots are the first thing I noticed followed by some caramel malt and a nice big heaping helping of hops. Wow. I didn't think the different flavours would work all that well together but hey, they do! The mouthfeel is medium, the carbonation is fairly low, and it finishes with a good mix of bitter hops and apricot tartness. Very nice indeed! Thanks again, Deniz, for throwing this one in. DFH has again defied the odds. ;^)"
Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;Medium amber color. Apricots, apples and caramel. Modestly bitter palate, but a bit more restrained in the finish.
Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;Found in cellar from last year (2016) and drank it today while working in garage. Pours a clear gold with a very very creamy long lasting head. Subtle apricot under more traditional pale ale aromas. Taste is more pale ale than apricot and it has a very long lasting finish of a melange of apricot, hop, and malt - almost lasts like it�s sticky going down, but it�s not. Very nice on this warm, but not hot, day.
Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;Vtg Blackberry backlog, Many bottles over the years, This review was from Spring 2010. Pours amber golden with one finger head. Smell and flavor are old hops, caramel, pine, and candy apricot. Too sweet.
Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;12fl oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass. Very effervescent, dark amber with a couple fingers of lingering off-white head. Aroma and flavor are both heavy on hops and apricot. Lasting bitter finish. Delicious. My 500th rate! :D
Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours a light amber color. Aromas of hop, apricot with hints of grass and malts. Flavor has a nice piney juniper bite to it, with a mellow apricot flavor with a nice dry finish.
Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;"just a slight hint of apricot, the apricot really gets overwhelmed by the hops (a good thing) much tastier that I expected; not your average fruit beer"

Taste is sweet caramel malt with some fruit notes and slight apricot flavors. Finishes with earthy, pine hops. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;I was stoked for this beer. What a cool concept, apricots and Dogfish Head, right? Eh. I didn�t enjoy it like I thought I would. It wasn�t a bad beer, but it didn�t keep me drinking. It was a little bitter and not really smooth, and tasted more reminiscent of grapefruit than any other fruit flavor I can associate with a beer. Just okay.
Dogfish Head ApriHop;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottled. Has a darker brown. Has a hoppy taste. Has a light body with a medium taste of apricots. Pretty good IPA!!
Manayunk Sasquach Maple Brown Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Manayunk Brewing Company;Wow! What a balancing act. The maple syrup flavor is right up front, backed by a lightly chocolaty malt character. The hop bitterness is present but unobtrusive. Full bodied, rich and strong. This beer should not be served in pints! Of course, it is on the sweet side and one pint is enough. More of an after dinner drink.
Manayunk Sasquach Maple Brown Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Manayunk Brewing Company;Too sweet!! This dark brown colored brown ale just had way too much of a brown sugar taste and it wiped my olefactory senses and tastebuds in the blink of an eye. I hope this was just a bad batch and not indicitive the this beer.
Stiegl Weizengold Hefefein;Salzburg, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Big foam ( at the castle in Salzburg) mild bead flavor with a soft wheat finish. Location adds to the rating.

Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Carolina Beer Company--Charleston Brown Ale--2002 12 oz. Bottle. 5.70% ABV. 25 IBU�s.

Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Draft. Pours deep brown with a tan head. Aroma was biscuity and yeasty, not very pleasant. Smooth roasty taste which made up a little on the aroma. I didn�t find this to be anything I would want to drink again.
Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Draught at Charlotte International Airport. Pours brown with an average, frothy, off-white, lasting head with good lacing. Aroma is average malt (cookie, caramel, nutty), light hops (herbs), average yeast (leather) with notes of toffee. Light bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a metallic finish. Average duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.
Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;I tell you this... I have drank a few other brown ales. Sam adams, petes, cotton wood low down brown(good), & new castle. I rate charleston above all the above.
Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;draught at Murphy�s Law Pub. Pours brown (duh), small white head. The nose is heavily nutty with smoked almonds up front.There�s a bit of caramel and coffee in there too. The beer is not so dense and the sweetness is not over bearing. Yeah, it sounds good, even as I type it, but the balance is off and some salty, veggie notes come out. Okay, I guess.
Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Enjoyed at the �Pirate�s House� in Savannah GA on draught. Fantastic malty, nutty, roasted initial flavor, then flavor disappears. Would have been one of my favorites if the flavor could have hung on a little longer.
Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Dark with a big off white head. Tasted of toasted malts. Not much hops. Had some slight stout like qualities. Dark for a brown ale. Not bad.
Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Poured a translucent brown color with an ok head and lacingg that was ok. Aroma on this one was hard to pick up, maybe some toasted malts. The fflavor was an odd liquor type flavor in the front of everything (sorry, I don�t know my liquors, nor can I say this was high abv, but boy, it was liquor sweet and sharp). Bitter nuts picked up mid-glass and as it warmed some sweet type candy came out. Too strong of an odd liquor type flavor in this one to be great.
Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;a great beer out of the draught. rich dark color with an off white head. rich carmel and toasty, almost taste like beef gravy, which is a plus for me.
Charleston Brown;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Carolina Beer Company;12 oz bottle. Clear dark mahogany color with bubbly khaki head. Heavy molasses nose that competes for aromatic supremecy with the strong raisin smell. Flavor is roasty and chocolatey with a delicate sweetness. Medium bodied with a flat finish.
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);At the great place in the neighborhood. Decent euro lager, good and unchalleging cold, suffers as it warms, malty and biscuity Serving: Bottle
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);from notes taken 9/21/10 -- golden color, almost no head, light streaks of lace. Taste is some malt supported by lots of sweet corn. Flavor thins as it moves to light hops. Not recommended.
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);Served from bottle in pint glass. Appearance: light golden color, a bit of lacing, mild carbonation streaming. Aroma: grassy hops, sweet fresh bread dough and a bit of metallic Mouthfeel: light and dry, almost champagne like Flavor: echoes the aroma with grain sweetness and bread crust along with grassy hops. The slight lingering metallic is a distraction. Overall: an average beer that paired well with my Greek pasta dish.
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);Rated based on notes taken 25 June 2012 -- A very refreshing lager. Went well with my spicy burrito.
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);Clear golden with s white head. Aroma of metal, grass, and grain. Taste is sweet and grainy with a slight bitterness. Light bodied and dry.
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);1st June 2015: 330ml green bottle sat outside �A Taste of Greece� in Laguna Niguel while waiting for a take away. Golden and bright pour, weak un-lasting white head. Corn aroma and taste: poor and basic. Just a boring lager/pilsner based beer that lacks interest or character.
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);Location: 12 oz bottle at a Greek restaurant, 7/30/14 Aroma: The nose is fairly typical pale lager, grainy, some lemon notes, grass, and a little bread Appearance: This one pour a clear golden-yellow color with a fizzy head on top of it Flavor: The flavor is much the same, clean, with a little sweetness, and a mild bitterness Palate: The body is light, but not as watery as some of the style, with a lively-to-fizzy carbonation Overall Impression: This one was pretty much what I expected, while at the same time being a little better. Maybe I just really was in the mood for a light, easy drinking beer, but this one hit the spot.
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);Bottle at olympic flame downtown dm.. pale clear yellow pour with super thin off white head... taste is malty and skunky.. decent overall
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);33cl bottle pours with a clear deep gold yet watery body and almost no head. The aroma puts off sweet creamed corn and some mild floral hop notes. The taste is similar as you�re greeted by a big dose of sweet creamed corn. It then slides into sugary malt sweetened subtle floral hops. Behind those notes are sweet fruity esters like honey covered apples wedges and pears. A bit less sweet and this might not be too hateful.
Aris;Sindos, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olympic Brewery, Sindos - Thessaloniki (Carlsberg);Bottle->session. Light gold with big frothy white head. A: strong corn and lager grains, wet hay. T: watery sweet corn and grains, grass. Crisp but unpleasant.

Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Pours black with tan head. Burnt malt aroma. Fullish body/creamy carb. Flavor is smooth burnt malt - and I think I get the oatmeal aspect. Plus it is nicely hopped. Very, very good.
Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;A very beautiful pour nets a slightly carbonated, jet black beer, with streaks of brown slipping through around the edges. Unfortunately the promise of its appearance disapates with a hugely burnt smelling nose, with some type of liquid smoke aroma dominating. Better on the palate, with nicely roasted coffee flavors up front and some nice hops on the finish. Seems too young, and the roasty character makes it hard to drink too much of this one.
Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;"Bomber thanks to footbalm, bought on our amazing journey in Colorado. Pours a dark black color with a small white head. The aroma is quite nice; oats and roasted malts, some sweet coffee also. The flavor was similar; coffee, roasted malts, cocoa. The only downside was that the body was very thin and watery."
Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;22 oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with a big creamy dark brown head that retains fairly well and laces the glass. The aroma is roasted malts and chocolate with some off plasticy/vegetal notes. The flavor is bitter roasted malts and sweet chocolate and some lactose. As it warms some off-notes come out - burnt plastic. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with full but smooth carbonation. Overall, pretty simplistic but enjoyable when cold. As it warmed, it became less so as some off-notes started dominating.
Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;22 oz. bottle. Pours a thick rapidly disappearing head of a nice mocha color, some mild lacing over a very black opaque body.....nose has nice coffee, chocolate tones....taste is light watery with a bit of bitter finish.....mouthfeel has none of the creaminess an oatmeal (listed on the bottle as one) should have. After the initial appearance and nose a total bomb.
Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;bottle. pretty bad. poured black without head. tasted kinda sour and lactic acid-ish. i guess otherwise it was pretty normal and uninspiring.
Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;Bottled. A pitch black beer with a rim of brown head. The aroma is sweet with notes of cocoa, but also a siight off-note of dust.

Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;22 fl oz bottle. Pours black with a fully gone head.

Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;Bottle. Pours black without much head. Strongly roasty nose with a dark chocolate note. Very thin. Acidic roast and cardboard. Definitely an oxidized bottle. I�ll try to find another bottle sometime to see if this is an aberration. Tastes like coffee watered down with iced tea. I�m surprised how bland this is compared to the aroma. 3 7 3 2 7
Golden City Oatmeal Stout;Golden, Colorado, United States;Stout;Golden City Brewery;22oz bottle. Pours black with a very small tan head. Sweet aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and some coffee. Roasted malt flavour with chocolate and coffee, with a burnt malt flavour following quickly. I could do without the burnt malt flavour as well as the plastic and metal tastes that show up. The finish is of burnt malt with some bitterness. With every sip it becomes more unpleasant. Under-carbonated with a thin mouthfeel. The best part of this beer are the appearance and aroma, it�s all downhill from there. It�s going to be a challenge finishing this bomber.

Alcatraz Birdman Brown;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Very clingy, thin beige head, watery cola colored. Yeasty, milky aroma. Tangy, amateurish, overbrewed hops, out of balance. No nuts, no fruit. Like water that�s been run through an old coffee filter. Their red actually came off as a better brown.
Alcatraz Birdman Brown;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Tried this in the sampler tray on the patio at thier Anaheim location. Not as malty as most. Good head on it. Rather enjoyed it.

Alcatraz Birdman Brown;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of medium sized mostly lasting off-white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing.

The mouth feel was smooth and somewhat flat with a mild lingering malt finish that was mildly tingly. The flavor contained notes of malt and hops.
Alcatraz Birdman Brown;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Utterly delicious! Rather sweet and mild with probably not much alcohol. I could drink gallons of this stuff. Not a hop in sight. Fantastic! Quite malty. Looking forward to more during 2005's annual Indy pilgrimage.
Alcatraz Birdman Brown;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Nitro. Dark brown. Nitro head makes it somewhat interesting, but not enough. Smooth clocolate taste with subtle nuts, malt and caramel. It did have a gritty finish. Way too light at 4.4%
Alcatraz Birdman Brown;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;From a sampler: This beer is a dark brown color with a medium thick beige head. Thin, sticky lacing. The aroma is very nutty with a touch of brown sugar. Very smooth body with a tasty roasted coffee, nut and malt blend. The only downside is the flavor is not very lasting. The finish is nutty and has a lightly bitter aspect to it. This is a pretty good Brown.

Buckhead Avalanche Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);A nice change of pace from the usual, somewhat ham-handed Cascades hop approach at Buckhead. This was nutty and dry with a decent but not overly-done hopping. Woody amber brown. Good aroma.
Buckhead Avalanche Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Tasted more like a Porter - noticed the caramel and toast as the description states - littel bit of coffee/chocolate as well. Not as sweet as Marzens tend to be and should be. Nice orange/copper color - pleasant aroma. Another solid effort from Buckhead.
Buckhead Avalanche Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Nice amber color. Balanced flavor that finishes on the hoppy side. Smooth and refreshing.

Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;I have known this beer,but I could not drink it,because,I am young and now beer is not making.I was a young,seen this bottle,logo in local store.My review is not correct,just I take out my respect to local beer
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Sampled from bottle. Pours hazy gold with a scattered white head. Aroma is unpleasantly sour. Flavor is balanced and dominated by pils malt. Metallic finish brings a grimace to my face. Light-bodied, moderately carbonated. Typical industrial lager.
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Interesting head. Starts out tall & bubbly, becomes slender but creamy, then turns to pond scum, all in about a minute�s time. The aroma is grainy and sweet, covered by an herbal bitterness and pencil erasers. The flavor contains a toasty malt coupled with a corny sweetness that turns somewhat metallic towards the finish, which is an oddly bitter, sticky event. I wish these folk brewed a mocne. DiCarlo Fine Wine and Spirits, Mundelein, IL
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Chill-hazed golden with a trickle of carbonation and a large but fast white head that settles scummy. Aroma finds stale pink bubblegum to start before powdery grains with a light floral quality that gets harsh and herbal as it warms. A thick, malty palate with syrupy-sweetness greeted me in the flavor, fully covering the alcohol assault I had expected. DMS quickly follows turning the sweetness to corn syrup with alcohol creeping in later. A sour finish hangs in the throat. Not too great, but better than the Gold. Purchased from Di Carlo Fine Wines and Spirits, Mundelein, IL 60060
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Pours a clear amber with a feeble white head. Nose was bearly perceptible but held a hint of sweetness and alcohol. Slightly fizzy but still watery and thin. The flavor was almost imperceptible notes of bubblegum and alcohol.
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;22oz bottle. A clear gold color, well-carbonated and sporting a white head. Early perfumy aroma before a sweet malty flavor matched with early mellow hops. Overall, a nice pale malt sweetness. Drinkable.
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;This has kind of an interesting taste going on. Malt very present, sweet. Hops not so much. Eastern European brews are running my life! So many 16 oz bottles and cans for cheap. I�m poor and can�t resist
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;For some reason, I have a bizarre fascination with the beers of Eastern Europe even though they�re seldom memorable. This is another typical pale lager for the region. It does pour quite a nice glowing golden. The head is initially white and fluffy but diminishes a tad to quickly for my taste. Nose is very bready with a strange sort of tang to it. Sweet and sluggish on the palate with a bit of chemical bitterness in the finish. I just can�t get into this. Sorry.
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;Color�s a clear yellow, head a full billowy white. Aroma is soft, dry, notes of flowers, straw, little else. Mouthfeel is smooth, texture and body are light. An underlying sweetness pervades the palate, leaving a pleasant, unobtrusive finish. Indistinct hop presence, just enough malt, turning out tasty, nicely balanced, easily consumed beer. And by far the best Ukrainian pilsener this old suds-snoot�s ever had.
Chernomor Extra;Odessa, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Efes Ukraine Brewery;(Bottle) Pours a clear yellow with a large white head. Aroma of grain and straw, reminds me of growing up on the farm. Not a bad flavor for a pale lager. I could even drink this one warm without making faces. I couldn�t say that for most pale lagers.
North Yorkshire Fools Gold;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Cask. Pours golden with a white lace head. Aroma pale malts and floral hops. Taste is medium sweet with some lemon bitterness before a malt finish. Carbonation average to strong. A forgettable beer whose rumoured retirement is challenged by this rating.
North Yorkshire Fools Gold;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Cask (Elm Tree, Cambridge) Tiny hint of honey, a bit vegetal. Black tea and tobacco. Some nettles, some green apple. Pretty crazy combination sometimes. Watery palate. Spicy and fruity hops in the taste, some gentle bitterness. Sweet. Weird. Kinda fun I guess, despite the oddness.
North Yorkshire Fools Gold;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;500ml bottle. Clear yellow golden colour, foamy white head that quickly dissipates away and aroma of malt, citrus. Taste is sweetish malt with some citrus, fruity & straw notes and a light bitterness. Watery mouth feel, light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, dry bitter on the finish. OK.
North Yorkshire Fools Gold;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Bottle 500ml.

Aroma is fruity, floral, yeasty and a bit tart wooden. Flavour is citrus, some yeast and mild parfumeish sweet notes as well. Mild tartness in it. Lots of particles floating around, foams a lot.
North Yorkshire Fools Gold;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;A - floral with light citrus A - light with thin head T - light sour with citrus bitter P - thin O - ehhhh....
North Yorkshire Fools Gold;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Old Rating. Bottle. Golden coloured. Medium body, strong malt body with a touch of sourness and a slightly bitter finish. An average bottled bitter which makes it a slightly below average beer.
North Yorkshire Fools Gold;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Bottle. Fine skimmed straw. Nose of regurgitated vanilla, farmyard and...wait for it....Picked Onion Monster Munch. No two ways about it. As wayward as that suggests on the palate where there�s TCP, oak, green apple, mealy corn snack notes and a dab of vinegar to be had. Soda emptiness, accidental gueuze. And yet I�m drinking it. Which probably says more about me than the beer.
North Yorkshire Fools Gold;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Bottle. Vibrant cloudy golden beer with a strong head. The aroma is mildly sour and fruity, and the flavour is fruity and dry with an element of sourness and yeast. Overall a very nice and drinkable bitter beer.

Buckhead Nut Brown Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Dark cola brown, light tan head. Very faint cherry-fruit aroma. Tastes a little like a lighter version of their Winter (Scotch) Ale. Moderately sweet, fruity (currants, plums), cola and a bit of cocoa flavoring. Mildly tart/sweet finish that fades to a very slight astringency. Pithy palate. A little sulphur in the finish. Commendable.
Buckhead Nut Brown Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Nice malty aroma - deep copper color - thick head with good lacing. Flavor is initailly nutty with a bit of caramel detected. Turns metallic and artificial as it winds down however.
Buckhead Duckblind Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Good hoppy ale with a lot of character - not too hoppy that it deadened the tastebuds though. Good quencher for the wings that accompanied it. On the upper echelon of Buckhead's offerings.
Buckhead Duckblind Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Has a lot of the Buckhead house character. Hoppy, citrusy, crackery-dry. Good palate, good kick. Medium rust colored, with smallish head.
Buckhead Duckblind Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Moderately hoppy with a floral aroma. Nice copper color but no head retention. This is the first Buckhead beer I tried and it was very enjoyable.
Buckhead Duckblind Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);A pretty solid APA with the strong, grapefruity hops dominating the malt. On the dark side for an APA. It's a solid beer, but not outstanding. A bigger hophead might disagree with me however.

Buckhead Panther Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Poured a clear ruby color (I wish my homebrew barley wines were this red) with a thin off white head. Big citrus and floral hoppy aroma with sweet caramel underneath. Sweet flavor of caramel mixed with a light hop flavor and finishing with a big hop bitterness. Light to medium bodied.
Buckhead Panther Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This is probably closer to a british bitter or pale ale than the American variety. The same bronze color and faint head. Wondeful, flowery aroma and aggresive hops. A macho version of their Red Hills Amber. Great for lovers of assertive ales.
Buckhead Panther Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This made up for the weak Pioneer Pilsener. Ruby brown body topped with a whiff of a head, but that�s not a big deal. The aroma is sappy hops and caramel malt. The flavor has a nice grapefruit rind bitterness supported by a sweet caramel malt that makes this a pleasure to drink. A very tasty APA.
Buckhead Panther Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This was a really solid example of this style. Lots of cascade and centennial hops come through in the flavor and aroma. Nicely hoppy, with a sloid malt backbone, to keep it all balanced. Lots of zesty fruity flavors as well. Very good.
Buckhead Panther Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);A very hoppy APA. Copper color with a decent head. Orange and grapefruit citrus flavor. A bitter and refreshing aftertaste. A west coast style hopfest and an excellent beer all around.
Buckhead Panther Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Overall a decent offering by Buckhead. No real discernible difference between this and their IPAs - therein lies the rub. A little too hoppy for the style in my humble opinion. Not a bad beer - they are just starting to all taste the same. Nice copper color and hoppy flavor stays strong throughout.
Buckhead Renegade IPA;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;IPA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Looks like copper jello with khaki foam head. Hops to make you weep. Lingering hop and orange bitters on the palate. More an APA than an IPA
Buckhead Eagles Eye Oatmeal Stout;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);"Name: Eagle�s Eye Oatmeal Stout Date: 06/15/2001 Mode: Draft Source: Brewpub black, thin head, thick lace, roasted malt aroma, creamy smooth body, a bit light, lots of rich malt and coffee flavor, a touch of oily oatmeal character Aroma: 5/10; Appearance: 6/10; Flavor: 7/10; Palate: 8/10; Overall: 16/20 Rating: 3.5/5.0 Score: ***/4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The score was calculated based upon the notes and an old scoring system."
Buckhead Speakeasy Pilsener;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Best of Buckhead to date. Hoppy presentation of a Pilsener - hint of a sweetness underlying it all. Bit of a bite to it as well.
Buckhead Speakeasy Pilsener;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);What a pilsener! Very hoppy. Warming C2H5OH content. Excellent mouthfeel and trailing bittering. One of my favorites from this brewery.
Buckhead Rocky Mountain Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This was introduced to me as the seasonal at the Alpharetta location and this is the only maibock I see, so I assume this is it. This was a very typical example of this style. It was light and refreshing and easy to drink, with a modest aroma and subtle flavors. Slightly buttery in the aftertaste.
Buckhead Pioneer Pilsener;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);"Date: 06/15/2001 Mode: Draft Source: Brewpub clean clear yellow, whispy head, light fresh floral hop aroma, soft creamy character, slightly sweet flavor, light bitter finish Aroma: 5/10; Appearance: 5/10; Flavor: 7/10; Palate: 5/10; Overall: 16/20 Rating: 3.4/5.0 Score: ***/4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The score was calculated based upon the notes and an old scoring system."
Buckhead Pioneer Pilsener;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);If they�d added some more hops to this, it wouldn�t be a bad pilsner. The body is a gold with limited streaming bubbles and a decent head. The Aroma isn�t much. The flavor has a nice pilsner malt profile, although sweeter than most in the style, but it�s definitely lacking the appropriate hoppiness. A bit of peppery hops tease the nose here and there and towards the end you catch a little bitterness, but basically, it�s an extremely drinkable beer, but boring.
Buckhead Pioneer Pilsener;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);A drinkable pilsener but way below average. Cloudy off-yellow color without any real taste of anything. A perfectly good waste of water.
Buckhead Munich Dunkel;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Lager flute. Sweet, dark, boring. Looks like practically ever other beer on the premises. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. The bottom line is: an uneventful way to cap off a night of drinking.
Buckhead Munich Dunkel;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This is a REALLY good dunkel. Nice crystal clear ruby brown body that's dark to the point where you have to look to notice that it is in fact crystal clear. The head is large but not overly so and a creamy off-white. The aroma is nicely malty, chocolate and an earthy caramel. The flavor is smooth, lightly sweet and extremely drinkable. A bit of wood is mixed in with the stuff that carries over from the aroma. This is something you'd down four pints of before you realized it and still not be bored with the beer.
Buckhead Munich Dunkel;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Grassy, coffee nose with notes of 'green' fruit. Deep cola brown. Floavor is coffee, plum and somewhat tannic or acidic. The palate finishes well, because the tannic notes in the flavor suggest that a twang is coming at the end, but it dampens out well. Medium body.
New Holland Full Circle;Holland, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;New Holland Brewing Company;Nice and tranquil, but with a highly sweet palate. Like a beautiful moonlit night, in mosquito season

New Holland Full Circle;Holland, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;New Holland Brewing Company;Straw color with very little head. Flavors of bread and spice. Moderately bitter.
New Holland Full Circle;Holland, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;New Holland Brewing Company;If you are already drunk, this beer tastes fine. However, if this is your first beer of the night, it may taste and smell like vomit. That�s how I have felt about this beer the times that I have had it. Personally not a fan.
New Holland Full Circle;Holland, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;New Holland Brewing Company;Draft to pint glass. Yellow in color and fair amount of head on the pour, which then recedes to a thin layer. Aroma and taste is of lighten sweetened grains, where the body is light and carbonation is light-medium. It�s a good drinker when reasonably priced.
New Holland Full Circle;Holland, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;New Holland Brewing Company;On tap at First Draft Taproom & Kitchen. Clear golden to yellow in appearance with a white head. Aroma of bread, grains and light floral/herbal hops. Similar flavor, light and crisp with a mild bittersweet finish. A solid K�lsch overall.
New Holland Full Circle;Holland, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;New Holland Brewing Company;Bottle, Ann Arbor, MI. Hazy pale yellow. Herbal apple aroma sharp citrus. Muted flavor. Bright citrus. Yeasty finish.
New Holland Full Circle;Holland, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;New Holland Brewing Company;Aroma is fruity, apple, grassy, some wheat. Appearance is pale golden, clear, white head. Taste is wheat, corn, metallic, earthy hops, slightly fruity, dry. Mouthfeel is light body, light crisp carbonation, metallic wheat and slight fruit aftertaste. Overall, not especially kolschy but better than expected.
New Holland Full Circle;Holland, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;New Holland Brewing Company;On tap @ Mudville 9. This is a crystal clear looking, golden colored one - only a little slowly islandy white head in the top. Smells like your average sweetish fruity pilsner really. Green apples and a little bit of peach if I have to say anything. Tastes absolutely drinkable. Could of course be the fact that I�m really thirsty though. It�s thin oily on the mouthfeel and it�s just about average on the small bubbled carbonation. A bit more fruity peaches at first, then it turns really grainy and cerealish toward the finish. I�m sure it wouldn�t taste as good as this if I wasn�t as thirsty as I am right now. 22.06.2015
Brimstone Honey Red;Easton, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);355ml bottle pours amber in color with a finger of white head that leaves some thin spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is caramel and light roasted malts with some mild hops. Taste is light caramel malty sweetness with hints of chocolate and some earthy hop bitterness. A decent amber ale that I somewhat enjoyed, but may have been an old bottle.
Brimstone Honey Red;Easton, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Had this ber on 9/14/1999. Aroma is a highly sweet malt and honey scent. Color is an amber/orange. Taste is malty rich, with a sweet honey flavor.
Brimstone Honey Red;Easton, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);One of the best beers I have had in months. I ussually don't like honey beers, but this one has just a slight taste of honey and is a very balanced red beer. Very very good! A+

I don�t understand why nobody rated this since 2003, when I saw a lot of sixpacks at �t drankurgel (a liquor-store in Eindhoven, Netherlands...) taste is like an alcoholfree beer.
Borealis Iceberg Beer;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Has a golden brown color some carbonation and a sweet malt smell. Taste was light malt and finished with a little watery bitterness. Overall for a $3 6-pack, this stuff is great. I bought it in the 6-pack box so no light was able to spoil the beer.
Borealis Iceberg Beer;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Eh. Clear bottle, which isn't a good sign. Pours a nice clear golden brown, with a thick whitish head. Aroma smells like it's in the preliminary stages of skunking, but still alright. Just starting to. A little sourness. It actually smells like a golden ale, and tastes like one too. Slightly estery and sweet, more like an ale. Light bodied, effervescent. I guess it's ok, but I won't get it again. Boring.
Borealis Iceberg Beer;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Nauseating. Smelled like a stagnant pond. I Drank half the bottle. It's all i could take.
Borealis Iceberg Beer;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;No head, no aroma,light blond color.Clear.Tastes corny,pastey.Oh well.......
Borealis Iceberg Beer;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;transparent golden colour, aroma of a danish strong lager (translation: bad), flavor of an ice-beer (same translation as before) - avoid this stuff even if you're very thirsty
Borealis Iceberg Beer;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;"A dark golden color, with a medium head. Slight lace. Minimal aroma - faint paper. Some body, but no flavor. Maybe my ""buds"" have been numbed by the Trois Pistoles. No really nothing there. Where's the Malt? Sure it's balanced, but so is water."
Scottish Pub Blonde;Fribourg, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Scottish Pub;pale blond colour, few creamy head, nice lace, malty, medium hop aroma, smooth and fresh, low carbonation, robust with a late bitter kick, long dry malty finish - looks like a mix between an ale and a pilsner - pleasant
Scottish Pub Blonde;Fribourg, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Scottish Pub;Blond ale, misty. Some nice hop aroma. Light carbonation, good mouth, good malt taste, nice hop balance, lightly sweet. Good hop palate. Beers of Switzerland

Murky whitish yellow with small white foamy head, strong citric acid aroma, low carbonation, sweetish citrus taste, medium finish with lemon peel aftertaste. Drinkable, but barely.
Grottes Blanche;Geneva, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brasseur des Grottes;Pale white, hazy. Definitely a wit. Coriander, citrus. Even some camomile. Soft on the palate. Light and easy. Does have a noticable bitterness, so i wouldnt count it as a coriander lemonade, even though easy to swallow. A bit thin. -- rated with �lankku� (N9)
Grottes Blanche;Geneva, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brasseur des Grottes;From tap at the brewpub. Pours hazy yellow with a small, dense and white head.

Grottes Ambr�e;Geneva, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;Butterscotch, butter. Heavily caramel, a bit like a scottish ale, but just a lot more. Quite drinkable though. Probably the best of what geneva�s craft scene has to offer. Smells like toffee candy, dr �tkers. A nice bitterness to balance. Finish is a bit dry and fading. -- rated with �lankku� (N9)
Grottes Ambr�e;Geneva, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;From tap at the brewpub. Pours hazy darkorangeto amber brown with a small off-white head.

Grottes Ambr�e;Geneva, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;"Amber ale, misty, nice head. Light malt aroma, but somehow rancid.

Grottes Blonde;Geneva, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;Tap. Bright, clear yellow color with a thin white head. Light graininess and some faint grassy hops in the aroma. Touch of maltiness about it in the body, grassy hop (very light) finish. Thinner body and dry finish. Just bland overall, and didn�t care for some of the graininess.
Grottes Blonde;Geneva, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;Clear golden with a medium white head. Sweet aroma with malty, caramel and mild hoppy notes. Flavour was malty with grassy hops and hints of caramel. Finished dry and bitter.
Grottes Blonde;Geneva, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;On tap at the brewpub. Clear golden, creamy white head. Malty all the way, semi-dry finish. The beer lacks any class, and so does the brewpub that serves it.
Grottes Blonde;Geneva, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;Bottle. Very grainy with big clumps of yeast in amber colour and fine head. Fine spicey beer some sweetness.
Grottes Blonde;Geneva, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;From tap at the brewpub. Pours clear and highly carbonated yellow with a dense and white head. Aroma is mild acidic and fruity. Flavour has the same fruity and acidic off note. Quite dominant but not unpleasant. Vague smoke infection touch into the finish. Lasting fruity impression.

Grottes Blonde;Geneva, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasseur des Grottes;"Gold ale, misty, nice head. Light malt and hop aroma, lightly fruity. Full mouth, some malt, dryish, correctly balanced, some hop, the bitterness reminds the abricot almond; the same particular flavour outstands in the palate, enough aromatic and quite long.

Heineken Cold Filtered;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;20cl from tap. Heineken wasn�t the best pilsener (to say the least) but this one is really rediculous! No added anything at all. Just marketing...
Heineken Cold Filtered;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;horrible like drinking fizzy water, would nt even drink this if it was free.
Shenandoah Leatherneck Wheat Beer;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Light pale yellow with no head. Sparse aroma...some wheat but not much. Smooth taste...like a light beer. Nothing special about this. Very uninteresting, as Aubry puts it.
Shenandoah Leatherneck Wheat Beer;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Sweet and sugary smelling nose. Entirely headless. Looked like a glass of apple cider. Sticky malt with an under-fermented flavor to it (seemed to contain unfermented fermentables). Easy to swallow, but I suppose that doesn�t necessarily mean anything � good or bad. Didn�t have a whole lot of flavor, or much of a mouthfeel for that matter. No interesting yeast flavors to talk about either. Overall, an uninteresting wheat beer, which would most likely fall under the diverse and vague category, American Wheat.

Fish Tale River Run Organic Rye Ale;Olympia, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Clear pale yellow color with a white head. Initially a cheap pilsner aroma, but developed more honey and spice aromas as it warmed. Spicy hops flavor, with a smokey aftertaste. Fairly thin, bubbly feel.
Fish Tale River Run Organic Rye Ale;Olympia, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Pale yellow color with a small white head. The aroma was, at first, that of a cheap lager. Later, it became more malty sweet with a nice spicy hops character. The flavor was an interesting mix of malty sweetness and spicy hops...with a distinct smoky aftertaste. Soft feel...medium thin consistency.
Fish Tale River Run Organic Rye Ale;Olympia, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;I can't say this is a favorite of mine but it isn't to bad a brew.Nice reddish amber color,Aroma was malty and little else to this untrained nose.The taste was pretty decent with a malty start,an almost spicy flavor some hops thrown in there as well.I got kind of a sweet,hoppy,earthy after taste from this one still it was pretty good and my first organic brew to boot.I don't know if it will be a brew that i will frequent but if it's around i won't turn it down.
Fish Tale River Run Organic Rye Ale;Olympia, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;The beer pours a hazy �Organic� yellow orange color, the head portly in size, creamy in texture and the color a very light tan, with the lace a thick covering sheet to seal off the glass. Malt aromas weigh heavy in the nose, earthy, with a certain mustiness that is common in organic beers, crisp and fresh, and a real treat for the schnozzle. Begins malt and lightly sweet, the mouth feel is middling, the finish has a light hop spicy bite, the carbonation tolerable and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. A fine drinking beer, one that would set well in any location, but with summer coming faster than I�d like a good Arizona Summer Beer.
Fish Tale River Run Organic Rye Ale;Olympia, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;My first impression was that this was a horrible pilsner. As the beer warmed, I could taste a fuller malty presence and I noticed yeast floating around in the beer. No huge rye taste present. A n ok beer, but not something I''ll drink again.

Bighorn;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Disgusting brew, cheaply made beer sold to bums and low income people in dodgy liquor stores. The beer itself is only found in cans and has a stale musky taste that is potent. Not reccommended at all. Stay away from this beer in New Zealand

Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Really good beer when you have had a few of another style and you get to the point where you don�t even think about the taste. Cheap
Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);do us a favour Independent Breweries, stop making and selling beer that tastes like its been made in a swimming pool then laced with metallic slag. brought an 18 pack of this crap for $25 at pak n save, drank only 6 cans and biffed the rest, disgusting ended up buying some panheads instead which is far better tasting albeit more expensive.
Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Can from Waiheke Wine Centre on 20 November 2018. Not as bad as I was expecting.
Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Enormous thanks to Kre�o for lugging this all the way from New Zealand! The can got battered in transport and half of it was spilled through a tiny puncture. It still retained some carbonation when it was opened, so yay there. Will rerate if possible at some point. Anyway, poured a deep amber body, quite nice, traces of a white head. Mild sweetish plum jam and rubber notes in the aroma mingling with a dry graininess. Doesn�t smell bad, only a bit industrial. The taste... ah.. yeah, the same vague mild fruity sweetness, light rubber, over a more or less characterless body, a mild touch of tartness. Vague herbal notes, absolutely no bitterness. Certainly slightly more character than expected from a 4% macro lager, but it�s still very much an industrial 4% lager, with, perhaps, a touch more complex grain bill than normally.
Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);after an earlier lovely porter this was as expected not that good 440ml can smells bit grainy malty taste is mostly caramel malt & water
Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);"440ml can of beer for macho men, it appears. Pours amber with a large foamy off-white head. Plenty of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma: light mix of bready malts and herbal hops; a bit floral. Flavor: Mild; good balance although it is sweet up front and mildly bitter by the finish. The hops dominate eventually in the mildly bitter and hoppy aftertaste. Feel: medium-light body; very smooth; good, very soft medium-high carbonation. O: a decent but unremarkable NZ beer."
Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Cheap beer, poor taste not much can be said about it, try it to see what you think don�t expect a lot from it...
Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Can. A dark golden beer with a fluffy off-white head. The aroma has notes of metal, malt, and caramel. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, metal, and straw. The body is light.
Ranfurly Draught;Papakura, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Clear golden with a small short lasting head. Somewhat fruity hops in the nose along with hints of malt. Flavor was somewhat rotten with yeast flaws and caramel.

B�re-Br�u Triple;Bern, Switzerland;Tripel;B�re-Br�u;Dark brown color. Fudgey, light chocolate in the nose with evident alcohol. The body is sweet and smooth, but not in a good way. Much too much alcohol evident.
B�re-Br�u Triple;Bern, Switzerland;Tripel;B�re-Br�u;Muddy brown. Aroma of pear brandy and other fruits. Lots of alcohol. Fat alcohol tang on the tongue, light plastic notes. I'd like a more developed malt/hop interplay to distract me from the alcohol assault, but worth trying.
B�re-Br�u Triple;Bern, Switzerland;Tripel;B�re-Br�u;Colour of dark tea with few foam. It has an aroma of peat, syrah and honey. The flavour is a mix of acidity and sweetness. The finish is strong and smokey. A complex and very pleasant beer.
B�re-Br�u Triple;Bern, Switzerland;Tripel;B�re-Br�u;Nut brown, pours thick with almost no head. Big unusual marzipan aroma. Malty and sweet, vinuous, almond flavours. Dry finish. A superb, rich, balanced and complex beer.
B�re-Br�u Triple;Bern, Switzerland;Tripel;B�re-Br�u;"re-rate 05/18/02: (one year old bottle) The sweetness is now balanced by a nice bitterness. It shows a powerfull alcohol presence. 03/17/02: dark brown colour, few head, nice lace, impressive aroma: dark fruits and hoppy with notes of licorice and a touch of caramel; the flavour does not live up to its aroma and lacks of balance (this beer is probably too young), very sweet; the finish is dry and long with notes of alcohol - warming and showing a great potentiel (I really would like to try it in 3-5 years) but lacks of balance right now."
B�re-Br�u Triple;Bern, Switzerland;Tripel;B�re-Br�u;This beer has a beautiful clear brown colour with few foam. Its aroma is superb, thick with nutty notes. It is robust, full-bodied, powerful with maybe too much alcohol presence. The aftertaste is very long, strong and full of alcohol.

Hood Canal Breidablik Barley Wine;Kingston, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hood Canal Brewery;Draft at the Collection. How the f do you say that name? Dark clear copper. Cheap raisin and cleaning product aroma. Astringent raisin and lots of cleaning product in flavor.

Hood Canal Breidablik Barley Wine;Kingston, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hood Canal Brewery;12 oz bottle courtesy of brewolf. Thanks. Pours a dark amber-brown color with a small beige head that quickly dissipates to a fine film. The aroma is dark fruits, hot sherry and a bit of toffee. The flavor was more toffee, roasted walnuts, dates and some more of that hot sweet sherry. The palate was full and smooth with soft carbonation. Finished long and sticky sweet. Overall: A rather complex little beast of a barley wine and not a bad one at all.

Deep, dark ruby amber with a dense, foamy head. Fruit and caramel malts on the nose � definitely on the sweeter side � with some booze and a mild hop contingent to counter.

Thick, full mouthfeel. Slightly boozy, slightly sticky� with some acetyl on the finish. Nice.
