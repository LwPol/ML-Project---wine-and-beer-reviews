Full Sail Wassail;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Full Sail Brewing Company;Old ass bottle. Poured a brownish color with a medium sized off white head. Toasted malts, earthy, and definitely showing its age.
Full Sail Wassail;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Full Sail Brewing Company;nutty toasty aroma. Flavor is resin, vanilla, and clove. Palate is medium bodied with moderate hop bitterness. Smooth and easy drinking, could be a session brew. Slight raisin in the finish. Reminds me of Magic hat #9 slightly in memory. I bought a sixer and was willing to take my meds if this wasn't good, but it turned out pretty solid. Nice brew.

Full Sail Wassail;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Full Sail Brewing Company;12 oz bottle into a La Chouffe stemmed tulip glass on 8th Jan 2018, while on holiday in California. Dark mahogany body, beige crown on top. Malts to the fore here, in both the nose and taste, sweet malty molasses with caramel and light coffee flavours blend together nicely before a mild hop finish. My sweet tooth really took to it.
Full Sail Wassail;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle in Seattle. Dark amber brown, mostly clear, small head. Nice roasty malt aroma, solid English character. Dark ale sip, nicely metallic and slightly burnt malt. Cool character distracts some, I'd love this a little fuller bodied. Amber bitterness. Quite nice.

Full Sail Wassail;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Full Sail Brewing Company;"Aroma: sweet and malty; Appearance: dark amber with thin white head that dissipates slowly; Taste: follows nose with dry, strong notes; Palate: heavy body with long, sweet finish; Overall: almost too sweet but underlying dryness saves it; will probably not get again, however."
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;A little old perhaps, couldn�t tell the date. Aroma is a little dusty, but the flavor was solid. Nutty, earthy with light caramel toast and fruit.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Dark bronze, clear with yellow foam. Raisins, toffee in the aroma. Sweet, toffee, fruit with strong metalic bitterness in the aftertaste and a hint of alcohol.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Clear bright penny copper with a thin foamy white top. Big lovely toffee pale english malt on the aroma with a slight grassiness. Smooth and slightly bitter flavor, perhaps the most bitter ESB I�ve had in a while (not that bitter overall but probably similar to how true Brits taste ESBs back in the day) with quite a bit of grassy hop flavor, English Marris otter pale malt biscuitiness, and a smoot nutty finish with a quiet grassy bitterness on the aftertaste.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours a deep dark orange color, some off-white head, not much lacing. Aroma is caramel malt and faint floral hops. Flavor is crisp and bitter, with a malty aftertaste. The palate feels thick and chewy. Look out, this one packs a wallop.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Appearance: pours a 1"" off white head that falls quickly with just a hint of lacing. Color is mostly clear copper with mild streaming carbonation. Aroma: malt dominate -- bread dough and a bit of toffee. Hops are floral with a little citrus rind as well. Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied with a fluffy ale mouthfeel. Finish is dry and somewhat boozy. Flavor: toasted bread, toffee, raisin and other ripe fruit. WIth a lingering floral, citrus rind, and even a bit of pine hops. Overall: a very good and enjoyable ESB -- although the 6.5% is a little high as the BJCP guidelines top out at 6.2% -- thus the beer is a little too boozy and would be limited for sessionability."
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle. Amber-brown beer with a tan head. Caramel and light citrus aroma. Caramel and citrus flavor with light woodsiness. Medium bodied. Caramel and citrus lingers with light earth and light toffee.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;"Pours a clear coppery color with off-white head.

Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium to dark amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (cookie, caramel, biscuit), lightly to moderately hoppy (apricot, flowers), lightly yeasty (dough), with notes of toffee and black tea. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. My second sampling of this and happily it�s as good as my first impression...it looks like someone actually put some effort into this one, which is becoming rarer and rarer at Full Sail sadly. It�s enticingly cookie-ish and apricotty, and while it starts sweet (in a nice lip-smackin� way), there�s quite a bit of apparent bitterness in the finish (only 35 IBU, really?), so it�s quite delightful to drink.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle from Fred Meyer. Clear pure amber in color. Lightly sweet earthy hop nose. Clean earthy hop flavors. A good spicy bitter hop finish. Fairly rich malty flavor with some good earthy hop notes.

Full Sail Pilsner (-2006);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Full Sail Brewing Company;Tap at Hood River brewery. Light to medium golden in color, clear. Very attractive white fluffy head forms and fades a bit too quickly. No lacing. Aroma is nicely hopped moderately spicey/earthy. Light toasted malt.

Full Sail Pilsner (-2006);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Full Sail Brewing Company;On tap at the full sail brewery. Pours a golden yellow with a small white head. Very smooth flavor with a grassy quality to it and some nice simple light malts. Slight fruitiness to the aroma and taste but very faint, quite a nice easy drinking summer brew.
Full Sail Pilsner (-2006);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Full Sail Brewing Company;light gold color, light fizzy head. Crisp fruity aroma, light malt but not much. The flavor is well balanced for a pils and drinks surprisingly well. I really like this one. It's well built which is hard to find these days in this style but still lacking like most in this style.
Full Sail Pilsner (-2006);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Full Sail Brewing Company;Deep amber, orange color with a slim white head. Decent aroma. Some malt and a hint of wheat, but that's about it. Fairly smooth taste and kind of watered down. A fairly average Pils. Nothing really to write home about.
Full Sail Pilsner (-2006);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Full Sail Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewery. Light clear yellow. Good lemon and wheaty aroma with a sizable malt presence. Fresh and light, while still frothy makes a good pilsner, one of my favorites.

Full Sail Old Boardhead Barleywine;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;From Nov 2007 his is the 2006 vintage and I got it in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! This pours from 22oz bottle a cloudy orange amber with a small head of foam with some lacing. Not much foam to shrink down to but there's still a fine layer as I near the end of my session. The smell has notes of caramel malt, hops, and some spice. The taste at first sip is hugely malty. Lots of nice caramel flavour permeate my every taste bud. Next sip brings the hoppy goodness with notes of floral hops and some grapefruit and some nice fruity tones both dark and not so dark.(plum and apricot) And boy are they working well together as in, this puppy is really well balanced! You love hoppy brews, this one is for you. You love malty brews, ditto. It has a medium bordering on full mouthfeel and it's lightly carbonated. It finishes slightly bitter but there's still a good malt presence there as well. And I'm sipping on it straight from the fridge! Time to set it aside and let it warm up a bit, methinks. (about a half hour later) As it warmed up, all the flavours became more intense but I still find it very drinkable. Very nice BWSA and one I'd drink again with no qualms.
Full Sail Old Boardhead Barleywine;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;Originally rated on 1/26/09. i liked this barley wine because of the balance. It had enough hops to give it a decent aroma and some complexity to the taste, but enough sweet malts to compliment. Neither one was overwhelming or overbearing. Alcohol was well hidden and it had a good mouthfeel, not too thick or thin. Overall i Thought it was pretty good, and i would try it again
Full Sail Old Boardhead Barleywine;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;Over carbonated. Malty. A little barrel. Lots of barrel nose. Sweet and over carbonated. Meh ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Full Sail Old Boardhead Barleywine;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;Really nice, aged well. Dry, not too heavy. Slight medicinal aftertaste. Hides the booze well.
Full Sail Old Boardhead Barleywine;Hood River, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Full Sail Brewing Company;"22 oz bottle of 2011 Reserve served in a Belgian snifter. The hazy brown body is topped by a thin weak head that leaves minimal lacing. Fruity appealing aroma with some biscuit and remarkably little evidence of alcohol. There�s little sign of the alcohol upon tasting either ... at first; but eventually the alcohol builds and the finish and aftertaste are actually rather boozy. While the boozy finish detracts from the flavor it is overall good enough, and complex enough, to deserve a 8. More hops than expected for this style. Feel: light carbonation in a medium-light body with obvious alcohol warming."

Full Sail Main Sail Stout;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;Full Sail Brewing Company;Should be listed as a dry stout. Hard to discern aroma (at brewery). Pours a clear very dark brown with a large creamy head. Comes off very smooth with incredible malt support from a style that rarley has such a thing. Taste and finish is dominated by roasted/burnt flavors, I'm guessing from chocolate malts (?). Certainly not the best beer from Full Sail (we all know what THAT one is!) but quite unique within its style.

NorWester Oregon Pale Ale;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);An alright appearance to this one with decent white head. Nose is lightly hoppy and...is there a note of peach or some other sweet fruit? It's a LITTLE too subtle...more aroma strength would be of great benefit. Flavor has that same hint of fruit that I just can't place. Not too hoppy or bitter...in fact, other than the fruit note, there's not much at all. This beer desperately needs some depth to make it better.
NorWester Oregon Pale Ale;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Mine had a slight metallic nose and taste...contaminated?...................

The body contained soft carbonation, was other and dark yellow orange in color. Its aroma contained notes of mild bready aroma with a wheat note . Its mouth feel is initially tingly with a lingering tingly palate and a smooth aftertaste. Its flavor contained malt wheat bready notes.
NorWester HefeWeizen;Portland, United States;Wheat Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);(12 oz bottle: Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) Not a lot of wheat flavor, more just a generic, cheap micro-wheat. Light sweetness, minimal hops. Seems to be a bit past its prime though, as I�m picking up a bit of breadiness, plus some cardboard in the finish. And actually, the nose is sweet and bready as well. Light-to-medium in body. The color is a muddy golden and kind of sickly looking. The small, fizzy, whitish head dissipated rapidly down to a small ring. Not very good.
NorWester HefeWeizen;Portland, United States;Wheat Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Not a great hefeweizen, Far too carbonated, produces a biting acid on the tongue, I don�t like that aspect, the aroma is a little weak as well. On a positive note, it does taste pretty decent, although bland. I don�t think I would get this one again.

NorWester HefeWeizen;Portland, United States;Wheat Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz bottle. Slightly murky medium yellow color, some yeast particles visibly floating. Light sweet grainy lemon and wheat flavor, a little bit like plastic, or perhaps the bottle that I�m tasting. Drinkable, refreshing and sweet, but not the ideal hefe.

NorWester Raspberry Weizen;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Looks perfectly fine so thats why i bought this old bottle. Has head and clear appearance. Smell is dead with nothing to smell but flavor is the same with only a light berry syrup taste.
NorWester Raspberry Weizen;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);This is hard to find in my area but a friend brought me a bottle and I enjoyed it. The pyrimid beers are notbad at all and I love friut and lambic brews. They are not in the blucreek or lindmans catagory but a pleasent drink that is mild. I could taste the rasberry but may have not been able to pinpoint it if it did not say what is was on the bottle. In any case a good beer but I like Purple Haze better.
NorWester Raspberry Weizen;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Regular medium yellow wheat appearance. Nose and flavor are syrupy sugared raspberries. Really similar to Thomas Kemper�s berry wheat. Fizzy, though not too thin. What else can you say about it other than ""It�s a fruit beer""."
NorWester Raspberry Weizen;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Hazy yellow, head thick and mildy pinked. Nose grassy and sweet, raspberry is restrained. Good raspberry in the flavor, not overpowering or cloying, balances nicely with lemon and clove. Refreshing.

Aroma is medium sweet, raspberry, lemon, some caramel, light wheat. Taste is medium sweet, raspberry that seems somewhat artificial, light lemon, finishing pleasant raspberry. Light body, some tartness. Sorry, but I just don't see the point.
NorWester Raspberry Weizen;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Had from bottle on May 16, 2003 An interesting beer - pours with the standard hazy yellow for wheat beers and has a small head. The aroma is slightly fruity but nothing to write home about. The taste is good - tart, but not too much so with a hint of other citrus flavors. I enjoyed the beer, but if I'm going to drink a fruit beer, I'll stick with the Krieks and Lambics. I love hefeweizens, but not too sure about fruit-weizen combos. Very drinkable however, and would be a great beer for a hot day in the sun. Also good if you're eating something sweet - the tartness would be a perfect contrast.
NorWester Raspberry Weizen;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);a good sweet fruit beer for desert. hazy amber stuff with some floaties. not much in the sweert aroma but the taste is pure raspberry, syrupy sweet yet tart. nice clean crisp palate from the wheat base. one of the better wheat+fruit beers out there
NorWester Raspberry Weizen;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at Yard House: Looks like grapefruit juice.

NorWester Smith Rock Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Very cloudy amber appearance with a 1 centimetre thick tan head. Thick pour, it appears to be full-bodied. Aroma is sweet and spicey...a pretty good representation to the style and exactly what you'd expect from a bock. Equally strong in the burnt sugars (caramel, toffee) as well as the malt and spiceyness...pumpkins, cloves and nutmeg are present. Medium-bodied; Strong initial flavour of malt and spices as well as that sugar! The carbonation was at a minimum and the head has completely dissipated now (less than 2 minutes). Aftertaste a bit spicey and definately flavoured with malt. Overall, a pretty good Bock, and since I don't like the style...that is saying quite a bit! Worth a try if you can get your hands on it...and i'm really not sure how I found it! I bought my twelve ounce bottle at Chevy Chase Wines & Spirits in Washington, D.C."

Dry, papery caramel malt aroma with a hint of herbal/resin bitterness, honey-clover sweetness as it warms.

Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rogue Ales;Bottle from Morimoto restaurant. Musty aroma with slight hops. Pleasant fruity taste. Enough of a hop bite to hide the booziness. Bready. Good!
Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rogue Ales;"From Dec 2005 Poured from bottle(room temp) a clear medium gold with a large head that dissipated slowly. The smell is pretty subdued with faint hints of hops and that overall ""pilsner"" aroma. The taste is a very pungent bitterness up front that makes my mouth pucker...I kid you not! Mid way, the bitterness settles down and becomes more of a citrusy flavour that carries through to the aftertaste. And...I find the alcohol in this imperial definitely noticeable but not in the ""Malt Liquor"" kind of way; it's soothing, and would be welcome on a cold winter's night. If you add up what I just wrote, you might think that I don't favour this brew all that much but guess what? I liked it enough to say to myself, I'm buying this one again."
Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rogue Ales;Sampled at SBWF. No carbonation or head. Very opaque. Green aple aroma and raw hops. Big bitter bite that lingers and some hop taste. Medium body.
Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rogue Ales;On tap @ Rogue SF. Pours clear dark golden with thin creamy off-white head that laces well. Aroma is light sweet pils malt, with a slight corn note throughout. Dry, floral hops on the back. Taste is a big sweet light-bodied malt, boozy and thick. Same floral hops, though they really get overwhelmed by the hefty malt bill. Lingers slightly bitter on the finish. Pretty good as imperial pilsners go.

Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rogue Ales;One strange brew, this pours a cloudy, headless murky pale gold. Aroma is nice and malty with a sweetness and some floral hop. Flavor is initial malt and some honey up front (nice), but quickly hits with a bitter/astringent bite mid-sip that lasts through the finish and leaves the throat dry.
Rogue Irish Style Lager;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Rogue Ales;An okay lager. Pours dark gold, has a thickish body and a balancing bready sweetness. Tried for the first time in 2010.
Rogue Irish Style Lager;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Rogue Ales;From Mar 2006 Poured from bottle(room temp) a clear medium gold with a large head of foam that dissipated slowly. The smell is of sweet malt. Kind of typical of a macro lager. The taste is also of sweet malt but there's a sourness there as well that does nothing to help with the taste of this lager. I find it *very* ordinary and I'm a *big* fan of Rogue products so there is *no* anti bias associated with this review. Bottom line: It's a Rogue product but don't let their reputation sway you into trying this lager. It's just not worth it.

Rogue McRogue Scotch Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Rogue Ales;This one stunned me. Found an unintentionally aged 8 year old bottle and expected the worst. Somehow this is still pretty solid. It pours chestnut brown with a beige head. It has a fairly full body with a bit of soft carbonation. It has lots of toffee, caramel, richness and a little on the sweet side. There is some oxidation, but its not much and extremely less than I'd expect for an 8 year old scotch ale. Pleasant surprise.

Rogue Mogul Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rogue Ales;On tap at Union 613. Hazy dark amber with a decent cream head (full disclosure - drunk out of a mason jar...but it worked). Matly sweetness, caramel, bit of toffee, some grapefruit rind and apricot but semi fermented, hints of spice. Moderate+ body, moderate carbonation, semi-sweet, smooth, alcohol is well balanced, becomes slightly dry and then you get an interesting play between the bitterness of the hops and the sweeter malts on the finish. Good.

A hoppier version of the style, but a nice diversion from the ordinary.

Rogue XS Old Crustacean Barleywine;Newport, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rogue Ales;From Jan 2006 Poured from 750ml bottle(room temp) a dark clear gold with a smallish head that dissipates quickly leaving just a fine layer with little lacing. The smell has a very sweet malty nose and there's also an obvious air of alcohol mixed in there but then, this *is* a BWSA so I expected that. The taste is huge! Lots of malt up front but a more than abundant note of hops(it's 120IBUs) comes into play and takes over and never relinquishes. If the malt had kept up with the infusion of hops, I'd have certainly rated this one higher than I did. Overall, this isn't exactly the most well balanced Barleywine Style Ale but I do find it a quite enjoyable brew to sip on. I recommend it.
Rogue XS Old Crustacean Barleywine;Newport, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rogue Ales;Sampled at SBWF. Small head and a clear golden color. Complex aroma and a very appealing taste. A bit alcohol in the taste but at 11.5 % it is expected. A smooth chocolate taaste.

Rogue Dry Hopped St. Rogue Red Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rogue Ales;This is the first Rogues that I tried about 3-4 years ago, and after sampling many others from them, still one of my favorites. Not overwhelmingly red, if that makes sense, and a little more hoppy than most....something to do with dry-hopping? Was also the first dry-hopped beer that I sampled. I stopped buying it though cause it's a little pricey for something that's only 5.2%, plus I've been trying to sample new things. It's still worth the price because it's one of the smoothest and crispiest red ales out there. I've been sampling some of Lagunitas Red Ales lately and love those too, but this I'd say is a little better, not as strong though.
Rogue Dry Hopped St. Rogue Red Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rogue Ales;From Nov 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle(room temp) a clear red with a large head of foam that shrank slowly leaving a solid layer with some lacing. The smell is an abundant nose of sweet caramel malt. The taste is sweet caramel malt up front with some grain and just a touch of hop bitterness near and through the finish making it a sample of the style that I can enjoy and revisit without hesitation. Bottom line: Another tasty brew from Rogue that I can recommend.

Rogue Dry Hopped St. Rogue Red Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rogue Ales;Bought in a 22 oz. bomber. Perhaps I obtained an old bottle or it may be that I simply cannot connect with this one. I do not know. It pours a nice dark amber with a fantastic egg shell foam that lasts a good long while. Drops down from there.Scent is malty with a bit of woodiness. The beer tastes of biscuit and a light hop tone that leaves quickly. I detect a dryness with a slight bitterness at the end. Hard to try this one again.

After Taste: Dry. Very toasty piney oozy and strong bitter to mouth. Comments: I bought this one as an afterthought, with so many nice Xmas beer in place already and I am not really a fan of Rogue. Surprise!

Rogue Smoke Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rogue Ales;"From May 2007 This pours a clear amber with a very small head of foam that shrinks to just some scattering in the middle and has very little lacing. The smell is a light malty nose with some hoppiness. The taste on first sip has a good caramel malt flavour that is followed up quickly by some citrusy hop bitterness. Not much smoke that I can note except maybe in the finish. Further sips in and the smoke becomes more noticeable but, imho, it doesn't seem to ""mesh"" too well with the malt and hops. The mouthfeel is good except near the finish where it borders on being watery and the carbonation is fairly substantial. Bottom line: I think it's pretty good but it's not something I'd drink on a regular rotation. Try it and see what you think."
Rogue Smoke Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rogue Ales;From old tasting notes. Hazy reddish brown color. Creamy beige head. Smoky chocolate malt nose.

I smell the smoke, of course, and the first taste is the same. That comes with some coffee and a bit of chocolate. Also something earthy. Tobacco perhaps. Variety is good but Ill take an imperial stout or porter over this.
Rogue Smoke Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rogue Ales;BB log, 12 oz Bottle, pours amber with one finger head.

Saxer JackFrost Winter Doppelbock;Portland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);94 keg, tapped at Fredfest 09 at Hair of the Dog. Pours murky dark brown with a very brief nod in the direction of having a tan creamy head. Big doughy sweet malt nose--toffee, caramel, nuts and biscuit. Creamy, slightly sticky body. Lots of different sweet and more neutral/savory malts duking it out across the mid-palate: caramel, cookie dough, toffee, nuts, biscuit, toast, then finally at the end, some sharp dark resin to resolve against all that. Very lovely beer that obviously never quite found its niche among the cognoscenti. Of course, 15-year-old expressions arent just lying around all the time for everyone to drink, especially given this was from the first batch.
Saxer JackFrost Winter Doppelbock;Portland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);OK, I havent had this beer for 2 or 3 years, but when I think about it almost every week I have to rate it. Saxer and Tony Gomes got me hooked on Dopplebock. Ive tried all the benchmark beers and cant understand why they are labeled benchmark when this beer is the one I dream of! Smooth sweet malt with no edges. High octane without recognizing it. Great all malt nose that leaves you yearning for that first sip. Overall, I cant think of another beer Id rather have on a deserted island than this one, or perhaps, Tonys Pilsener.
Saxer JackFrost Winter Doppelbock;Portland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);I was lucky enough to get a bottle of this with some signifigant age on it. It was at least 2 years old, possibly 3 or even 4. Which ever it was, it was a nice beer with some good malty sweetness to it. The nose is a bit of wet cardboard, some whiskey notes, brown sugar and prune juice. Appearance is a deep woody brown, barley any head at all. Mouthfeel is slightly thick. Flavor is alcohol, caramel malts, and a touch winey. A nice beer for a nice cold December night playing Rock Band.
Saxer JackFrost Winter Doppelbock;Portland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);This beer produces a hearty aroma of nuts and hops. It is copper in color with and an off-white head. It touches the tongue as a thin solution producing and sweet nutty taste on the palate that lingers well after swallowing.
Saxer JackFrost Winter Doppelbock;Portland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);A bit of a one-trick pony...all sweet malt toffee and caramel...alcohol pretty well hidden...a bit thinner than I like in a doppel...but pretty drinkable. Id revisit this one again.
Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);I used to enjoy this beer very much, it was one of my favorites- before getting serious into tasting. 1997: I remember this beer having a clean finish but having a moderate body of roasted malts. Light clear brown in color. I miss it.

Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle 2002 vintage poured a clear reddish brown with a lingering ring of amber foam. Aromas of wet cardboard, cinnamon, molasses, dates, fig and light carmel. Palate was light bodied and crisp nwith a smooth finish. Flavors of carmel, spice, fig, mollasses and a hint of cardboard with a smooth lingering malty spiced finish.
Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);bottle. ugly pour, looks like prune juice mixed with quik with hardly any head, just kind of filmy with a ring of bubbles around the glass. smells like sugar babies, grape taffy, and a bit of smoke with just a cupful of cardboard. how old is this thing? definitely has an oxidized flavor, caramel, soft wood, a bit of plum/prune. not a bad beer, but it seems like this would have better fresh. 1 6 6 2 12 apparently it is an 02 bottle.
Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);This was my first Dark Bock, but its smoother then I expected. Alittle sweet but not over powering.Well balanced so you cant taste the Alcohol..Very good
Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);First Saxer from the great beer state of Oregon. Dark, hoppy, little sweet undertone. Chocolately, very nice beer. PNW hasnt disappointed yet. A little watery for what I was expecting. Overall a very good beer. Again, if this is one you havent had you should try this brewery.
Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);A dark malt liqour? some things were just never meant to be, take for example the upcoming movie Soul Plane, I mean, what the hell was the guy that came up with that idea thinking? But more importantly, dont buy this beer.
Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);"I have no clue what a ""dark bock"" is supposed to be, other than a darker color of a bock. I've had plenty of Saxer's regular bock and even their dopplebock (they're often on sale) so I thought I'd try this one (also on sale < grin >). Bottle looks a lot like their regular bock label only...darker. 7.2% alcohol by volume ""microbrewed malt liquor."" No date code. From back label: ""Dark Bock - A classic Bavarian Dunkel Bock brewed with imported German malts and hops. Dark Bock has deliciously rich, roasted malt flavors with a spicy hop profile.... Saxer brews world-class Bocks using forty percent more malts than other beers and then cold conditions them for a full six to eight weeks."" Um, sure. Pours dark brown with not much head, but what's there seems to stick around rather well. Not much lace but there's a ring floating in the beer that's about a half an inch thick that doesn't want to go anywhere. Smells really malty with a hint of spicy hops. Tastes malty. I can't detect any hops at all, but something is offsetting the malt. The high alcohol content is well hidden. There's a hint of caramel with some fruity undertones, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Mouthfeel is actually rather watery. Plenty of foam, but there's very little aftertaste. It's lacking the crispness I expect from a good bock. Drinkability...eh. I could have a few of these and I'll buy it again if it's on sale, but it's nothing special."
Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Ok bough in a six pack of 12 oz brown long necks at the ""cheapo canned food warehouse"" place..$3.99..a little past spring but here goes.. Wow this is one handsome looking beer, not pretty this has a manly look to it! A dark ruby/garnet red with a lovelly off white head..that goies but leaves some nice lacing..beautiful. Smell is rather a step down from the looks but it seems to be reasonably malty and fresh. Taste is malty but there is a ""grapfruit"" hop flavour too..I cannot taste the high alcohol though..well hidden. Was rather dissapointed by the mouthfeel it ended half way over my tongue then nothing,,feel cheated! A drinkable enough beer..but could have been way better."
Saxer Dark Bock;Portland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Nice dark brown color,small bubbly tan head that last a short time.malty sweet aroma with a faint hint of fruit and hops.The taste is sweet roasted malt with a slight caramel note and mild hop presence,and a pretty decent chocolate as well.The after taste was mostly malt and chocolate with a mild hop character at the tail end.Nice feel in the mouth not to thin but just right for the way i like it anyway.IMO this is a pretty decent bock and well worth having quite a few around and also very easy to drink considering the alcohol manages to stay nicely hidden and never really makes a dramatic appearance.
Saxer Lemon Lager;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);From old tasting notes. Bright yellow gold color. Huge rocky white head. Intense lemon aroma. Tangy lemon and malt flavor. Little character or depth. More like a shandy.
Saxer Lemon Lager;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);355ml bottle tried many years ago poured a pale golden color with a finger of white head that left a few spots of lacing on the glass. Aroma was lemon and cereal grains with some pleasant hops. Taste was nice malty sweetness with light hop bitterness and lemon. Was a nicely balanced brew with well balanced flavors and quite enjoyable.
Saxer Lemon Lager;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);I had this beer on a tour of the northwest u.s.a. in the late 90s. I have enjoyed beers all around the world, and this was by far one of the best in memory. It did not! Taste like lemonade you idiots. It was crisp, clean, refreshing and went very well with grilled salmon steaks. It was the only beer Ive ever wokeup in the morning in the majestic mountains of durango, colorado and thought....mmmm Id rather have this than coffee . Now Ivereturned and am trying to locate this beer only to find it extinct....so sad.

Saxer Lemon Lager;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle - sicky sweet lemony dishsoap aroma. Looks like a Bud Light. The flavor ... the flavor. What the hell are they thinking? This is just horrible.
Saxer Lemon Lager;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle Pours a straw pale yellow. Hazy and with a nice full white head. Dry faint aroma of leamins and light malts. Flavor was lemony but like gatorade. Thin and light weght.
Saxer Lemon Lager;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle: Very very pale yellow color, big puffy retentive white head. The nose is a bit tart with some lemon peel and extract sweetness, a touch of ricey notes too. The flavor is a bit odd with some underlying poor lager along with a slightly sweet lemon extract flavor. The finish has a light body and a bit of pleasing lemonade characteristics. Just a bad combination, more like a gimick or an alcopop.
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Saxer Brewing Company--Pilsner Seasonal--1998 12 oz. Bottle. 5.50% ABV.

(4.75 / 5.0) Rich clear light golden color. Good head intros strong Saaz front, but rich light textured really makes brew with its smooth light sweet ester cream body. Finishes clean with a light spicy hop note. Sampled 6/3/1999.
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a gold color in the glass. Good head. Nose and taste of pines, grass, spices and hops. Rated 1/24/2000
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pale clear golden color with lots of head & sticky lacing. The aroma is fruity, malty with some pilsner malts. The flavor is balanced, a little tangy but pilsnery. Not too bad!
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Golden and still with nice solid head. Very malty tones with an odd stringent, melon-like character.
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Loose, soapy white head and golden body loaded with planktonic matter. Nose is wheaty and nutty with dark honey and a hint of grass. Spicy, hoppy quality with some wood, raw nuts, and more honey. Very organic flavor. Id call this a hybrid pils. Very unique. I dig this.
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);"This one pours a clear yellow, or should I say a golden color. The head is white and rocky, and the lace adheres to my glass to stay. Nose is of freshly roasted malt, and hops to back it up. For a bottled beer, this smells remarkably fresh. Taste is what it says on the bottle ""Classic Bohemian Style Golden Lager"". Very drinkable, nice for a hot sunny day, but as far as bohemian pilsners go, this is right in there with Czechvar and Pilsner Urquel. Good, but nothing new., Brisk roasted malt followed by a crisp hop balancing act. Another good pilsner."
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);I like this Pilsner. Real malty nice hoppy flavor, too. Delicious. Good American Pilsner.
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Dark straw color, quickly dissipating head, sporadic lace and hazy for a Bo. Pils. Malty and floral hop aroma w/ the slightest hint of diacetyl. Malty start w/ a hop flavor and bitter finish. This bottle is slightly oxidized, but not horribly so. Carbonation is a little high and prickly for Bo Pils and my taste, but the overall body is a medium feel. Very slightly astringent, but doesn't really take away from my overall impression of this beer.
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pretty good as far as pilsners go. Aroma is all saaz, flavor is slightly sweet malt with saaz, finish is a pleasant saaz. In other words, everything a Pilsner should be.
Saxer Pilsner;Portland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecera Costa Rica - FIFCO);I didn't mind this too much. Not stinky like most pilsners, and pretty easy to drink. Not bad at all. Goes well with Cheeze-Its, but will probably go well with real food too.
Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Backlog, bottle that pours a hazy orange color with medium head. Nose and flavor of bubblegum, banana, lemon zest, wheat, and grain. Lighter to medium bodied with fruity finish.
Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Low formation foam, low density and very short duration. Liquid is yellow, very cloudy, with a juicy aspect. Aroma is very poor. I hardly could feel the hops and the wheat notes. Even the yeast were hidden. On mouth, things get better. The wheat comes in a shy way, then the hops but not truly aromatic, just a pleasant bitterness. The aftertaste is the best part. Little bit higher bitterness and the wheat taste. Not even fat the best American Wheat I have ever tried, but it is refreshing for hot days. Only worths in a very good price, otherwise, id prefer other brewries. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Widmer Brothers Hop Jack;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Still digging through old note pads/books. I used to drink a lot of this some years ago when hoppy beers werent always easy to find. All I noted was roast malt and a lot of hop. Well a lot of hop for 7 or 8 years ago. I remember loving the bottle and label - not to mention the beer. For me it was right in there with the old bottle conditioned Bridgeport IPA. If I found it, I would drink it again.
Widmer Brothers Hop Jack;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Very typereal American pale ale with great persistent foam. Aroma of fruit reminiscent of apple and good hops. The taste is full-bodied, with soft fruit tones, light citrus and pleasant long hops bitterness.
Widmer Brothers Hop Jack;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Retired? Draft at the brewpub. Clear golden color. Aroma of light grass. Taste is plain but balanced.

Widmer Brothers Hop Jack;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Nice pale golden coloured body with a white head. Medium-bodied; Strong assertive cascade hops up front with some mild malt and a bit of cardboard behind. Aftetaste shows some nuts, sugars and a lot of lingering hops. Overall, a nice beer - definitely worth trying if you can find it! I sampled this on draught at Growlers Pub South in St. Louis, MO on 13-August-2005."
Widmer Brothers Hop Jack;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);1/19/08 On draught at the Portland brewhouse. Aroma is all C-hops with a very faint sweet malt background to balance. Appearance is clear gold with a low white head. Flavor is earthy bittering hops forward with a light sweet malt balance again.

Widmer Brothers Hop Jack;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Had this beer on 8/2/1999. Color is a hazy gold with good carbonation and light head. Aroma is light and but hoppy. Taste is hoppy and smooth. It starts with a medium body that goes down very smooth and a nice hop flavor coming on. The finish is this hop flavor backed by a light hop bitterness. Its not the best pale Ive ever had but I do like it
Widmer Brothers Hop Jack;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);On draught at the Widmer brewpub in downtown Portland. Sampled during ABA Beer Tour 07. Pours a golden pale amber brew with a thin white head that dissolves quickly to a fine film. Aroma of light bready malt, lemon and citrus zest, with a touch of mango. Taste is well carbonated, medium bodied, with fruity malt flavors with citrus character. Finish is light, crisp with a slight citrus aftertaste.
Widmer Brothers Hop Jack;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Widmer Hop Jack Pale Ale is an outstanding example of American Pale Ale that showcases hop aromas and flavors. Unlike many over the top APAs, that tattoo your taste buds with an all out acid wash of hop bitterness, Widmer takes a little different approach. Widmer brews German beer styles, and make use of malts such as Vienna, Munich, and Carapils, that you will not normally find in APA. These malts join the grain bill of pale and caramel malts, which are the traditional malts used in the brewing of APA. Widmer Hop Jack is hopped with three different hop varieties including two PNW classics; Cascades, and Centennials, as well as Tettnager, for bittering. Five malts, and three hop varieties, make for a very well crafted and flavorful APA. I really enjoy this beer. Widmer Hop Jack pours to a hazy, deep pale golden color with a thick white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is wonderful. Very fragrant, zesty, citric hop aromas flood the nose. This is paired with a nice backdrop of biscuit like malt aromas, but the hops really shine in the nose. The palate is firm, with very good pale and caramel malt flavors paired with just a touch of grainy malt flavor as well. Widmer Hop Jack finishes with more good malt flavor up front, then ends with a nice herbal/spicy hop bite that slightly lingers."

Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Had this beer on 4/17/2000. Aroma is a light citrus hop scent. Color is a nice golden brown with light carbonation and head. Taste is sharp, rich and bitter. Starting with a medium body it goes down with a rich malt feel that is sharp on the end. The finish is this sharp feel turning into a bitterness. Its not well balanced and doesnt make for a good spring brew.
Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Widmer Springfest pours to a beautiful, bright, deep amber/light brown color with a nice stiff white head, and a lively amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting with some nice herbal/spicy hop aromas paired with some light sweet malt aromas. The palate is soft with good clean, slighty sweet and nutty malt flavors on the tongue. The body on this beer is just so round and smooth, making it a very clean and drinkable beer. Widmer Springfest finishes with a short, snappy, vibrant burst of herbal hop bitterness that slightly lingers. This is a well done domestic example of a very local German beer style, altbier. What I love about alt bier is that wonderful balance of malt and hop flavors and aromas. Nice balance of both in the nose, a malty body, and then that snappy burst of herbal hop bitterness makes this just a wonderful beer to enjoy. Springfest is not quite up to snuff with the Germans, but this is a nice beer.
Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);From the bottle this brew pours a deep red with mahogany tones and a small off-white head. Very dry grain, not overly sweet, but very earthy with a medium bitter finish. Light caramel notes show as it warms but doesnt last long as the flavors finishes bitter.
Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"I disagree that this is ""assertively hoppy"" but it's probably not the first time. This is easy to drink but not something I would want to drink on a regular basis. It is smooth and refreshing though."
Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Brown with decent off white head. Acidic nose. Vinegary flavor. I obviously had a bad one.
Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Worty, malty aroma. Bit of molasses and fruity hops. Nice ruby-brown color with light tan foamy, lacing head. Medium-high carb, kind of fizzy with medium watery body. Malts in the mouth, but not sweet - lagerish. Prominent bitterness/nutty finish and after - sticks on the back of the tongue. Definitely not as good as German altbiers.
Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);pours a kinda of a copper color with decent head, malty aroma and taste balanced nicely with hops
Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Medium brown color, medium head. Nicely hopped and malted Alt ale. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.Nice beer.
Widmer Brothers Springfest;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"I thought this was rather modestly hopped actually. Grains were very apparent (especially in the bouquet) and tasted rather ""unfinished"" balanced with the of malt. Although I find it rather refreshing to find a beer so prevalent in grains, this didn't seem to blend well with the rest of the beer."
Widmer Brothers Wildwood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);12oz bottle. Poured a deep golden color. Heavy red apple aroma. Taste is like a thick rich apple champagne with a mild tartness.
Widmer Brothers Wildwood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Pours a dark golden yellow color. Aromas of apples and other fruit. Flavor crisp with a nice dry finish.
Widmer Brothers Wildwood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);This is the first cider I have rated, so I dont have much reference. This thing was just found aging for a few years, more accidently aged, or misplaced, but still really nice flavor. Aroma is lightly spicy, more apple and less alcohol. The flavor on this was well mixed together, very smooth. Rating this against beer is tough, but i guess i would rather rate this brew better than some shitty macros, but I would never take this over a craft brew.
Widmer Brothers Wildwood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Definitely taste the ""unfermented apple juice"" flavor that supposedly composes 20% of this. Almost a cherry undertone. Mix of sweet and dry. Takeable, but unremarkable. Maybe give me something I can remember next time. On the flip side, it didnt scorch my throat like dry ciders sometimes do."
Widmer Brothers Wildwood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Appears like a carbonated apple juice. Fresh apple nose. Nice tart flavor with a bitter finish. Good cider.
Widmer Brothers Wildwood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Pale and effervescent, smells like cheap wine, reminded me of Boones Farm. But really and truly not bad in the taste, a bitter aftertaste though.

Widmer Brothers Wildwood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Cider. Whoohoo. Liked it more than I expected, but it's still hard cider and not really beer. Nose is very apple, flavor is very apple (it's an apple cider, duh). Also has a sugary sweetness. Fizzed, a bit spritzer-like. Surprised I actualy sorta liked it, didn't at all expect to.
Widmer Brothers Wildwood;Portland, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Clear apple juice body. Aroma is sweet apple. Taste is of lightly fizzy apple juice. Bleah -- I don't need spiked carbonated apple juice -- I'll just stick with the apple juice.
Stoneys Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;By far and away this has to be the worst beer made in the U.S. Its embarrassing to even call it beer. It smells like garbage just like it tastes.

Stoneys Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;On tap at Genes Place in Oakland (Pittburgh, PA). I always found this beer to taste better on draft than in the bottle. A good old fashion cheap american pale lager.
Stoneys Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Golden copper color with a light rim head and no lace, light ascending carbonation bubbles. The taste is caramel malt cut toward the finish with harsh carbonation. Typical of big box beers, perhaps a little more going on. Probably good for slugging.
Stoneys Black and Tan;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;From a can, beer pours (in Chimay glass) a dark brown-red that light can penetrate. No black or tan detected - did they mix? Head is white and dissipates quickly. Aroma is of licorice and molasses. Flavor is of halloween candy flashbacks - the black cow, the candy corn with a dry, slighty bitter finish. A nicely different brew, but nothing special to keep drinking it. Sampled at 71 degrees Fahrenheit.
Stoneys Black and Tan;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;A B&T but not a psecial one! tatse was there but not strong & lacking something. Not below average but not far above either!
Stoneys Black and Tan;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;I really wanted to love this beer. I thought maybe Jones was finally gearing up to challenge Yuengling with a good Black & Tan. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. Frankly, it tastes like Stoney's Lager with caramel color added. I'm detecting very little malt character...one would expect some black and chocolate malt in a black & tan but it's not really apparent. No noticeable hops flavor. I guess this is a fair training beer for those wanting to venture into the world of craft beers. Close your eyes and you'd think you were drinking any domestic lager.

Iron City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"Here is a belated review for you all. Last drank this in the late 70's and early 80's. A river rat punk rock favorite based on how much party liquid you could get for your money, about $4 a case in returnable bottles. Aptly noted as ""swill"" by those readily chugging the stuff. An awful, bottom of the low cost beers made in the Ohio River Valley, that's why tastes like it was shipped on barges. Iron City is appropriate given its hideous metallic aftertaste. At least when you accidently ""swill spill"" it is no major loss!"

Iron City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;I had one of these in a Penguins bar in Cranberry, PA. Some head dent named Troy was yammering about how Gretzky was overrated and he kept guzzling Iron Cities. So I tried one and decided to get on the first plane with a free seat to get far away from this beer and this metro area forever. Turns out I ended up in Yellowknife and drank whale blubber smoothies and both were much better. Thanks, Troy!

Best by date on this 12oz bottle is Jan 22 08 and it pours a clear deep amber-brown with a nice large head of foam that lasted right through the session as a solid 1 finger layer and it has plenty of nice lacing.

Further sips in and as the beer warms, I start to taste some fig, raisin, toffee, and dark fruit as well as *some* chocolate.

Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Riecht sehr intensiv dunkelrstig. Pechschwarzes Bier mit einer feinen Schaumkrone. Im Antrunk wie l, sehr intensiv, sehr kernig, smig. Stark gerstete Kaffeebohnen, dunkelste Schokolade und zustzlich eine hopfige Herbe im Abgang die seines gleichen sucht. Nichts fr Weicheier
Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"As someone who is a big fan of Victory Brewing, my experience drinking the Storm King was the first time I've been disappointed by a product from this generally top notch Pennsylvania brewery. Currently trying my second bottle of a 2018 vintage with an August 2023 best by date, and although I'm getting more flavor and nuance on this second round, this beer falls short of its aim to challenge Great Divide's Yeti in the hoppy American-style imperial stout category. That being said, this beer is still very good, with a rich brown-black opaque appearance and creamy head, exceptionally smooth palate, and that intriguing interplay of bitter piney hop flavors and charred coffee malt flavors that again reminds me of the first time I had the classic Yeti. Some red fruit notes in the aroma and the taste, with hints of chocolate as well. I however did not pick up on the ""massive espresso"" as described on the bottle, which added to my disappointment. It does finish very smooth, but just doesn't strike me as particularly impressive in any category. A good American imperial stout, but fell short of high expectations."
Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);0,33l bottle. Pours black with tan head. Aroma of roast, coffee, chocolate, licorice, vanilla. Taste is big, sweet, bitter roasted malt, coffee, milk chocolate, licorice, slight hint of smoke, with some bitter hops in the finish. Full body, very well balanced.
Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);A solid IPS. Super dark appearance with mocha colored head. Some hop in the aroma...not the typical soy-sauce smell. Chocolate and coffee malt. Alcohol is well hidden. Used half of my 2nd sample combined with Bells Kalamazoo in a slow cooked pot-roast.
Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);From the bottle. Dark, dark brown with a frothy to creamy beige crown that lingers for the duration. Aroma is ladened with an overtone of nail polish, which is undoubtedly the brews biggest flaw. Beneath it: licorice and coffee. Taste is bittersweet up front with a fairly sharp hops bite at the finish. Body is full, carbonation is soft. Okay but the flat hops bitterness covers the richer, malty undertones that I prefer to make more of an appearance in this style.
Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);A great aroma of malt, chocolate, coffee and some licorice, pours a dark brown color with thick tan head that lasted. A full bodied oily mouth feel with a taste of malt, mocha an de licorice with a boozy licorice finish.
Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);A 12 fl. oz. bottle with an enjoy by date of 27th January 2021. Poured into a snifter glass. It was a dark dark brown to black in colour with a thin mocha head that dissipated fairly quickly and left some sparse lacing. Aromas of piney hops, roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Tastes of roasted malts, piney hops, chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, light herbal and a hint of liquorice. Creamy, medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, a nice Imperial Stout, although Im not too fond of the liquorice and herbal mix on the finish.
Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);I've heard Victory is discontinuing production of Storm King shortly. Can anyone confirm or (hopefully) correct this? It's a favorite, so I hope it's incorrect. Bad enough that I had to stock up to get me through the summer each spring (smile).
Victory Storm King Imperial Stout;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Black with a thin, tan head with lacing. Nose is roasted oats and chocolate. Unbelievable smoothness for a high ABV. It has a warmth, but not a fiery boozy taste. Bitter dark chocolate and espresso tastes. I had this one many times over a decade. Great move going back to the six pack (four packs are too rich for me). Happy New Year!
Victory Sunrise Weissbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"Hazy straw pour from a growler into a glass with a large white fluffy head; looks amazing. Aromas of banana, cloves, sour yeast and sweet bread. Taste follows the nose as the German malts add a crisp yet smooth finish. Carbination is just right. Awesome Hefeweizen; a lighter more refreshing version of Victory's Mad King's Weiss in my opinion. Light bodied and very sessionable."
Victory Sunrise Weissbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);From Jul 2007 Purchased at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins as part of a mixed 6 Pack. This one pours from 12oz bottle(best by May 24 08) a hazy straw colour with a good head of foam. After a few minutes there's just some spotting of foam and it does have some lacing. The smell has a strong nose of clove and banana and is nice. The taste follows the nose with a heaping helping of both clove and banana with a good citric background. Further sips in and I'm getting some good yeast flavour that hits my palate very well and the finish has a nice bitter-sour twang to it. Great summertime brew!! Now *this* is a very tasty Hefe and I'd be more than pleased if this was available locally. I recommend it!

Victory Moonglow Weizenbock;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);An unfiltered heavy wheat beer. Has a cloudy amberish appearance. Smell has some tart fruit, wheat, yeast....a little piney. Mouthfeel is weighed down a little by the unfiltration and yeast. I messed up slightly on the pour so had to wait for it to settle. Not the best Weizenbock out there, but a good representation nonetheless. Only tried a single first to sample, but this is something I would get again.
Victory Moonglow Weizenbock;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);t contains all the best traits of both a bock and a weizen.

Victory Golden Monkey;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);People were saying banana and it turns out they were right, although there are other more tripely fruits as well. It doesn't quite have that Belgian lighter-than-it-should-be thing down. Dry at the end. Good, but not great. Poured from a can.
Victory Golden Monkey;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"Gold hay color with wheat, peppercorn aroma. Taste has mild banana, Belgian yeast, oak and spice notes. Pretty weak for a Tripel; still drank 6 in one night."

Victory Golden Monkey;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"Can. I'm not a fan of Belgian style beers. This one was typical translucent straw colored beer. Way too strong 9.5% ABV. ""Spicy,"" slightly sweet. Requires sipping, and I had to add ice to keep it cold, because it took so long to finish it."

Victory Golden Monkey;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Hier versucht man ein hopfenbitteres IPA etwas aufzupeppen. Das geschieht mit Zuckerzugabe (was auch den hohen Alkoholgehalt etwas dmpft) und einigen Tripel-artigen Gewrzen wie Koriander. Dadurch wirkt es wie einFabelwesen, dass weder IPA noch belgisches Bier ist. Der Vorteil ist, dass die Hopfenbittere ein gut trinkbares Ma erreicht und der Alkohol nicht zu brutal rberkommt. Aber dieser kastriert wirkende Hopfenwolf macht sich zu sehr zum verwirrten Affen, um wirklich zum Top-Bier zu werden.
Victory Golden Monkey;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Pours clear amber with full off white head. Aroma is light dried fruit, light caramel. Taste is plum and caramel, moving to banana esters and Belgian yeast. Finish is Belgian. A decent tripel.
Victory Golden Monkey;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Pours hazy gold with thin white head. Nose is overwhelmingly bananas with some bread, cloves, and apricots hanging around as well. Taste very strong in the bananas and apricots. Finishes very sweet with the taste of alcohol coming through as well. It is good for what it is, but not something I would drink on a regular basis.
Victory Altbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"I first had this ""Old Beer"" in D-Town. I believe it was a special offering after they expanded the brewery; for sure, they brewed it for their 10th birthday. Recently, I bought a growler at Kennett Square, and I poured into a pint glass. Theres a slight, sweet malt nose. Nice amber coloring with a white head (very similar to their Festbier). Expertly balanced with a strong malt presence and a bitter after bite. Has a heavy feel being a lager, but its easy going down at 5%. Cheers!"
Victory Altbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Transfer from BA review on 9-4-13- Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance  The beer is served a lighter copper-deep amber color with a one finger white head. The head fades relatively quickly leaving a very light level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell  The aroma is lighter overall, but has notes of a lightly toasted bread and a bit of a herbal hop and a light sweetness of caramel. Taste  The taste is very much as would be expected from the nose. It starts with a lightly roasted bready flavor mixed with a bit of caramel sweetness. The sweetness fades a bit as the taste moves on all while a herbal and slightly grassy hop taste comes to the tongue. These flavors are joined by some more light earthy flavors, to in the end, leave a rather light and crisp flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is rather light and thin with a carbonation level that is rather average. The thinner body and moderate carbonation are good for the lighter flavors and create a very crisp and easy drinking brew. Overall  More on the refreshing side, but a little bit low in the flavor profile which all in all makes for a nice easy drinking session brew.

Just a really easy drinking beer.

Victory Sunset Dunkelweizen;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Nice-looking beer, especially in a tall beer glass. But tasted unexpectedly bland, maybe even frightened. Ive had better dunkels.

Victory Workhorse Porter;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Cask @ Victory Brewpub. Beautiful black beer. Served a little too cold, but I could still smell the chocolate aroma. Very smooth, creamy mouthfeel with no bitterness. Very nice porter.
Victory Workhorse Porter;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Tap @ Victory. Dark brown with decent head and lace. Rather faint nose (after I had a couple the milder brews smell rather faint to me). Very nice roasted flavor w mild unsweet chocolate, not sweet, quite smooth, a bit mild,( I don't remember hops here after drinking the nice, hoppy pils just before), just into the medium bodied category. I could have inhaled a gallon of this without much effort.
Victory Workhorse Porter;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);I wonder why they dont bottle more of their beers. It does have a nice chocotately character to it, as the description suggests. A little nutty, pretty good. Not a huge fan of the porter style but no complaints here.
Victory Workhorse Porter;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Burgundy appearance with a small head and little lacing. Some caramel in the aroma that was also a little nutty. Palate was a bit thin for a porter. Maybe a little closer in style to a brown ale. More of a coffee edge as it warms. Finish was short lived. Had greater expectations.
Victory Workhorse Porter;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);On tap at Victory. Poured a medium to darker reddish brown with an averaged sized off white head. Aroma and tastes of bitter chocolate. OK Porter but a little light all around.

Roast malt and chocolate in the aroma, although a little weak. The flavor was similar to the aroma with a somewhat thin mouthfeel. Overall, it was a little disppointing.
Victory Workhorse Porter;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);On draft at the brewery. Deep garnet pour with a medium head. rich metallic aroma, hard to gauge the aroma due to the guy next to me blowing smoke in my face. Roasted malt flavor, nice choco-bitterness to finish. Very easy drinking, the finish makes this beer.
Victory Workhorse Porter;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Draft @ brewery. Very light brown for a porter as was the taste and body. Light, gritty cocoa flavor was mostly predominant here. Drinkable but a bit dissapointing.
Victory Workhorse Porter;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Deep red. Light roasts in nose, vaguely roasty in flavor with a bit of fruitiness at the end. Quite underwhelming considering Victorys usual skills.
Victory ESB;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);BB Backlog, Pours a copper gold with 2 finger head.

Enjoyed this one even though its not my favorite style.
Victory ESB;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Transfer from BA review on 5-23-12- Served on cask in a pint glass Appearance  Served an orange-copper color with a thin off white head. The head faded very fast leaving only a very light amount of lacing. Smell  The aroma is biscuit in nature mixed with a bitter hop aroma of earthy and citrus nature. There are light spice and herbal aromas mixed into the nose as well which overall create an overall very pleasant aroma. Taste  The taste is biscuit up front as the nose would have predicted. In the middle some of the citrus hop flavor and spice then comes into to the tongue. The citrus loses ground fast but the spiciness gets stronger. In the end the spice flavors mix with the bread an herbal/grassy flavor and an earthy hop flavor to leave a bitter spiced flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel  Typical for a cask beer this one was creamy in body and low in carbonation. It was nice and smooth and very drinkable. Overall - The flavors of this beer taste and transition well making this one a very easy drinking bitter with a nice smooth feel and taste.

Delicate, wood and resin ladened nose, lightly floral bouquet bursting forth from freshly sewed lawn. Flavor is more singular, soft carbonation appropriately allows for grass and tea, faint bread crust mid before rich, warm toast in finish. Awesome example, been so long since a low carbed esb graced my lips. Victory reminding all ""trail-blazing"" craft brewers again that brewing to style can be just as good."

Malts are light, slightly bready, and balance well MF/D: Carbonation is low, body is medium for the style. Finish is of spicy hops
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);What a pleasure to drink, very lively and powerful. Not such a fan of the label.
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Tad above average beer and for the style. Just not a big fan of wheats and this one not really standing out. Wanted to get Victory's Summer Love again after trying it last year, but saw this along with a new review. Summer Love is better IMO. Whirlwind is cloudy medium-pale yellow. Tastes wheaty...the Hoegaarden kind though and not the hoppier American Wheat like I prefer. Glad I split this with my brother-in-law as I'll be going with other summer beers for the season.
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"From Jul 2007 Purchased at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins as part of a mixed 6 Pack. This pours from 12oz bottle(Best by Apr 30 08) a cloudy yellow with a small head of foam. Not much is left after a few minutes other than a ring around the edge of my glass and some lacing. The smell is of yeast and citrus and wheat and clove and banana. It's not a bit shy on the nose. ;^) The taste is big and citrusy up front with flavours of clove and some banana but it all works up front only..the flavours fall off quickly midway through and it finishes really watery. If at least some of the flavour lasted, I'd have liked it more. Pretty disappointing for me and I'll not revisit this brew."
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);BB Backlog, Bottle, pours cloudy golden with medium sized white foam. Aroma is flowers, banana, clove, and other belgian spice. Flavor of orange peel, coriander, clove, and dark fruits. I could mix these in between some hoegarden and other wits.
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Aromas of orange and spice. Flavor has too much orange, I didnt care for this beer at all. White beers arent high on my list.
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Aroma is wheat malts with that belgian yeast touch. Slight banana. Taste is refreshing citrus with some herbal traces. Theres quite a lot of bitterness in the aftertaste, and thats what saves this little guy. Refreshing.
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Hazy yellow. Aroma of clove, banana, wheat, yeast etc. Taste is refreshing lemon, cotrus, spice, coriander, banana and fruity esters. Tingles going down and crisp mouth feel. Not bad
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Pours pale straw yellow with a thin white head with just a little lacing. Aroma is of wheat bread, spices, cloves, lemon zest, and some light floral hops. Taste is about the same as the aroma. Has a medium-light body with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a slightly bitter, slightly dry, medium finish. Overall, a pretty nice, classic wit that is a nice refreshing summer beer.
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle at home, not that Victory is finally available in Arkansas. Pours a hazy light yellow with two fingers of white head. Aroma is wheat, yeasty, some lemons. Nice summertime beer.
Victory Whirlwind Witbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Cloudy yellow pour, quickly fading white head. Nose is citrus and spice. Bittersweet. Middle is yeasty malt, bread notes, and lite cardamon. Finish is dry with subtle but persistent carbonation.
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Five year old bottle so I didnt expect this to be as good as once before probably. Pours clody orange with a thick white head. Aroma of honey, pine, berry, and orange. Very good taste of resin and orange with a bitter finish.
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Pours a light tan head with a cola-color body...i got the dregs tho. Smells of malt and mellow citrus hops. Tastes of floral and some spice hop and medium malt sweetness. Little dry. Wish the hops were more prevalent all-around.
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Pours a hazy gold with foamy head. Aroma of citrus, pine, hops, lemon, some malts. Similar taste, buttery up front with some nice hop bite. Not bad for an 04. Thanks butters!
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Five year old beer courtesy of Butters at his Cellar Reduction # 6. Old tasting but still going. Best by 12/9/04. Bitter hops. Resin and pine. Tastes like this beer might have active yeast in the bottle . I wouldnt be surprised if the alcohol content has risen over the years. Who knows. Interesting for its age but hardly a stellar beer
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle (12/9/04) shared from springslicker at the 6th Cellar Reduction. Gusher upon opening. Pours a near clear orange with solid white head. Nose is a weird sweet fruity honey malt, with big alcohol notes. Apple, butterscotch flavors. Still has a decent bitterness on the finish. And im not sure, but I think this got more alcoholic with age, lots of warming. Extra points on the age.
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);btl opened by Springslicker. Lemon sour like butterscotch and apple starburst. Very musty flavor of old wood. Semi sweet that fades to a bitter that is far from pleasant. Very foamy and thin. A beer that did not hold up well with age. Rated out at 2.7 but with a best by of 12/9/04 I rated on a curve officially.
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);12oz bottle-pours a thin white head and cloudy gold color. Aroma is sour, lemon. Taste is sour, lemon-hops, secondary medium malt, butterscotch. 2.9 Thanks to springslicker for sharing. Best by 12/9/04 therefore 3.2
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottled, thanks to SpringsLicker for the brew! Poured hazy, deeper golden, and almost still.. a dusting and a light ring of white head stuck around. The aroma was warm and welcoming, and undoubtedly unlike how this originally came across.. deeper caramel, toffee, and barley give an aged, well-malted impression with just a touch of dried floral hoppage.. this aged gracefully with an old-ale appeal. The flavor had deep toffee, medium-skinned fruits, caramel, and barley again with mild floral bitterness.. well-aged and soft, with little hoppage left. Medium-bodied with very low carbonation.. let the malt show glide slowly, but gracefully across the palate. This was just delightful!
Dogwood Breakdown IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);This was one damn good IPA! I wish this was still around. Nice malty flavor and lovely citrusy hops.

Dogwood Stout;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);(12oz bottle best by 5-22-03 thanks to Walt) clear dark brown with ruby edges and no bubbles.

Totally buttered biscuit from Hardees  aroma. Flavor is candy corn, roast chocolate, marshmellow, and a little oakey. Has held up fairly well. Thanks to Sprinslicker for the hookup!
Dogwood Stout;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Thanks to OSCF for sharing this at his tasting! Hasnt quite held up as well as some of the other Dogwoods Ive had but it was a perfectly reasonable session stout. Thin, cola-ish pour with a faint prickly carbonation to it. Nice roasts still come through in the nose, though the bodys a bit too thin to substantiate the flavors at this point. Decent though.
Dogwood Stout;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Pours a dark black with a thin tan head. Nice extraction. Nose shows mild soy, chalky, chocolate, some paper. Age not doing it well. Flavor is thin, papery, chocolate, some roast and coffee. Thin palate.
Dogwood Stout;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);12 oz bottle via Mys Swap 3.0 (thanks shp555!). 2004 bottle...4 yrs old...with a Troeggs cap...She pours a near pitch black with an average size beige head. Nose is roasted grains. Taste is roasted grains, semi-burnt coffee, a little chocolate, and some licorice in the aftertaste. Body is medium, carbonation is perfect. This is nothing overly special or complex, but is a nice solid roasty stout that seems to have aged well with no oxidation or off-flavor issues.
Dogwood Stout;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);A nice beer here, that is...who knows how old. Received in a trade with someone. Forgot exactly who sent it, but thanks. The beer was nice. As nice as a dry stout can be. Granted, its not one of my all-time favorite style, but this was still very nice. An aroma of coffe, in fact it damned near dominates the nose. Some light aroma of dark chocolate is barely detectable. The flavor of chocolate and coffee dominate as well. A bit of a puckering twang was also picked up, perhaps due to the malts.
Dogwood Stout;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Stout - Dry;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle thanks to shp555. 2004 edition. Pours a dark brown with a beige head that goes down pretty quick. The aroma is heavy brown sugar, some dark fruits perhaps. The taste was mostly a dry burnt malt, brown sugar, some hints of dark fruit, and overall a sweet chocolate flavor. This is a decent beer that has left us. Thanks go to Steve for sharing this.
Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Golden hazed wit with a thin white head. Aroma of coriander and bananas with light oranges. Light wheaty malt with light orange notes. Lighter bodied than Blanche de Chambly. Trade with Goldtwins, if I remember. Tasted Spring 2006.
Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Another gusher from Dogwood. Pretty tasty but not great. The level of spicyness was just about right.

Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with goldtwins, thanks Larry!) Best before 15-Nov-04. Hey, Im just glad I get to try another brew from the now-defunct Dogwood Brewery. But frankly, its been my experience that these Belgian whites handle aging very well. This pours a hazy yellow body with a small whitish head. Within a couple of minutes, the head has faded to a thin ring around the edge of the glass. The mildly aromatic nose consists mostly of lemony citrus and some light coriander in the background. However, coriander shows much more presence in the flavor, and the mildly bitter orange peel is unmistakeable in the finish, tasting like, well, biting into the rind of a fresh orange. Pleasant fruitiness, only lightly sweet and minimal bitterness. Very slight breadiness to the wheat malt base, probably a hint to the aging this beer has seen. Body is light-medium, and while not more than lightly carbonated, the citrus and spice still make the beer fairly refreshing on the palate. Overall, a pretty nice beer, especially for one that should have been consumed 14 months ago.
Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Its long story how I got ahold of this one. I jumped at one last opportunity to rate this retired beer knowing full well it may have gone bad. Well the smell has the same citrusy aroma Im used to. It still has that cloudy orange color. The taste is slightly spicy with hints of orange. Thank goodness it hasnt gone bad. Unfortunately it was never a great beer to begin with.
Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);light yet crisp aroma, nice yellow golden color with a slightly off-white head, nice whole wheat flavor, slight lingering bitterness, wonderful sweet summer beer. Sad to have lost such a high quality brewer
Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Cloudy yellow to orange colored white beer with a little head that died away instantly. Aromas of orange, lemon and citrus in there, some notes of coriander too. Medium bodied beer with a dry malty finish. Too low on carbonation and a watery finish.
Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Goodbye Dogwood! This brewery will be sorely missed in the Atlanta market. This is a good summer beer with just the right balance of orange & spice.
Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);This beer poured a medium yellow to slight orange color with a slight soapy white head, but it died off very quickly. There was also a slight degree of cloudiness in this beer. The aroma was light with definite coriander, orange, lemon and citrus in there. Light to medium bodied beer with a dry, malty but tart finish. Its definitely a summer brew but it had a nice mellow long-lasting finish. It began to smell and taste like a grassy field in the middle of Kansas as it warmed but it was definitely very light on the carbonation. Relatively unexciting, but worth the try!
Dogwood Summer Brew;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Medium orange gold color. Small to no head. Aroma is orange, coriander and lemon. A light to medium bodied white. Malts are fruity, with lots of orange and a ton of coriander. Light and refreshing, kind of grassy tasting. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Might have been a little bit old, carbonation was kind of flat.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2001;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);12 oz. bottle from TheBeerSommelier- thanks, Matt! Wow, first rating in over three years. This one pours a cloudy, deep gold color with a white ring. Sweet aroma of toffee, cookies, brown sugar, honey, and a coppery metal note. The flavor also has that copper note finishing toffee, brown sugar, apples, and honey. Light-medium bodied, with low carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel. This one is not bad after 11 years. We all enjoyed it.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2001;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Appearance: Pours a hazed, orange-amber body with a thin, oh-so tired ring of white bubbles. Smell: Interesting aroma of a particularly fruity, aged past its peak wine, like a Viognier, perhaps, served up with a pairing of local jams and jellies. Taste: Sweet candyish, honeyed flavor with a blend of fruit flavors: golden raisins, yellow apples, and peach jelly. Light oxidative hints throughout, but nothing to fret over. Nil bitterness as the hops long ago picked up stakes and moved on. Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-low carbonation. Rather sticky mouthfeel at this point. Drinkability: Its interesting to see how this has changed and morphed since it was first released, though Ill echo the sentiment of its initial reviewer, beergirl99, and say that, years later, it is still a very nice ale.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2001;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle shared by kp. Pours a hazy light golden amber with a small off-white head that didnt hang around for long. The aroma was fairly sweet with lots of light fruits and some esters from the yeast. Taste followed the aroma with a dominate light fruit sweetness and some Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated given the age and sticky sweet in the finish. Despite showing some signs of age with hints of oxidation in the aroma and taste, this one has held up exceptionally well for the age.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2001;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);(12oz bottle, thanks artusory) Small beige head atop lightly hazed light amber body. Aroma is medium sweet, stewed apple, apple wine, alcohol. Taste is medium sweet, apple wine, some yeast. Medium body. Hard to believe the ABV was that low.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2001;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);"12oz bottle, courtesy of artusory. Thanks, Ryan! Pours a hazy, golden orange color; off-white head with solid, medium-bubbled retention and lacing. Lots of apples, chewy yeast character and wheatiness, candy sugar in the aroma; some dried caramel from the oxidation, but a very pleasant yeast character overall. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: lively carbonation; almost to the point of champagne-like apple cider; solid acidity and a dense yeastiness and caramel-apple note; probably a bit past its prime, but this is still very generous and very good at this point. Lengthy finish, showing honey, apple, and yeast."
Dogwood Winter Ale 2001;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Hazy, light amber with a small white head. Sweet nose with tons of apple cider, some caramel, herbs and riesling. The flavor is lightly sweet with lots of apple, peach, caramel, rye, light oxidation and spice. Medium body is light and lively with high carbonation.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2001;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle courtesy of ? (most likely TBC or slob).

Considering its age and ABV, this one held up very well.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2001;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);A little smokey and quite refreshing for a winter brew. The wheat comes out as the beer warms.

Dogwood Octoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Thaks to kp for this one. This was surprisingly good for a two year old beer that is not from a style known for cellaring abilities. Pours with a large white head over a clear medium amber body. Malt dominated aroma that is bready and lightly toasted malt. A bit fruity (apple) for an Ofest/MArzen. Sweet well balanced flavor. Some oxidation present as expected, but not overpowering enough yet to disguise the fact that this was a fairly decent beer in its day. Good body and finish.
Dogwood Octoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);On tap.. Poured a clear copper color with a small white head. Aroma is sweet with some roastedness. Flavor has some sweetness then finishes with some sour notes and bitterness. Light to medium body. This came in an imperial pint glass and I really didnt want to finish it.
Dogwood Octoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Wasn't too bad. An average beer from dogwood. Way better than the bock and summer, but worse than the decadant.
Dogwood Octoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Heavily carbonated and it sure doesn't taste like any other octoberfest I've ever had. More fruity than malty. I don't think it's a good representation of the style... I'll take a sam adams or paulaner any day.
Dogwood Octoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Pale copper golden color with a thin head and mostly flat body. Bland macro-like aroma of stale hops and corn grains with some apple juice. Body really tastes like apple juice with some grainy maltiness and a sugary finish. Not much of an oktoberfest if you ask me. Probably closer to a cider.
Dogwood Octoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);What a strange take on an Oktoberfest. Mine was a cloudy yellow color with a rather large head. Flavor was sour and slightly hoppy? This was like a watered down APA. I thought this style was supposed to be very malty? This may be the worst Dogwood I've had yet. And perhaps they should read up on what an Oktoberfest is suppose to taste like. An ok beer I guess.
Dogwood Octoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);"A nutty, caramel aroma and a pleasing malty taste. Not too heavy, but it did have a ""gummy"" aftertaste. A little too hoppy for the style, but still smoother than their ale varieties."
Dogwood Octoberfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);"12 oz bottle, goblet. Large, frothy, creamy head is white and diminishes slowly. The body is a hazy orange-peach color with little visible carbonation. Nurtty, caramel malt (mod); flowery hops (mod); corriander and date aromas. The aroma is very nutty and spicy; it reminds me of a brown ale. Moderately sweet, lightly bitter flavor becomes a lightly sweet, moderately bitter, lightly acidic finish. Lingering, bitter, nutty flavor. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. The bottom line is: yeah it's hoppy for an O'fest so...think of it as a malty pilsner."
Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);A little fruity and thin. Caramel and malt along with a little hoppy flavor.

Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Pours a rich golden brown with a 1/8 inch tan head. dissipates quickly but leaves some persistent lace. Smell is malty and lightly fruity. Taste is malty and light sweet caramel. Fruity too. Lightly bitter in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with the caramel aftertaste. Stickiness lingers after its gone. Cant put my finger on it but there is something in the finish that I dont like the taste of. Not bad. A pretty fair bock beer.
Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);I was very sad to see Dogwood close and it was because of this beer. I first tried it as a sample at the Rusty Nail on Buford Highway and immediately went to Greens and bought a 6-pack. While not the greatest beer in the world, it was intriguing enough for me to see if Dogwood could bottle a consistent beer. This was the only beer made by Dogwood that I ever had that didnt have a skunky bottle in the pack.
Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);On tap at Summits Wayside Tavern...NOt one of my favorites but unfortunately i have lost my notes on this one..
Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Poured a rather hazy amber color with a pretty light head, even with a vigorous pour. Not too much complexity in the aroma The flavor was very malty, which I enjoyed as I am not a huge fan of hops. On the whole however, this beer did not impress me, and will surely ot be one of my repeats.
Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);I like wacky label art as much as the next guy, but this one seems to suggest that goats and beer bottles were delivered to Earth by U.F.O.s...not sure why theyre implying this, just seems a little bit weird... Cloudy, dark amber color, with a fizzy, buzzing, active, slim cream-colored head. In the nose, a toffee-ish sweetness, soft, sweet, fruity. In the taste, more of the same, well-modulated, nice and juicy...pretty nice bock bier, I says. Ah, nice flavor rising up with every sip. Medium bodied, nice, sweet finish. Got to hand it to Dogwood, UFOs or no, this is a beauty of a bock.
Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Poured amber with a moderate, short-lived white head. Rich of aroma of malts -- and thats just about it. The flavor was much the same, a sweet caramel maltiness but just not enough hops to balance. And the beer was too thin for my tastes. Not a bad brew, but not remarkable in any way. For a brewery that I hold in such high regard as Dogwood, Im disappointed. Im even more disappointed, however, to see Dogwood closing its doors. Farewell to a great brewery.
Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);"Bottle. Brought this bottle back from GA and it was worth the trip. Rich amber color with a medium head that dissolved into just a thin sheet of light bubbles. The aroma is malt, smoke and yeasty. The first thing I get from the taste is a light hop bite then a full malt taste that blankets the tongue. Ive noticed Dogwood uses malts very nicely, subtle and not too rich. I usually dont use ""chewey"" to describe a liquid but this description fits here. Caramel taste as the beer came up in temp."
Dogwood Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Not much head out of the bottle. Its not that important. Dogwood beers have been great so far. Again, this is very good. Dark Amber color, Good hops/malts, smooth with nice gravity and a quality mouthful feeling. This is one of the beers from Ross whos a great trader and should be congratulated for passing 400 beers a couple of days ago. Thanks Ross great beer!!!
Paulaner Premium Pils;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);(Draught at Maximilians, Berlin, 8 May 2019) Golden colour with frothy, white head.

Paulaner Salvator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);"11.2 oz. bottle. AROMA: Very sweet with scents of bread, brown sugar, and caramel. APPEARANCE: Pours an opaque, orange-brown with a dirty-tan head that dissipates quickly and minimal lacing. Overall, its appearance is a bit on the ""muddy"" side. TASTE: Tastes almost exactly like it smells ... sweet, with notes of brown sugar, malt, and caramel. MOUTHFEEL: Full-bodied with a slick and creamy texture. Carbonation seems a bit low for a beer of this type. There is not much of a finish at all. OVERALL: This is what I would consider a ""typical"" doppelbock. Which is to say, it is a pretty tasty beer. But there's nothing to make it stand out from all the other ones. Basically, if you put one in my hand, then I will drink it and graciously thank you for it (while asking you for another). However, if I go to a bar, then I'm not going to remember that I've ever had this beer, much less that I actually enjoyed it."

Hacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.5%. Cloudy, somewhat vibrant orange. Smallish quickly dissipating head. Aroma of wheat rusk, slight citrus, and banana. Moderate+ carbonation. Initial citrus slightly orange-juicey hop hit, a little rough on the tongue, seguing into a perhaps subdued classic weissbier finish of creamy rusky wheat and a touch of banana yeast. Seekers of a hoppy weissbier should definitely give this one a try, but although it holds its end up with the yeasty, wheaty aspects, they feel a little overshadowed here, with the beer perhaps even feeling disjointed between how it starts and ends in the mouth. Not quite the full-on creamy banana weissbier hit I love, but more than decent.
Hacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);On tap at Der Pschorr. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head.

Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest Mrzen;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.8%. Crosses the line from gold/yellow lager colour into a very light tawny brown! Mild grassy aroma, slight spiciness developing. Fairly large but shortish-lasting head. Moderate carbonation. Grassy hops, with slight(!) tangerine-y citrus spiciness, merging perfectly with a plain brown-bread malt. A little sweet overall. This is like their Muenchner Gold with more flesh on its bones. Superbly simple, splendid with food, doesn't wow in any regard but is salubrious from start to finish. Unconcerned with impressing, only with being pleasant. Super clean and uncomplicated, without feeling conspicuously stripped-down or overly focused. The drinker's Maerzen. Connoisseurs might not find enough to interest them much, however, and perhaps lacks some of the robustness that typifies the style - this one really is light in its caramel-y nature.

Redhook IPA;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);It's been a while since I had this beer, but I remember it being a good IPA.

The taste had strong hops, yet still some spices come out as the beer warms. The palate was about a medium, sessionable, strong hoppy grassy finish, no aftertaste.

Redhook Hefe-Weizen;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Had this beer on 4/3/1999. Color is a pale hazy gold with very good carbonation and good head. Aroma is an odd sour malt scent. Taste is a little more bitter than other Hefe-Weizens Ive had. It starts with medium light body that goes down crisp with a bitter feel. The finish is odd, theres bitterness coming from the malt flavors as well as the hops. There is also a hop flavor in there somewhere. Overall it doesnt fit as a Hefe-Weizen and is not much fun to drink.

Redhook Double Black Stout;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Stout;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);This was the beer! When this first came out 2 decades ago or so, this was the beer that got me hooked (no pun) on craft beer! I've always put this at the top of all beers. Not because it's 20 % alcohol, or barrel aged for 3 years in 5 different barrels. This beer was just pure coffee stout at its finest. Made and discontinued twice, remade under Budwiser (which was not good) and then gone forever. Dark, silky smooth, Starbucks coffee, rich like Founders or Nebraska beers have been for the last 10+ years. The price was great, and the beer for its time, had a finish that started just like the 1st sip. Thanks Redhook for all the great memories on that beer! I still keep my last original bottle unopened from 2003 in the 1st spot on my top ten shelf!

Redhook Double Black Stout;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Stout;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Rated on 10-30-2011.

Pours dark inky brown with medium thick body and creamy brown head. Aroma is chocolately dark roasted malt and sweet espresso on the finish. Taste is smooth rich roasty malts, mild dark chocoate sweetness, subtle coffee flavor, and sharp spicy hops bring bitter balance to the finish. A really rich tasty brew; belies the fact that its only 7%. I think this has been retired for a while now, which is a real shame - shows what Redhook is capable of and is way better that most of what theyre brewing these days."

Morland Original Bitter (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;March 2008: clear 500ml bottle, no BBD found, it must last forever! Poured into a pint sleeve. Good healthy looking copper/amber colour, clear with a few bubbles rising up to the white foaming head. A sweet almost candy aroma hits your nose at first, it peters away to not much of anything, almost aroma-less towards the end. Fairly bitter and refreshing taste, like a good English Bitter should taste. Hops and malted barley both evident, a good strong flavour when first tasted. Although it has bite to it, there is a flaw in the beer. It doesnt have enough umph to stay flavoursome in the mouth, it fades away very quickly to a nothingness. Better than I anticipated, and not bad really.

Nice clean lookin almost brown pale beer. Yes, goes down fairly easy. These lower alky beers are fun to deal with. There are some ale attributes present but fer sure its better than some of those moreland beers Ive had like speckeld hen but this may not be as good as the golden hen I had on cask. On the finish this beer is trying to a little bitter but never quite gets there.

North Coast Scrimshaw;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;North Coast Brewing Company;Well I picked up a six-pack of this pilsner earlier this summer just to try something different from North Coast other than their Rasputin imperial stout. Overall in my experience this was a pleasant and refreshing mild pilsner that was light and quaffable while maintaining a traditional European noble hop presence. This consistently poured a bright full golden color with moderate carbonation, and with a classic pale pilsner maltiness on the nose. The pale malts are a little sweeter than usual in the taste, but the palate dries out quickly with a crisp herbal hoppiness in the finish. Not quite medium-bodied, this is a nice sessionable pilsner that admittedly isn't as full-flavored and bitter as a proper German pilsner, but it's a good balance of drinkability and character. Non-GMO certified ingredients are a bonus!

North Coast Blue Star;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Wheat Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;Kind of harsh taste, not much wheat beer kind of flavor. The bottle I got, bottled 3 months prior, had chunks of sediment, some of which stayed on the surface.
North Coast Blue Star;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Wheat Ale;North Coast Brewing Company;"I admit, it suckered me in. That sassy little blue star on the label had me thinking of the great and glorious Dallas Cowboys......oh wait, this is 2018, not 1993! And the ""taint"" of Jerry Jones is strong indeed. From a feared franchise to this abysmal mess. It's true. When you want the CHAMP stick with Blatz. That shit is World Champion FOREVER. This ""beer"" was probably brewed by Jerry Jones, and strained through Charles Haley's mouldering jockstrap. Never again."

Flying Dog Snake Dog IPA (through 2007);Frederick, Maryland, United States;IPA;Flying Dog Brewery;One of the first craft IPAs I sampled. Must have been around 1999-2000.

Appearance: Pours a nice golden brown with a 2-finger head. Smell: Nice malt aroma and some nuts also. Taste: Malty & smooth with a faint bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Citrus-like in the mouthfeel, subdued but balanced, with very mild hops. As it warms, nut-like aspect and a certain wood quality is apparent. Maltiness maintained throughout. Drinkability: Very sessionable, smooth to drink. Though sampled in winter, would make a good summer brew.

Flying Dog Old Scratch Amber Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Flying Dog Brewery;BOD 250/15. Pours a clear medium amber that is light garnet in intense light. World class head volume, lacing and retention. Somewhat light nose of caramel and earthy hops. Medium body that has a somewhat creamy texture. Superb carbonation with an effervescent burst in the middle and a nice prickly finish. The flavor profile is very good. Reasonably intense, slightly complex and very well balanced. It begins with a slightly charred caramel that is more nutty than sweet. The middle brings a mild earthy hop bitterness and flavor. Underneath is the strongest caramel appearance. The finish is a slow fade of the above coupled with a subtle tart fruit note.
Flying Dog Old Scratch Amber Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Flying Dog Brewery;Nicely persistent foam. The aroma is weak, but suggests malt and a little fruit. Mouth feeling is tingling due to much carbon dioxide, but the taste does not fail immediately something. It has a tart fruity filling allowing only sporadic touches of caramel malt. Hop bitterness is intrusive. I think the hops are a little too dominant.

Flying Dog Road Dog Porter;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Porter;Flying Dog Brewery;12 ounce bottle from the sampler case. Above average on all counts. Totally bizarre label that takes a lot of getting used to and ruins the experience of an otherwise calming porter.
Flying Dog Road Dog Porter;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Porter;Flying Dog Brewery;On tap at Gillys in Rockville, MD. Clear, but very dark rusty brown with a small khahi head and fair lacing.

Flying Dog Road Dog Porter;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Porter;Flying Dog Brewery;Backlog rating. Multiple bottles from Old Town. Pours a deep brown with a finger of tan head that dissipates quickly. Dark baker's chocolate aromas with some light prune and roasted malt aromas. Chalky dark chocolate, lightly sour prune and more roasted malt. Body is think and easy drinking, but the flavors don't come together as good as most do for the style.

Flying Dog Road Dog Porter;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Porter;Flying Dog Brewery;"After being sort of down on Flying Dog, I was expecting to not care for this much. Somebody had a variety pack at a camping trip and offered me a beer. This was the only one that interested me so I couldn't refuse. I know I bought the variety pack about 5-6 years ago, but couldn't remember what was in it so never got around to reviewing them, thus even more reason to try their porter again. The appearance was actually pretty decent....a dark brown near black. Not much aroma, which I find typical of most porters. I was hoping it would have a bit more flavor, but wasn't really expecting it to. Tastes of chocolate malts, slight coffee, enough hops to balance it out ok but a little light for a porter. I found this to be on the watery side, sort of like Yuengling's Porter, but for near-swill microbrew, an overall above average beer. I would recommend this as a ""budget beer"", but for what Flying Dog is charging can probably do better."
Flying Dog Tire Bite Golden Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Dog Brewery;12 ounce bottle from the sampler case. A bit more tart than similar types but overall crisp and refreshing. Better than average.
Flying Dog Tire Bite Golden Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Dog Brewery;Draft at Moriartys. Orange pour. Appears to be an old keg. Malty golden ale with tropical fruit. Mango. Orange. Spruce. Wheat bread. Still has some spark. Spicy hops but smooth. Not complex but not bad.

Beer no. 2 out of my 12 pack sampler, poured a nice well carbonated body, white 1 finger cap. Flavor and aroma was a mix of a few hops, and sweet malt, a decent balance but slightly bitter. Overall not a bad beer but i probably wont try it again.

Flying Dog Horn Dog Barley Wine;Frederick, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Dog Brewery;Malty, faint plum aromas. Dark red in color with light head. Taste is malty of plum, raisin, faint black cherry
Flying Dog Horn Dog Barley Wine;Frederick, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Dog Brewery;From Apr 2007 This one pours from 12oz bottle a clear dark brown with reddish hues and a very small head of foam. The foam doesn't really shrink much from the pouring and there's some good sticky lacing there. Gorgeous looking brew to say the least. The smell has a lot of caramel malt and fruit to it. I note plum and cherry for the fruit. The taste on first sip is just like the nose. Big notes of plum and caramel malt with some cherry tartness that is especially noticeable when I swish the beer in my mouth. Quite complex and very flavourful. Further sips in and the alcohol is starting to make its presence known but not overly so....the malt and fruit of this BWSA just won't let anything get in the way of their domination. This may be the fruitiest example of the style I've ever tasted and for me, that's not a bad thing at all. Further sips in makes me glad I picked up a 4pack of this at Wilbur's in Ft Collins yesterday and...the price was darned reasonable at only $6.99!! I think the value for the money is really top notch. Well done, Flying Dog! Bottom line: An excellent sipping BWSA that I have no qualms in recommending. See some, get some.
Flying Dog Horn Dog Barley Wine;Frederick, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Dog Brewery;2007 Vintage. Pours copper with almost no head. Sweetish bourbon and oak with vanilla, toffee and brown sugar. Just a little bit of oxidation, this has aged pretty beautifully. Full, round, vanilla finish. Very nice for this age, I thought it would be a drain pour.
Flying Dog Horn Dog Barley Wine;Frederick, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Dog Brewery;Pours a pretty copper w/ a tan head & plenty of lacing. The aroma is mostly malt w/ some booziness. The body is stunningly light for 10+%. The flavors of bourbon, oak, & malt really stand out. It has some caramel & slight bitterness in the finish. Complex, tasty, & overall a very nice offering!
Flying Dog Horn Dog Barley Wine;Frederick, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Dog Brewery;Bottled, 355ml aged 3yrs from S.H.Jones in Banbury, Oxon (when it was still open). Ruby to brown with off white head. If this were a wine I would class it as a dessert wine as it is sugary sweet more Muscato than Bordeaux. The sweetness lingers along with an apricot, alcohol note, warming, reasonably smooth. Unlike a wine I didnt spit as it is worth persevering with giving a glow on a chilly March evening. Went well with fried eggs, tomatos and potato if you are inclined.Reasonable.
Flying Dog Horn Dog Barley Wine;Frederick, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Dog Brewery;Dark tobacco brown with thin tan head. Brown sugar aroma. Heavy toffee molasses flavor and mouthfeel. Musty boozy finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can);Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);This is another one of my old reviews that RB has somehow lost. I'm estimating they're losing about 5% of old reviews. This beer is not as good as what I remember. Lots of solvent qualities in there.

Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can);Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Can, Amber color with plenty of head and carbonation. Notes are so lacking and thin for the style. Some moldy bread, water, grain, rust and cream. Light to medium bodied. One and done on this beer for the rest of my life. Actually I would sip this one if the world was coming to an end in the very near future
Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can);Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);I bought this from the alko shop in Helsinki, I was really impressed with it so much better than the normal stuff
Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can);Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Light and unintrusive, but overall pretty bland. Slightly creamy and bitter. Commendable head. Bonus points for sticking to 0.5 volume despite having nitro.
Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can);Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Another rating from the old notebook. I never really enjoyed Boddies Gold, it came out in the era of creamflow as a fashionable serving method for bitter, which of course pretty much negated everything that was good about Boddies (pre-recipe changes) in the first place. So it was another weird creamy alcoholic liquid with a nondescript bitter finish, just marginally less watery that the creamflow ordinary bitter.
Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can);Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Simply one of the worst beer i have ever had. watery and tasteless. The the only thing going right is its appearance as you pour it into the glass
Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can);Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Surprisingly good, well served at Fiddleheads in Perth, surprisingly creamy head which add to the experience. With great company and great food, it was a perfect lunch while visiting this part of the province.
Boddingtons Draught Bitter;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Can from Aldi. Amber with a fat coat of white head Pretty watery with a touch of cardboard as well as honey and a little stone fruit. But oddly the lack of body (combined with rather tentative nitro) brings the modest bitter finish into greater prominence - which for me makes it beat the Pub Ale. You could drink buckets of this but you wouldn't enjoy it much - if that isn't authenticity, I don't know what is.
Boddingtons Draught Bitter;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Beer dark orange. Aroma bread and fruit. Bakery products. On the palate there is a slight bitterness mixed with honey-malt sweetness. aftertaste fruit and caramel tones.

Boddingtons Draught Bitter;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Is there something I'm missing or is the reason that this tastes like flat beer because it pretty much is? Sorry maybe I just don't get Bitter.
Boddingtons Draught Bitter;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samlesbury (AB InBev UK);Pint from keg. Bit malty, some light fruity notes. A bit sweet taste, but actually rather thin. Nitro style dense bubbles and head.

Harpoon IPA;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Harpoon Brewery;9/11/2019. Can from Beer52. Pours pale amber with a short lasting off-white head. Aroma of hops, pine, leaves, sweet malt, caramel and syrup. Medium plus sweetness, light to moderate bitterness. Moderate bodym, sticky texture, average/prickly carbonation.

Harpoon Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harpoon Brewery;Poured into an English pint glass, the appearance was a semi-golden bronzed sort of copper color to it. Some transparency in its body and has a fingers worth of white foamy to bubbly head. Quick dissipation. Sliding lace. The aroma had some bready malts with citrus in the background. The flavor takes the prior mentioned aromas and adds a dry woodiness to it. Nicely blended aftertaste with a smooth dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt right. Overall, good for what it is, but didnt exactly look like an amber, everything else seemed mostly on par. Id have again.
Harpoon Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harpoon Brewery;[2/2/17] Draught at Harpoon Brewery in Boston. Deep golden. Grainy, malt, bready, slightly fruity, a bit of citric hops, sweetish, bitterish finish.

Harpoon Dark;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Harpoon Brewery;Thick beige capped mahogany wafting sweetly with sarsaparilla spice, Allsorts, Jamaican ginger cake crumbs, molasses, bit of glossy preserved cherry. A bit big regional English but pleasant. Sweet layered malt with black cherry, lactic chocolate on caramel, Allsorts, a scatter of rust on black bread. Decent.
Harpoon Dark;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Harpoon Brewery;6/11/2019. Can from Beer52. Pours dark brown with a short lasting off-white to beige head leaving something that looked quite insipid. Aroma of moderate roasted malt, chocolate, dried fruit, caramel and light molasses. Medium plus sweetness, light bitterness. Moderate body, watery texture, average carbonation. Sweet roasty finish. Not great and not much of a beer to have had to bring up my USA 500.
Harpoon Dark;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Harpoon Brewery;330ml can from Beer52 in 2018. Dark brown. Aroma of dark malt, dates and brown sugar. Fairly thin body. Very light roasty flavours that build slightly in the finish.
Harpoon Dark;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Harpoon Brewery;Aroma: Caramel, bread and some faint red fruits. Appearance: Deep red, clear. Creamy, white head. Taste: Sweet, a bit sour!? Medium bitterness. Palate: Medium body, average carbonation, quite smooth. Overall: Malty and smooth like it says on the can, but also slightly fruity and sour, real deal breaker for a lager.
Harpoon Dark;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Harpoon Brewery;Can at home. Pours deep brown, nose is roasted, caramel, sugary, meaty, taste is similar, sweet.
Harpoon Dark;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Harpoon Brewery;Can: Poured a dark brown black with a bubbly fast dissipating cream head. Aroma is toasty and roasty. Taste is dark malt, chocolatish, but metallic nails that screws it up.
Harpoon Dark;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Harpoon Brewery;Creamy light brown head left a spotty cover on a rich dark brown still body. Dark chocolate, caramel, malt & zesty aroma. Medium bodied, tingly on the tongue with a smooth sticky back. Demerara, nutty, roasted, rich dark chocolate & lactose tastes with a tangy fruity finish.

Taste - rich, there's a strong sweet fruity christmascake note, but also a counteveiling toasted maltiness. Body - perhaps a touch thin, and therefore coming across a tiny bit hot. Needs to be fuller. Overall - sweeter than German Dunkels I've had, but it's brewed to an ancient-by-craft-beer-standards American recipe, so good as far as that goes.
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;From old tasting notes. Bright copper color. Big creamy beige head. Fruity malt aroma is clean and fresh. Soft fruity toasted malt flavor. Pleasant spicy hop finish.well rounded and nicely balanced. A decent American Pilsner.
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;Out of retirement and back with a Bohemian vengeance. Just finished my last one of these 12oz bottles. Probably had a dozen over the summer. They sure nailed this back into existence. Vibrant deep gold. Low, persistent lacing. Buttered wheat toast and hints of sweet lemon zest on nose plus a sprinkling of something green and herby. Taste follows smell with near perfect palate feel. Prolonged beefy and bitter middle tapers beautifully to a balanced clean, dry finish. A stunner of a return. I sure hope its this good next year. A note on pilsner in CT: NO LOVE. The CT distributor sold off their large remaining portion of this beer out of state cause they couldnt sell it here. Get over the cult beers, Connecticut, and drink some classic works of art. Congrats, Harpoon, but please bring back your perfect little Belgian-style pale.
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;A beer that isnt produced anymore, but was actually quite enjoyable. Recently found an orphaned 6-pack at Kappys in Medford. Pale straw color with slight head. Crisp taste of malt on first tasting. Smooth aftertaste with only a hint of hoppiness. Wish Harpoon would re-release this so I could get a better batch to try.
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;A buddy of mine dropped one of these off for me and said he found it in his closet...and didnt know where it came from, or how long it had been there...Hehe. Clear pale gold. Crisp clean malt nose. Small white head. Sweet at first, quick, light bodied, clean dry lightly hopped finish. Nothing special, perhaps thats why it isnt produced anymore.
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;Once again Harpoon put out a beer that I can say I like. This is a beer that the unknowledgable beer drinker as well as the beer afficianado could drink together. A simple traditional pilsner with obvious flavor that sets it apart from the mass produced pilsners.
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;Bright yellow/gold. Nice and hoppy with high carbonation. I agree with Volgon, this is a good first craft brew to have your Bud friends try.
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;It's OK for a pilsener. Would be good for introducing a Bud drinker to real beer
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;"Amber color; crisp and Saazy. Good head, by the way. A solid American Pilsener."
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;Clear gold, bright white head and good lace to cling to the glass, nose is malt, crisp, clean, front is slightly sweet, top light, the finish is dry, acidic, and lightly hopped.
Harpoon Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;A nice bubbly head out of the bottle & throughout the pint, a bright golden color, not much of anything in particular in the aroma, very clean & crisp, refreshing, nice balance, very nice pilsener
Harpoon Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harpoon Brewery;I had this on special tap at the brewery, and for a light, its not bad. But you can still tell its a light. Bland, a bit watery, and seemingly a poor hybrid of their Ale and Summer. Smelled good, though!

Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;Draft Mostly clear, burnt orange ale with a small, wispy, white head. Decent retention. The nose is toasty, biscuity and grassy. Light to medium-bodied with a mildly creamy mouthfeel and tickling carbonation. The flavor leans bitter, but not by much. Pleasant, minerally hops lend to a crisp, moderately bitter finish. Thirst quenching, but lackluster.
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;Draught. Reddish brown pour. Small thin head. Some spice and bitters with a mildly phenolic finish.
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;"Tap at the Saucer. Dark orange to almost reddish appearance. White head. Small aroma. Some amount of sweet candy on the nose but not much else. Flavor is immediately dry and bitter. Almost a smacky bitter; lingers on the tongue for a length of time. Slight sweet finish. Unimpressed."
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;Copper in color with a small white head that faded quickly. Fairly average across the board. Some detection of hops and malt flavors, but all-in-all pretty bland.
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;Draught > Gingerman. This was noted as Single Hop ESB on their sheet so I hope this is it. Im pretty certain it is. Anyway, I guess this brewery just doesnt do it for me. All their beers seem very average which is frustrating b/c Id like to like them as I think theyve got potential which is why I keep trying them but am ultimately not surprised that there are far better slections on the wall. So, this guy was thin and weak w/o head and leaning more towards an IPA than an ESB. Couldnt detect the malty backbone that I look for in ESBs yet are still pleasantly bitter. Again another Harpoon beer that is one and done.
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;Nice copper pour. Nose and taste of caramels, breads, toffee and dough. Rated 6/8/02 4.1
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;"To say this is an easy drinking beer would be spot on accurate. An appearance of rusty orange, a nice size upon pour with about a 5 minute melt time which left decent lacing. Mouthfeel is light, soft and clean. Aroma is sweet, perhaps some caramel malts along with a low-level bitterness thats somewhere between ""where is it?"" and ""I think I smell something"". Taste is clean, refreshing although not very bitter, but it is slightly hoppy. Its mostly malty sweetness thats present. Overall, Id say its a decent session beer. Clean finish, nice taste but nothing to blow you away."
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;Good session beer. Not quite up to an average ESB. Light copper color with a nice head and lace. Taste is a little too sweet for my liking but it does not linger or leave the palate bitter after having more than one.
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;Way to hoppy for my taste, and ended up teetering on bitter to taste. Very, very dry finish. Served best cold, and tends to go very bad when slightly warmed in open. Looks good in the glass though.
Harpoon ESB;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harpoon Brewery;Light coppery texture gives way to reddish when the beer settles with a pinkish white head. Smells of pepper. Taste is much sweeter than I expect out of an ESB with a decent slightly bitter finish.
Harpoon Octoberfest;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Harpoon Brewery;Pours clear, dark amber with a three finger, off white head. Aroma is caramel and light Munich hops. Taste is caramel, moving to roast and Munich hops. Finish is hoppy.
Harpoon Octoberfest;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Harpoon Brewery;Pours dark amber with a thick white head. Aroma of sweetened malt. Hoppy and slightly resinous malt body. Palate has malty and hoppy elements, typical of the style. Good.

Harpoon Octoberfest;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Harpoon Brewery;I poured it from the bottle into a dimpled mug. It pours a dark amber with a fluffy, off-white head and lacing. The aroma is earthy, caramel, and biscuit. The taste is caramel, biscuit, honey, and tea. It's smooth. There's a subtle sweetness and an earthy bitterness. This is an above average version of this style.
Harpoon Octoberfest;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Harpoon Brewery;Tried a few different Oktoberfests this season, and although this didn't stand up to my favorite (Samuel Adams)...it was solid for what it is. The balance isn't quite there, as the background is the lagery Harpoon beer which is nothing special to me. But, there are some nice caramel flavors and spice in there. Also has a slight creamy texture to the mouthfeel. A slightly above average brew.
Harpoon Octoberfest;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Mrzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Harpoon Brewery;12 oz. bottle from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. Clear and coppery with some being head. Nice lacing falls down the glass. Aroma is malty and a bit earthy. Flavor is floral with gentle fruit. Caramel malts. No Fall spices noted.

Harpoon Winter Warmer;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Harpoon Brewery;Tin. WTF Beer52 are sending me this in July is anyones. Hot and thin with booze bullying a pleasant figgy sweetness. Nose alcohol, varnish, bocky dark bread, fruit loaf, liquorice and caramel. OK, its growing on me. The spices are there but discreet.

Harpoon Winter Warmer;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Harpoon Brewery;Clear dark reddish-amber beer with a head that soon fizzles down to a film. Light smell of malt and spices. Flavour is cinnamon, caramel, dried fruit, malt. It doesn't have the richness I'd like from something with these sort of flavours but the flavours themselves are nice and leave a nice, spiced finish too.

Beck's;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Purchase a 12 pack from my local Rite Aid. Thick white head on top of a pale yellow body. It's really bubbly.

It's a touch on the dry side but otherwise it's a perfect lager. it's slightly sweet with no hoppy bitterness there's a slight aftertaste I find unappealing but other than that a fine beer
Beck's;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;"This beer it seems little more light than usual for the style to me.. It smells and taste like some ordinary ""Pale Lager"" but something missing here for me. First of all i dont get the malty aftertaste so much and instead i get little more bitterness on the taste. Also it is a very dry beer and very punchy.. Overall nothing too special to me. I can find better ""Lagers"" to drink and that is the fact. Otherwise is an ""Ok"" beer to drink and nothing more.."

Beck's Dark;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This is pretty awful for a Dunkel when u compare it against others in the style. Brown color with smaller head. Notes are cracker, grain, light fruit. corn pops, and spice. Thin in the mouth.

Coors Banquet Beer;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This beer is lighter than I wouldve guessed. A solid blend of corn & wheat came through a little bit. Two tallboys for $3.98 in Louisiana. Cant complain much!

Coors Banquet Beer;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I haven't drank a Coors banquet in decades. I don't remember it being this weird tasting. It has a strange sweet medicine flavour. The type they put in prescription medicines to make it taste better for kids but ends up gross. I dont usually toss beer but I did not finish this one. I think this beer is popular due to being around for ages, commercials, and featured in media. I won't be buying it again, not even on sale.
Coors Banquet Beer;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Take this beer for what it is: Easy drinking. Cheap You need a 24 that will last a few days at the cottage and goes down easy then this is it. I enjoy a good hoppy beer or strong ale for flavour but I enjoy this beer more when I want to crush back a few on a summer day. Maybe not as good as some lagers out there but nothing to complain about. I wouldn't mind a stronger alcohol content. Solid 3.5 stars out of 5 for me.
Coors Banquet Beer;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Of course this is good beer. It's the beer that made Boulder famous. I love this beer and wish that I got invited to banquets more often so I could drink more of it.

Coors Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Nothing tops a cold Coors Light on a hot sunny Florida day. Its like when someones cums on the roof of your mouth. Also, its a beautiful party drink, a cheap beverage, that is top tier for shotgunning and other party games. Very rare you will get ID if you are underage at a store.All in all, liquid gold. Like a marenellies that went to private school.

Coors Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);One left in my fridge by my brother in-law after his familys stay at my place. Might as well rate which is weird to do after 5k rates on this site. If asked my least favorite beer in world for last 2 decades this would be my choice, although its been many years since I had last. I often would say 4 of these would give same hangover as 12 Busch light at least I used to say that 20 years ago, long before my beer snobbishness. Pale yellow brew with a smallish white head. Nose is light sour mash and wet cardboard. Tastes of corn, grain, wet dog, and tears. Some urine qualities in after taste. More bitter than I recall. I my beer journeys since college Ive had less drinkable swill but casual conversation Ill still say this is my least favorite brew.
Coors Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);330ml bottle brewed 8n the UK, bought from T-Market, drunk with lunch in Kotel. Clear straw, not much head, lacing or rising carbonation. On the nose, soft bread and biscuit malts with gentle floral hop hints. In the mouth, similar flavour profile, quite frothy at first then light texture but not actually watery, not a lot of bitterness or sweetness with a short crisp finish. A lot less terrible than expected, refreshing on a sunny day.
Coors Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pint on draught. Light gold colour with white head. Biscuit cracker malt, grainy, white bread, light corn. Super bland but not that bad for an American light lager, better than stuff like Michelob Ultra for sure

Carlsberg Export;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Can. Clear gold with a decent white head. Mild aroma of grains, grass and general blandness. The beer is only two months old but already tastes stale. Grainy, grassy and metallic. Low bitterness, medium carbonation. Pretty bland and boring even for it's style.
Carlsberg Export;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;I'm assuming this is the Carlsberg in the North American market, but no mention of Export on the label. Giant 1000 ml can from Winco. Aroma of grain, bready malt. Pours crystal clear golden with a large white head with excellent retention. Taste is mostly sweet, weirdly tart, with some light hop bitterness. Not as bad as I was expecting.
Carlsberg Export;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;"# 272; 3/2016. From Carlsberg Serbia. Slightly bitter, grainy international lager without character. Aftertaste is little bit sour. 0,5 l bottle, market, Pilsen (CZ)."
Carlsberg Export;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Shared pint can poured to snifters showing a clear, golden hue, with a decent layer of soft white froth, and spots & strands of lacing. The aroma offered a touch of pit fruit, soft grain, a hint of corn, and basically, a light lager nose. Light to medium bodied, with okay carbonation, the taste was similar, and fairly clean, adding some light grain & grass astringency.

Carlsberg Pilsner;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlsberg Brewery;330ml can, spilt from multipack in reductions bin, from Waitrose Westfield London for 55pence. Dated as best before 21/05/2020. Served fridge cold into a tumbler. The beer pours a perfectly clear gold colour with a uniform foamy faded white head. Few streams of carbonation, I would have expected more. The aroma, although minimal, clearly has light notes of grass/hay, lemon, biscuits. The taste follows the aroma. Sweet in front with the faintest suggestion of bitter hop on the back. Nothing memorable in the mouth. A light bittersweet finish on the tongue. Clearly a beer for the mass market. Not nearly as bad as the rating on here would suggest. A stepping stone of the road from Carling to Helles.
Carlsberg Pilsner;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlsberg Brewery;Can. Clear golden color with a thin head. Mild aroma of hay. Messy taste. Thin body.

Pretty tasty budget beer.
Carlsberg Pilsner;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlsberg Brewery;"I was afraid to get similar beers like the ""Pilsner Urquell"" because i had bad experience with that beer.. But i give a try to this also famous ""Carlsberg"" Pilsner beer.. The aroma smell like one ordinary ""Pilsner"" beer that wasen't the greater thing but the taste really surprised me and in the end i enjoy this beer.. It has some bittersweet taste and not some high rate bitterness.. Also the aftertaste is simply beautiful.. You feel one amazing malty taste in your mouth and that is the best part here for me.. Overall a very enjoyable and refreshing beer to drink and with the cheap price the whole thing become better.. For sure you can't compare these beers with some classic and badass belgium and german beers but like i say before, any beer has a purpose.. This beer for what it is, worth to drink it.."

Carlsberg Special Brew;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg UK;A fantastic beer with a bad reputation, which is a shame.

Carlsberg Special Brew;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg UK;Ruined! I'd been drinking Special Brew for over 40 years, won't be any more. New version is way too gassy, and doesn't taste anything like Special Brew.

Carlsberg Elephant;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - Strong;Carlsberg Brewery;If cheap beer made a strong flavor, this is it. Hard to swallow. High alcohol content doesnt make up for awful taste. Also very heavy bodied for something that tastes so shitty
Carlsberg Elephant;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - Strong;Carlsberg Brewery;Pours golden with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet and grassy malt. Taste has nice floral and rich dry bready notes. Palate is like a pilsener, dominated by bread with light elements of hops. Great.

Carlsberg Ice;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottled@The 1st Vaasa CS/ES beer session (Thanks JP!). Bought in Malaysia, 5.6% abv. Pale yellowish golden colour with mediumsized bubbly white head. Aroma is malts, some grains and quite grassy as well. Flavour is quite similar. Actually quite mild flavours for being 5.6%, as it is rather watery.
Carlsberg Ice;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;33 cL bottle, 1999 vintage. Pours clear and golden orange with a fully gone head. Aroma is dense wineous and oldis. Dramatic change from the original fully clean and towards watery aroma and flavour. Dense malty and fruity oxidised. A bit flat into the finish. Way too oxidised but better than I remember the original.

Grolsch Amber Ale;Boekelo, Netherlands;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Yeah, Id say this is slightly better than the original premium lager, but not much. Sort of like the difference between Heineken and Heineken Dark. If you prefer medium dark ambers over typical lagers, then youll probably prefer this as well. Has more of a caramel, sweet malty taste...not as skunky as the original. An average overall beer, nothing more.

Grolsch Premium Lager;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Can. Aroma of malt but not too strong. A little bit alcoholic?

Sweetish, faintly roasty aroma. Sweetish taste of licorice and faint roastiness with faintly dry aftertaste. Nice, easily drinkable, not too exciting. Overall impression is that its a beer with very little taste, but still not really boring. (On tap. I think this rating is attached to the right beer, but not absolutely sure. Served at ""Two Cats"" (whatever that is in Czech), which was very much a Prazdroj house. It was definitely Prazdroj, definitely dark, and definitely 12 degrees. This is the only beer that matches.)"

Gambrinus Premium ern;Pilsen, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Plzesk Prazdroj (Asahi);The ones I samppled were not in their freshest form, having been sitting in one of the ubiquitous kiosks in Kyiv. As a dunkel it felt quite different as the sourness of the brew reminded me, oddly, of a Guinness. It lacks balance and has a fleeting body that tended to feel thin in the mouth.

Da in Tschechien grundstzlich jeder Bier trinkt und Frauen sowieso das gleiche Bier wie Mnner trinken, denke ich dass die Zielgruppe fr dieses Bier wohl Leute sind, welche einfach keinen Zucker zu sich nehmen sollten -oder gleich Diabetiker. Es ist einfach weniger vollmundig und sffig, aber dafr mehr spritzig als ein typisches Helles. Sollte man als Diabetiker wirklich nach einem Bier suchen, ist man gut aufgehoben, aber fr den 0815-Trinker und auch den Bier-Conaisseur ist es eher langweilig."

Primus Svtl (Pale);Pilsen, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl;Plzesk Prazdroj (Asahi);getrunken im Frhling 2016 Das Primus ist eines der bekanntesten Biere in Tschechien. Das liegt aber nicht an seiner berragenden guten Qualitt, sondern einfach nur, dass man es berall bekommt und ein relativ gutes Preis/Leistungs-Verhltnis hat. Ich glaube am besten verkauft es sich in der 2l-Familen-PET-Flasche. Das Bier ist eher leicht, wobei es aber nicht nach 10grdigen wssrigen Sommerbier schmeckt. Wenn man sich billig betrinken will und aber doch ein Bier mit einem Namen haben will, kann man es gerne nehmen. Aber helles Bier aus Tschechien kann weitaus mehr.

St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle, when i was a kid. Can't really remember much, except that it was nothing compared to what i've had since. Was tasty when i had it. Refreshing too.
St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;From old tasting notes. Translucent deep reddish brown. Creamy tan head. Hoppy nose wit sweet malt. Sweet toasted malt flavor upfront. Light hop finish is slightly dry.
St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;"Dark brown/black color; Medium body; Aroma of sweet toasted malt, & caramel; Flavor of roasted malt, caramel, and some hops; Finish is slightly bitter; Surprised by this one - decent dunkel."
St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;"Rated from old notes. Pleasant, slightly sweet roasted malt taste. Fizzy, though this rapidly flattens; the head makes a quick exit as well. Light bodied, and with little complexity. Still, not an unpleasant brew and tolerable with food, and in quantity. OK."
St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Taste is roasted malt, crisp and yet creamy. Dark brown in color and mostly clear. A nutty aroma and a medium body. Smooth head with some lace. A gentle drinking lager for anytime.
St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle. Pours brown. Sweet aroma with toasted malts. Taste of roasted malt, sweet, a hint of caramel.
St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;not wretched, and a step or two or three above the classic and the NA. like a light dunkel, has the requisite flavors and aroma, just less of it all.
St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pilsener glass. The appearance was a nice looking hazy brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There was a decent dry chocolate and somewhat of a banana like smell. The taste was mainly sweet and had a decent sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat fairly light and showed a decent sessionable aspect about it. The carbonation was mainly smooth. Overall, this was not a bad Dunkel but not necessarily one of the better ones.
St. Pauli Girl Special Dark;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle at home from backlog notes 07. Pours a clear brown color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have toasted malts, caramel, light fruit character, hints of chocolate, low bitterness, flavor falls off on the finish, just a slight off note.
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle pour into pub glass. Appearance is basically clear, pale yellow with a good amount of sparkle (basically like ginger ale), with a thin white head with poor retention and mild lacing. Aroma is fairly typical Munich or Pilsner malts, Noble/European hops, in the same vein as traditional St. Pauli Girl, Beck's, Heineken. Taste follows aroma as malty with light fruit, cardboard. Mouthfeel is light bodied with thin, smooth, frothy texture, soft carbonation and finish as taste. Overall, I'm not the biggest fan of the European group noted above, but as a non-alcoholic option this doesn't stray too far from the traditional fare.
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;This is the most disgusting excuse for a beverage I believe Ive ever tasted. I couldnt even get through an entire bottle without feeling ill. The taste of this non-alcoholic beer is horrible beyond description. I have no idea how there are people on here who say they like it.
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;This is a solid skunk lager that happens to be non-alcoholic. It's got a hint of malzbier-like sweetness that's the only clue this is for the kiddies. Otherwise, a solid mass produced Euro-lager, drinkable with a touch of bitterness in the finish.
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Very pleasant. I would never know it was non-alcoholic just by taste. Very nice aroma and appearance. Light taste with decent carbonation. Nothing offensive and very refreshing I could drink these all day and be happy.
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle in California - clear golden, white head. simple n/a beer, medium sweetish, sweet malts, high carbonation. maybe close to becks n/a? :P
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Crystal clear, light yellow/green color, tall white, forever lasting head. Exuberant yeasty aroma. Light body, intense flavor, bubbly texture, watery, flat mouthfeel, long aftertaste, weak finishing flavor. Bitter, totally dry, badly lacking acidity or other tastes. Hoppy, yeasty, greens, very narrow palette of flavors. Useful if you are avoiding alcohol, amazing nose.
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Pours bright gold into a shaker. Bright white head with medium retention recedes leaving spot lacing. Skunk aromas. Soft with skunk, bitter earth and a mild watery hop finish. Honestly tastes like a regular St. Pauli Girl...
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Pours clear golden with a three finger, white head. Aroma is skunk and caramel. Taste is caramel, moving to skunk and grass. Finish is corn syrup.
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;"Pours clear solar yellow with a thick snowy head. Crisp, malty aroma unfortunately says ""Non-Alcoholic."" Flavor, though, is a little better than expected - not great, but at least it has a little malty character. Texture features good body and fizz for a ""near beer."" For a non-alcoholic, rather good."
St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle. Single purchased at Super Saver. Poured clear golden, white head. Aroma was grassy, vegetables, toasted grain. Taste was mild bitter, stewed vegetables.
Pabst Blue Ribbon;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Tasteless when cold / easy to drink Very generic lager, so fine if you are wanting a cold drink I had the sound society version, which at least had an unusual label
Pabst Blue Ribbon;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Not awful, but not good. This beer has the looks, but little to no personality. Pabst Blue Ribbon will get you drunk, but will make you vomit not because you drank too much, but because of the awful taste.

Pabst Blue Ribbon;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Aroma of old dusty hops and a little malt. Glue as well. Taste is light sweet with more old hops and a bit of crystallized sugar. Not so bad actually.

Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;16 ounce can at the house. Smells grainy. Real light yellow with thin white head.

Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Bready aroma, watery flavor with a metallic aftertaste. Mildly bitter hops. Highly carbonated.
Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Backlog, can that pours a clear golden with small white head. Flavor is cereal, grain, corn on the cob, and spice. Thin and forgettable.
Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Re-visiting beers from growing up in the 70s an 80s . Nice and cheap .Nothing special here , but nothing overly offensive .Pass for a Blatz or Strohs .
Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Best tasting beer out there. Not enough credit given to this outstanding beverage.
Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;A very smooth and refreshing beer on hot summer days after yard work. Always liked this for being what it is. A plain simple beer. Cheers.
Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;500ml can Pale straw colour with firm white head. Slight grainy aroma. Sweet grainy taste. Ho hum.
Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;There is no profound or deep taste but it is certainly an easy drinking beer.
Old Milwaukee;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pint can. Nose sweet, subtle perfume and corn, even possibly light hops. Pour very, very clear golden, still rich and attractive, supports a large and soapy bright white head. Taste actually drier than expected for this kind of beer, well-attenuated, a bit fizzy but crisp in the light body, a little bit of malt for structure, smooth-drinking throughout, no alcohol (though I can't quite shake the hangover connotation). Perfume / corn very mild here, and I think the result is drinkability -- seems a bit closer to a cream ale than most. No rough edges, or else they've been sanded off. Drinking this blind, I'd say one of the best of the beasts, one I'll happily revisit. [2018.10.28: 2.7]
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Nice touch of gold hue in appearance, head quickly disappears but good lacing. Touch of malt taste followed by smooth dry finish. If macro lagers are judged against each other, Stroh's is near the top imo. 30 pk $18.99 + tx. Cheers!
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Worst tasting brew Ive ever had in my life. Would rather suck on cow chips.
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"16 ounce can into lager glass, best before 5/28/2018. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of honey, nuttiness, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. A touch of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/corn and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of honey, nuttiness, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very good pale adjunct lager! All around nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and never watery for the ABV. Very clean and nicely rich malts/grains and solid earthy hop presence for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts, plenty of barley presence. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example. One of the absolute best AAL I've ever had for sure."
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;lol at the guy saying its a waste of money when it's about 50 cents a beer. Great for an American pale lager :) one of the best for the style for sure.
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Geurloos en smaakloos, niet slecht, maar ook niet goed. Niet veel meer smaak aan dan water.
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"wow, what a waste of money. sorry, nothing good to say about this ""beer"". if you are considering buying some of this, continue your thinking for a while longer........."
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours a clear, thin golden with a full, smooth white head. The aroma isn't strong, though its lightly floral, a little buttery, and has hay and corn. The taste has a faint sweet touch to it. Flavors are basically identical to the nose except that its even more floral. However, the overall taste is milder than what the aroma offered. Minimal floral finish. Light in body and thin in texture. This one is on the low end of the macro spectrum.
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Best beer ever. Low price but high quality. Good flavor. The most underrated beer on the market ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"From old tasting notes. Labeled as ""Strohs Signature"". Clear golden color with small bubble carbonation. Small white head. Crisp, sweet malt aroma has a slight hop background. Decent balance. Dry hop finish. Highly carbonated."
Strohs;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Brewed nicely to style.looks pretty,and actually has a little hoppiness.this pabst version tastes better than the original.a very good american lager.
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;16oz can (Old Notes)-Pours a clear golden with a decent head. Aroma of corn, grains, and malt. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew was not bad and filled the purpose in college. Purchased $.99 six packs of tall boys at Liquor Mart.
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;this was not very good beer at all. though it did have a decent golden color. and it was foamy enough. seems years ago that was the gimmick that kept us coming back, the nice robust burn of carbonation set the pattern for that ability to sense that weak and sweet malt and corny sweet with touch o hop character. that and that beer was pretty cheap.
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;tastes good or did i have too many hamms before this. nice golden look and a very simple head. reminded me of schlitz which i really enjoy. dont be snobby try a falstaff
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Actually for a mass produced beer Falstaff, wasnt that bad. I didnt have this one for years, and didnt know they had gone out of bussiness. The aroma was ok average appearance, enough flavor to satisfy, and ok on the palate. Most certianly it was eons better then Budwiesers offerings. If I had my druthers, I would druther have had Falstaff stay in bussiness and Bud close down
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;It has been ages since i have had this. From what i recall it was fairly good.
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"I liked this beer tho I cant get it anymore.Was a bit weak but still had one of the strongest flavors of the now watered down beers since their purchase from ""The Big Guys"". I wish I had been drinking this prior to the buyout. I bet it was what I like in a beer."
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This was one bad beer. Another cheaply made American lager. They finally put it out of its misery in June05. I have no idea what it looked like, because this was drunk only from the can. If its like most pale lagers, it looked suspiciously like urine, only colder. If you never tried it, consider yourself blessed.
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Thank goodness someone had the self respect to discontinue this beer. I ralphed one night after drinking this. It was not pleasant. Ralphing, in general, isnt a pleasant experience, but this seemed worse for some reason. The fact that I can remember this from almost 20 years ago stands behind my statement.
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;(12oz can. 04/2006). Yup. Found one in back of the fridge (found a couple, actually). Not the worlds worst brew, an icon that it is sad to see disappear. Alas, a little corny on the nose with almost no body. A light straw color and quite watery. Very smooth and approaching refreshing.
Falstaff;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12 oz. can. I cant believe I still had one of these rolling around. The Falstaff brand is one of the larger groups in my beer can collection. Im sorry to see Falstaff is gone. I hate seeing these regional brewers disappear. The beer itself is not very good. RIP.
Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Typical American lager. Not much different than mass market lagers. Crisp and tinny.
Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours clear, pale golden with a one finger white head. Aroma is light corn and grass. Taste is corn syrup, moving to grass and faint hops. Finish is corn.
Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;can. Poured clear gold with a bleach white head. Grainy aroma. Light bodied, high carbonation, flat finish. Bland corny grain flavour, an astringent hint, not even refreshing.

Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Tall can from LCBO. Pours a big foamy bubbly white head that dissipates to a thin layer and has a clear straw coloured appearance. Average lacing. Aromas are grainy, malty, herbal. Flavours are bland grainy malts, a bit of corn and light wheaty notes. Dry mouthfeel. Nothing special here.
Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Its not for everyone but its a solid lager with better flavor then some would like to give credit. Grain and corn combo with a subtle sweet finish.
Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;473 ml can from the LCBO. Pours a clear pale golden colour with modest-sized white head. Aroma is unpleasant with chemically character and gently corny grains. Flavour also has a chemically note with corn and other grains. Bleh.
Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can that pours a clean, very light yellow colour with a whitish cap, average stay and light foam lacing. Sweet malty nose with the corn notes and bad chemical hops. Tastes the same with the smoothness of corn that many people like. Not the grossest, but fairly rich and hard going down. Gonna eat Doritos to go with the corn right now.
Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;It's in my opinion a decent lager, fits well on a hot summer day. And there are a lot of those in Texas !
Lone Star;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;473ml can. Clear pale blonde, effervescent bubbles and a thin foamy white head. Flavors are cereals, apple, corn and grass with floral notes. Medium body, moderate to good carbonation, smooth texture.
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Drinkable lager but not as good as I'd hoped. A bit grainy and harsh. Otherwise light, reasonable beer. Can from 5 Point Cafe in Seatte.
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Drank straight from the can because no one really cares what a beer like this looks like, its likely clear pale yellow with bubbly white head. Aroma and taste of typical pale lager, crushable and light, easy drinking. The hipster PBR of the Pacific Northwest, or is that Ranier, I don't even know anymore.
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This is a value brand beer that really is worth a try. Considerably similar to Hamms which is starting to grow very popular once again. This has your classic American Style lager flavor to it, best drank very cold and I would personally suggest getting this before any major brands like Budweiser. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Clear gold with white head. Nose is weak. Vaguely sweet grain. Taste is mostly empty, nutty sugar. Light bodied with a little bite of carbonation. Yeah, its not good.
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours yellow with a thick white head. Grass, grain, light floral hop and malt aroma. Corn, grass, grain, light floral hop and malt flavors. Light body and average carbonation. Grain and grass finish
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Drank cold from the can. Not a lot going on. Some light grain. Refreshing when cold. Bad when it warms. Does its duty.
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Medium gold color. Fluffy white head. Light sweetish malt aroma. Light grainy malt flavor. Light dry hops in finish. Brief aftertaste. Drink it cold.
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Quenches thirst if very cold on a very hot day. Then again, so does water. One plus....it was my dads standby for years.
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12 oz can for $2 at Sisters and Brothers, used as a fire extinguisher for some Nashville chicken. Was it worth it? Time will tell. A lot of history with this brew, so Im at least somewhat excited to finally try this. Surprisingly, this is the first time Ive had this beer. I really thought i would.go for.the half gallon can i see at the gas station sometimes. Someday. Didnt pour this to a glass, because i dont believe such behavior is allowed. Tastes like a watered down beer, with water added. The beer served its purpose for me today. Well, thats one thing we got.
Olympia;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Golden with a fast-vanishing white head. Aroma is mainly cereal and maybe a bit of toast. Dry, malty with no real bitterness detected. Bland but fits the expected mass produced light lager profile. I would grab one without hesitation if the temperature hit triple digits.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Supposedly I never reviewed this beer. Yeah, right. It's the best of the white trash beers, or should I say white collar? It pours deep golden with very minimal white head. The aroma is pleasant compared to Busch, Mickey's, etc. so it smells like something you might want to drink, that is if you like cleaning out soiled horse pens. I didn't say good. The corn is kept in the background. And it's from Texas' oldest brewery, which isn't a brewery anymore but a restaurant with a gift shop surrounded by condos. What more could you ask for in today's global economy? Oh and the pearls!? if you look extremely hard you will see a few rising from halfway up the glass but if you're over 40 you wont be able to see them. This is a conflict of a beer, it starts off good (because you're thirsty for a beer) and ends real bad.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;From can at Boiler House. A mediocre lager. Better than run-of-the-mill lights but not by much.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Hazy, honey gold color. Creamy white head. Malty, corn syrupy aroma. Tangy citrus fruit flavor. Light hop finish is brief and watery.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated on 9/19/08. Back in the day i hear it was a pretty good beer, but times change and pearl certianly did. Taste of corn and grain, certainly is cheap enough though.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Rated based on notes taken 22 June 2012 -- Cheap Texas bar beer. Meh overall.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This actually isnt that bad. Better than quite a few macros, some light but decent flavors. Good body and carbonation for drinking in the summer.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Looking through a list of old time beers an ran across this one that I had back in the day and forgot it existed. Must not have been too memorable, bad or good.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Grabbed a 12 pack of this just for a walk down memory lane. Drank alot of pearl when I was a teen and hadnt seen it on the shelves in probably the last 20 to 30 years. As a teen I would pretty much drink any old beer this one had to have been better than it is now to have made me keep coming back. Think someone took feed corn, mashed it, and canned it. Taste like corn water and that is it. Not very good at all. Oh well another beer of my past that I just dont get why I was drinking it all those years ago. Maybe cause it was cheap.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz snubby bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a lighter golden with no head. Aroma of grains, corn, and sweetness. Taste of the same with light hops. This light bodied brew always did the trick when playing beer pool plu sit had the puzzles on crown.
Pearl;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"12oz can. Not the worst macro lager Ive had - its a good bad beer. The smell is a little ugly and unappealing, but the taste is fine, just a touch of toast and slightly bitter. Some basic cereals and basic malts, nothing fancy with the light hops. Light body, well carbonated. What can you say, its a ""classic"" - whatever that means."
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Can, as Schlitz The Bull Malt Liquor (Stroh's). Pale gold with a white head that never quite disappears. Mildly grainy aroma with a little paper. Dryish with no fumey notes. Again, slight paper. Not much of anything really. A little corn at the end where bitterness is just noticeable. Vacant. Nothing terribly offensive but nothing good either.
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;(24oz can) AROMA: light notes of malt and grain, dough, hint of yeast/cheese, slight touch of grass, nothing too negative. APPEARANCE: straw yellow, relatively light but not extra pale, decent creamy white foam head, clear, well carbonated, some residual clinging and film TASTE: unexpectedly not too flavorful, some grain/corn, light malty middle, crisp/green finish, some toast, dont really notice the alcohol PALATE: medium body, some bitter in the middle and on the end, smooth/fluid feeling, easy to drink without being too wimpy OVERALL: better than I was expecting, easy to drink but with a touch of body and malt/toast flavor, pop retry simple. An average, drinkable beer.
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Bright honey gold color. Creamy white head. Pungent, vinous malty aroma. Flavor is initially bittersweet but fades quickly to become bland and listless. Light sour aftertaste.
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Aroma and flavor is grainy/malts, apples and a sweet/somewhat alcoholic finish.
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;If your drinking this beer because you like the way it smells or taste. Give me a break. I love the bull. Its not for the weak or people who like yuppie beer. Its for grown folks who can handle a good stiff beer. All yall cry babys go drink some coors lite
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"Only tried it because the grocery store I stopped at specifically to buy the regular/classic ""1960s"" Schlitz apparently no longer stocks that delicious old-man beer. Ugliest, most randomly jumbled can design Ive bought in a while. My decidedly-low expectations are exceeded, slightly; no overwhelming corn sweetness or off metallic flavor that is so typical of most malt liquors. The taste is actually very plain and more like a regular, bargain-price American macro lager. The sweetness predominates but mainly because there is little else going on. Not as good as Genny Cream Ale (which I admit I like), and priced more like PBR, so I doubt Ill pick up another 6er any time soon, but perfectly drinkable. Nothing to look at, nothing interesting in the aroma, yet nothing offensive. Basic 5.9% beer, drink it if you arent picky or want to get drunk."
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Can (from Miami). Pale yellow color, small white head. Aroma of light green apple and alcohol. Light-bodied, watery palate. Soft flavor has some corn and green apple. Watery, simple, sweetish.
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;473ml can. Pours a light, clear gold with a foamy white head. Doesnt dissipate nearly as quickly as some. Aroma is corny and a touch sour. Hint of sweetness and alcohol nuttiness. Flavor is alcoholic and dry, some metal, sugar, corn. Not a favorite malt though it is smooth. Blind tasted with a slightly older red, this was more acetoney and cheap tasting smelling.
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;It is what it is. Really pretty foul. Only time I ever drank this was in college when a cheap buzz was the final objective. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Schlitz Malt Liquor OML;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Bottle-At least it was too bad. A fizzy white head sat on a pale yellow brew. The aroma was slightly skunky that was mostly of corn and malt. Some corn and dough (not malt) in taste. Pretty much a no nothing finish. I tend to like malt, so maybe that help to improve my rating. Produce place 1.99
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Wodnisty lager, pachncy kukurydz i od zasypu i od DMSu. Do lekki wic w upalny dzie, dobrze schodzony powinien uj w tumie.
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Turns out I have not tried this one... Smell- weak, maybe hops. Foam- thin, watery, some bitter-sweetness and maybe hops. Head is quite small, but not tiny, white color. Appearance- unique brewery bottle cap, clear yellow, orange amber, medium carbonation. Taste- weak bitter notes, hops, quite refreshing, but apart from that nothing to really brag about, but definitely not as terrible as advertised, this no fancy beer, but compared to average lager it stands at the same place so score should be same.
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Nie jest ze ale tez nie jest dobre. Ujdzie w toku. Dupy nie urywa 5/10 taka sytuacja
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);It's ok... nothing special. White head, not very pleasant or strong after taste. It's better with a slice of lime lemon
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Not much nose, slightly malty and biscuity. Light-medium body, not much flavor, but what there is is nicely balanced. Unobtusive finish. A light beer, slightly maltier than most mass-market pilsneroids, but not much to talk about.
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);I wouldn't compare this to any craft beers by a long shot. Not a whole lot of character. It's purely for refreshment on a hot summers day. The drinkablity is very high, I've easily slugged these back. It's crisps, clean, abit of lemon. It's ok for what it is.
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);this is a good beer, after how I drink this beer I feel good, I don't feel a headache or drowsiness. This beer tastes soft and constantly carbonated
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);It is a mystery that such a poor beer has become so popular in the world. Light beer with slightly bitter aftertaste. No real character or body. Disappointing to drink every time.
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Really nice beer on a hot day with the boys! Its got a summer feel to it and is very easy drinking! Wouldnt say its the best beer ever but it sure is a nice beer!
Corona Extra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);I've been ejoying Corona for over 30 years 12 months a year. Sure, I will try a new beer here and there and some are not bad. I still end up finishing with an Ice cold Corona with or without a lemon or lime. Always seems to hit the spot!! If only my cat would let me get to the only one left in the 12 pack. I have her on video unwilling to let me take one. It's very funny! Have to go, all this talk about a cold Corona has made me thirsty!! Cheers
Corona Light;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);This beer taste like piss and shit, the only reason I gave it a 1.1 is because the Nelk boys send Coronas.
Corona Light;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);This tastes like tap water filtered through my grandmothers pantyhose. Lord it is not the best beer ever. No wonder people loaded up with lemons and limes. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Corona Light;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);355 ml clear bottle. Clear, straw colour, thick white head, medium low carbonation. Aroma of white bread and corn. Mouthfeel is thin, low carbonation. Tastes as the aroma. All in all you get what you expect, an adjunct light lager, brewed with corn syrup. Nothing wrong with it, it's just dull.
Corona Light;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);4-4-3-1-7 Bottle, 3,9 ABV, 11 months before bbd. Finally I get to this timeless classic. All the way from a continent far, far away comes this watered down version of the otherwise brilliant, near perfection of tastelessness. Pours a beautiful crystal clear, pale yellow, with a creamy head. Some sharp, citrusy hoppiness in the aroma, with a flat, dull biscuity sense of malts, with notes of dry, Mexican hay. Light to medium body, with average carbonation. Flavour has a sharp, citrusy hoppy edge, and light biscuity malts with floral notes of honey, minerals and hay. It's almost kind of fresh and rather crisp, with a nice dryness. Yet, still there's a sweet finish of cardboard, garden compost as well as light metal and garbage that's no winner in my little book of beer preferences.
Corona Light;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Blah. If you're going to drink a beer that has barely any substance there are better options than this. Looks like pee. Flavor was muted but it's what people want I guess.
Corona Light;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Bottle, mexican piss golden color without much lasting head. Notes are piss, cereal, cracker, and the lime that the asshole barkeep put into it. Thin and trashy
Corona Light;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Can from Arizona - clear pale golden, white head. actually better than I thought. not overly sweet. not much else going on here, of course. watery.
Modelo Negra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Dark Lager - Premium;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Wow, this is an amazing fluid. I can recall every time I drank Modelo Negra, and every time I had a great experience each time. This dark brew is not too strong, but not too weak with the alcohol percentage. Also, the taste is one of the gods, there is no way I could ever consider chugging this beautiful beverage, as it is too much quality for a beverage, and I just savor every swig. Finally, the presentation of the beverage is quite A1, as the golden top of the bottle that holds the cap is quite the scene. This drink all in all gets the blood flowing!
Modelo Negra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Dark Lager - Premium;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Medium dark reddish clear with an off white to cream colored head. The head dissipates rather quickly. I dont detect a lot of smell, some sulphur and a very light caramel sweetness. The taste is rather light, theres a slight sweetness and a little toasted malt note. It has a medium mouthfeel, the sweetness of the caramel malts lingers. Fortunately there is enough hop to give it a little bite so its not cloying. Its pretty complex for a mass produced Mexican beer. I like it, theres really nothing wrong with it. I will definitely have this again.
Modelo Negra;Mxico DF, Mexico;Dark Lager - Premium;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);Cerveza de color cobrizo, ligero y de carbonatacin media. Aroma dbiles a malta y caramelo. En boca es ligeramente dulce con una sensacin de caramelo.

Espuma blanca de ms de un dedo de espesor y corta retencin. Aroma tenue a cereal, notas de limn y heno. Sabor plano a cereal, final corto sin apenas amargor, alcohol imperceptible, refrescante. Textura acuosa. Carbonatacin media media alta. Puntuacin baja por su inocuidad pero no presenta fallos evidentes y es refrescante.
Pacifico Clara;Mxico DF, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Modelo - Corona (AB InBev);At don Taco. Pours clear medium yellow. Decent white head. Bready lager aroma, inoffensive. Similar bready taste, almost no hops, light inoffensive. Goes pretty well with Mexican food.
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);My go to beer. Better than any of the basic light beers, and cheaper too. Maybe not the best beer ever, but its 5 bucks a 6 pack.
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);473ml can (TCrBF2018) (3:2:3:2:5=1.5) Just a messy watery corny pale lager, a bit nasty. Not as bad as some of the horrors at the fest but still pretty darn terrible.
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);zapach bardzo lekki, troch zielonej butelki, troch skrki z jabek, jaki kurz, woda spod warzyw i sody. wszystkiego trzeba si doszukiwa. kolor bardzo jasny, soty, somkowy, klarowny, piana biaa, rednio obfita i krtka. w smaku wytrawne, wodniste, bardzo lekkie zboowe nuty, odrobina kurzu i zielonej butelki, kukurydza. nie jest niedobre, ale nie ma smaku praktycznie. goryczka bardzo niska, kukurydziana i liciasta. w ustach gazowana woda. nasycenie wysokie.
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Purs a pale yellow with a whte head the leaves lacing. The nose is slight cereal. Body is thin. Taste is sweet with slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste. 16 oz can
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);The flavor of the beer, however, is lacking. There is a quite a lot of residual sugar in Rolling Rock and virtually no hops bittering, only a hint at the end, so this beer is somehow both watery and cloying at the same time.
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Ordinary lager beer. Slightly sweet malt and crisp, hop bitterness. Hop aftertaste.
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Refreshing and affordable. Rolling Rock is what beer should be. Taste buds change throughout one's life. Currently, I'm a light lager guy. (When I was a young buck, my beers looked like used motor oil.) You can't go wrong with Rolling Rock. If you buy it can, I recommend pouring it in a glass.
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Nothing much going on here. I would prefer something else than this one, for me a very boring beer.
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Overall its solid some people might hate the DMS taste but I think its a lot more subtle than people say its mild and refreshing also maybe its just me it kinda taste like colt 45 just lighter that might sound awful to some but for me that sounds pretty good
Rolling Rock Extra Pale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Taste: crisp, thin mild hops character, slight citrus notes. Mild nose. Golden hue, clear, with tall white foamy head, not much lace. Medium /light body. Light like a boating beer.
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Enjoyed this beer. Nice lager. Better than most as actually has some flavour. Nice head on the pour. Recommended if looking for a crisp lager
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Color amarillo plido con tonos verdosos, transparente. Espuma blanca de ms de un dedo de espesor y corta retencin. Aroma escaso a cereal y notas ctricas. Sabor igual, con el dulzor un poco excesivo del maz, final corto y escasamente amargo, alcohol imperceptible. Textura acuosa. Carbonatacin media.
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Uit een flesje. Bleek geel, weinig schuim. Voor de dorst aardig, maar verder een gewoon waterig pilsje.
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);A very smooth lager without a bitter aftertaste or strong smell upon opening. Pairs very well with most American fan food such as hot dogs, burgers, etc. This is a truly enjoyable lager to share with friends. Two Thumbs Up!
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Shitty beer done Jamaican-style. Just as corn-tasting and metallic as a terrible American lager, but with the added joy of a stubby bottle. Which, to be honest, is nice, since its stubbiness means you get .8 ounces less of this awful beer.
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Need to rerate as no notes taken. Enjoyed at Beach Hut pop up bar in North Berwick on draft.- rerated as sessioned in cans. Nice head retention and thoroughly enjoyed.
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);A light brass colour, clear like glass. Looks and tastes really fresh. Funnily enough tastes a lot stronger than it is - every percentage of alcohol gets through. Close to no bitterness, but quite sour, not in a bad way though. Take your time with this one, the taste doesn't kick in right away - savour it. Heavily carbonated, more than I was prepared for. This is clearly a social beer, drink it with friends in the sunshine at a BBQ or party. It's everything you would expect from a Caribbean beer, so if that's your style, I recommend this one.
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Can. Found it on a train. I dont care. Green tinged, clear, pale gold. Decent foam of white. Nose has corn syrup and envelope glue. Taste is a little sweet. Barely any bitterness here. Mouthfeel is a bit greasy. Burp inducing carbonation. Some bitterness on the finish.
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Standard clear gold lager with a low butterscotch flavour. Easy to drink and better than your other budget lagers but nothing special.
Red Stripe;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);"330ml bottle brewed at 4.7% in the Netherlands. Bubbling head of average size, didn't last long. Generic lager aroma, and faint at that. Yellowy colour. Medium carbonation. Not much taste - a little breadiness, a little grassiness, none of which lingers at all. Not bad, but next to nothing here for someone who wants to get something out of their beer besides the ABV and the wetness. There's a reason the bottle says serve ice cold. As with several ""nation's #1 beers"", it would appear they win that position by ensuring they don't have enough taste to offend anyone's palate."
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Gets you rather drunk rather quickly, leaves you with a bad head also but then again that's if your like me and drinks 15 bottles of the stuff on a weekend, my favourite drink right now
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);9.6 oz bottle. Pours very black brown with a dense tan head. Sweet malt and coffee scents. Taste is sweet up front with a slight edge of bitterness with vanilla notes dominating. It ends up balancing well. Sticky mouthfeel. Not bad.
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Sweet, dark with a ting on the front if the tongue. Thick syrupy finish. Lingering molasses. Overtones of a sugar high... headache coming. Its very sweet.
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Had from 9.6 oz bottle. Smells of chocolate. Taste is sweet, moderately bitter from dark malt and some hops - average stout taste, nothing noteworthy. For an adjunct laden beer, fairly well done.
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Bottle in Orange New Jersey. Aroma of mocha and dark fruit. Pours a dark brown. Minimal brown head. Flavors of mocha and dark chocolate. Very nice but less than 9 ounces is very odd. But a very yummy sweet stout.
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Proefglas van 28,4cl-fles. U: Donkerbruin met een dunne beige schuimkraag. G: Amandelpit, maraschinokers, karamel en esters. S: Zoet. Karamel, amandel en esters. Droge afdronk. M: Weinig body en medium carbonatie.
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Easily the best beer I bought in the mixer sixer from Blackbeard's Liquor in Cayman Islands. It has a nice moderate body that drinks smooth. Little head. Nice chocolate flavor with a little bit of bitterness. Good beer.
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);This is what happens when Budweiser and Guiness have a love child. Not horrible, but nothing special
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Wasnt expecting much from a tropical stout. Was definitely too thin. Taste was ok.
Dragon Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Dark brown beer with medium beige head. Aroma is sweet syrup, malty, sugar. Taste is also quite sweet, sugar, malty, some alcohol. Creamy texture. Overall sweet creamy stout.
Rolling Rock Bock;Latrobe, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Latrobe Brewing Company;"Im sorry, I couldny even get the first mouthfull down. Tasted grain alcohol, like a malt liquor, been sick a couple of nights in a row, figgured it wasn;t worth it. Down the drain."
Rolling Rock Bock;Latrobe, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Latrobe Brewing Company;THE BEST AMERICAN MADE BOCK!!! With the exception of most all other bocks.

Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Found from notes circa 2001 while cleaning the basement. This one was a golden color with aroma and taste notes of pale malt, hops, and mild fruit. I vividly recall all the hoopla surrounding the frogs obscene gesture.
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;copper amber color, smells like cider. apparently this is retired, so maybe my bottle is just old. since this beer is retired, and the last rating is from 2002, im guessing its just an old bottle. mostly malty taste with some thin hints of bitterness at the end--better than most macrobrews but not great. ill admit to buying it for the label.
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;"Golden color with a smallish head. This was a typical contract brew with a ""cute"" label."
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Okay stuff, if just for the label. I drove by the HQ for a long time and there was one of their bars for a while downtown, but it didn't make it. I enjoyed it okay, and it is better than most megabrews, but considering it was made in Frankenmuth, I would have expected more.
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;The label rocks. That's about it as I probably have overrated it. Can anyone tell me where I can get this stuff, especially the other brews they have? I haven't seen it in a long time. The only time I had it was at LSSU on a weekend.
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;My deepest apologies to Emily, who deserves better, but this poem seems appropriate to a dreary beer: I'm Nobody! Who are you? Are you - Nobody - Too? Then there's a pair of us? Don't tell! they'd advertise - you know! How dreary - to be - Somebody! How public - like a Frog - To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Gets a whole bunch of points for having a cool label and specifically for sponsoring my RAGBRAI team (Team Frog) a few years back. Doesn't get much in terms of points for flavor, unfortunately.
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;I bought this beer when they finally allowed it and its label into NYS. Wish they would have kept it out on quality grounds. Would have rated it even lower, but it is better than Bud or Rolling Rock (on the other hand it costs twice as much).
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Once was enough.............................................................
Bad Frog Golden-Amber Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;If nothing else the label is cute. Average beer, fair malts and hops, a little weak for my taste, but still a clean and refreshing beer.
Bad Frog Bad Light;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Typical light beer. Clear and thin. Not too bad for a microbrew. I had it when Bad Frog taverns still existed.
Bad Frog Bad Light;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;12 oz. bottle. Im going by memory here. I originally drank this beer maybe 2 or 3 years ago. Fizzy, light yellow with virtually no head. No aroma to speak of. Unpleasant flavor (and Im being charitable). I still like the logo a lot and have a bottle of this crap sitting on my bar in the basement.
Bad Frog Bad Light;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Even weaker and nastier than the original. How do they do it? Water with a funny taste and a pale color. Yay. I mean boo, hiss.
Bad Frog Bad Light;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;This beer would be great to drink if they sold it in this state.............
Bad Frog Micro-Malt;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Malt Liquor;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;This was the only Bad Frog beer I could tolerate at the brew pub that was within walking distance of our house. Apparently most people felt the same way since the place closed down within a few months, even thought it had decent jumbalaya.
Bad Frog Micro-Malt;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Malt Liquor;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;You know, this stuff actually has some character - it's the only Bad Frog that my bride, a friend of brown ales and stouts, will even look at after trying the sampler.
Bad Frog Rockin Raspberry Wheat;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Had this beer when Bad Frog Taverns were still in existence. I found this beer not bad for a raspberry wheat It was smooth, a malty? finish
Bad Frog Rockin Raspberry Wheat;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Has to be one of the most disgusting beers I have ever tried................
Bad Frog Bad Brown Brown Ale;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Inconsistent, I had two and they were very different. Color was nice, foam okay. Flavor was good, but weak.
Bad Frog Bad Brown Brown Ale;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Very little to distinguish it from any of their other beers. As a brown ale drinker, this has to be the weakest brown ale I have ever tried.
Bad Frog Bad Brown Brown Ale;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;There used to be a Bad Frog a block away from my house in Waterford, Mich. My saving grace was that the beer just wasn't very good, though this brown ale was the best of the lot. An interesting roasted flavor, just oddly textured and sometimes a bit off.
Bad Frog Lemon Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Brewed by Evansville Brewing-Pours clear golden with a small white head. Aroma and taste of lemon. This light bodied brew is not bad and fills a need on a hot summer day.
Bad Frog Lemon Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;If you like lemon brews I strongly suggest this. Very refreshing taste with a slight sour after taste. Not bad at all!
Bad Frog Lemon Lager;Rose City, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bad Frog Brewery Co.;Overall pleasant taste. Great on a really hot day, the touch of lemon isn't a good match with some foods. The refreshing flavor stands well by itself.
Bavaria Pilsen (Brazil);Jacare (SP), Brazil;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA Cerveja Brasil;Can in Brazil - now (?) brewed by Heineken Brazil - beer is very watery and resembles more a soft drink than a beer. weird.

Tremont Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Nice copper pour. Aroma is caramel malt. Taste is smoked malts. Better than expected. Rated 2/24/04
Tremont Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Maybe it is because I have been having a few really good brews recently but this was just really bland and boring. copper ale color with lots of lacing on pint glass. Some malt taste and a bit of soapiness. Bar wasnt very good so maybe they had dirty lines. in any case i wont be bothering with this again.
Tremont Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Bottled. An amber beer with a huge lazing orangey head.

Tremont Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;I have this vague memory of drinking Tremont Ale on tap at a place on Tremont Street in Boston. Back then I believe it may have been brewed locally and not by Shipyard but I could have my facts wrong with this. A more recent taste found it to be thinner and less impressive from what I remember.
Tremont Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;12 oz bottle, labeled as Tremont Patriot Pale Ale. Thanks LooseCannon! Lightly hazed amber with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Lots of carbonation. Bready nose, mild malt, light earth. Mildly bitter earth flavors, mild nuttiness. Meh. Would be better if it wasnt so weak. Its like a BMC English...
Tremont Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;"Feb. 8, 2009; 12 oz. bottle sampled in an English pint glass. Odd that an English style is (now) marketed as ""Patriot Pale Ale!"" Overall, this is pretty true to the commercial description. The hops generate interest (even if they are a bit sharp), but the lack of substantial aroma and somewhat-watery taste left the brew off-kilter and slightly disappointing. Id rather have a Bass."

Tremont Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Tremont Brewery;This tasted like a decent porter, except for the carbonation. It was like soda, dude. The beer was so fizzy that i could barely make out any taste. I don't know if it's because I drank it unrefrigerated, the bottle was a little old, or what. If it wasn't for the excessive amount of carbonation, I think this would have been much better. I made the mistake of taking a big gulp to start, and my throat hurt so bad. It felt like i swallowed a golf ball. Yeeeeeeeowch!!!
