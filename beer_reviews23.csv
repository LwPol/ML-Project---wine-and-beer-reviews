Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee,Wisconsin,United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;"""Not bad, not something I�ll likely have again. This mild ale is obviously pretty light in aroma, body, flavor...hints of earthy matiness, dark fruit and a hint of hop bite."""
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;12 ounce bottle from local store. Can�t tell year, hope it wasn�t too old. Pours an orange gold with a small white head. Aroma of malt and grass. Taste is mild hops, citrus and some hops. Average at best.
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;Had at Lakefront brewery. Not a particularly complex ale but if you needed a easy drinking session beer and didn�t want a pale lager this would be a nice bet. Too bad it is retired. Serving: Tap
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;botle from apossibly aged 8 pack. medium golden pour, medium dose of caramel malt in the aroma, taste was mild malt sweetness, fruity with a hint of a sour twang
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;Bottle from a mix 8 pack. Says that it was bottled in late December (week 4) of 2009, so I don�t think it is retired. Pours with a hazed golden body with minimum white head. Aroma of earthy and a bit bitter. Slight spicy hop, and a similar lactic quality to the one found in Guinness of all things. Taste is slightly fruity, lightly lactic, grainy and watery. A bit of pitted fruit. Not much going on. Medium bubbles. Dryish finish with a touch of sourness.
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;A: Pours a nice light clear yellow hue with a tall foamy white head. Okay retention with just a spot or two of lace. S: Very sweet malty aromas. Lots of fresh bread with hints of cream of corn. T: Malty sweet up front. Mildly doughy with the corn coming through. There is a wonderful hop addition though to balance all the sweetness. Mild citrus notes with a nice bit of bitter floral and grassy hops in the finish. M: Light in body, smooth, sparkling carbonation. D: Good, for a lighter beer this one really packs a punch. Too bad they retired it cause it is the best Lakefront beer I have ever had. Beats all the light Macro swill by a mile. For what it is, a real solid beer.
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;12oz bottle. Pours an orangeish color with a huge foamy white head. Head stays at around 1.5 fingers. Nose is grassy with a light straw and toast malt note. Palate is fizzy and stingy with a medium feel. Flavors are grass and straw, hay, etc with some light toast and lots of foam and fizz.
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;12oz bottle. INFECTION!!! woooooo INFECTION! but its seems to be a positive thing for this beer so I shall rate it! The description of this beer is quite odd. Pours a very clear glowing golden with a medium foamy sudsy white head. Aroma is fruity, lightly sweet and tangy, some sour, touch of acidity and maybe some brett. Wow... It�s almost lambic-like, which make sense as its now a funky low-alcohol blonde ale. Flavor is fairly sharp, some acetic, loads of funky cheesy brett, light hard-candy caramel glassy sweetness, but mostly dry. Med/light bodied with larger somewhat corse soda carbonation, quite dry. Happy infection here.
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;Appearance is yellow, slightly orange color with mild off white head. Aroma is bitter, yeasty smell with a grassy, malt, sharp hops taste.
Lakefront Cattail Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Lakefront Brewery;Had this from a mix 12-pack I picked up while visiting Milwaukee. A solid ale, but nothing special by any means.
Southern Tier IPA;Lakewood, New York, United States;IPA;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Just another IPA beer. Fruity flavors with a decent finish. Alcohol level is well blended in the body of the beer. Not bad.
Southern Tier IPA;Lakewood, New York, United States;IPA;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);This bottle is coming from the beer of the world, at Geneva. I have tasted and enjoying this bottle at Bonfol, in the house of Vincent, during the last winter. It is a tasteful and aromatic american IPA. As usual, you get a decent resinous bitterness, a bit soily, a bit sweet due to the hop, the malt and the alcool, dry malt. The body is brown, clear, average carbonation, thin and white foam.

Hoster Gold Top;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hoster Brewing Company;Draft sample. The beer is a clear copper with a white head of foam. Doughy and moderately lemony aroma. Bready and sweet taste. Medium body and medium carbonation.
Hoster Gold Top;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hoster Brewing Company;Approximately 16 oz mug draft at Schmidts Sausage Haus in Columbus, Ohio. The pour is a clear golden copper, with a smallish white head. Nice lace left on glass as the head recedes. The aroma is bright grain, toast, and a touch of malt sweetness. The taste is a delicate blend of the lightly sweet malt, and the toasted cracker malt. The taste thins out a bit before showing some mineral earth in the finish. The palate is light bodied, a bit dull on the carbonation, and finish has the mineral and is bright and clean. Tasty, easy drinking beer.
Hoster Gold Top;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hoster Brewing Company;Got this on tap at Leghorns in Athens, Ohio. Pours a clear, gold with a medium white head. The aroma is almost all hops with an even mix of spruce, grass, and some earthy undertones. This is a quite bitter beer all the way through. Somewhat thin with a light to medium body and a thin, slightly bitter finish. This is not a bad brew and I wouldn�t mind having one again on tap during happy hour.

Hoster Gold Top;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hoster Brewing Company;July 17-19, 2008: Finally, the return of Hoster Gold Top! Unfortuntately, it just isn�t as good as I remember... This beer has a clear golden appearance and has large carbonation bubbles but lacks any sort of head or crown. Basically this beer is a fairly typical gold-colored macro brew with a bit more malt and color. Overall it is a smooth, decen American-type lager. Draught sample at The Smiling Skull Saloon in Athens, Ohio during Ohio Brew Week 2008. Rating #14 for this beer.
Hoster Gold Top;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hoster Brewing Company;Draft sample at Barleys Afternoon with the Brewmasters. Poured clear golden color with an average frothy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Solid balanced citrus sweet aroma. Medium body with soft texture and soft carbonation. Medium balanced flavor with a medium smooth sweet finish of moderate duration. Drinkable brew and above average for the style.
Hoster Gold Top;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hoster Brewing Company;I had this on draught at the pleasant Schmidts authentic German restaurant in the very cute German Village district. It was called German Village lager on the menu, but the waitress could direct me towards the Gold Top. It�s a hazy golden lager wearing a foamy 1cm white head. Clean, but actually fairly yeasty for a German derived lager. Still, we�re mostly talking bready yeastiness and since the malts are all about breadiness, it works hand in hand. Not much hops come in to complement the duo. Generally well done, but it felt as if the water was perhaps a bit too hard as the mineralic notes felt out of place.

Big River Grille Irish Red Lager;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);The last of many beers at Big River on Saturday night. I didn�t finish it and wasn�t very impressed. It felt stale and malty. It also took forever to come out as the waitress was in the weeds all night. I�m probably not being fair, but I don�t get the good reviews on this beer. It was flat and not worth the calories.

I wasn�t kidding when I rated the Pilsner. Drop this one. Lager, but even there it�s well, uninspired and bland. Nose is grain and stagnant water. Taste is the same with some wheat and maybe some orange. Couldn�t really grab much else from this. Better not to spend your money this way, even if you only like lagers."
Big River Grille Irish Red Lager;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);On tap at Chattanooga. Pours quite red with a good white head. The aroma is very woody with bicuity notes and something like damp basement. There is a surprising level of European hop bite in the flavor. It�s very woody with a pleasing dry finish. Hints of apples and bread are noted. This is a very crisp, clean beer. This delivers in the way I�d hope a typical lager to. It�s not bad at all.

Big River Grille Irish Red Lager;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Draught in Chattanooga: This one pours with a small white head that dropped off almost immediately and left no lacing. It is an absolutely clear amber color. The aroma is a little light, although pleasant. Just hints of some toffee, malt, roastiness and earthiness. The taste is good. It had just a touch of sweetness to it. Pretty good balance with a hint of bitterness on the finish. No bad, it will appeal to many, but is rather non-descript.
Big River Grille Irish Red Lager;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Draft in Chattanooga w/ Shag/Clash. Poured a dark amber to copper color with a nice initial head, decent lacing. The aroma was light roast, some caramel. The flavor followed suit, although mixed in and underneath was a corny adjunct flavor that started to get annoying by mid-glass. The first half of the glass was drinkable, probably the best of the four I did at BR Chattanooga (although not lager crisp, even had some fruity ester notes over top of it), but with warmer temperatures, I couldn�t get past the adjunct flavor in each sip. Imbalanced clearly to the malty side of things.

Samuel Adams Pale Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Boston Beer Company;Draught at the brewery, 11/10/18. Glowing copper-tinted maize. White head atop is medium-sized, but falls quickly to cover. High clarity and well-carbonated. Nose is rich malt with lovely cereal-rich barley, light and toasty with honey emerging more strongly as it warms. A hint of toffee in there, perhaps, but it stays true to the base malt without getting too bready or finding any medium/crystal malt character. Light white grape, fresh herb and grass from the hops, which are quite light and more of an afterthought. Clean and with no alcohol. A bit monotonous with the base malt character, but what's there is quite enjoyable and well-done. In the mouth it's soft, malty, slick at times with a good deal of residual sugar but balanced pretty well by gentle acidity from lightly toasted malt character and grassy, herbal hops. Honey, nectarine, toasted white bread, pepper and herb all create a harmonious character, with strong honey lingering on the finish. Low, fairly engaging carbonation. Again, a bit simplistic, but still enjoyable. The malt character shows through very nicely.
Samuel Adams Pale Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Boston Beer Company;German style lager that is very average. Slight pale taste with hoppiness.
Samuel Adams Pale Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Boston Beer Company;When you go on the Sam Adams brewery tour you sometimes get to sample their newest inventions before they hit the general market. This was one of those times. The Pale Bock was served from a tap with a hand drawn picture on the handle. It poured a nice orange gold and retained it's head for a good while. The aroma was discreet. I actually had to concentrate to pick up the faint hoppy smell. The flavor was citrusy, and had a VERY strong hops assault. The finish was quick and crisp, but was a little unsatsfying. Luckily they were serving food on this tour (which is rare). The Pale Bock was MUCH MUCH better when I drank it while I was eating. The flavors in the food (Jumbalaya) were well complimented. But despite the good turnaround there at the end, I'm not sure this one will make it to the public any time soon.

The mouthfeel is extremely soft, almost ""velvet"". With hints of grave juice too. The palate is thick, not that sour, and very, very dry. A smooth and soft drink. Low in alcohol too - although I can�t say what the alcohol ABV was - and rather basic, thin, not that complex: More juice than a fermented brew."

Pours slightly hazy deep orang amber/light copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pineapple, mango, citrus peel/rind, mint, wood, pepper, pine, caramel, toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. A bit muddy aromas. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pineapple, mango, citrus peel/rind, mint, wood, pepper, pine, caramel, toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pineapple, mango, citrus peel/rind, mint, wood, pepper, pine, caramel, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy/sticky, and slightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol for 5.5%. Overall this is a nice IPA. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish, not aggressive. Classic tasting IPA. Centennial, Cascade, Fuggles. Nice juicy, dank, and earthy balanced hop complexity; nice dark/bready malt backing, with minimal residual sweetness from lingering dryness. A nicely enjoyable offering."
Thomas Creek Class Five IPA;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Thomas Creek Brewery;One of the better ones I've tried from this brewery. Figured it would be about average for the style, but was quite solid. A little on the weaker strength-wise, yet decent amount of malts and good hop balance makes up for it.

Rocky Run Brew House Barrel Stout;Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Rocky Run Tap & Grill;Poors a very dark brown with purple highlights and with a thin beige head. Scent is mostly of coffee, which is the dominate taste and aftertaste. It seems quite possible to me that they took a stout and then poured some coffee into it, resulting in a brew that is a little thinner than your average stout and tastes a lot liked a chilled espresso. Smooth and pleasant.
Rocky Run Brew House Barrel Stout;Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Rocky Run Tap & Grill;While this Stout does have a bit of a burnt barley flavor to it, the first thought was - taste like they use Cough Syrup in the recipe. It was extremelly light for a stout and difficult to drink because of the awkward cough Syrup flavor.
Kona Big Island Ginger Beer;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Flavored - Other;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Tap at brewery. Pours copper with minimal head. Aroma is mostly sweet toasted malts. I thought I smelled ginger at first, but I couldn�t find it after that. Taste brings some fermented sweetness. Not a whole lot going on with this beer, which is disappointing. Thin mouthfeel and clean finish.
Kona Big Island Ginger Beer;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Flavored - Other;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Okay - I must admit, I couldn�t detect any ginger in the aroma, and very little ginger in the flavor. But those at my table thought I was crazy - everyone else could taste a ton of ginger. So for me, this was merely a mediocre blonde ale. But I�m sure others would find it differently.

Kona Big Island Ginger Beer;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Flavored - Other;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);On tap at Koko Marina. Pours reddish-orange with a white head. Aroma is pretty minimal, perhaps some estery notes. Flavor is bold, but perhaps a bit muddy. I struggled to really locate the ginger flavor, yet my girlfriend said she definitely tasted it. For me, Kona has toned it down to much. Ginger should be, at minimum, spicy, distinctive, and a great complement to hops. I didn�t get that out of this brew.
Kona Big Island Ginger Beer;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Flavored - Other;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Tap. Ginger and malt aroma. Amber color with moderate head. Light ginger and barley malt flavor. Nice light beer with an excellent ginger flavor and only a mild burn in the finish.
Kona Big Island Ginger Beer;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Flavored - Other;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);When I went to the brewery, they only had this beer available as a growler and not at the bar, so I went out on a limb and decided to get a growler. I poured it into a pint glass when I got back home to NY. It has a slightly dark amber color and is a bit darker than I remember it being in Hawaii, so it could have changed in the belly of the plane. The taste is the same as Hawaii though, so it didn�t change that. You can definitely smell the ginger along with a slight malty aroma. The aroma is milder than I expected a ginger beer to be. Ginger dominates the taste, but it is not a sweet ginger taste like I was expected. It is very dry and there is very little hop flavor. The mouthfeel is pleasantly light although it would be a bit better if it was a bit sweeter. Overall, this is a good beer. I wish I had more than a growler to drink now that I�m back in NY and 5000 miles away.

Crystal clear pale copper in colour with a thin white head. Slight hint of dry hop flowers in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing.

Dragonmead Bishop Bobs Holy Smoke;Warren, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Dragonmead Brewery;Majority of 6 oz. pour, on tap at the brewery�s taproom in Warren, Michigan. Consumed on 9-26-16. Hazy, maroon to medium brown. Long-lasting, beige head. Very pleasant color to the liquid. Meaty, smoky aroma. Barbecue sauce scent. Smells nice but should be stronger, and it doesn�t have the powerful smoke of many rauchbiers. Nice, meaty, malty taste. Really tasty and delicious. An excellent rauchbier, which itself is an excellent style. Well-made base beer with good smoke. Even more smoke could have pushed this into the upper echelon. Medium body, heavy for the ABV. Frothy in the palate. Really good stuff. Looks great and super-tasty.

Dragonmead Bishop Bobs Holy Smoke;Warren, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Dragonmead Brewery;Smokey aroma. Smokey flavor. Unfortunately, both are of a liquid smoke variety instead of a good campfire. 6/2014 Update: Tastes more like woodsmoke! Coincidence with their new BBQ menu?
Dragonmead Bishop Bobs Holy Smoke;Warren, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Dragonmead Brewery;Armoma is smokey, yet quite smooth. Dark as sin, almost no head on it. Taste smoke and water, a very thin beer. Not something to seek out but enough to try if given the means
Dragonmead Bishop Bobs Holy Smoke;Warren, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at Dragonmead Brewery. Very encouraging smoky aroma. Pours relatively dark. Has a smoky taste, but is somewhat of a letdown as its not very full bodied and seems a bit watered down.

A little bit of light saltiness with a fairly clean malt character. The beer is moderately smokey flavoured with an insistent smoked character on the back of the palate as well. Fairly clean if a little bit sweet. Quite carbonic tasting but the beer is pretty decent really.

Words to describe this beer are caramel, dark fruits, seems to be a little better on draft.
Dragonmead Under the Kilt Wee Heavy;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dragonmead Brewery;Notes from summer. Pours reddish brown. Aroma and taste are malts, caramel, and some nuttiness.

Dragonmead Under the Kilt Wee Heavy;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dragonmead Brewery;Three bottles - three different experiences. The first bottle was pulled from the fridge, sat on a table for 30 mins, and when I opened it it was like a geyser. Most of it sprayed out. Not judging anything on that bottle. Second bottle did not do that, but hat this sour taste like it was infected. Decided to try a third bottle before rating. Third bottle....poured a dark cola. Decent head but the lacing disappeared quickly. I can�t place the smell. Not pleasant, but not unpleasant. Just doesn�t taste like a beer to me. Tasting dark fruits but with a smoky taste to it? I think my third beer is what it should taste like. I love Final Absolution. I have had that many times. This, coming from the same brewery is surprising. Three beers from the same four pack. Three different experiences. I will drink the fourth, but then go back to Dirty Bastard. This is just a mess.
Dragonmead Under the Kilt Wee Heavy;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dragonmead Brewery;"Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a thistle. The appearance was a semi-dark brown with tints of purple along the edges.The head was about a finger�s worth of white foaminess that gently died. Super light lacing trickled down the glass. The smell had a caramel malty roasted peatiness I normally get in most Scotch ales. Light ""meat""-like aroma tried to invade but stayed subdued for the most part. The taste was sweet roasty peaty with that light ""meat""-like flavoring trying to come in. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with a semi-decent sessionability to it. The ""meat"" flavoring could be a tad distracting. However, this beer definitely rolled across my tongue extremely well leaving a really nice smoothness all around. Overall, for the most part, good Scotch ale. I�m not sure where I got the ""meatiness"" but hey throughout the beer it does show its face fairly strong but fairly weak at different times."
Dragonmead Under the Kilt Wee Heavy;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dragonmead Brewery;Tap. Dark ruby/plum. Thinnish. Very sweet. Raisin, soy sauce, definitely present alcohol.
Dragonmead Under the Kilt Wee Heavy;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle. The pour is dark, deep amber. The aroma is nice and bold, mostly scottish malts. The taste is decent for a scottish ale, nothing special. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Dragonmead Under the Kilt Wee Heavy;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dragonmead Brewery;This is a deep, rich tasting beer with a heavily fruity aroma and truly minimal lacing/foam presence. This beer is best enjoyed cold as it becomes overwhelming as it creeps closer to room temperature. It�s not my favorite beer but it is quite enjoyable by itself, cold, or with a good slab of red meat.
Dragonmead Under the Kilt Wee Heavy;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Dragonmead Brewery;"Undated 12 oz bottle served in a snifter. Pours dark but clear, with a tan head of moderate size and retention. Minimal lacing. Aroma: more like wine vinegar than Scotch Ale. Flavor: Some vinegar here too, about matching the dark malts. Light smoke in the finish. O: ""Unique taste"" indeed. Probably not at its best, but then again the bottle was from a reliable store, and carefully cold-stored for just a few months."
Altitude 7200 Stout;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Altitude Chophouse and Brewery;"This is served from a nitro tap, which I think deadens aroma; and I realized as I was drinking my sense of smell was very weak, probably from still adapting to the altitude. It looks the part and is creamy but perhaps a little light. I don't think they are advertising this as a 7% ABV anymore."
Altitude 7200 Stout;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Altitude Chophouse and Brewery;Shared 32 oz. howler poured to snifters displaying a black/brown hue, a bubbly layer of brownish tan head foam, and wavy cling to the lacing. The nose was malty, roasted mocha notes, some dryness, and light smoke & wood. A little less than medium bodied, with soft carbonation, the taste was similar notes as the aroma�s, plus a dry, roasted & earthy bitterness that lingered. A decently robust Stout that traveled well. Thanks Mark!
Altitude 7200 Stout;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Altitude Chophouse and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub it is a dark amber color with a slight head. The aroma is coffee and the taste is a strong bitter roasted coffee that finishes with a bitter chocolate

Altitude 7200 Stout;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Altitude Chophouse and Brewery;"Sampled an 8oz cup of this at yesterday�s Platte River Fall Festival. Nice very dark brown colour with a 1"" head of tan foam. The smell had notes of coffee and roasted malt. Also some chocolate. The taste had some coffee, toffee, roasted malt, sweet chocolate, which grew as the session went on, and some hop bitterness that was mostly in the finish. Good stuff. A good drop, and easy drinking for a 7%abv brew. It was medium bodied, carbonation was medium, and it finished slightly bitter and had a slight sourish note to it. Bottom line: A good American Stout that had some Milk Stout traits to it, I�d drink this again without hesitation. 09-14-2009"
Altitude 7200 Stout;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Altitude Chophouse and Brewery;Sampled at the brewery. The aroma is dark, bitter, chocolate.

Altitude Expedition Porter;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Porter;Altitude Chophouse and Brewery;Sampled from growler, couple months old, into a mini schooner glass. Thanks Greg and Joe! It poured a predictable clear dark brown color, reddish at the edges, but with no remaining carbonation, so no head or lace. True-to-style English porter, though drier with less malt complexity than my favorite examples. Subdued aroma, but bready and toasty. Grainy, faint caramel, toasty again and a little roasty, faint biscuit malt, not much in the way of fruity ale yeast esters. Light-medium body, still, somewhat rounded mouthfeel, not much aftertaste. I prefer carbonation, but this is probably more authentic, to be honest. Glad to tick Wyoming, if nothing else.

Scuttlebutt Vanilla Bean;Everett, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Virtually black with a solid white head. Obvious aroma of vanilla, alcohol and chocolate syrup. An interesting combination but could do with a bit more malt to add body.
Rocky Run Winterfest Dunkel;Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Rocky Run Tap & Grill;"I was told the beer was called ""The Dunkel""....and it was a porter. Ummm...ok....sure. Dark brown, creamy light tan head. Nose held light notes of cola nut and chocolate apple skins. Weak chocolate mint flavors mix with further soft cola and nut tones. Just a hint of hops in the end. Light bodied, soft carbonation, light chocolate malt finish. Whatever the style, it was another poor excuse for beer..."
Rocky Run Winterfest Dunkel;Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Rocky Run Tap & Grill;(Draught) Pours a chestnut brown body with a moderate beige head. Aromaof cola and toasted malt. Flavor of flat cola and malt with a funky, dry finish.
Rocky Run Winterfest Dunkel;Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Rocky Run Tap & Grill;This beer looked and smelled nearly identical to their stout. It was better, however, because it did not have that cough syrup flavor. But a Dunkel - I think not.

R�servoir Weizen;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;R�servoir - Brasseur;On tap @ R�servoir. Hazed golden pour with a white head. A touch tangy and citrusy on the nose. Particularly heavy on lemon. Good enough banana and sweet bready malt. Some hints of clove and bubblegum, too. The flavor is nicely sweet, but does have that tangy sourness on the back end. Lemon, oranges, and sweet banana make up most of the flavor. Some doughy bread/malt character and a touch of spice. Despite not necessarily being the most traditional, I found it easy enough to drink.
R�servoir Weizen;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;R�servoir - Brasseur;tap on the premises. cloudy, almost dirty very light golden with a small creamy white cap, some retention and nice lacing. very yeasty - bananas, dust, minerals, chalk, spices - pepper and cloves, wheaty - touch of its acidity, oranges, candied oranges - hint of sweet cereals, grass. moderate carbonation, light body, dry grassy-citrusy-spicy finish. nice. enjoying this.

Coddington Blueberry Blonde;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coddington Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. It poured a hazy yellow color with a white head.

Coddington Blueberry Blonde;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coddington Brewing Company;Served with blueberries bobbing in it, which gives the foam little flecks of purple. One of the better blueberry beers. Got a good dryness and light bitterness. Not too perfumey even.

Coddington Blueberry Blonde;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coddington Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewpub. It arrived with blueberries in the beer. A different touch. They are smelled but lightly. They are also light in the flavor. Malty and smooth. Minimal bitterness. A nice summer quencher. Those blueberries remained elusive until I ate them at the finish.
Coddington Blueberry Blonde;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coddington Brewing Company;Clear dark yellow to orange. Aroma is more grainy than blueberry. Some maltand hops as well. Taste does have blueberry. That, or it was added as 6-8 blueberries were floating in it as a garnish. Not bad.

Aroma of fresh blueberry and malt. Malty flavor with fresh blueberry before a semi-dry finish. Probably their best beer we sampled.
Coddington Irish Red Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coddington Brewing Company;Growler with Henry. We both poured into a mugs. The appearance was a burnt copper color with a cap of a little white foamy head. Some messy lace. The aroma had some earthiness/grassiness up front, slight nuttiness, dried sweet wood and a good malt base. The flavor was somewhat malty sweet with the nuttiness coming in to round it all out. Aftertaste was malty and nutty. Finish was somewhat smooth, slightly dry. The palate was almost medium bodied, just a touch under. Sessionability was there. Carbonation was there. Overall, seemed like a little bit of an Americanized Irish red ale, lacking some of the expected herbal qualities I normally get.

Coddington Irish Red Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coddington Brewing Company;Like many Irish ales this one smells a little woody and a bit nutty. Clearish red-brown color. Chalky malt flavor with mild hop presence that is a bit more evident than in some cardboard laced Irish beers. Pretty good example of the style, I had it with chicken parm, which was less so.
Coddington Irish Red Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coddington Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Faint perfume and alcohol aroma. Estery and canteloupe-like. Clear dark red-copper, with a well-settled nice looking khaki head. Flavor has some wet, soppy dirty malt character and then a nice slide into generic caramels, ale yeast, and thinness. Surprisingly crisp and hoppy finish. Drinkable, dry, but unexciting.
Coddington Irish Red Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coddington Brewing Company;On tap at Coddingtons -and this one for me was the best all around of the brews I sampled. Slight hazy amber pour. Good foam ivory lacing. Steeped grain roasted aroma carries into the pallet. A smooth malt body with a bit of hop bitterness. Wonderful texture and when I sampled this it was listed at a 6.1% ABV? Meh-good stuff.
Coddington Irish Red Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coddington Brewing Company;Sampled in late oct 06 - Copper and nutty color. Dry carbonated, not sweet, dry in the finish. Not my favortie beer style, but this one wasn�t that bad.
Coddington Irish Red Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coddington Brewing Company;A decent, dryish amber colored ale, not too much interesting character, nothing stands out but there was a decent citrus hop finish with a low 30�s IBU count.

Coddington Irish Red Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coddington Brewing Company;Has a reddish amber color with moderate carbonation and a slightly sweet smell. Taste is malted, but has a funny bitter aftertaste. Overall I am not a fan of Irish Ales and this one is no different.
Three Needs Braggot;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Looks like honey, surprise. Very clear, no head at all, totally still and flat. Faint honey-biscuity nose; strongly sweet initial flavor taken over shortly by bristling hoppiness and a somewhat harsh alcohol presence. Thinness makes the bitterness overpowering; an interesting experiment but not really successful yet."

Coddington Oatmeal Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Coddington Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewpub. First thing I see on the description is the ABV. Cool! Light absorbing black with a creamy tan head. The oatmeal is definitely noted here along with the smoothness it brings. Some chocolate and roasted notes. Some citrus is bright and cheery and works well here. Nice.
Coddington Oatmeal Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Coddington Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub. Arrived to the table black with a thin, somewhat creamy, tan head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left a sheet of lace with each sip.

Coddington Oatmeal Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Coddington Brewing Company;Nicely done nitro-stout. Oatmeal is not overly sweet and the stout retains some bitterness.

Abbeydale Matins;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Abbeydale Brewery;Cask @ Hollins Mill, Sowerby Bridge. Clear blonde with a creamy head. Has a smooth and light tasting texture with a fuller hoppiness. There�s some underlying citrus behind this.
Abbeydale Matins;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Abbeydale Brewery;19th Oct 2018, hand-pulled cask pint at The Pheasant Inn, Wellington Shropshire.

Abbeydale Matins;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Abbeydale Brewery;Cask @ The Pub, Leicester. Drinkable session golden ale.

Abbeydale Matins;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Abbeydale Brewery;Cask@GBBF2009. Pale yellowish golden colour, not much head. Aroma is sweet sugary nectar along with wood and some bready malts,. Flavour is quite much the same. Balanced brew, but quite boring.

Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);OLD NOTES OCT 9, 2003 This beer wasn�t what I expected. A first smell it reminded me of a red wine more than a beer, and the first sip of the dark redish looking beer didn�t say much more. The flavour was quite hoppy, I suppose you could describe it. Not really sweet, or have an real obvious flavours, but it wasn�t too bad overall, easily drinkable.
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle- A decent amber ale, nothing really special, but still a very drinkable beer.
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);I wonder what was going on in Cascades mind when they developed this amber ale is light on taste anddoesnt make u want to have another
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Probably my least favourite of the Four Seasons 2005 series, but still okay. Amber brown, thin head, aromas of fruit (apples?) and caramel malts. Slightly sweet initially but with a bitter finish. Not bad, but I�ll stick with the Winter Warmer.
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Moderately successful seasonal ale but short on complexity. Bronze colour with a thin head. Floral hop aroma with some caramel. Medium-bodied but full-flavoured. Toffee notes and a puckering bitterness. Bold flavours but a little one-dimensional. (Bottle, 2003)
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);"Clear amber in colour with a thin white head. Aroma of caramel, glue & alcohol. Light-bodied; Astringent taste with tart flavours up front that make the mouth pucker. Aftertaste clean after a while, but bittered for most of it. Overall, pretty bad by itself, but sampled together with the Scharer�s Lager, makes them BOTH taste bad! Still...neat to try, and the last beer on the trip to Australia with JonR888710 and Haddon90...Thanks guys! I sampled this beer on draught at the Australian Hotel on the Rocks in Sydney, Australia on 09-June-2004."
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);5 May 2004 - Slight malt aroma. Clear yellow amber colour, dodgy lacing and no head. Slight citrus flavour, watery and bitter hops. Uninspiring.
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Bronze color with smallish white head. Sweet flavors with some bubblegum and banana. Weird for, what in the states we call, a marzen.
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Copper aromas and flavour. A dash of saltiness at the end. This is a good beer for a cold night in Canberra, though probably not great value for money. Cascade should be applauded for it however.
Cascade Four Seasons Autumn Amber;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Nice bright amber colour, with a small head which fades quickly, and coarse carbonation. I won�t pay out on this as much as some of the other raters - certainly much better than last years, flavours very much in balance, but just lacking all over. Far better than most of the local product.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;OLD NOTES SEP 21, 2004 Not as bad as I expected. Light citrusy hop aroma, hazy pale gold in appearance, light malt body, slight hop citrus kind of fruity flavours. Nothing outstanding.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;330ml bottle from First Choice. Hazy straw yellow body with a slim white head that lasts. Noticebly bready aromas with faint citrus hops. Medium sweet taste with low bitterness in the finish. Medium body with a rather thin mouthfeel and lowish carbonation. Pleasant. Easy drinking. Certainly different to the German or Bohemian pilsners that tend to have a much higher dry hop bitterness.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;330ml bottle. Evenly layered dep white foam atop an amber base, looks inviting. Aromas of malt and hops with a bit of straw thrown in. Light in the mouth with a medium body and dry aftertaste.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle (330ml). Poured yellow with a small rocky white, head which was average lasting. Aroma was grainy malts with sweet bread, honey, lemon and light notes of butterscotch. Flavor was of grainy malts with a light bitterness, honey, lemons and hints of mandarin. Light bodied with lively carbonation, a mildly dry mouthfeel, watery texture and a short/clean finish.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;...bottle from bottle. They all basically erupetd upon opening, so I don�t know what all that was about. Otherwise, a bretty good balanced brew. I liked the citrus\spice notes, and it was very clean with no lingering, or overpowering finish. I thought it was a light golden belgian more than a pils, but overall, pretty decent, too bad it was only a 4 pack. Worth trying if you like the style.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Yellow to straw colour,good head,carbonation good,aroma grain,crisp like sweet corn or barley,hops, perhaps stonefruit.Flavour barley,corn mild fruit tastes perhaps graprfruit a puzzling beer okay finish,grapefruit dry and sweet.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle. Strange kind of pilsener. More of a Belgian ale feel. Pretty unexciting overall, best part is in the finish, where most of the flavour is hiding - fair bit of orange there at the end.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Not sure what BJCP style a Belgian Pilsner falls under so not sure if it is �to style�. That said it was a tasty beer, with noticeable spicy citrus flavors. Would be a good summer beer.
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Bottle -- Pale yellow with average carbonation and a big sudsy white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Nothingy sweet aroma of Euro supermarket lager. Crisp, simple flavour with some pilsener character in it at a stretch. Quite pleasant but, having been sucked in by ""Brewed in Belgium"" written on the back and the quaint picture on the label, fairly dissapointing. But at the same shop I also picked up a three-pack of Chimay, complete with a proper Trappist glass, for $24, so I won�t complain too hard."
Caporal;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Bottle as part of an Euro lager 6 pack. Yet another Aussie review. Good head and left good lace on the glass. Even tho a Pilsener it tasted ""Belgian"" - if that makes sense. Have been drinking German pilsners and lagers lately as the standard brew at home and it was more Leffe than Bitburger. Enjoyed it though won�t go out of my way to buy it."
River City (CA) Dunkel Weizen;Carmichael, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;River City (CA) Brewing;wierd yeasty aroma, undunkel like light amber appearance, banana flavors like crazy with some soft but dry wheatiness towards the finish, interesting but can't say it's too true to style
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Sampled from a can this beer poured a bright yellow gold color with a large foamy yellow-white head that lingered and left decent lacing. The aroma was tangy, sweet, corny and a bit perfumey. The flavor was tangy and sweet with corn, and perfume. Medium length finish. Light body.
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Exact same as if light. Pale lager, highly carbonated, bland finish. Best drank cold.
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;(can - 12 oz) Pale yellow with a fizzy head. Smells like corn and can. Some grass. Tastes pretty much the same. It was there.
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"gift from ""cheap"" thanks buddy. I�ve never tried this beer before, so this is a first. Ok, it�s a cheap grass cutting brew, nothing else. Cheap beers, a cheap price, so I guess what else would you expect?"
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Same great American taste, less great American calories! Sadly, there is nothing less American than having less calories in anything.
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;I would put this in the category of Bud light, miller light and so on. I think it holds its own for its style and price range. I would not buy it again. I�m beyond this type of beer.
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"i�ve een reminiscing about the Hopefully this is the same american lite i had from yesteryear. AWFUL. cheap. watery. like a beer rag in a bar. had a great time playing ""a**hole"" with it, though"
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Every time i think of this beer i think of the theme song to team america world police......America...........................fuck yeah comin again to make crappy beer.
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;How did PGH Brewing ever score the rites to a name like American? (update 11/8/2016: probably because D Trump is a real american, heheh!) Yes, the american light form the company that invented the first �light beer� & the makers of light brigade. Don�t say �this is first� because it is one of the low price leaders in the south western PA region. 29 US cents per 12 oz can. Nice average flavor for a lager. I heard this is sold abroad and it sells well outside of the US. It says it has the strength of america in it. Pours very light yellow but not quite bright enough to be called lemon. Not a ticker because I rate this as I taste. Very few bubbles in the brew but the carbonation is decent to below average. It is a little bit light on the palate. Personally, I think that PGH brewing�s other lite knock off �brigade� may be much better. A well behaved lager with a rapidly fading finish that is not an insult to the back of your throat. Good deal and it fills in where the raters leave off.
American Light;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;If I wans�t from Pittsburgh this woud be rated the lowest. Here in Pgh, we drank this when we were young and hiding in the woods. I guess whoever we stole it from didn�t miss it. Tried it again and it hasn�t changed.
John Harvards Freedom Stout;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;Exceptional stout, very much like their milk stout but without the creamy laxtouce flavors, black in color, huge bubbly tan head that laced the glass, full bodied, excellent balance, this beer was also on the hand-pump which brought out even more of the burnt malty flavors, rich malty aftertaste, awesome stout
Morgan Street Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;Draft: Clear amber...small off-white head. Caramel malt scent. Taste has an almost smoky finish in the caramel malt....... Very basic....OK.
Morgan Street Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, pours a reddish amber with a thin head and spotty lacing in the glass, the aroma has a little bit of fruit mixed in with the malt, the flavor is sweet with malt but isn�t all that bad, the mouthfeel is nice on this one, this one can actually pass as drinkable.
Morgan Street Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;Sampler at the brew pub. This beer was different in that it was almost pure barley in both aroma and flavor. A decent looking dark red in color. The barley gave it a harsh mouthfeel that was not particularly enjoyable.
Morgan Street Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;Draft sample at the brewpub. Pours a coppery red color with a small white head. Faint aroma of mixed malts, toast, nuts, and fruits. Flavor of sweet, pale, and caramel malts, earth, nuts, cereal grains, and a little bit of leafy hops. Light-medium bodied, with a malty mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Pretty basic beer but some nice malts going on in the flavor.
Morgan Street Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;Amber to brown in color... Not much aroma... Flavor is malts, slightly nutty and more rich than their other beers... Probably one of their better beers.. Not bad...
Morgan Street Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;Enjoyed 4 pints of these one afternoon at the Pub while watching Mark brew. Very drinkable well balanced taste. Nice reddish brown color and malty aroma. Hints of fruit and light to medium body. Very good beer overall.
Morgan Street Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Red-brown in the glass with a thin off-white head. Subdued aromas of toasted malts. The flavor found caramel with hints of nut and fruit. Light to medium body.
Morgan Street Red Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Morgan Street Brewery;[draught at brewery] Pours a gorgeous redish brown with a small quickly dissipating head. Smells of light fruit and maybe chocolate but very faintly. This was one of the best I sampled at the brewery.

Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;[Tap] Nothing memorable about this beer. I sampled this and 4 others last night, forgot my sheets and cant remember what this beer tasted like. That means it wasn�t terrible though.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;Pours iced-tea brown with a thin head. Aroma is butterscotch (uh-oh), hop pepper, though the (assumed) infection dominates any subtlety that may exist in the malts. Flavor is also dominated by butterscotch, sweetness underlying, some floral hops and a bit of fruit. Would like to try again without the diacetyl.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;Pours dark amber with a small head. Aroma is very sour and malty. Flavor is sweet and pretty sour. The body is medium thick. Finishes strong with a medium aftertaste.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;Another unimpressive beer from this brewery. I�m glad I can knock this one off my list and never return. Grainy cereal malt nose, with some light hoppiness. Light fruits skins on the palate. Very light with a finish like malt liquor.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;Draught at Morgan St. Pours clear tawny with a small, frothy, white head, somewhat diminishing with fair lacing. Aroma is average malt (bread, grain, cereal), light hops (grass), average yeast (sweat, earth) with notes of apple and pear. Light bodied, thin texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Average duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;on tap at the brewey, amber color, with a white head, sweet toasted, grainy malt nose, with a cookie dough, biscuity accent, some nutty, butterscotch diacetyl accents, with a faint fruity aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a toasty, grainy, caramelized malt character, with a flowery hop grassiness, with some faint citrusy notes, leading towards a malty, fry hoppy finish.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;On draught at the brewpub. Pours a dark amber color with a wispy white head that disappears very quickly. Minimal lacing is evident. Mildly spiced hops and malt in the aroma. Light-bodied and lightly hoppy with some spice and earthy malt flavor. The finish is subtle hops and malt with a short and lightly bitter hops aftertaste. Average overall.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;Reddish, brown pour. Some mild hop character in the nose, but subdued. Lots of buttery diacetyl in the body - good in sips but 4 oz was too much. Drinkable.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;Draft - I agree with pretty much everything that Braudog said. I�ll have to take his word for the color, it was too dark in the brewery to see. Not much character. Some spiciness, probably from 6-row malt. A few mild hops.
Morgan Street Harvest Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Morgan Street Brewery;An amber beer with no real overwhelming character in either aroma or flavors. It's smooth and crisp, a decent but standard brewpub beer, and still way better than any macrobeer.

Augusta Hefeweizen;Washington, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Augusta Brewing Company;Draft sample at the St. Louis Brewers Heritage Festival 2011. Pours a cloudy golden-orange color with a small white head. Aroma of orange citrus, banana, sweet doughy malts, faint clove, and honey. Flavor of banana, clove, sweet bready malts, tangerine, and tropical fruits. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a fruity, juicy mouthfeel. The fruitiness to this maybe takes it a little out of the traditional hefe style but it doesn�t matter to me because it�s so clean and refreshing. I could drink this all day.
Augusta Hefeweizen;Washington, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Augusta Brewing Company;Tasted on tap at Augusta Brewing in Augusta, Missouri. Light orange (lighter than a typical German Hefeweizen) appearance that�s mostly hazy but not completely. Sweet wheat malty aroma. This is a German Hefeweizen but a bit more bitter like an American Hefeweizen.
Augusta Hefeweizen;Washington, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Augusta Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Mostly clear golden with an aroma that is mostly cloves and some banana. Just a hint of butter. This is not as sweet an offering as many of its style. There is some bitterness from orange peels, perhaps, light bananas, and fruit. Pleasant but it could use some umph.

Augusta Hefeweizen;Washington, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Augusta Brewing Company;On tap @ the sister brewpub, Square One. Appearance is very thick golden, cannot see through it. The beer is basically an esters gone bad hefe. There just isn�t much else backing it up. It is watery banana, some orange peel, and fruit sugar throughout. Also needs a bit more carbonation.
Augusta Hefeweizen;Washington, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Augusta Brewing Company;On tap at Augusta Brewpub. Unfiltered banana yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of lemon, herbs and mild banana. Lively palate tastes of banana, wheat, lemon and yeast.
Hopf Weizen-Ale (Red);Miesbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wei�bierbrauerei Hopf (Brau Holding Intl. - Heineken);Bottled. A dark nutty coloured weizen with a minimal head. The aroma is sweet and a bit meaty. Red berry fruits seem to figure with some caramel. The taste is also over sweet with some sweet fruity notes. Really not sure what this is trying to be but I don�t like it.
Hopf Weizen-Ale (Red);Miesbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wei�bierbrauerei Hopf (Brau Holding Intl. - Heineken);Pours cloudy dark orange with a foamy off-white head. Dusty and fruity aroma with a weak tone of wheat. Sweet and somewhat candied. Flavor is slighly wheaty with banana tones, but it is a quite different weissbier, more sweet and sugary and not as harsh as many other weizen. Sweet candied finish.

Aroma is refreshing citrusy, a bit yeasty. Taste is bananas (they are much more pronounced in the taste), refreshing, some spicy yeast characteristics. Hints of an unbalaced tartness, but it makes it more refreshing. Very refreshing, I suppose this how it�s supposed to be. Spritzy carbonation. Good thirst-quencher, and therefore dangerous.

Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;Bottle: &nbsp Deep amber, moderate foamy sandy head, spotty lacing. &nbsp Pale caramel malt aroma, slightly mealy but not too much. &nbsp As it warms it appears to be a little toasted. &nbsp Smooth sweet and rich malty start, could be a little much if had in quantity, but its nice. &nbsp Very minor nuttiness and biscuit in the finish. &nbsp Not a hoppy Amber, and does seem like a Lager despite it being listed as an Amber Ale. &nbsp Better than I was expecting at least. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Finishes fairly quick, which is better than the start which seems to be a little sticky. &nbsp Not bad!
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewery. Clear amber, frothy beige head. Aroma of caramel malts and fruit. Taste is mildly sweet with very faint citrus. Medium light body, smooth carbonation.
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. A simple, surprisingly dry (yay!) but unexciting Amber beer. Tasty, malty, well-made, but not in any way particularly a standout. Note I didn�t say Amber Ale, as this is clearly marked an Amber Lager, despite how it�s classified on the site here.
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;Clear amber, average off-white head, no lace. Aroma of caramel, and low earthy hops. Same on the palate, a little thin. Decent enough, but there are better beers coming out of Montana.
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at the Great Northern Brewpub in Whitefish, Montana. Pours a dark caramel amber brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of roasted dark caramel malt, roasted nuts, a touch of toffee and soem flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, very light carbonation with flavors of dark hard fruits, sweet barley malt and some candy cherries. Finish is smooth, slightly sweet with a candy sugar aftertaste.
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;"Draft pint to finish off oru tasting at the GN taproom. Dark amber, almost light brown. Lightly carameled aroma. Nice fully flavored brew, almost tea-like, moderately bittered. Robust for an ""amber"", bordering on a brown ale. Good, though. (#2866, 5/12/2007)"
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;Pours a medium amber color. Aromas of caramel, a hint of nut, and some light fruit. Flavor is a sweet roasted taste, I think it could use some more hops. Finishes a bit sweet.
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;Pretty amber colour. Wonderful malty aroma with plenty of toffee, a little hops, and maybe even some fruits? Flavour has an interesting combination of sweet malts and acidic hops (Cascade). IMHO not perfectly balanced. The carbonation is fairly low. Overall, a decent beer (with a great aroma) but nothing more.
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;Scribbled review from 8/15/03. Clearance beer. Cloudy, greenish amber. Thin head. Smells like corn syrup and fruitcake. Tastes like fruitcake, bready, malty, candied fruits. Interesting and sort of appealing, but hard to get past texture...Cloying and too sweet for me and unsettlingly tart. Maybe this batch is bad, maybe I don't like the style.
Great Northern Hellroaring Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Northern Brewing Company;"Big caramelly lager; slightly slippery body, some corniness in the aroma. Some sweet brown sugar, malt is indeed sticky. Not the hoppiest Vienna around; much more European without hybrid intent, I think. Super drinkable, perfect with Pizza! Thanks SW."
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;On tap @ Great Northern. Cloudy yellow, sudsy white crown. Aroma is equally sweaty and grainy. Flavour is nicer, bready pale malt, light hop finish. Not sure if this is an intentional unfiltered pils, but either way, it�s pretty simplistic and not the brewery�s best offering.
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewery. Clear yellow, foamy white head. Aroma of grain and light citrus. Taste is sweet grain and some husky bitterness. Light body, crisp carbonation.
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;Thanks to Skyview for sharing. Light clear bubbly golden color. Rich honey, biscuity malt on the nose. Medium bodied, with a slightly hoppy profile followed by a nice biscuity malt, but also a little bit of a metallic tinge. Thanks bob for bringing me a beer from home
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub in Whitefish, Montana. Pours a light clear golden blonde brew with a fast dissipating white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles in glass. Aroma is very faint of light grain malt, green vegetables and grassy hops. Taste is well carbonated, semi-smooth with some corn malt and grassy flavors. Finish is light, spritzy, with a dry hop aftertaste.
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;Definitely a lager nose. Cloudy yellow and has probably spent too much time in the sun. Stale corn body.
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;Draft 6 oz�er at the taproom. Very light yellow with a nice standing pilsy head. Kind of musty with a subtle saazy-ness that lingers in the background. It has a light starchy base, but not overly so. This is a decent interpretation in the Bohemian vein. (#2862, 5/12/2007)
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;If you can�t get Fred�s, this will do...I guess. I�d rather walk across the street to the Northern and get a Pabst.
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;Tap @ Dog & Grog Virginia City. Aroma of honey & light malt w faint hops. Flavor of fresh grain/malt, moderately sweet w honey flavor and light hop flavor & bitterness. OK but not great. Would prefer something more crisp with a bit of a bite. Update 7/31/11: tap @ brewery, unbalanced toward malt and sweetness but it�s freshness was able to lure me back to it many times. be nice to get fresh pils in Cd�A.
Great Northern Bucking Horse Pilsner;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Northern Brewing Company;Pours a golden yellow color. Aromas of grass, cheerios, and some hops. Flavor is typical pilsner, not a lot of hops, a nice smooth taste.
Iron Hill Gueuze;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Gueuze;Iron Hill Media;Had this at the Media location. This was my first gueuze style beer so I can't compare it to any other. I'm also not a big lamibic fan. But have to geive to beers a try at least once. If you like sourness in you beer this was good. The banana flavor came out when it warmed up a bit.
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;EBF 2007: Cloudy pink/purple pour with a white head. Aroma, sour raspberries and some wood. Flavor, tart, raspberries, a dry acidity to it, some spice. This one was out there. But good.
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;[At GABF 2004] A hazy amber beer with a disappearing white head. The aroma is sweet and sour with notes of raspberries and wood. The flavor is sour, which draws out the mouthwater, like a Belgian original, and also contains notes of wood and raspberries. I believe this is the best non-Belgian Framboise I�ve had - nice.
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;On tap at the North Wales location. Thanks to egajdzis for giving me a call to let me know it was on tap! Poured a medium and cloudy reddsih/pinkish color with the same color head. Nice tart raspberry and almost cherry aroma and tastes. Medium tart and sourness.. Very easy to drink. Very tasty and enjoyable.
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;Another fantastic beer from Iron Hill at �04 GABF. Light red/dark pink color with a mellow cherry aroma. Taste is right in your face sour rasberry and light green apples. Tart but could use a bit more sourness to it but as drinkable a Lambic as I�ve had. A great variation of the style.
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;9/30/04. On tap at GABF 2004 in Denver, CO 9/30/04. Deep gold-amber color with a light haze. Very nice, fluffy cherry-tan head without much lacing. Nice, fairly straightforward framboise nose, but maybe a shade too little raspberry. Sharp, crisp, tart lambic flavor-- a shade of subtle funk with a bright woodiness and a luscious blink of barely ripe raspberry bliss. It�s amazing how quickly the raspberry appears and then disappears, but also how much else there is going on in this beer. Finish is lovely, disappearing fruit with a touch of lip gloss plastic. I actually quite like it. Drying and subtle, long and delicious. Finishes like a passionate kiss. Wonderful foreplay. If it had more fruit and a little more depth, it would be divine.
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;"GABF 2004. ""Iron Hill Framboise de Hill"". Mildly hazy golden-brown body with a slight garnet tone.

Crisp, very tart and quenching."
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;GABF2004... Poured a hazy brownish red color with a light pink head. Funky, stinky aroma of brett and raspberries. Taste was tart and sour raspberries and cherry skins. Medium mouthfeel.
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;I�m assuming that this is the Framboise de Hill I had. Quite sour aroma. Still rasperries present. Taste is sour as well, tart and berried. Nice bready layer underneath. Interesting and good.
Iron Hill Framboise;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;Had this at the Media location. First let me say I'm not a big lamibic fan. But have to give new beers a try at least once. Nice good version of a lambic good balance between the raspberries and the sourness.
Iron Hill Kriek;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;750 ml bottle shared at the hotel room bottle share over Jackie-O�s 9th Anniversary weekend. Pours a hazy reddish-orange color with an off-white ring for a head. Notes of cherry, vanilla, oak, caramel, lemon, light red wine vinegar. Almost has a sour mash thing going on, probably from these things melding together with age. Medium-bodied, with a tart, sweet mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Interesting beer. Never heard of it before this.

Iron Hill Kriek;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;Bottle: &nbsp Orangish, thin sudsy white head, sparce lacing. &nbsp Looks aged. &nbsp Nice nose of tart cherries and oak. &nbsp On the tongue it has a touch of sweet tart cherry vinegar. &nbsp Its both sweet and sour. &nbsp Clean, and better than I expected. &nbsp Very tart on the backside, sour and unripened cherry galore. &nbsp This one was very good. &nbsp Well balanced. &nbsp Based on others I thought this would be nothing but vinegar, but I was pleasantly surprised.
Iron Hill Kriek;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;[Bottle] shared by BDR. Pours a cloudy orange with a soapy white head.

Iron Hill Kriek;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;GABF 2006. this was one I couldn�t wait to try! Amber with a slight haze. Aroma is mouth-watering! Tart cherries, barnyard, light sweat, sour fruits(lemon), and sharp cheesey wafts. Taste is equally sour with more cherry, lemon, banryard, horseblanket, wet leather and damp wood. Body is light and bubbly. Moderate acidity. Ends with more horsey notes, banryard, earthy flavors, cherries, and sour fruits. Very nice stuff!
Iron Hill Kriek;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;"Draft... GABF �06... Murky straw-colored ale with a small, fizzy, white head.

Lightly sweet, but still totally unbalanced. ""Total barnyard experience!"" ... take that any way you like. Medium-bodied and astringent with lively carbonation. Lengthy, dry finish."
Iron Hill Kriek;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;GABF 2006. The beer pours to a geuze colored glowing brassy golden body. Nice white head. The aroma is insanely geuzey with tart cherries and leathery funk. Some cheesey things going on too. The flavor is extremely toasty toffee, tart cherries, buttery. Very tart upfront on the palate. But then mellows and excites.

Iron Hill Cassis;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;UPenn tasting again...very dark red - purple. Excellent black berry/currant aroma. Flavor is dominated by black current. Good tartness. seemed a little thin and could use even more base under the fruit.
Iron Hill Cassis;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;Sample @ UPenn�s Tutored Tasting �07. Poured a vivid reddish/purple. Aroma was full of blackcurrant - fruity and sweet. The blackcurrant dominates the flavor as well, though not as much as in aroma. A little thin and watery. A decent tartness, but overall, a little unbalanced. *Says it was done by Iron Hill Wilmington.
Iron Hill Cassis;Media, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Iron Hill Media;Had this at the Media location. This is my first cassis style beer so I can't compare to any other.Also let me say I'm not a big lamibic fan. But have to give new beers a try at least once. The description says it all.

Held it�s hazy yellow body and creamy head all the way through. Up against local competition it�s not surprising that places like this go to the wall but then again there are many, many worse beers in the world.
De Brugse Bierkaai Die Scone Blonde;Brugge, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;De Brugse Bierkaai;"The brewpub is (or was, by the look of it) a nice place to while away an hour or so with one of their ""drietaps"", which provide a sample of each of the three regular beers and a few nibbles. This beer was blond, hazy, slightly tart and refreshing. Didn't take long to down this one. Not bad, but not exceptional. Draft, Brugse Bierkai brewpub, September 2003. Shame it's now a goner. Must have caught it just before it closed."

De Brugse Bierkaai Die Scone Blonde;Brugge, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;De Brugse Bierkaai;Hazy, pale, yellow wheatish. Very dense white head. Malt, fresh worts, some hops in the nose.

De Brugse Bierkaai Die Scone Blonde;Brugge, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;De Brugse Bierkaai;Cloudy golden, with medium white froth. Aroma is lemon, fairly light. Taste is lemon, some tartness. Light body, some crispness -- pleasant summer beer.

De Brugse Bierkaai Diene Simon;Brugge, Belgium;Dubbel;De Brugse Bierkaai;"The brewpub is (or was, by the look of it) a nice place to while away an hour or so with one of their ""drietaps"", which provide a sample of each of the three regular beers and a few nibbles. This beer was a strongish dark brown beer with an underlying bitter tang, but somehow lacking in excitement. I wouldn't really describe it as an authentic dubbel. Draft, Brugse Bierkaai brewpub, September 2003. Shame its now a goner. Must have caught it just before it closed."
De Brugse Bierkaai Diene Simon;Brugge, Belgium;Dubbel;De Brugse Bierkaai;"Fairly flat, sweet, sour, but not the ""good"" kind of Flemish sourness. Little aroma other than sour wet towel."
De Brugse Bierkaai Diene Simon;Brugge, Belgium;Dubbel;De Brugse Bierkaai;Foxy colour, hazy, virtually no head. A bit vineous in the nose, amber malt. Tastes as a kind of alcoholised cola. Sweet. Spritzy mouthfeel, reasonably refreshing when cold. No aftertaste. This is a beer for starting at 16 after the Cola-years.
De Brugse Bierkaai Diene Simon;Brugge, Belgium;Dubbel;De Brugse Bierkaai;Cloudy brown body with minimal head. Aroma and taste are sweet, raisin/prune. Somewhat watery, but still an ok beer.
De Brugse Bierkaai Diene Stouterik;Brugge, Belgium;Tripel;De Brugse Bierkaai;"I read and heard of this former brewery in Bruges many years ago but somehow never made it there, and met the former owner (Jan Debruyne) only years after it closed down. I always kind of regretted to have missed it, but got a (probably last) chance to see at least a shade of its original self thanks to a vintage bottle of the tripel in their range, made some twenty years ago when it was still simply named De Brugse Bierkaai Tripel. This very old bottle still produced a remarkably stable and frothy, irregular, snow white head, resting atop a misty peach blonde beer with khaki tinge, obviously carrying a lot of dead yeast bits. Aroma is unsurprisingly heavily dominated by oxidation, the unmistakable nose of a very old tripel, sweet and almost sherryish so in all, not unpleasant; other impressions include apple sauce, canned peaches, sweetbread, honey, sweetened apple cider, ice tea or sugared camomile tea. Sweet onset, apple sauce and ripe pear, banana, all soft and flattened by the overall oxidation; soft carbo still though, with a smooth, slick mouthfeel, not yet dramatically thinned by age, possible thanks to the carbonation which has been preserved relatively well. Oxidized, caramelly malt sweetness with a slight metallic feeling to it, hops in the finish are reduced to a vague tea-ish (even ice tea in combination with the overall sweetness) aspect but provide no more actual bitterness. Some warming wodka-like alcohol at the back. This is obviously way too old, but preserved relatively well, with good head retention and carbonation having remained; based purely on experience, I imagine that when this was young, it was probably a sweet, yet correct, subtly florally hopped tripel, nothing more, nothing less. Glad I did get a chance to taste something from this bygone brewing project, even if it is in this overaged form."
De Brugse Bierkaai Diene Stouterik;Brugge, Belgium;Tripel;De Brugse Bierkaai;Rather sweet and not big on flavour. Shame that the brewpub�s gone as the guy was quite entertaining.

This beer was gold coloured, deceptively strong but a little sweet and cloying. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Draft, Brugse Bierkaai brewpub, September 2003. Shame its now a goner. Must have caught it just before it closed."
De Brugse Bierkaai Diene Stouterik;Brugge, Belgium;Tripel;De Brugse Bierkaai;"Malty-sweet, little hops, some ""off"" sour notes in nose and taste. Little flavor."
De Brugse Bierkaai Diene Stouterik;Brugge, Belgium;Tripel;De Brugse Bierkaai;Strong clean blond beer. Since the hopping rate is low, the beer is very sweet, if not cloyingly so. Very light flavour, perhaps not enough malt or too low sach. rest temp. Lacking character.
Three Needs Scottish Ale 90 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;On tap at the brewpub. Some smoke, lacey on a mahogney body. Strong carbonation. Barley taste. Some of the elements, they couldn�t put it together. Drinkable though.
Three Needs Scottish Ale 90 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Mild sweet nose, raisin and some fig. OK fruity tones with a bit of roasted grain or molasses sweetness. Murky brown beer with thin off-white head. Medium chewy body with medium-high carbonation. Starts with light soy tang, raisins and/or molasses sweetness. Toasty grain notes. Light fruity and mild acidity, tanginess. Hops come in at finish, not overly bitter. Mild chalky after with a bit of Tootsie Roll.
Three Needs Scottish Ale 90 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Lightly peaty aroma and flavour. Fairly fruity with a mild balancing bitterness. Opaque dark muddy brown with shy tan head that recedes rapidly to ring. Medium-light body is very dry. Fair carbonation. On tap at the brewpub with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
Three Needs Scottish Ale 90 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Placid caramel and red fruit entranced by the full but complacent mouthfeel...Kind of bland fruity finish with mild malt and water...Underaverage for its style...
Three Needs Scottish Ale 90 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Short-lasting head covers a chestnut brown hue. Weird aroma of watermelon, cantaloupe and various fruit salad ingredients. Sweet, yet not very desserty, mostly juicy, slightly tart and quite watery. Nothing Scottish about this, weak wet mouthfeel.
Three Needs Scottish Ale 90 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Hazy brown ale, with light malts aroma. Very watery beer with light caramel notes. Soso. On tap Dec. 2004.
Three Needs Scottish Ale 90 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours a rich dark brown with a thin light tan head. Heavy sweet caramel malty and peat aroma. Body is thick and sweet with a sticky palate and a nice malty complexity. Don�t see much resemblance to a Scottish ale, but a nice malty brew nonetheless.
Three Needs Scottish Ale 90 Shilling;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Dark prune-maple body. No head but for some tiny wisps of foam; totally opaque. Earthy-caramel aroma, hints of chocolate initially in the flavor. Dry, astringent, slight fruitiness disappears quickly. Buttered popcorn, hazelnuts. This has a lot going on, but it's really too dry and not full enough to hold it all. Close to excellence, it seems to me; just missing that body and a hint more sugar."
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;I'm not really a cider drinker, so a little hard to review these. Even though this is hard @ 8%...it has a light and smooth feel to it. Near clear appearance, or like a white wine with that small hint of green. Not sure if I prefer this style over the unfiltered/brown kind, but still tasty, refreshing, and drinkable.
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;650ml bottle. Yellowish cider pour, musty apple nose, this one is super sweet, 9% it is up-sweetened and not great.
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;Its alright. Clean straightforward apple flavors, a bit on the sweet side, a tad heavy, but not surprising at 8% abv. No real depth or anything interesting however. Try a different yeast. Sorry hometown winery.
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;Very light straw yellow liquid. Sweet and fruity scent, with plenty of berries. Apple and candi sugar flavors. Too sweet for me. 4/12
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;The aroma is great with sweet fruity apples and mild alcohol. The appearance is straw gold and very pale with no head but carbonation bubbles are present. The taste is like the aroma but tart and a bit sour. The palate is thin but right for the style. Overall not my favorite cider but drinkable pretty mainstream with an unpleasant note
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;I don�t usually drink ciders, but I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this one. A good aroma and crisp taste make this one somewhat decent overall.
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;The aroma is a light apple cider. Pours a clear light yellow. The taste is a light sweetness. The body is light, the texture thin a little stivky, the carbonation lively and the finish a light sweet and long. Taste is more like the mass produced fruity drinks, ok.
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;750ml bottle...label states a 9%ABV. Lite gold pour...the nose is fresh picked apples. Taste is juicy ripe apples with a bit of sweetness. Lite carbonation and very easy drinking. Good stuff.
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Oliver Winery;(bottle - 750 ml) Clear gold pour with a fizzy white head. Light and mild apple aroma with a matching mild flavor. Decent but not great.

Jack Russell Huntsmans Lager;Camino, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;From Feb 2006 Poured from bottle(room temp) a cloudy straw gold with a large head of foam that dissipates slowly. The smell is malty but nothing beyond that. But..this *is* in the Macro lager style so I shouldn't be expecting more, right? The taste is umm..wow. The smell gave no indication of how flavourful this lager was going to be. Prominent hops with a decent backing of malt and the flavour just goes on and on right through the finish. This is a yummy lager!! Bottom line: If this was available to me locally, it would certainly be on my prime rotation list. Lager lovers....give it a try!!
Jack Russell Huntsmans Lager;Camino, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours hazy amber with a modest white head and a light malt aroma. There is a typical pilsner matl flavor that is somewhat bitter and dry. Lots of flavor for a lager.
Jack Russell Huntsmans Lager;Camino, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;12 ounce bottle purchased at Corti Brothers in Sacramento, CA. Tasted malts in the aroma with a bit of floral aroma as well. A little metallic, spicy, and yeasty. Virtually transparent golden body with a small, quickly dissipating off-white head. Thin, watery, lightly floral and lightly toasted start. Becomes a bit minty and a little spicy. Lacks hops and carbonation. A little diacetyl. Boring, devoid of hops, and relatively uninspired.
Jack Russell Huntsmans Lager;Camino, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Hhm. Aroma of slightly wet dog underlain by near-caramel malt. Think there is some noble hop as well. Amber tinged, brassy gold color with a white head that flattened immediately. Nearly medium in body, somewhat biting in carbonation. The malt is very much towards roasted. Maybe biscuity. The malt then turns towards lightly roasted. Finally some very decent grassy, and perhaps floral, hop arrives. So the struggle to goal line: touchdown: clean, crisp, bitter finish with enough malt to balance. How this beer ended up this way I have no idea. My mouth is still liking the last mouthful. I vote for it being a good pilsner in a dunkle mode. Really good.
Jack Russell Huntsmans Lager;Camino, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty with a touch of cardboard and some other weird smell that kind of hard to identify. Its not wile or bad, just sorta weird and unidentifiable. A medium bodied pilsner. Malts are mild and slightly sweet. Hops are very mild and a touch floral. It�s very drinkable, and way better than most pilsners, but its still kind of average. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Le Cheval Blanc Vienna Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;Entered from notes from Fall/Winter 2003/2004. Lightly toasty malt aroma. Pale amber-copper with decent off-white head that diminishes to ring. Mild toasted malt flavour with balancing bitterness and sweet finish. Medium-light body and creamy mouthfeel. On tap at the brewpub.
Le Cheval Blanc Vienna Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;Copper red beer, with some nice hops and yeast in the nose. Again, the fresh bready taste comes in the mouth, like bread raising, and malted balls, with some fruitiness at the end. (reated at BP in Dec. 2003)

21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;On draft at 21st Amendment. Pours a light amber with a white head. Citrus, pine, grapefruit, light body. Very drinkable. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. The Giants are still in their first homestand, so this can�t have been on tap more than a few days. Gold with a small white head that laves the glass. The aroma is floral and has a touch of grapefruit. Just a bit of pale malt comes through, but it�s mostly just smooth floral hops on the nose. The flavor is lightly sweet pale malt and floral hops with a touch of citrus and about a medium IPA bitterness in the finish. A touch of alcohol comes through in the mouthfeel, which is medium, but is all the more evident having this after the session IPA that is Bitter American. Pretty well constructed for a basic single malt and single hop IPA, and pretty drinkable overall, but just not that interesting or impressive next to Bitter American.
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Clear golden with a fizzy white head. A good solid balanced dead on for the style ipa. Grapefruit and bitterness. What more needs to be said?
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Tap at the brewpub: Clear golden with a dense off white head. Resiny hop aroma- light peanut brittle in the background. Creamy and slightly slick texture. Spicy hop flavor (I guessed centennial?) but it�s cascade (similar hops). Peppery, piny and a smooth sweetness hold up the hops. A solid IPA.
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Draft. Golden amber beer with an off-white head. Citrusy, light floral aroma. Citrusy flavor that turns floral and lingers with just a bit of pine. Medium body. Decent hoppiness.
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Pretty light color, orange-amber, thinly topped. Orange-citrusy aroma. Full-up flowery hoppiness here (I�d guess Simcoe, but it reads Cascade), almost resiny, but not quite. Excellent brew. (#3411, 4/11/2008)
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Overly soft and underwhelming beer that is mule more Pale, than India. More of a malt forward golden ale with a very one dimensional hop profile.
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. This was the day before opening day, it rained heavily, Bonds went 1-4 with a ground rule double and the A�s won the game. Oh well, it was dry and warm in the pub. The beer was gold in color with a white head. Good cascade hop aroma. Thick palate. Strong berry flavor. The hops in this beer are plentiful, flavorful and not harsh. Has a nice tartness and sweetness all at once. I find this to be a very good IPA.
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;This is another good california IPA. The taste is big with awesome hops. This has greater than 80 IBUs. The malt is light and not really balanced, but it�s tough to balance the extraordinary hop taste. Excellent IPA.
21st Amendment Opening Day IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;Tap. Well, it was two days before opening day, but I saw the Giants beat the A's and Barry Bonds hit a homerun. The beer had a dark amber color with a foamy laced off-white head. A nice fresh bright hop aroma. The bite on the palate is strong and leaves a big bitter finish. This has a little sweetness hidden on the front.
Hangtown Golden Ale;Placerville, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hangtown Brewery;"""Brewer�s Description of this Beer: Light in color and taste, this ale is perfect for those who enjoy a refreshing beer without any lingering, heavy aftertaste.

Hangtown Golden Ale;Placerville, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hangtown Brewery;bottles mainly only found in the placerville area, if you ask your store to carry them i have found that they will.

Hanby Wem Special;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wem Brewing;Cask conditioned - handpump - Wig and Pen Northampton. A gold coloured beer with some whitish bubbles around the edge. There are apples in both the aroma and taste, and a bit of vinegar in the taste too. Hops are hinted at, and I think this has not yet conditioned out.
Hanby Wem Special;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wem Brewing;Cask at the Wellington Arms, Bedford. Mid amber with a small white head. Floral hoppy aroma. Gentle, oily mouthfeel with smooth fruits and a sharp bitter finish. One of those beers that becomes less appealing as you drink it. A cardboard overtaste seemed to creep in.
Hanby Wem Special;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wem Brewing;Cask Stillage at the Civic Hall, Nantwich 26/09/2003 Golden amber coloured smooth and creamy on the palate. Some sour flavour. Hoppy finish.
Hanby Wem Special;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wem Brewing;Crown & Thistle, Gravesend. Dark amber best bitter with plenty of juice and a real tangy English hops finish. Elements of bitter almonds also emerge in the finish. A decent traditional bitter.

Nethergate Priory Mild;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Mild Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask @ The Wadkin, Nr Selby, N. Yorkshire. Almost pitch black, medium consistency. Quite dry in the mouth with charcoal elements, can't detect much sweetness. Finishes slightly bitter. Reasonable....

Nethergate Priory Mild;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Mild Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys Bishopsgate as �Nethergate Priory�, a mild weighing in at 3.5%. Almost opaque black with very little head at all. Aroma is molasses, cola. Body is smooth, tingly carbonation, touch oily. Taste is quite sweet up front, oily almost pungent roast malt, dates, flat cola, molasses. A definite balancing bitterness, but very understated and delicate (which obviously defines the style). A bit chewy sweet for me, this one. Quite flavourful though. A sipper even at the low abv.
Nethergate Priory Mild;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Mild Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Ok. Very dark to black, quite flat and not much head. Fairly flavourful. Surprisingly heavy-going.
Nethergate Priory Mild;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Mild Ale;Nethergate Brewery;On cask at the Cask and Barrel. Appearance - dark brown to black with some red chinks. Decent head. Nose - light red fruit then chocolate biscuits. Taste - a touch of honeycomb, chocolate, caramel biscuits. Palate - close to medium bodied with a creamy texture and a long dry balanced finish. Overall - a tasty mild.

Nethergate Priory Mild;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Mild Ale;Nethergate Brewery;"Cask at the Crosse Keys (JDW), London. Tawny with a ring of tan head; nutty aroma; earthy with a bitter nut kernel taste; and some demerara sugar to finish. Rather on the bitter side for a mild."

Stadin EXXtra Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Stadin Panimo;Sampled draught at Helsinki Beer Festival. Pours thick, orange coloured and slightly hazy. Heavy grassy flowery nose.

Sweet stout aroma, plenty of grains, plenty of roast. Full palate, carbonation pleasant. Full and sweet body - burntness providing some liquorice against the otherwise sweet body. Finish dry and burnt. Didn�t get so much rye from this. Rating rediscovered while packing for a move in 2010.
Stadin Ruisportteri;Helsinki, Finland;Porter;Stadin Panimo;Sampled draught at Helsinki Beer Festival. Black with beige head. Dry and bready with notes of coffee. The slightly sharp, spicy rye flavour overshadows some of the roastiness. Short coffee finish with sharp bitterness.

Lammin Mahti;Lammi, Finland;Traditional Ale - Other;Lammin Sahti;"Sampled draught at Helsinki Beer Festival. Ladies and gentlemen, behold the first ""kristall-sahti"". They've made away with the usualy muddy appearance and instead this beer pours amber coloured and nearly entirely clear. It is thick and bready with loads of rye character. It is sweet, but not cloying, chewy and soft. Am I only imagining that some of the estery banana aromas are gone? The finish is completely without bitterness and more like liquid rye bread."

Beer Hunters MuflonIPA;Pori, Finland;IPA;Panimoravintola Beer Hunter's;Draught at bar. Amber color, white head. Bitter taste with much citrus, caramel, floral hops and pine. Fairly balanced body, could be a bit fuller though. Dry bitter finish. Good IPA.
Beer Hunters MuflonIPA;Pori, Finland;IPA;Panimoravintola Beer Hunter's;Sample draught at Helsinki Beer Festival. Very dark brown with grassy oily saaz hop character. Medium bodied and quite firm with soft maltiness. Low hop rate, and just about average bitterness. An indivdual cross of beer types. The friendly brewmaster laughed and described it as a too dark IPA with too much malt character, the wrong type of hops and too little bitterness...

Teerenpeli Laiskajaakko;Lahti, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;330 ml bottle from 2016 Craft Beer Advent Calendar. Pours a hazy ruby/chestnut brown with orange highlights, rapidly vanishing head. Aroma is of treacle, chestnuts, earth, raw cane sugar. Taste is very much like the aroma -- chestnut, maybe a little smoky peat which redeems it (slightly). Hops not obvious, more like borage. Mouthfeel: fizzy, spritzig, quickly becoming flat and clammy. One thing you gotta say about this offering is that it consistently collapses across the senses -- visually, aromatically, tastewise, and with the palate. Doesn�t really fit into box presentation theme of American style craft beers. More of a Dunkel than anything American craft.

Hops Powder Horn Pilsner;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);This was the best beer I had at the Ft. Lauderdale Hops restauraunt.

Thirst-quenching and quite okay in that respect, but too stereotypical and even boring example of its style (like most of Haacht�s beers)."

Christian Drouin Coeur du Lion Pays dAuge Cidre;Coudray-Rabut, France;Apple Cider;Christian Drouin;"12 oz. pour at Holy Grale. Called ""Pays d�Auge Cidre"" without the ""du Lion"" business. Aroma: Slightly musty apple skins; moderate bittersweet apple juice; light oak. Appearance: Hazy light caramel color with a sticky bone head (Head! In a cider!) that eventually settles into a skin.

St. Austell Black Prince;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Mild Ale;St. Austell Brewery;[cask at 2009 GBBF, Earl�s Court] Dark black porter, looks quite thin on the pour rather than being viscous. Light at 4%abv. There was something about this I was trying to put my finger on for ages � it�s roasty but not too dark. There�s a hint of molasses, a sweetness but with some subtlety. It�s good stuff � I was getting hints of what I thought was slight coffee � but I realised later it reminded me of sugared tea � the bitter tannin flavour that�s not quite coffee-bitter, mixed with a sweetness. Good stuff [05082009]

Wieckse Lichte;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;A very light yellow beer with a fine white head. The aroma is sour - sour from wheat and sour from hops to try to cover the lack of alcohol - the only other thing in the aroma than sourness is some hints of lemon. The flavor is like water with a slice of lemon put in - it must be carbonated water since it feels fizzy in the mouth.

Spots of soapy lacing left behind. Earthy aroma with grassy hops along with some oak and buttery diacetyl presence which is really unpleasant. Lots of pale malts underneath with hints of light fruit. Medium bodied with a very unpleasant combination of flavors. There�s some faint grassy hops and a very strong cider/apple flavor that is extremely unpleasant. The diacetyl presence from the aroma is also prominent with some of the oak character as well. There�s a lot going on here and none of it is good. Drain pour.

Two Brothers Old Mans Irish Coffee;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Chicago Barrel Aged Beer Festival. This seemed kind of cool to me, dry hopping, except with fresh coffee beans. The initial smell seemed to be the aroma of a huge, rainforest tree's leaf bruttally ripped open and the gels spread on a piece of burnt toast. However, the second sniff yielded intense coffee aromas coming from very fresh beans. The aroma was so strong, it could possibly have had caffeine in it. The darkest espresso I've ever experienced. This beer tastes like a coffee smells. I had trouble sleeping, and I think it is because of this beer. The most interesting beer I've had from Two Brothers, save maybe the Weiss Wine. Thick and full with plenty of flavor and character. A great name for a great beer. The biggest surprise of the Barrel Aged Beer Festival.

Es interpretiert den Begriff alt eher s��lich-malzig als malzig-bitter wie die Kollegen aus Ddorf! Bedenkt man den recht niedrigen Alkohol-Gehalt kommt es auch reichlich vollmundig daher. Kein Alt f�r alle Tage -denn auf Dauer ist es mir zu s��- aber ein sch�nes Wochenende kann man sich als Altier-Gelegenheits-Trinker locker damit vertreiben!

Malty notes, colour malts, sweet but cake neither bread - in between. Sweet-malty with a bakery touch - bottom of the pie. good sugar syrup with a maple touch and in the finish some shy hops.

Rebellion Overdraft;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;"Cask at The Monks� Retreat (JDW), Reading. I really enjoyed this; amber with an off-white head which, though small, lasted to the bottom of the glass leaving lots of lacing; malty aroma with a hint of spice; big and malty in the mouth with some spicy notes again, then a watery lull before the pleasantly bitter aftertaste hits; finish is smooth and creamy."

Davenports Original Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);My brown 500ml bottle has a best before date of May 2009, it is being consummed mid Feb 2009 (now). Poured into a UK pint sleeve glass. It looks fine and is the copper colour claimed on the label, there is a hint of a haze and the white foaming head sets it off very nicely. Very English hop, malts and yeast aroma, maybe on the sweet side as the malts assert themselves in the glass. Oh dear, they forgot to put any taste in the brew. Where has the 4% ABV gone, where have the ingrediants that gave me the aroma disappeared too? I am drinking a fizzy, watery, slightly malty glass of dishwater. No body and a sad, sad beer indeed. First impressions can obviuosly be wrong, looks and smells OK, pity about everything else. I�ve still got two thirds of the pint left, I�m off to find some cheese to help me finish the beer off, can�t drink it on its own!

Davenports Original Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);500ml bottle. Pours a hazy mid-gold, with a minimal head, yet reasonably good lacing. The aroma is fairly simple, consisting mainly of honey notes, with some faint bread hints. The hops are quite moderate to begin with, offering up some faint floral notes and mild citrus, but after a short while a honey flavour develops, which mixes with them quite well. The finish is quite sweet, with honey and caramel notes present. Being perfectly honest, this is not the best bitter out there. To begin with, I quite disliked it. However, it did grow on me a little, and it certainly went fairly well with the spicy pork stir-fry I was eating with it. Thus, I would say that this, whilst far from the most interesting beer, is a fairly good simple session drinker, and good with spicy food.
Davenports Original Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Bottled. Golden, small to average and mostly diminishing head.

Davenports Original Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);[500ml bottle, Tesco, New Street Birmingham] After reading the label and discovering it contained sugar syrup I was really not looking forward to this one at all. The first taste was really unexpected - a bitter sharpness up front. The sweetness followed afterwards and made for a rather unpleasant combination. Redeeming features - slight hoppy finish in there somewhere, plus a nice amber colour, good clean pour. That�s not enough to save it, however.

DuClaw Alchemy Oatmeal Stout;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;DuClaw Brewing Company;I had oatmeal for breakfast (I ran out of my kashi cereal. I don�t usually eat kashi but I figured I would try it. It was quite tasty I might buy it again.) so this beer had strong potential. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint.

Southern Tier Porter;Lakewood, New York, United States;Porter;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Solid all-around porter. Semi-thick and creamy with a sweet chocolate malt character. Great balance and not super hoppy like some American porters, while still maintaining that flavor and feel for this style. Growing on me with each sample. A little similar to Anchor's which is one of my favorites. This is going to be a new staple for me.
Southern Tier Porter;Lakewood, New York, United States;Porter;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);A solid example of the style. No odd or off putting notes as some porters have. But also did not bring anything special to the table. Fine to drink when it's the best a menu has the offer but not worth seeking out or buying. Try Fullers London Porter, founders Porter, or Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald. Those will not disappoint ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Southern Tier Porter;Lakewood, New York, United States;Porter;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);bottle @ Jungle Jim�s / Cincinnati OH --- Aroma of musty toasted malt. Near black color, deep tan head, hanging strands of lace. Taste is lightly toasted malt that moves through light fizz to a quick sharp dip to bittering, followed by a gradual return to bittersweet malt in a long finish. Interesting, light, as a porter should be, easy-drinking.
Southern Tier Porter;Lakewood, New York, United States;Porter;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Black as the night with a frothy tan head (that gives in a bit to fast). Ok intensity in the aroma. Medium + body and smooth carbonation level. Ok sweetness with a fine bitterness to back it up. A bit oily texture. Cold coffee, chocolate, toffee, roast and bready flavor. Ok complexity.. [Bottle from a trade with Sigmund]
Southern Tier Porter;Lakewood, New York, United States;Porter;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Let it warm up and poured the bottle into a 16 oz.Belgian ale glass. The foam filled the glass to the brim and then dissipated to a creamy film atop the deep brown brew. Malty cocoa aroma. The flavor was disappointing, roasty, milky and pretty mild, a bit burnt and bitter at the end, but in general underwhelming. Thin bodied and mildly carbonated... nothing to really dislike here, but not much to please either.

Southern Tier Pilsner;Lakewood, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);From old notes so the details are a bit vague. I remember when Southern tier started and they focused on traditional ales. They mad credible exampled but nothing that really grabbed attention. This one was such a beer. Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a pale yellow color with a large foamy white head. The aroma was light tangy and crisp fruity hops. The flavor was tangy with light floral and fruity hops with a touch of bread. The finish turned a bit dry with some lingering hops. Light body. Ok.
Southern Tier Pilsner;Lakewood, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Fruity and a bit metallic aroma. Very lacey. Light colour. Easy drink and fruity, with lemon promient taste and drying, a tad metallic finish. Above-average carbonation. Satisfying summer beverage.Nice balance with understated malt.
Southern Tier Pilsner;Lakewood, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);This is the best of the few pilsners I�ve had so far. Just seemed to be a very drinkable beer.
Southern Tier Pilsner;Lakewood, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with shadey, thanks Shane!) Now this is an American pilsner I could drink with some frequency. It features a mildly sweet, fairly bready flavor that is wonderfully balanced by a spicy, moderately bitter hops. The nose is strongly dominated by the sweet, bready aromas, with hops being a minor component of the nose in general. Light to medium in body, but the palate is plenty full enough for the style and shows some crispness from the hops. Golden yellow in color and fully cloudy in appearance. The bubbly, off-white head pours to an inch in height, but maintains a thin but complete layer atop the beer for the entire session. Lots of patchy lacing is deposited on the glass. Another solid effort from Southern Tier.
Southern Tier Pilsner;Lakewood, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Golden with good head and lacing. Bready malts with an excellently dry pepper hop finish. The prickly carbonation also helps cleanse the sweetness from your palate. I�m not sure how old my bottle is, but it tasted very fresh

Gingers Beer;Poznan, Poland;Flavored - Other;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);It is rather a sweet beverage than beer but you can actually feel the taste of ginger in it. And this is what makes its flavor fairly original when compared with other beverages of this kind.

Flossmoor Station Dark Star Imperial Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On draft at brewpub Don�t let the people who rated from a third-hand bottling fool you, this is an excellent beer. Dark, thick black pour, with a creamy brown head. Lots of aromas, dried fruits, chocolate, coffee, caramel. The roastiy taste hits you then devles into chocolates, and black coffee. There is some hop flavor as well, which is a pleasant surprise. I don�t often enjoy stouts, but this one is excellent.

Flossmoor Station Dark Star Imperial Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Bottle from TAR. Black color with no head.

Flossmoor Station Dark Star Imperial Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Wow, thanks to Jeffin7 for sharing this one with me - when I was over to pick up a growler he bought for me no less! Hand bottled from a growler (TAR). Deep, dark brown - near black - with a small tan head. Aroma is medium bitter chocolate, roasted malt, fudge, with a hint of licorice and alcohol. Flavor is chocolate, roasted malt, licorice, toasted tree bark, mild coffee, mild tobacco, and a bit of yeast towards the end. Smooth, creamy, velvety palate all the way through.
Flossmoor Station Dark Star Imperial Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Hand bottled from a growler (thanks TAR): Pours black with a thin tan head. Aroma of dark chocolate brownies, and dark fruit. Flavor of sweet and bitter chocolate, dark fruits, mild coffee, and a mild tobacco. An excellent full bodied full flavored imperial stout.
Flossmoor Station Dark Star Imperial Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft: Black, but permeable. Thick beige foam settles to a creamy collar. Enormously estery nose of rum-soaked berries and cinnamon. Fudge, smoke, and toffee lay buried beneath the richness. Oily, delicately carbonated body. Opens with a gritty cocoa edge which adds sturdiness to the body. Quite yeasty. Myriads of assorted-berry esters beautifully frame a rich fusion of bittersweet chocolate and full-blown roast. Presence of alcohol is next to nil. Roastiness generates a flash of acidity. The center reveals loads of coarse char intensity with burnt matchsticks accompanying a huge black malt snap, which also dries out the beefy body. Decadence of espresso and fudge never fully blossom due to the regnant �unspent� roasted malt flavor. Fresh dried plums relinquish their ripeness to the intense grainy-dry, tar-drenched roast finish and mild huskiness. Notwithstanding the yeastiness, this is extremely nice.
Flossmoor Station Dark Star Imperial Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;New creation from FS...and it demonstrates their willingness to experiment. Great rich chocolate mouthfeel. Roasted malt sweetness and an usually hoppy aftertaste. I think they call it Dark Star because, midway through my third pint, not only did the lights go out, but the stars in the night sky, one by one, began to silently blink out (thank you Issac Asimov)
Flossmoor Station Dark Star Imperial Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;There is a lot going on in a glass of this brew. Thick black liquid. Dark brown, frothy head. Aromas: anise, coffee, chocolate, caramel - - - HEAVILY ROASTED THINGS!!! After each cycle of sniffing, swallowing, absorbing, the tastes and aromas kept changing. Dark dried fruits, chocolate, roasted malts, burnt toffee and caramel, coffee, licorice... all of these and more made themselves known. AND, a BITTER and HOPPY finish!!! Egads. If this drink had a woman�s name, I might consider getting married again. As it is, I guess I�ll have to settle for drinking this beer seasonally. Flossmoor Station, Flossmoor, IL
Flossmoor Station Dark Star Imperial Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Very dark beer with a mahogany redness around the shoulders of the snifter.

De Troch B12 Energy Beer;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;Bottle. Clear golden color, flat. Aroma of banana and medicine. Taste is metallic fruit. Saps my energy.
De Troch B12 Energy Beer;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;Bottle at Kulminator. Almost clear golden liquid with a minimal white head. Aroma of banana, sugar, lemon, mint and cardboard. Taste is high sweet and light sour with notes of banana, sugar, lemon and cardboard. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Horribly sweet and weird.
De Troch B12 Energy Beer;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;Bottle at Kulminator. Clear pale gold, with just a couple of white bubbles. Aroma of red bull, sweet fruity notes, lemon, soda. Taste is sweet, lemony, really really sweet, banana, oxidization notes. A lot better than Chapeau Banane, but that only means what it means.
De Troch B12 Energy Beer;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;Bottle @ Kulminator. Clear yellow with a small white head and no lacing. Aroma is sugary and is really similar to energy drinks. The taste is also sweet/sugar with light fruitiness. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Cola-like finish. This is quite funny that B12 Energy Beer is classified as a fruit lambic as this doesn�t taste like lambic at all and there�s not much lambic in there. It�s not good, but it�s really not as bad as it sounds.
De Troch B12 Energy Beer;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;From the backlog Bottle at Kulminator Head: none Colour: Gold Smell: smells exactly like any sweet energydrink taste isn�t needed to mention as you allready know what it taste like when u smell it ... gross !
De Troch B12 Energy Beer;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;De Troch Whale enjoyed at the Kulminator. Initial impressions are great... clear bottle, hand-drawn label and 3 E-numbers on the ingredients list! It pours clear golden with a medium white head. The nose is damn sweet, sherbet, parma violets, energy drink, refreshers and love hearts (the sweet). The taste is refreshers, tangy fruit, energy drink, sugar, mouth-puckering tanginess and fruit-salad sweets with a dry finish. Light-medium body, moderate carbonation and sticky-mouth-feel. Pretty perverse stuff all-round. If you need an energy drink and want to consume some lambic at the same time this could very well indeed be the drink you need!
De Troch B12 Energy Beer;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;Bottle @ Kulminator. Cheers to Scopey brandishing the harpoon on this one. The pour�s sickly light amber gold with no head whatsoever. The nose is straight up Red Bull energy drink. Loads of medicinal sweetness and little else. The taste is similar. Loads of candy, syrup. Some oxidized flavors in the finish (cardboard etc). Drank blind I would never guess that lambic is mixed in here. Oh man. Atrocious! Cool stuff though.
De Troch B12 Energy Beer;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;bottle shared in delirium cafe by i think siebeltje ?? than i had a bottle for my own @ kulminator. pours lager-ish, but withoud the foam. smells like candy your grandma woul buy in the 90�s, wich she�d now open for you... old and yuck... taste is like a bad version of energy drink, combined with again that old candy-thing. drinkability is extremely high, but if i wouldnt know it was a beer / it had alcohol , i would have never guessed it
Kingston Johns Strong Cider;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Apple Cider;Kingston Brewing Co.;Good apple flavor, a little sweet, a little tangy, and with a nice slight honey finish. Refreshing, and enjoyable. Nice stuff.
Kingston Johns Strong Cider;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Apple Cider;Kingston Brewing Co.;NEW NOTES - Very clear light gold with clean sassy fruity nose, taste tart wonderful apple and yeast, mineral, kind of like a good French bistro white wine - dry, spare and elegant. Vastly better. *** OLD RATE *** I found this medium-light bodied with some genuine flavors of apple, but a bit dilute and parching on the finish. Still a good drink, it just lacks the �sass� and flavor density of really good british cider. Worth a try. 6 3 6 2 11 2.8
Kingston Johns Strong Cider;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Apple Cider;Kingston Brewing Co.;A golden bubbly cider with a thin white head. A slightly funky apple and gueuze aroma.

Alexander Keiths Honey Brown;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a red to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving a slight lacing. The smell was a dull honey as it didn�t really seem to be real honey, something just seemed off. The taste was kind of a sour to sweet weirdness going on. On the palate, I�m thinking it was about a light on the body but I�m not exactly finding this too sessionable.

Tin Whistle Coyote Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Draft - Light sweet biscuit. Clear gold with a rich white head, light spicy grains and a nice finish. Not bad.
Tin Whistle Coyote Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;On tap at Tin Whistle, pours a clear blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out light biscuity notes and not much else. Flavour is similarly bland, with cereal and dry biscuity malt. Clean and drinkable enough, but pretty boring and pointless.
Tin Whistle Coyote Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;650ml bottle pours a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves some surprisingly decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is light caramel malts with some light fruits and mild flowery hops. Taste is mild caramel malt sweetness with some citrus fruits and moderate hoppy bitterness in the finish. Medium body and enough carbonation to leave a pleasing sensation on the palate. Quite an enjoyable and tasty ale for the style.
Tin Whistle Coyote Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;This was a nice ale, pours with a good-sized head. Initial taste and after-taste both quite acceptable. Appearance is clear. I would drink this beer again. Sadly, the label is none too descriptive.
Tin Whistle Coyote Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;This beer pours honey brown, and had nothing for a cap except for some small bubbles around the rim of the glass, actually it look identical to clean motor oil. Very hard aroma to pick up, the smell is almost non existent, but would could picked up was of sweet malt and maybe some faint earth. The mouth feel was slightly oily and thin, but did have good carbonation. The taste was mildly bitter, and malty, I think there maybe some smoke in the background of this beer and some honey. The taste isn�t watered down but it seems held back by something, not to much flavor in this brew. This to me is just a average beer, nothing standoutish at all but nothing bad either.
Tin Whistle Coyote Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Excellent beer! I�ve had some inconsistancies with some of the Tin Whistle brews - but I blame that soley on not having access to the freshest beer. Beer cap deep white head with various sized bubbs came and went, but oddly enough the tiny ammount that was left over produced really impressive lacing that lasted the entire bottle. Smells of honey, apricots and mild flavourful malts made me drool - I�m hooked on malty brew lately. Nice dirty gold hue. Movement of the glass gives way to tons of tiny bubbs. Tangy and tasty! Yummy flavourful malts dominate this slightly sweet brew, but once it warms, the apricots come out and not in a sickeningly sweet way either while a mild bitterness hides in the background. The only advantage of the large bottle is that you get to drink this much and watch the flavours evolve - vacuum and seal the bottle between glasses or it�ll get gross and flat.
Tin Whistle Coyote Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;"650 ml bottle from Sherbrooke Liquor (Edmonton), served cold in a wine glass. App.: Fairly deep golden, clean, minimal white froth. Aroma: Big gobs of sweet honey and sugar, very malty, a touch floral, some caramel, toffee and golden syrup, a bit of grain and cereal, a touch vegetal, Palate: Medium body, very soft carbonation. Flav.: Much like the nose, lots of really sweet honey, corn syrup, golden syrup, caramel, toffee, and any other overtly malt-like flavours; somewhat sweet, no bitterness. Not for me."

Tin Whistle Black Widow;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;No idea how this rating system will work for me and my brews. This is my first. Nice dark ale that doesn't taste all that dark. Very little head. Lightly carbonated? Not a lot of after taste for me. Some people notice chocolate, but for some reason I don't notice the chocolate. Lightly roasted I agree with. Very easy to drink. I find my rating's will be consistent with my other beer club, which may make it confusing for some. I give it 3/5, meaning it's a good beer but I probably won't buy it again for whatever reason. If it was put in front of me, I'd have no problem slamming this 650ml bottle back. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Tin Whistle Killer Bee Dark Honey Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Pours a light black to Cola brown with a quickly dissipating head.

District ChopHouse Belgian Bastogne;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);A transluscent wit beer? Looks filtered, absolutely no wheaty haze ... to its detriment in my opinion. Aroma is decent, orange peel, citrus, etc., but a little harsh for a wit. Unfortunately the flavor is the same. Contains orange peel and yeast spiciness, but there is way too much flavoring/aroma hops. A decent brew, perhaps, taken out of style, but not a good offering as a wit.
Widmer Brothers Drop Top Amber Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Low formation foam, medium density and very short duration. Amber coloured with traces of copper and little bit cloudy. Aroma brings a lot of toffee, and a caramel wich reminds of caramelised fruits like bananas but with a very well balanced and pleasant sweetness. The hops got hidden and should be more present but i liked this at all. On mouth, amazing. The caramel comes at first, very intense but with an amazing sweetness, very well balanced, followed by malted notes with a bitterness came more from toasted notes but very interesting. Aftertaste is the best part of amber ales. Very malted, with caramel and no sweetness. These notes asks for another sip. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Zerodegrees Black Lager;Blackheath, Greater London, England;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Zerodegrees Microbrewery;Keg at Zerodegrees Blackheath. It pours hazy/murky deep brown with a small beige head. The nose is earthy, plenty of dirty sulphur, burnt egg sandwich, sweet roast, manure, rivita and burnt toast. The taste is bitter-sweet, earthy roast, rivita, cocoa powder, slight stickiness, pepper and weak coffee grounds with a dry, toasted finish. Light - medium body and fine, prickly carbonation. Wow that aroma is very off-putting. Taste is better, but still not great. A poorly executed beer for sure.

The flavor is sweet, with notes of anise and orange, ending on a very slight bitterness. More like a summer beer, than an easter beer.

Belle Isle Wild Marys Wheat;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Wheat Ale;Belle Isle Brewery;"Wow, this is pretty fruity. Tons of orange in this. Very cloudy. A little bit thickish. Extremely wheaty; too much for me."
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;Draft. Brown beer with a dark cream head. Caramel and light grain aroma. Caramel flavor. Medium bodied.Caramel lingers with what seems like a light sour infection.
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;Better than expected. Nice roasted malt and nut aroma. Dark but with a thin head. Palate was too watery and lacked the creamy feel I was hoping. Taste was a copy of the aroma. Safe beer since the ABV was so low.
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;Pours amber brown with a white head. Flavor and mouthfeel are pretty weak.
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;Much better than the other stout. Some coffee right from the start. Their thickest beer by far. A slightly sweet aroma.
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;Blackish pour, low head, and lacing. Dry, nutty, aroma. Slight worcestershire flavor, surprisingly highly carbonated for a stout. Some woody, nutty notes. A low coffee undertones. Kind of weak, but I enjoyed the coffee flavors. Not bad for a local microbrew.

Light aroma of grain and roasted nut. Taste includes toffee and very light oatmeal. Light bodied. Rather disappointing overall...
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;Tastes better than the Bricktown Brewery stout, but not as good as the Coach�s stout. Black body, almost no head. Sweet and thing with some barely detectable oatmeal in the background.
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;"Draft at the brewpub, 11/15/06: Reddish black with a sticky but thin, quickly dying foamy/fizzy head. Vague roasty aroma. Likewise a light flavor palate ... oak, smoke, toasted malt. Bit on the light side for an ""oatmeal stout"", but not too bad."
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;Probably the best most flavorful of the Belle Isle lineup. Looks dark and rich but those flavors only linger for but a few seconds. Flavors of cheap coffe and bad chocolate slightly dominate. I think these guys use the same hops in all their beers.
Belle Isle Oatmeal Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Belle Isle Brewery;Draft at the brewpub: poured dark brown with ruby highlights. You can still see through it. Mild roasted malt aroma with some olive juice. Body is fairly thin. Flavor is roasted malts and a little chocolate. Slightly sour. Not too awfully bad but kind of thin.
Unionsbr�u Unimator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Unionsbr�u Haidhausen;On tap at the brewpub. Sampled at Starkbierzeit 2012 with Bela. Very delicious one from this small brewery at Einsteinstrasse. It is worth to take a trip to here.
Unionsbr�u Unimator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Unionsbr�u Haidhausen;Part of the great Munich Beer Raid 2010. On tap at the brewpub. Pours a hazy red brown color with a thick off white head. Aroma is ginger cookie dough and spices. Taste is very sweet and is much like those Winter ginger cookies. Palate is also sweet and soft. This beer goes down way too easy. Very different and good brewpub craft beer!!
Unionsbr�u Unimator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Unionsbr�u Haidhausen;"Cask Very red shiny granat beer; thick dense head, impossible to assess its colour. Vegetable nose with cucumber and aniseed, overlying malts. Hops in the beer - at last! With quite some roasted notes and a malty background. Very slight sourishness, a bit fruity. Well-bodied Bock, without being syrupy. Decent Bock, and I guess pretty drinkable. Unless it�s the 10th 1/2 litre of the day."
Unionsbr�u Unimator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Unionsbr�u Haidhausen;A dark amber beer with a thin orange head. The aroma is sweet with notes of alcohol and caramel. The flavor is sweet with very strong notes of caramel, but also notes of alcohol, leading to a woody and slightly metallic end - the metal stemming from the alcohol. Nice one.

Unionsbr�u Unimator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Unionsbr�u Haidhausen;"Sign says ""drink slowly"",and indeed that is a good advice, this is a dangerous beer: Honey and fruit (strawberries) in head and aroma. Cloudy red amber in color, certainly lighter in color than most dark doppelbock I know, big fluffy head. Sweet fresh tastenotes which remind of a belgian golden ale. Slightly vineous aftertaste.Creamy mouthfeel, yet full and yeasty. Hides its strength very very well."
Unionsbr�u Unimator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Unionsbr�u Haidhausen;glorius beer. coppery brown with a soft head. nice lacing. ultra malty, with toffee ,caramel ,milk chocolate but never too sweet. hops give it a slight bittering finish. quite possibly the besr beer I drank while in Munich.

Bricktown Black Gold Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout;Bricktown Brewery;(Tap) Pours an inky black with a tan head that didn�t look too bad. Only the slightest aroma, which was slightly bitter. Flavor is of roasted or burnt malts. A decent bitter finish. If it wasn�t so watery, this beer might have actually tasted pretty good.
Bricktown Black Gold Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout;Bricktown Brewery;I�m going to go out on a limb and say that this wasn�t a terrible beer. It had some toffee and coffee tastes, and if you ignored the complete lack of aroma and the totally watered down body, you�d be left with something that you may consider beer, but in the end realize that its still just watered down crap.
Bricktown Black Gold Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout;Bricktown Brewery;This is just too thin and watery tasting. Tastes like it�s flavored with essence of roasted malt. The roastiness is there but it�s ruined by the watery body and citrusy notes.
Bricktown Black Gold Stout;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Stout;Bricktown Brewery;(On tap) Black with an orangey red haze and a creamy, beige head. Very burned aroma. Medium body with lots of burned malt with very nice accents of both licorice and chocolate. Dry finish with a light bitterness from the black malts. Definitely the best Bricktown of the day. Quite delicate. 210306

Bricktown Rock Island Rail Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bricktown Brewery;on tap-pours an off white head and gold color. Aroma is sweet grain. Taste is sweet grain, secondary herbal/spice hops.
Bricktown Rock Island Rail Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bricktown Brewery;[Tap] Just when I start to think that Bricktown Brewery has turned the corner with respect to beer quality, they come out with stuff like this. Pours a light golden color with a small and fizzy head. Nasty aroma of oxidized hops, old malts and corn syrup. The taste is not much better. Grainy body is mixed with some wet paper and astringent light hoppy finish. Very light and watery. Highly disappointing.
Bricktown Rock Island Rail Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bricktown Brewery;Clear pour, low head and lace. Biscuity, dry aroma. A bit stronger than a pale lager. Nice carb, some biscuit and butter, very light and refreshing. Solid for such a light brew.
Bricktown Rock Island Rail Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bricktown Brewery;Pours a clear golden-orange color. Aroma is almost nonexistent. Flavor is light malts and citrus. Very thin and watery. A decent beer on a hot day, but nothing to write home about.
Bricktown Rock Island Rail Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bricktown Brewery;"Slightly hazy gold coloured body with an orange tint and a thin white head. Aroma of wheat, light cascade (although they say williamette) hops and citrus. Light-bodied; Hops & very light malt up front fading to a super pale taste with little else following. Aftertaste shows some bitterness, but its very mellow. I could imagine this one being good for people who don�t like the taste of beer at all! I sampled this beer on draught at the Bricktown Brewery in Oklahoma City, OK on 17-November-2005."
Bricktown Rock Island Rail Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bricktown Brewery;RE-RATE: By far the best ale offered by Bricktown brewery. Lacks the strange sour/tart notes of the other ales and has a pleasant dry finish.

Very neutral aroma - perhaps with a whiff of tartness. Very thin - almost watery - body with fruity, citrusy notes. Lightly hoppy, dry finish. 210306
Bricktown Rock Island Rail Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bricktown Brewery;While this was the best of the Bricktown beers, that isn't saying much. Diacetyl was about the only flavor I found. Very limited appeal, maybe to a Bud drinker going out on a limb.
Bricktown Rock Island Rail Ale;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bricktown Brewery;Golden red murky appearance. Smells like bread, very yeasty, very carbonated, with a burnt fruit taste.
Fancy Pants Black & Blue;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);This was the first time I've seen this on draft pre-mixed. I've had it elsewhere where the bar just mixed it from two taps. Aroma is malty, chocolatey with a fresh blueberry smell. Flavor is a good mix of their excellent porter and a fresh, tart blueberry flavor. Not overly sweet. I normally don't like fruit beers like this, but a pint of this was tasty. Not overdone with the fruit.

Aroma is floral hops, hay, boiled vegetables and a hint of resin, taste is slightly on the bitter side. Bitter piney finish, light body, light carbonation. Remember it used to have less hops a couple of years ago, this one actually reminds me quite a lot of a decent pils, body could be a bit more robust and the boiled taste reduced the score a bit.

Shed Maple Brown Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a dark ruddy brown color with a finger�s worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Subtle clingy lace speckles the glass. The aroma had some sweet nutty to caramel malts. Some maple is there, but fairly low. The flavor yields to the sweet side with a crisp nutty backbone. Sly malty aftertaste rubbing against a soft malty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good. Sly crisp yet smooth sort of feel, not cloying. Overall, decent brown ale but the maple is a tad weaker than expected.
Shed Scottish Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Chocolate cake taste followed with a sweet candy finish. Not bitter enough in my opinion to be a decent scotch ale. Way too sweet.

Thiriez Extra;Esquelbecq, France;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Thiriez;Purchased at Gerrard�s Market, Extra is a Dry-Hopped French Farmhouse Ale brewed by Brasserie Thiriez. The scent of hops, herbal notes, wheat, saison, and funk are felt upon the nose. The body has a surprisingly large character of hops. A reasonable amount of carbonation accompanies the hoppy and saison complexion. Farmhouse yeast provides a nice funk from beginning to end after you get used to the hops. An alcohol presence of 4.5% is overwhelmed by the ingredients of the beer. Saison offers the familiar tone to a dry hopped ale. Wheat adds another flavor to the saison body. Lemon brings a light bite to the mouthfeel. The lemon is crisper when you get to the bottom of the bottle. Banana gives the beverage some weight and compliments the farmhouse yeast used. Clove plays upon your tongue and spices the take. The spice bleeds into the watery, dry finish. Thyme is experienced in the finish as well. Sage is comprehended with the watery take. The water quality is exceptional. The water captures the flavors of the herbs used. The funk blends beautifully with the water. The finish is watery despite the dryness felt. Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer. For more beer reviews, visit my blog �Drink For the Love of Beer.�

Molson Carling Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Hey kids, it�s Canadian Macro Bingo time! Fizzy gold pour? check.

Molson Carling Beer;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);473ml Can. 6 pack for less than 10 bucks. Must say, as a Tiger Cats fan, that this beer far exceeds mass produced American swill like Bud, Miller, or Michelob. However, just a plain pale lager with a bland, mildly refreshing taste that I would rarely order anywhere, other than cheering on the black and gold.
Z Street Coconut Porter;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Z Street Brewing Co.;Well someone beat me to it, I wonder how many times I apsted him at the Beer Summit. Anyway, has a very dark brown color and a sweet coconut smell. Taste is of coconut/roasted malted and finishes with a nicely bitter roasted flavor. Overall another fine brew from Z Street.
Z Street Coconut Porter;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Z Street Brewing Co.;Boston Beer Summit 2003: I'm guessing this is a new offering from Z Street since it's not listed on their website yet. It's colored a nice dark brown and pours (from tap) with a good head. The aroma is sweet and smells strongly of coconut. The beer itself has a hoppy attack that bleeds into a burnt coconut aftertaste. Not unpleasant at all. As a matter of fact, I quite enjoyed it. It reminds me of Magic Hat's Ravell, but with coconut instead of vanilla flavors.
Mad Anthony Auburn Lager;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On tap in the Warsaw taproom. Amber pour with an off-white head. Aroma and taste of sweet malt with a mild hoppyness.

Mad Anthony Auburn Lager;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Bottle undated. Hazed rust. Tight cap of broken off-white foam. Plum, metal, DMS, caramel and hints of browned piecrust line the simple and generic nose. Loose carbonation. A plummy twang collides with alcohol and a light note of red licorice on entry. A purer underlying base of cookie adds some short-lived structure, but soon succumbs to the ongoing plummy acidity. Hints of springy tobacco and pecan emerge, but the malt sorely lacks depth and the body is consequently thin. Crystal-derived caramel combines with minuscule wet paper accents and a spent tealeaf and gummy bear dimension to add to the flabby mix. Minimal malt detail or sophistication and zero snap to the under-lagered body. Dull and anticlimactic finish displays notes of slick caramel chews and paper. This has somehow garnered three medals at GABF for Vienna Lager -- one of which was a gold just this year -- but I�m not seeing it. It's quite soulless and generic, with zero malt dynamism or elegance whatsoever. Disappointing.

This beer poured a dark amber brown hue with a one-finger thick head of light tan foam. Some light lacing was left around the glass. The aroma included mild caramel, nuts, and a very light noble hop note. The flavor was also very light and mild. Light caramel and nuts, followed by a light note of brown sugar.

Aroma is fairly weak, some notes of nuts, spice, and candied sugar. Texture is a bit watery, but smooth. Flavor has the typical brown ale profile, but amped up with pine hops and spice. Notes of grapefruit and candy as well. Overall, pretty nice, just needs a bit more body and aroma.

Dark amber pour with no head to note...nose is relatively bland, a bit of caramel malt and spice apparent but not assertive in any way.

Oyster Bar Oyster Stout;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;Ft Wayne '03 Pub #2. Salty--not that I mind. Rosted aroma, syrup taste. A little thin, warming may be key.
Oyster Bar Oyster Stout;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;On tap at the pub. Faint mahogany red when held up to the light with an oil slick for a head. Anise in the nose. Faint coffee bitterness with anise and molasses in the finish. A little thin with an oddly salty sensation while drinking it.
Oyster Bar Oyster Stout;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;The word in Fort Wayne was that the Oyster Bar brewed a pretty nice stout. I concur. Oyster Stout had a nice chestnut-brown body, mostly opaque, with a very slight off-white head that largely dissipated after the pour. I had a hard time detecting much of an aroma. Perhaps the beer was too cold, but I did sense some molasses and some roast. Luckily the flavor was rich and luxurious, with strong roasted chocolate and an almost salty aftertaste that beckoned for another sip. Some dry fruit as well, although I couldn't pick out its exact nature. Medium bodied, full-flavored, and saucy. Solid.
Oyster Bar Oyster Stout;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;Reddish/brown hue with an oily film on top, good tears. The aroma hinted of moderate malty notes (burnt/smoky, molasses, coffee), floral hops, raisin, cherry, ruby port, licorice, and vanilla. Full flavored stout with a smooth malt and twangy sharp bitter aspect. A touch salty and fruity as well. Long dry tart finish. Oily and lush mouthfeel. Very nice stout. The twang keeps the palate from becoming overwhelmed by the oily malty character. Recommended.
Oyster Bar Oyster Stout;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Oyster Bar Bistro and Brewery;I sampled this stout and found that it had a mild coffee taste to it that I liked because it did not have an overwhelming coffee taste which is much to my dislike. It was smooth and I would definitely have more than just a sample of this stout the next time.

Its body is a dark brown but not black color. It has a pleasant malty aroma. It starts out tasting flat and is very smooth initially then finishes with a slight bitterness with a mild coffee flavor. It was a very nice draft and was very smooth. I rather liked this beer.
Aberdeen Golden Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Standard straw hue with a fizzy small head and little lace. The aroma had hints of toasted white bread, aromatic German style hops, and lemongrass. Watery and thin body produced a light and crisp carbonated brew with minor sweetness and some bitter hops. The finish was clean of course. Boring, but wouldn't interfere with any food dishes.
Aberdeen Golden Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Light color and light body. Has a cereal taste that has some highlights. Slight yeast flavors. Good for its style. Medium carbination and good texture.
Aberdeen English Pale Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;On tap in Valpo: Golden hue with little head, no lacing. Aromatic hops, light grass, light pine, grain, and horse blanket on the nose. Citrusy forefront with a mild hop middle, finished slighty bitter, crisp and clean. Thin to medium-bodied, dry and lively mouthfeel and a slight metallic feel. Good, solid traditional English styled Pale Ale, Quaffable.
Aberdeen English Pale Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Is a spun yellow color. Slightly hazed/chilled appearance. Nutty floral hops with some caramel. Smooth texture, and medium bitter finish. Mellows out with a good hop end.
Aberdeen English Pale Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Ok, one more re-rate. This one, like the others I've tried again recently is looking up. The English hop presence is back as is the body. Appropriately light.
Aberdeen English Pale Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Medium copper to amber color. All-malt nose, off white head. Dusty, earthy malt flavor initially that turned to carmel before letting go of some light, dry hoppy notes. A decent, right on style ale that is perfect for a long session.
Aberdeen Scottish Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Scottish Ale;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Good coloring and head. The body is coming along again. This used to be a fairly decent scottish, but had diminished recently. It's on its way back in terms of body and mouthfeel. Still a little too sweet, but better.
Aberdeen Scottish Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Scottish Ale;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Ruby red with no head. Fruity, smoky, roasted malt aroma, did I really detect some peat or just wishful thinking? Raisin/plum big taste upfront with a nice twangy hop balance. Lingering malty and smoky aftertaste. Medium-bodied, soft and creamy mouthfeel. Nicely made 80 Schilling ale, enjoyed with Aberdeen's version of Shepherd Pie. Recommended.
Aberdeen Scottish Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Scottish Ale;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Very brown in appearance and approach. Smooth, watery, and reminded me of a solid brown ale. Malt tones in nose.
Aberdeen Scottish Ale;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Scottish Ale;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;This is the textbook Scottish Ale that every American brewpub should strive to achieve. It's amber-brown color, malty-nutty-peaty nose and rich, smooth mouthfull is a perfect compliment to almost any meal. I enjoyed it with hickory smoked duckling breast with asiago-chive crispy polenta, framboise reduction and wilted spinich. I know this smooth 5%+ Scottish ale will also go good with a Whopper with cheese and a large fry.
Aberdeen County Porter;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Porter;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;On tap in Valpo: Dark brown hue with reddish tint, tan small head and some lacing. Toffe, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, grape, and allspice detected in the excellent complex aroma. Piney and smoky hop presence. Turned a bit fruity midpoint and had a lingering lighty bitter finish. Thin to medium-bodied, Thin and lively mouthfeel, dry finish. A respectable porter from Porter county, hence the name.
Aberdeen County Porter;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Porter;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Dark brown black color with some red tints. Chocolate milke nose and taste with some burnt roasted flavors. Slight carbonation. Smooth with some hops. Possibly oat ad straw. A little medicinal. Good texture. Enjoyable.
Aberdeen County Porter;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Porter;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Good dark color, with some chocolate notes. Very thin body. Just not a whole lot going on here.
Aberdeen County Porter;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Porter;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Dark and thick, this chocoholic delight is more sweet-stout like and even leaves a bittersweet bakers chocolate aftertaste. Very nice ending on this one.
Aberdeen Queen Mum IPA;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;IPA;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;I don't know what happened to this IPA. It was never over-the-top good, but now it's just weird. Overly bitter is not what an IPA is supposed to be about, especially one that I named under the previous regime. The body is underbalanced. The color and head seem ok, but a sour yeastiness blasts right through. For an IPA, that seems impossible. Is it conceivable that they need to clean their tap lines? If so, that's a horrible sin for a brewpub.
Aberdeen Queen Mum IPA;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;IPA;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;On tap at Brewery: They have again changed the level of hops in the brew, now at 63 IBU. Light copper hue, small fizzy head and good lacing. Piney aroma with a hint of wood, toasted malt, herbs, citrus, and vanilla. Major hop rush, who stuck the pine tree in my face? Aggressive at the beginning, some malt sweetness in the middle and finished with a bitter bite. Medium-bodied with a dry and lively mouthfeel, slight metallic feel. This sure has changed (for the better) since my last visit. A hop-head delight. Head west of Valpo on IN-2 and try this beer. Outstanding.
Aberdeen Queen Mum IPA;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;IPA;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Tarnished gold color. strong hop-ish nose, with a hint of cheese? Slight citrus. Hops are found in the long finish. Subtle IPA and certainly no where near the big and bold variety found today. More of a bitter or pale. Creamy with a distinct amount of hops.
Aberdeen Queen Mum IPA;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;IPA;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Just enough ingredients to make this an IPA. Light amber with an ever-so-slight grapefruity hop aroma. A bit light on my palate, this is my least favorite selection at Aberdeen. They need to make a more exciting hoppy ale for this Midwest market in my opinion. Even though it is a decent ale, overall, it was presented to me at a craft brew dinner alongside the mighty Three Floyds Alpha King. The Queen's less-than-50-IBUs made it seem tame and timid.
Aberdeen Braveheart Barleywine;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Displayed a hazy reddish hue with a small off-white head and good lace. The aroma hinted of roasted caramel malts, ripe fruits (cherry, apricot, plum), aromatic hops, earthy yeast eaters, and oak wood. The taste starts out malty sweet with a big kick of alcohol the wram the chest. A nice balance of bitterness shows up for balance. The finish is dry smoked wood and a touch yeasty. The mouthfeel is slighty sticky and lush, as stated earlier, a moderate alcohol presence is noted. A good brew, not huge but still a sipping brew.
Aberdeen Braveheart Barleywine;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Light malt nose. Bright fruit flavors, something like a hint of cherry. Nice arming alcohol feeling. Some good hops in the finish, which gives it a good contrast and makes it smooth. Dark red gritty look. Brown head with good lacing.
Aberdeen Braveheart Barleywine;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;These ratings are for the 2002 brew. I tasted it alongside the 2001 edition which was done by a different brewmaster and not nearly as robust and complex (even after nearly two years of cellering). The 2002 was a deep brick red offering a nose of sweet doppel-bock like maltiness and plenty of alcohol. The taste was strong and woody. Sweet malts and alcohol battled for control. A nice hoppy end to this rich ale was welcomed. Too many of these and it's a long 30 mile taxi ride back home.
Mountain Sun Pearl Street Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;"Deep brown with a slight off-white head. Roasty maple syrupy sweet aroma. Full bodied porter; great roastiness! Notes: GABF Week �15"
Mountain Sun Pearl Street Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Pours a hazy brown with a half finger of tan head, decent retention and some lacing. Roasty, malty, nutty sweet smell. Mild sweet, almost fruity flavor that fades into chocolate, roasted, nutty tones. Moderate carbonation, medium-light body with a smooth mouthfeel.

Mountain Sun Pearl Street Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;On tap @ Southern Sun brewpub. Darkish cola brown, with dark ruby tones where the light can shine through. Light brown fluffy head. Smells like chocolate coated hops. Interesting to smell this much hops in a porter. Some coffee and cocoa come through, but unfortunately thats all I can detect. The hops provide a mild bitterness that I�m really not used to in my porters. Awesome aroma with a ho-hum taste.
Mountain Sun Pearl Street Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;sample at Mountain Sun on 4/9/10... nitro pour... black color with a creamy off white head... very smooth due to the nitro... sweet and creamy... lots of roasted malts... sweet finish... nice easy drinking porter.
Mountain Sun Pearl Street Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;An average porter. There was aroma of coffee an fruit, with little hops. The finish was abrupt and dissapointing
Mountain Sun Pearl Street Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Draught at Mountain Sun. Red/Black color, Thicker tan head that stays. Aroma is expresso, sweet chocolate, and light fruit. Flavor is smooth milk chocolate and darker roasted chocolates with heavy emphasis on the roasted Palate is longer finish.

Brew It Up! ESB;Sacramento, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brew It Up!;a color by numbers bitter, meaning it fits the style to a tee, but also does nothing to excite you, unless ESB happens to be your favorite style.
Brew It Up! ESB;Sacramento, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brew It Up!;Sample at the brewpub on 8/7/10. Clear red/copper pour with a medium tan head.

Aroma is light roasted and subdued hops fruity. Dry caramelish malt flavoured. Vague bitterness and lasting light roasted malt flavour into the far finish.
Brew It Up! ESB;Sacramento, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brew It Up!;mildly bitter and soft nutty character all the way through. Bright, translucent amber colour with a medium sized head. Pleasent malted taste to conceal some of the hops.
Brew It Up! ESB;Sacramento, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brew It Up!;Bomber from the brewpub. Medium roasted malt aroma. Dark copper/red color with a decent tan head. Starts medium with coarse carbonation. First taste said anise, but that passed on to heavily roasted malt. It has a reasonable amount of bitter. Nutty enough to head for brown ale. Smoky enough? to head for scotch ale. Strong in flavor. Might amaze our friends over the pond. Pretty drinkable.
Brew It Up! ESB;Sacramento, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brew It Up!;"This is my first ESB. ~It poured into a dark brownish copper color with a nice 1/2 inch head. ~It smelled of sweet malts. ~ Light and frothy with a bit of a tongue tingle. ~ Had a sweet nutty taste that was followed by a bittersweet after taste. I didnt detect any ""Dimethyl Sulfides (DMS)/ Cooked Vegetable Flavors"" The other tasters may have been unfortunate enough to get a bad batch. I thought this beer was pretty damn good."
Brew It Up! ESB;Sacramento, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brew It Up!;Bottle. Rich copper color with a nice off-white head. Caramel malt aroma with a bit of DMS. Caramel malt with some nuttiness and grassy/earthy hops. Nice balance. Lighter bodied. Not a bad rendition of a typical english bitter, but with higher alcohol.
Brew It Up! ESB;Sacramento, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brew It Up!;Average ESB some DMS and slightly metallic. English malt forward some nuts and tast on the palate. mild noble hop bitterness. ESB should not be bitter. some off flavors on finish.
Brew It Up! ESB;Sacramento, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brew It Up!;Light amber color. Small head. Aroma is malty, bready and sweet. A medium bodied ESB. Malts are fairly upfront, nutty and fruity. Hops are bitter and a touch floral and citrusy. Mild flavored. Somewhat overbalanced towards the malts, and there is a strange flavor that detracts from the taste a bit. Not very bitter for an ESB. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Getman Svetloe;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);Hazy yellow. Swet and yeasty, very noticeable mineral quality to it. Some mild hops, but not much going on.
Getman Svetloe;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);A rather pungent sweet malt aroma. Very fizzy. 500 ml bottle. Floaties, perhaps my bottle had done a protein drop. Some vanilla, peppery, a bit Belgian-yeasty. A long mild cakey finish.
Getman Svetloe;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);"Big fat industrial 500 ml bottle. Pours a light golden color with a frothy, airy white head. Saaz-induced hoppy aroma with a touch of pepper. Not much to the flavor, perhaps a trace of honey with some bland vegetable notes; a bit of mown grass. Mouthfeel a tad thin. Had worse from the soviet bloc."
Getman Svetloe;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);A papery aroma with som yeast. Rather thin and watery. Uninteresting beer.
Getman Svetloe;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);Golden. No aroma(served cold naturally). Not much taste. PLeasant on the beach maybe but there were no beach...
Getman Svetloe;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);very smooth going down sat very well on the palate crisp clean taste, not harsh like some of the other beers i have tried. will have again(a must)
Getman Koronne;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);Bottle... Clear golden lager with a small layer of brown sediment and a large, fluffy, off-white head. Excellent retention. Floral, almost perfumey, aroma with a light citrus note. The flavor is a mildly sweet, watered down version of orange blossom honey. Almost no bitterness. Medium-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Lengthy, delicately sweet finish. There�s so little character to this one that it�s totally inoffensive, but also completely unspectacular. It�s not even refreshing, because it�s not the least bit crisp. A silly, thin, little beer.
Getman Koronne;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);i dont really know what i have here. it says tetamah getman kopohhe on the label, whatever that means. 4.5% alc. anyway its gold in color with a large, quickly diminishing to nothing, fizzy white head. lagerish grainy aroma. flavor is sweet and yeasty. honey maybe. actually decent stuff im just not sure what to call it.
Getman Koronne;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);"Malty, bubblegum aroma. Taste is malty with the ""eastern europe flavour"", feint hops. Nothing to write home about."
Getman Koronne;Mykolaiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yantar Brewery - Ukraine (AB InBev-Efes);Hey I'm the first to rate this beer. Bottled. Nice drinkable summer beer. Nothing special. Poured a little off yellow.
Z Street GPA 8.0 Cream Ale;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Z Street Brewing Co.;Pours with white, two-fingered head, fades quickly and leaves barely any lace. Medium carbonation. Cloudy, light golden/amber color. Nose is faintly hoppy, starts and finishes with a lot of strong flavor of hops and malts. This was brewed by Z Street Brewing Co.for Boston Baked Beans Co.
Z Street GPA 8.0 Cream Ale;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Z Street Brewing Co.;Pours a super cloudy medium golden, small ring of white foam that leaves a decent lacing. Aroma is very sweet, vanilla, lots of butterscotch. Flavor is like drinking a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a lot of butterscotch topping. Medium body, mucho carbonation, alcohol is hidden well behind all the cloying sweetness.
Z Street GPA 8.0 Cream Ale;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Z Street Brewing Co.;Radiant deep golden colour. Sweet cream ale aroma and flavour to match, but rather thinnish and slightly sticky/malt liqourish. Not bad though. I like the concept.
Z Street GPA 8.0 Cream Ale;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Z Street Brewing Co.;"Yes, it seems to be a cream ale, but most of the few of those I've tried are thinner and crisper - this is as if one took ""vanilla butter flavor"" (OldGrowth nailed it) and malt liquor (St. Ides, anyone?) and added it to Jamesport Brewing Company's Cream Ale. Needs to be crisper! Whoa is this sweet! Thanks, OG!"
Z Street GPA 8.0 Cream Ale;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Z Street Brewing Co.;Bottle: Sweet, a little vanilla extract scent. Dull brown orange color. I get a kinda vanilla butter flavor with a little warmth to it. Finishes smooth. Interesting. Label say its made for the Boston Baked Bean company. Never heard of them. Not a big Cream ale guy, so I don't have a good way to judge.
Z Street GPA 8.0 Cream Ale;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, United States;Cream Ale;Z Street Brewing Co.;Has a light golden color and a slight malt smell. Taste is smooth malt/rice and finishes slightly hopped. Overall this is a great high alcohol beer for me due to the lack of the alcohol taste which does not sit well with me...
Deja Brew Sturz Strong Ale;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Deja Brew;Winter Jubilee '04, Deep amber in color with a small white head.Unblanced nose with a small detection of alcohol.Stale hop flavor,thin body, and no finish.
Deja Brew Sturz Strong Ale;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Deja Brew;On tap Winter Jubilee 2004: Clear dark orange with a small white head. Alcohol nose, light watery texture, quick ending.
Deja Brew Sturz Strong Ale;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Deja Brew;Ok, this was one of the last beers that I tried at the 2003 Boston Beer Summit and to be quite frank, I do not remember all the details about it and I could not read my notes to well. What I do remember is that I did not like it that much due to a strong, strange taste which did not sit well with me. I will have to try this again to make a rational rating.
Elysian Helios;Seattle, Washington, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);on tap at brewery. a medium gold color. lemony scent, a sunny beer for a winter day. Kolsch-like.
Elysian Helios;Seattle, Washington, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);On tap at Elysian, Seattle. Pale gold, thin white head. Bit of caramel lager malt on aroma. Very carbonated. Bit of sickly malt. Honey caramel. But finish is fine. Bit of Saaz. Not my favourite lager.
Elysian Helios;Seattle, Washington, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);A hazy golden color, very light bodied, grainy nose and very refreshing. There aren't alot of Dotmunders out there and this is a great example of the style.
Elysian Helios;Seattle, Washington, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Blonde-bronze color, this is weak by helles standards. Light urine aroma and flavor. Not absolutely disgusting, but certainly unpleasant and stale.
Elysian Golden Gorgon Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);yellowish with a thin head, slightly cloudy. sour bitter wheat biscuit flavor. the bittering hops are strong. Aroma is dominate biscuits.
Elysian Golden Gorgon Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Has caramel and honey notes in the nose, medium body with subtle spices and honey. However, Elysian often impresses me!
Elysian Golden Gorgon Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Good belgian ale yeast taste and aroma. That's about all that was going on though. A little dissapointing, but Elysian doesn't often impress me.
Elysian Golden Gorgon Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);A cloudy pale golden color with a white head. The aroma is of banana and spices. A nice spice in the flavor as well and a good bitter aftertaste that lingers.
Elysian Golden Gorgon Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty, fruity and yeasty. A medium bodied golden ale, Fruity and yeasty. Mild, sweet and refreshing. Fruity and yeasty. Nice bright yeasts. Refreshing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet.
Elysian Golden Gorgon Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);"Gold, with a prickly carbonation and a nice spicy flavor. Orangey, but with a pepperiness and a bit of underbrush in a medium bodied, Belgian tasting ale, more characterful than most Belgian brewed ""regular strength"" ales."
Elysian Golden Gorgon Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Rather too blonde appearance with a creamyish head. This beer was quite spicy, with a peppery, wheat aroma and a spicy, wheaty flavor with punches of yeast. A nice, light zing.
Hahn Longbrew;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Do they still make this stuff? There was a stubbie of this muck sitting in my old man's bar fridge. It sat there and sat there until one day when I was visiting, I grabbed it and drank it. I wish it was still sitting there.
Hahn Longbrew;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I think it was Hookesy not Boony. No self respecting Tasmanian would drink that stuff. Mind you no self respecting Tasmanian should drink most Tasmanian beers really. Less calories and less carbs means much less body. Beer brewed so the body can process it with a minimum of effort.
Hahn Longbrew;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Even though I greatly respect ecz's excellent comments, I must say here that I disagree somewhat. This beer is so much better than a lot of the basic Aussie offerings, and compares well for an average sort of beer. Hell, I've had to get a pallet specially ordered for myself after moving through 3 states!
Hahn Longbrew;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);i think eczematic really hit the hammer on the head there. on the topic of cricket, I heard that david boon used to drink this though i am sure he would deny it
Hahn Longbrew;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);must say I felt remarkably unobese after downing half a bottle of this crap. Only difference in the before and after shots was I needed to piss afterwards. Maybe Warnie should've tried this instead of diuretics? yes it's fizzy yellow tasteless crap and i won't bore you with a description of my phenomenological state during its consumption.
Zannekin Cassel Blanche;Cassel, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zannekin;"Ok, let me try to compose a comment here which describes my taste-experience with this brew best.......ok I got it: ""This beer is sour, lightbodied crap!""."
Zannekin Cassel Blanche;Cassel, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zannekin;A hazy yellow beer with no head. The aroma is very wheaty and spicy with coriander standing out. The flavor is sweet spicy with notes of wheat and coriander. It is very carbonated.
Zannekin Cassel Blanche;Cassel, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zannekin;Lightly hazy yellow. Phenolic aroma with winter melon, longan. Some fruity esters in the flavour as well, alongside spices, yeastnotes and a hint of pale malt.
Zannekin Cassel Blanche;Cassel, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zannekin;Quite lemony, tart, clove, slightly sour finish, lemon rind in the finish, flavour doesn't last long. Refreshing, but not outstanding.
Zannekin Cassel Blanche;Cassel, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zannekin;Zesty aroma, sweet lemon cordial flavour with a sour bite in the finish. Not bad.
Zannekin Cassel Blanche;Cassel, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zannekin;the first beer of our mammoth tasting session last week. perhaps in all the excitement i was expecting a little more in the flavour department. this had a pleasant lemon rind aroma, was ridiculously pale and had a pleasant cheese rind sourness with some lemon barley in there to balance it out. surprisingly low in spice but definitely a good quencher
Zannekin Cassel Blanche;Cassel, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zannekin;lemony smell. tastes like very weak orange cordial. a little bit sour. not enough zing for a wit. thanks duff/per
Zannekin Cassel Blanche;Cassel, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zannekin;Bottled. Pale yellow and cloudy. Concentrated orange aroma. Firm, soft maltiness, perhaps a bit sweet. Discretely flavourful, yet an excellent thirst quencher. One of the better examples of the style!
St Peters Brewery Autumn Ale;Sydney, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St Peters Brewery (Australia);Ouch! This guy's starting to push his luck. Watery crap that barely hid the taste of the hints of dishwashing detergent remaining in the overpriced pint glass. Certainly not anadequate excuse to hang out with weirdo rugby types who inevitably start singing Kenny Rogers by 11pm.
St Peters Brewery Autumn Ale;Sydney, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St Peters Brewery (Australia);what a great idea, stale cask beer. remarkably flavourless, sticky yet thin, pretty bad stuff
St Peters Brewery Autumn Ale;Sydney, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St Peters Brewery (Australia);1/8 at the nags: looks like they had a cask of this sitting round going stale for the last 4 months before they whipped it out and flogged everyone for $6 a pint for the stuff. whatever flavour kook found in it 4 months ago was way gone by now. impossibly bland, watery, and brown-orange. no bitterness left, not even any interesting fruitiness, nothing. even too bland for my gurlfriend. rer8: this time it was fresh and hoppy, but with a slight infection...cloudy, sour and dishwatery. bleuagh.
St Peters Brewery Autumn Ale;Sydney, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St Peters Brewery (Australia);4/4 @ Nags Head: Pumped by hand. Small foamy beige head ontop of a cloudy amber liquid. Aroma of crystal malt and floral/grassy hops. Great smooth and medium-full mouthfeel. Hint of tingle on the lips from the bitterness of the beer. Sweet crystal flavour with a good kick of bitter to it. Slight floral hop flavour too. Served at a real temperature.
Manayunk Stumbling Monk;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Manayunk Brewing Company;Dark red with strong alcohol nose, but surprisingly mellow taste, a bit of candiness, but well-malted character.
Manayunk Morning Star Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Manayunk Brewing Company;Just had some of this that was one year old, and man was it incredible! Lots of toasty chock full of hop goodness.
Manayunk Morning Star Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Manayunk Brewing Company;I'm not a barley wine fan at all, so I'm jaded. This was orange-red with overwhelmingly strong sweet scents. Obtusely alcoholic swallow. Well malted, but not at all my bag.
Bittings OHallorans Irish Red;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale - Irish;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;I had it on tap. It pours a clear and light reddish color with no head or lacing. The aroma was pretty weak with hints of caramel. The taste was caramel and grain. It was rather thin. This is not my favorite style. There are better examples though.
Bittings OHallorans Irish Red;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale - Irish;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Growler left on my work desk one morning, great way to start the day! Pours a bright crimson with a thin white head. Toasted malt nose, slight caramel with a faint hint of citrus hops. Toasted caramel malt backbone to the flavor, I also get almond undertones, with a grassy hops finish. Very light, easy to put down with medium-low carbonation. Enjoyable Irish Red, not one of my favorite styles but this one is good.
Bittings OHallorans Irish Red;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale - Irish;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Had this on tap at the brewery. This poured with very little head and a deep red colour. Slight hops flavor and a little sweet.
Bittings OHallorans Irish Red;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale - Irish;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Pours a lightly reddish copper with really no aroma, maybe a little sweet malts, and then just maybe. Taste is of some light caramel malt and a little bit of grain, and that is really all I have to say about this one. Definitely forgettable.
Bittings OHallorans Irish Red;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale - Irish;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Sampler at the brewpub. Inoffensive aroma, very bland, toffee and caramel malts over grassy hops. Body is thin with slight carbonation. Flavor of slight caramel and grain. Forgettable.
Bittings OHallorans Irish Red;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale - Irish;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;on tap-pours an offwhite head that laces with amber color. Aroma is sweet malt. Taste is caramel malt, sweet, dark fruit, backed up by hops nicely. OK carbonation.
Bittings OHallorans Irish Red;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale - Irish;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Middling malty aroma wafts from this deep chestnut red brew. Topped with a slight, quickly dissipating pure white head. Nice malty character with just a hint of sweetness. Well balanced hop character, but slightly thin mouthfeel.
Bittings OHallorans Irish Red;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale - Irish;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Dark red. Surprisingly little aroma, it's one weakness. It has a good caramel malt body with a subtle appearance of the hop in the finish. Very good.
Valley Forge Barleywine;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Alcohol is right on the nose of this amber brew. Very strong alcohol-malt flavors dominate. This isn't my bag at all.
Valley Forge Altbier;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Valley Forge Brewing Co;On tap at Valley Forge Brew Pub - listed as Olivia�s Drunken Monkey @ 5.9%. Poured a dark brownish color with an averaged sized off white head. Aroma and tastes of malt, toffee, and some caramel. Lightly sweet. Somewhat of a watery/thin body.
Valley Forge Altbier;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Called Drunken Monkey Alt at the brewpub. Poured a dark golden color with basically no head and no lace either. A light aroma of sweet caramel and fruity, tangerine, hops. Sweet vanilla, and grassy hop taste. This was a little too easy drinking.
Valley Forge Altbier;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Michael, the VF brewmaster, gave me a sample of this a few weekends ago (it was not on the regular menu yet). It was very crisp, with a great malt base, nice hop flavor, and good complexity. Reddish/amber in color, the texture and flavor remind me a little of a fest/Irish red combo. A very nice, very drinkable beer.
Valley Forge Altbier;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Traditional reddish colors with caramel notes to the aroma. Flavor is intensely more bitter than a normal alt. I'd say this was an English pale if you'd blind taste-tested me. This is overly bittered on not balanced.
Valley Forge American Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Hazy gold pour with aroma of hocpti and some fruit. Tastes light to medium on the palate, with hopcit and wheaty yeasts. Not great, but passable.
Valley Forge American Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Part of the sampler at the brewery. No wheat flavor at all with this one. It was yellow and tasted like beer.
Valley Forge American Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Poured cloudy gold body with a small white head. Light refreshing wheat. A little sweet citrus taste.
Valley Forge American Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Golden wtih a soapy nose. Vaguely lemony flavor with smooth drinkability. Bit of an alcohol finish.
Harvest Moon Sullys Oatmeal Stout;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);On tap at the brewery. Pour is completely black, not brown with a small brown head. Very nice aroma. Sweet taste of chocalate, oatmeal, malt, coffee. Fairly complex. Rich and creamy. Decent beer. Filling.
Harvest Moon Sullys Oatmeal Stout;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Dark brown with a short lasting tan head. Kind of weak in terms of the aroma. There were hints of chocolate and coffee and alcohol. Taste was kind of alcohol but with some good coffee and chocolate notes underneath. Overall an above average stout.

Harvest Moon Sullys Oatmeal Stout;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);"This is a great stout. I sampled it under the best conditions;, good company, pleasant barmates and sitting at the copper topped bar on a nice day. Creamy head, traditional opaque body, a bit sweet with a nice hop finish."
Harvest Moon Sullys Oatmeal Stout;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Overall, this is probably the best beer I�ve had there. I�m surprised that more people haven�t rated it (in comparison to their other brews). Dark colored sweet stout. Tastes on par with a Guinness. The oatmeal nature is not as obvious as other oatmeal stouts I�ve had. I did enjoy it immensely, however. The picture for the beer looks a little Rush Limbaugh, but I won�t hold that against Sully. Great Brewpub and Great Beer.
Harvest Moon Sullys Oatmeal Stout;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Deep brown, tan head. Coffe chocolate aroma. Smooth roasty flavor. No real defects.

Harvest Moon Sunnys Bitter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);This was a very nice ESB. The appearance was brown and cludy, with an average light brown head. There was an ample dose of hops which added to the aroma and flavor. This was a full flavor beer with long duration on the palate.
Harvest Moon Sunnys Bitter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Cloudy and murky orange color. Slight head. Good noble hop aroma. Lots of hops in the flavor, and a decent bitterness. Malt is a bit subdued. A good brew.
Harvest Moon Sunnys Bitter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);"Reddish copper, smells ""smooth"" if that makes sense. The flavor is bitter right up front with a nutty hoppy finish. Pretty good."
Valley Forge 4-Grain Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Valley Forge Brewing Co;This beer rocks! Very dark brew. Nice, medium-sized creamy, lightly tanned head. Mostly lasting with excellent lacing. The aroma is of cocoa, vanilla, espresso and dark roated cashews. The taste is malty and chocolatey with a toasted, nutty flavor up front. Balanced nicely on the backside with a lightly moderate bitterness. Full-bodied with a wonderful silky mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Medium-length, dry and lightly tart finish. This is a world-class stout!
Valley Forge Scotch Ale;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Nice copper/orange color. Very malty with good hop presence. Hints of caramel, port wine, cognac, and cabernet on the tongue. A great scotch ale.
Valley Forge Scotch Ale;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Crystal clear copper hue. Small creamy off-white head. Mostly, but not fully diminishing. The aroma is rich and malty with notes of butterscotch, caramel, alcohol and red wine. Also, an underlying note of milk chocolate. The flavor is malty and rich with bursts of caramel, milk chocolate and Enlish toffee up front. Lightly bitter with a touch of alcohol on the backside. Well-balanced for a scottish ale. Full-bodied with a slightly oily mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Medium-length, grassy, oaken finish. Very nice brew! Pulls up just short of being world class, but definitely a must-try!
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Light Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Good flavor compared to other less expensive light beers. Lightly carbonated, good color with more of a distinct taste for a light beer. If it was available where I live, it would be my beer of choice.
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Light Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Weak aroma, almost non-existant. Has a light, pale golden hue, with a little head, and a couple bubbles. Weak, non-existant flavor, what you would normally expect form a light beer. OK texture, but little carbonation, it felt flat. I guess it would be comparable to other light beers, but that doesn�t mean that it�s good.
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Light Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Nice beery nose but that is about it. Very low in carbohydrates (2.9) so it might be a viable option for Michelob Ultra fans, and at a fraction of the cost.
Watch City Nuptial Belgian;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Watch City Brewing Co.;On tap last February. Served in a proper (snifter) glass. Was excellent on a chilly winter day. Went down smoothly. Nice stuff!
Watch City Nuptial Belgian;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Draught tulip at the brewpub, 3/8/06 Deep cola-licorice brown, with some deep auburn and light mahogany tints, light haziness to it, with a quickly receding beige head, providing light lacing. The nose is fruity at first (plums, cherries, dates, oranges) and only lightly phenolic, with some medium-sweet brown malts that are more soothing than anything. Very well concealed alcohol does not come through in the nose, save for a bit of perfuminess upon warming. Light anise and cinnamon dryness, but almost an intense, herbal-rootiness, really. Some dry caramel as well. The flavor begins more dry than I would have expected, but it�s due to proper attenuation, as the mouthfeel has a strong chewiness to it that shows of well-extracted malt. Anise mixes with chocolate and other dry phenols creep in, but for an uncontrolled fermentation temperature, this is strikingly clean. Reserved fruitiness keeps things interesting, while dry chocolate and light caramel notes provide most of the conversation. Some spicy, but otherwise reserved hoppiness, no alcohol. Belgian yeast is tastefully done, no meatiness, or heaviness/dullness. Very Unibroue-esque.
Watch City Nuptial Belgian;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a foamy tan head that laces. Color is black with dark amber. Aroma is dark fruit, malt. Taste is dark fruit, malt, flat hops. Light/medium body.
Watch City Nuptial Belgian;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Watch City Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. The aroma was sweet and malty, but not particularly pronounced. The color was a very dark copper with an off-white head. The flavor was fruity, with some candy sugar, and Belgian yeast. With such a sweet beer, I would have expected a sticking mouthfeel, but it just wasn�t there. A good solid, heavy beer.
Watch City Nuptial Belgian;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Watch City Brewing Co.;22oz bottle from brewpub - dated 4/14/02. Pours a hazy dark reddish-brown, with the smallest ring of tan foam, very still bodied. Aroma is big sweet fruitiness (grape, raisin, plum), some hops, a bit of honey, and some alcohol. Flavor is fruity, vinous, a bit of alcohol comes up in the middle, some chocolate pokes through at points, and ends with a fairly strong hoppy finish. Full bodied, very slick mouth feel due to lack of carbonation.
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Light golden color with a foamy off white head. Grits with a hint of floral hops in the aroma. Sprity in feel. Sweetness, can not pin down if its corn, or malt. Kraft paper and a real stale flavor come out later in the quaff. What should you expect from a totally dirt cheap premium beer. Thanks slikwily for the bonus beer to rate.
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;It done dirt cheap. Enjoy a few of these while watching Dale Jr. win some racing.
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"It is as it says it is, dirt cheap. I paid under three bucks for a six pack of this with the lowest of expectations. This did indeed however exceed my expectations, but not by much. This doesn�t smell like much, a little sawdust, a little malt, basically smells like cheap beer. One great surprise is that this thing actually maintains a small head; the color is (of course) a light gold. There are some wild things going on with the flavor here I detect apple, some mild hop character, and of course plenty of adjunct grains I think there is rice in this, but I am certain that there is corn. This one is very crisp and refreshing, and goes down well but about 3/4 into the can I got a little sick of it altogether."
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;12 oz. can from csbosox. Pour is clear golden with a typical white head. Aroma of some sweetness and almost Pils hops pokes through. Even some floral scent in there. Taste initially jumped out as chemically sweet, though that cleared quickly, really only evident in the first sip. After that, the sweetness (others have mentioned corn - I personally thought it was softer and more rounded than corn adjunct flavor I am used to) come through, and the finish has that nice Saaz element. Overall, this one was pretty drinkable, thanks Chris!
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;12 ounce can from csbosox Pours crystal clear piss golden yellow with a good white head. Lots of corn here. Maybe even a scant amount of hop aroma. Corn flavor too. Imagine that. Its not totally foul. Its better than a lot of crappy lagers out there.
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"In the can. Thanks (I suppose) to paul V. for the beer. Paul and I are always trying to trump each other with gifts of what we call ""Canoeing beer."" While at the time of this rating, there were only 6 other scores, I�d have to say that it does not deserve to get trashed in the ratings. I soundly believe this to be a better beer than Bud or Coors. I don�t know what a sixer of this costs, but because of the name, it had better be less than everything else on the shelves. Sure, there�s a lot of adjunct here. It�s quite corny, but is has a sweet perfume flower water finish that makes it not completely thoughtless. I just don�t get the prostitute chicken logo. Is there a poultry whore problem in St. Louis?"
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Mild, indistinct aroma. Light, golden color, with some head that dissapated after a couple minutes. Flavor is surprisingly OK, somewhat sweet. OK texture, but little carbonation, it felt kind of flat. In the end, what else would you expect from a beer called dirt cheap (other than maybe the presence of dirt, which I do not detect)?
Totally Dirt Cheap Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;great name, not so great beer, definately not one to write home about. Fruity corny watery beer, pretty well describes it.

Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;Dark mahogany. Grayish-tan mixture of large and small bubbles. Tangy smoked meat, roasted wood, and fresh crushed malt aroma. Quite airy with slight dark berry fruitiness, maple, and char. Feisty, loosely packed carbonation. Light-bodied. Less meaty-flavored than the aroma leads you to believe, with abundant airiness that somewhat hinders the body, but amplifies the spicy phenols and leafy hop undertones. Moderately smoky with a lactic tartness that gives way to a staunch roasted wood firmness and minerals. Whispers of anise pave the way for a rich roasted malt, unsweetened chocolate foundation. Candle wax and burnt sugar accents emerge and shorten the malt richness. Intensely dry, slightly salty, and continually lactic finish, coupled with chalky malts which lengthen the dryness. Airy belches continue to mute the faint lingering maltiness. Good, but too much roast and not enough smoke, nor is it richly malty/full enough. Thanks, Prof!!
Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;"Apparance: dark brown, near black, with a nicely retained head, good 1/4"" cocoa-tanned foam. Smoke hits first in the nose, blasts over subtler whiffs of coffee, very roasty and smokey. Taste: bacon, yep, that�s what we get on first swallow, great snap on the palate, terific texture. Smooth, well-balanced. medium-bodied, shortish finish. An easy-drinking smoked beer, and a very smooth porter, went down without a trouble, and that�s a good thing, son."
Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;Sampled at the VT brewers fest. Deep mahogany color with no head. Some smokiness in the nose, some malt aroma. Watery mouthfeel, some smoke to finish. Mildly malty and smooth. A mite too thin for my liking, also served a bit too cold, probably better a bit warmer.
Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;"This also came with a real label that did mention ""limited brewer's offering"". Pours with light brown, one-fingered bubbly head, fades quickly and leaves barely any lace. Medium carbonation. Very dark red/amber color. Nose is the roasted coffee. Flavor is also a deep roasted coffee that finishes smooth. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle."
Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;Pours a rich dark brown with a thin tan head. Nicely roasted and smokey aroma. Body is semi-sweet with plenty of smoked malts and a dry finish. A well balanced and enjoyable smoked porter.
Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;Dark brown color with a nice head. Aroma is smokey and too close to beef jerky for my liking. The flavor is much the same. It is lighter than other smoked beers I have had, but still too meaty and too much like teriyake sauce. Underlying tones of nice roasted malts, lightly bitter and lightly sweet. The smokieness, even though subdued, just ruin this beer for me.

Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;Dark, really dark brown with a thin big bubbled head. Gunpower smoked aroma in a really good way. Eat this with cheese. Real cheese. Hmm..cheese. Ends light sweet and really smokey. Really.
Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;Dark brown topped by small tan head. Aroma is strong smoke -- meat more than cheese. Taste is quite smoky, with a bit of sweetness trickling in. That being said, a beer definitely sits under the smoke -- roasty, coffee, some chocolate. Nice medium body that generally holds up under the assault of the smoke, though it occasionally does get lost. Quite a nice treat.
Paper City Smoked Porter;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Paper City Brewery;Bottle. Very good - great rich body, fuller than many porters. A clone of it's tap only neighbor in Amherst, MA, except that this one is smokier and a tad less cardboardy. I was pleasantly surprised!

John Harvard's Midwinter's Russian Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);I thought this was pretty good. Extremely full bodied. rich chocolate and creamy texture. not much aroma. I�m surpised this place had too extreme beers, barleywine and imperial stout.
John Harvard's Midwinter's Russian Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Also known as Russian Imperial Stout Dark brown appearance with a light-brown, fizzy head. Aroma is of faint burnt malts with alcohol presence. Initial taste is bitter, finishing with a heavy sweetness loaded with alcohol. Light to medium on the mouth, it has a watery to creamy texture with soft carbonation. Very tame on the nose. Comes off more as a barleywine than a stout. Alcohol slaps you across the face. The score here is not the whole story however, as this beer will certainly knock you on your ass. It is well-crafted, however does not do much to separate itself from the pack. Reviewed on January 20th, 2007.
John Harvard's Midwinter's Russian Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the brewery. Light malts, beets, molasses. Not assertive enough. Light smoke. Nice thick palate, a bit of peanuts, veggies. Not nearly big enough for what it�s trying to be.
John Harvard's Midwinter's Russian Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sampled on draft at the brewery. The beer poured a black color with a small tan head. The aroma is lightly sweet and has a floral hop undertone. The mouthfeel is moderately thick. The flavor is moderately strong roasted malts with a mild chocolate element and light floral hops underneath. The beer turns a bit bitter towards the finish. A nicely drinkable if uninspired Imperial Stout.

The Tap Bricketts Brigade Brown;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a good looking brown color with a cap of a little white head. Slight sliding lace. The aroma had sweet and roasty nuts, some caramel/toffee sweet malts and some earthy/grassy hops. The flavor leaned into the sweetness at first and then blended more with the roast as it warmed. Decent aftertaste and smooth sweet to roasty finish. The palate was between light and medium bodied with a good smooth feel all around. Overall, really nice brown ale when I had it.
The Tap Bricketts Brigade Brown;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;A good brown ale. Pours well, brown with a small head. Taste is very sweet with nuts and malt. Another great brew from The Tap.
Cambridge Bourbon Barrel Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Cambridge Brewing Company;Deep brown color. Vibrant porter aromas (cocoa, chocolate), with hints of raspberries, light wood, low aroma hops. Flavor begins with a backround of charred fruits and deep roasted malt, along with a faily substancial hopping rate. This made the wild yeast a very small component of the beer. Was hoping for a funky, sour beer and I ended up with a well made porter, with very little wild yeast or wood influence.
Cambridge Bourbon Barrel Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Cambridge Brewing Company;Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus charged version. On draught at the NEBF on 10/29/2005. Pours an opaque, very deep black body, with a wispy beige colored head, that is not long retained, nor does it create much lacing. Aroma has a sour lacto note to it, with bitter baker�s chocolate and a fair amount of roast. Don�t get much brett from the aroma. A touch of light hops and then fades off with some light whiskey notes. Flavor is all over the place. I think they�ve pretty much got everything covered here. Light bits of sweet chocolate-caramel malt, a touch of dry tartness from the brett, dark roast notes, hint of floral hops and a lactic flavor that is lightly sour. Very moderate use of the barrel ends in only a touch of warming whiskey and light coconut. The body is medium to medium-full with a tight carbonation and lightly creamy texture. I wouldnt have thought I would have liked brett in a bourbon porter, but it works well enough and it is only lightly done, it dosent taste like they poured a lambic in to this. Serves to dry out the flavor and add interesting wild yeast notes. The base beer is not sweet to begin with, so it really dosent have to battle with a heavy malt sweetness. No alcohol apparency.
Cambridge Bourbon Barrel Porter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Cambridge Brewing Company;Redbones Porter & Stout Dinner March 29, 2004. Dark brown in color with no head and very low carbonation. Aroma is of oak,cherries,roasted malt and chocolate. Flavor is of roasted malt,cherries,oak, some bitterness and a hint of acidity. The oak lingers and finishes long.
Northampton Steamer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Northampton Brewery (MA);Pours a pale golden colour. Minimal head. Grainy nose. I wasnt too impressed with this brew. Very drinkable, yet a bit on the thin side. Grainy, light bodied, finishing with a light floral/herbal quality. Not bad.
Watch City Bombed Blondeshell;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Tripel;Watch City Brewing Co.;Pouring at BBF in Boston. Pours a hazed amber with a thin yellow to beige head. Musk and spicy yeast. Medium-bodied, sweet yeast, musk and warm alcohol. Lingering sweetness, musk, and a touch of booze on the finish.
Watch City Bombed Blondeshell;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Tripel;Watch City Brewing Co.;Sweet malty fruit bread aroma. Darker orange, doesn�t exactly shout tripel ale. Very sweet flavor, all kinds of sugary and only a small touch of bitter. Obvious alcohol presence, creamy syrupy body. Too much sweet, not enough heat.

Harvest Moon Full Moon Pale Ale;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Excellent pale ale! The Full Moon poured a light amber color with an off-white, sticky, lacing head. This beer is extremely delicious and well-rounded. I tasted lots of dry and floral hops, balanced nicely with some slightly sweet and bready malts. The finish was spicy and bitter, as well. This is a very smooth and drinkable session beer.

Aroma of floral hops, caramel malt, light fruits. Flavor of bready and caramel malt with a soapy, floral finish.

Harvest Moon Full Moon Pale Ale;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);poured from tap at harvest moon into a pint glass. Pours a solid orange color with a nice, but short, head. Forward with noticeable hops along with aromas of florals, citrus and oranges. Good complexity, but lacking some depth medium/full bodied with a very smooth feel. Nice flavors of citrus, oranges and hops This comes off as more of an IPA than a Pale Ale. A very good beer on the whole though
Harvest Moon Full Moon Pale Ale;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a moderate amber-henna-copper, fairly clear and with an off-white head. Flavors are crisp and reasonable. Some juicy hops, only slightly isovaleric and cheesy. Malts are okay, but for me, too heavy on the caramel malt. Alcohols are clean. This fine, but nothing particularly notable, really. Just kind of a middle and average pint of ""ale"", which I guess is what English Pale Ale and this beer are shooting for. A little too sweet. Continued mediocrity."
John Harvard's Pacific Coast Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at John Harvards, Cambridge MA, 28 September 2009. On the chalkboard as simply Pacific Coast Ale but I guess this is the same beer as the Pacific Coast IPA. Hazy gold. Pronounced tropical fruity hop character. Stronger on the palate than on the nose. Firm citric flavours and mouthfeel. Pleasant and nicely drinkable.
John Harvard's Pacific Coast Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"Cask at the Cambridge location - cloudy orange, tapped from a ""gravity cask,"" not from a handpump - it has the expected, bright, citrusy, west coast hop explosion in the aroma I expected - quite full-bodied, with a slick mouthfeel (had this pegged as an imperial ipa at first) - loads of grassy, piney, earthy hops, with an undercurrent of sweet malts that combine with the citrus to create an orange jam kind of flavor to the beer - nicely bitter throughout, especially in the finish - a solid ipa."
John Harvard's Pacific Coast Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap @ Framingham location. Ok nose, grapefruit, sourdough, grass. Clean pale orangy gold color, small to no head. Bitter flaovors, Grapefruit & lemon mainly. Little of a aluminium taste. . Medium body, lite creamy, slick mouthfeel, bitter finish. An easy drinking ipa, but I�ll always look for the stormcatcher from this location.
Aarschotse Bruine (Huyghe);Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Drinking from a 33 cl bottle. Very old bottle. The beer didn�t survive the hand of time. To bad.
Aarschotse Bruine (Huyghe);Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Aarschotse bruine tielemans 5% 1980 - 35 years old! At Kulminator. But still with a branded glass and a clear deep amber �brown with some head but fairly minimal. The nose is sweet malty caramel fudge. Thick full smooth body. The taste is tart sour brown caramel maltiness. Actually surprisingly refreshing. Not sure what it was like to start but now it�s an acidic tart light beer. Yum.
Aarschotse Bruine (Huyghe);Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Mostly clear brown colour, no head. Aroma of caramel, raisins, dusty. Sweet flavour, caramel, cola. Sweet finish, caramel, cheap sherry wine. Very old, BBF 2002. Interesting but it didn�t keep up well (while some Oud Bruin beers do keep up quite nicely). (From 25cL bottle @ Kulminator. Combined purchase)
Aarschotse Bruine (Huyghe);Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;"33cl bottle@Cafe Belge, Grote Markt Leuven 08/2014. Label: ""Extra sour"", a hollow caveat... Light, aquateous dubbel-like pour with a nose of a malt-infused, diluted Rodenbach. Very slight wood astringency cannot balance out the sticky, unclean palate, transporting the dubbel light tastes that are there: some dark fruit juice, malt sugars. - Reminiscent of Adriaen Brouwer Bruyn, also a too timid Oud Bruin verging towards the NL version of the style."

Aarschotse Bruine (Huyghe);Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Combined purchase by the group. 25 cl. bottle BBF 12/2002 @ Kulminator sampled. Murky cola brown beer that has clearly already fallen apart. Taste is pure oxidation, watery bad / fake cola syrup in the nose mixed with iron. Taste is totally shot as well, watery mixed stale old fake cola, completely oxidized, bad sugar water. Carbonation is basically gone. Unsurprisingly totally dead. I doubt that it was ever stellar even when still alive. Apparently this was an Oud Bruin, interesting, well whatever it was I think that it is safe to say that it is gone now.

Aarschotse Bruine (Huyghe);Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;A hazy orange beer with an off-white head. The aroma is primarily of oranges, slightly over ripe, combined with light metal notes, and so is the flavor, while the body is a bit thin.
Aarschotse Bruine (Huyghe);Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Vintage bottle (old, dirty with a rusty cap) courtesy of Joris - thanks!! Thin white head that lasts well, hazy orange golden body. Fruit, berry and wet woody aroma with a sourish edge - rather old and fusty. Extremely dry and woody flavor probably helped by the age - with a fresh sourness to back the dryness up. Quite thin and watery body. Definately over the top but still drinkable.
Aarschotse Bruine (Huyghe);Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle. Sweet stale caramel flavours, and slightly on the sticky side of the scale, ever so slight sourness. This tasted old/gone to me.
Goose Island Bayou Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. Thin ruby brown body with a small white head. Little to no aroma. Earthy flavor with some richness, but it almost tasted stale. Rather thin palate.

Goose Island Bock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Despite the reported 6.9% ABV, this comes across as a watered down example of the style. It�s got a cloudy reddish brown body with a dincus white head. The light aroma smelled of toasted biscuits, caramel, and a soft earthy bitterness. Sweet but balanced, the flavor is pretty mild - some caramel and bitter nuts. Drinkable. Goose Island - Clybourn, Chicago, IL
Goose Island Bock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at GI Clybourn. Poured a slightly-hazy deeper brown with a short-lived cap of beige head. Aroma was sweet with very lightly smoked caramel and darker sugars.. very nice woodsy and herbal accents. Flavor was a tiny bit thicker with the smokiness with an enjoyable caramel base.. some chocolate emerges too... candy-like sugars, light herbal bitterness, and some sharper alcohol notes as it approaches the finish. The sharper notes detracted a tad on the palate.. medium-bodied with a quiet, accenting bitterness. Another tasty one from GI!

Goose Island Bock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A nice, malty beer. Dry grains and alcohol dominate this amber colored beer. A decent beer, but nothing outstanding.
Goose Island Bock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Amber red body, moderate head. Aroma is half ""European super-strength lager"" and half Belgian ale--when the latter comes out it is quite decent. Much more mild flavor, however, but some good malt support and a spicy bite of alcohol. (on tap, Goose Island, Clybourn, Chicago)"
Goose Island EMP (English Malt Porter);Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Clybourn. Poured an opaque dark brown color.

The nose is full of chocolate, both milk and bittersweet, and some lightly roasted malts. Some dark, chewy caramel is added to the flavor and some soft nuts enter near the finish. Sweet and tasty. But it�s made with water, malts, hops, and yeast. Shouldn�t this be an alias for Honkers Ale? Goose Island - Clybourn, Chicago, IL

A - Deep brown, opaque appearance with three fingers of creamy tan head, looks absolutely delicious. S - Smells pretty good, burnt malts are the biggest, can pick up some chocolate and sweet caramel in the background, nothing surprising. T - Again the most prominent flavor is the burnt malt, bitter chocolate and sweet raisins and caramel. There�s something sort of earthy in the background that reminds me of tobacco. As it finishes the burnt malts are what stays with you; its really amazing, like the beer is actually a bit charred, very tasty. M - Medium bodied, good carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, very dry finish. O - A really solid, enjoyable stout, picked up a growler after trying my first glass.

The sticky caramel is the most noticeable right up front, followed by peanut butter, toffee, peanut brittle, buttered toast and a chewy bitterness off in the distant. The barrel dulled the bitterness, and while it left quite a bit of whiskey, this was a good show.
Rock Bottom Chicago Sub Zero Barleywine 2002;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rock Bottom Chicago;"A different recipe than the 2001, they added a part of the 2001 vintage to this. Lighter, more of a shining copper color, produced less head. More aggressively hoppy, longer finish, flavors of what we used to call ""ground cherries"" growing up--little fruit-like things that grew in paper-thin shells.

Gala;N�Djamena, Chad;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasseries du Tchad (Groupe Castel);"26th March 2018; Shrewsbury Beer Exchange Group in Chez Sophie. Cheers Mat, via Erzengel for this new country rate. Small sample between five seems like cheating, but we all had a 'Danish Pint' and that was enough to gauge an opinion I suppose. The bottle fizzed a little when opened, so some life left in the golden bodied brew, wispy topping on each glass. It's a malty lager with a slight metallic twang. Bet it's fine on a hot sweaty day in Chad, not so great on a cold March evening in Shropshire; scored kindly!"
Gala;N�Djamena, Chad;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasseries du Tchad (Groupe Castel);Bottle @ monthly tasting, Chez Sophie, Mar 18. Thanks to Erzengel for this!

Gala;N�Djamena, Chad;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasseries du Tchad (Groupe Castel);Bottle. My first beer of 2018 and it's a country tick! Country #179 - huge thanks to Boris for the trade and his friend Aziz for facilitating its arrival in Germany. Pours very pale gold with a lasting white head. Aroma of grain, straw and grass. Medium to heavy sweetness, light bitterness. Light body, slight oily texture, average carbonation. Not the worst pale lager in the world by any means.
Gala;N�Djamena, Chad;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brasseries du Tchad (Groupe Castel);630ml bottle [due to Aziz's fantastic organising ability, thank you very much!]. Clear, yellow-ish golden colour with average, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Minimally musty, strawy aroma, ephemeral hints of wet straw and a weak touch of horse piss give way to a minimally sweet-ish, grainy malty basis and metallic overtones. Taste is minimally metallic hoppy and grainy malty, hints of corn and straw.
Manayunk Bill's Elixir (Keller Pils);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Manayunk Brewing Company;On tap at the Manaynk Brew Pub. On the menu as �Bill�s Elixir�. Poured a medium and lightly hazy yellow color with a small sized white head. Aromas and tastes of mainly grass with a light citrus aspect. Thinner body.
Manayunk Bill's Elixir (Keller Pils);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Manayunk Brewing Company;Diminishing white head leaves a mostly clear golden hue all alone. Very interesting toasted pils malt aroma with soft complementing breadiness. The saaz hops procure a reasonable grassiness and a really crisp, fitting floweriness. Faint diacetyl becomes noticeable in mouth, but the dryness of the attenuated palate and medium body welcome it with open hands. Crisp and bitter finish, peppery and fresh.
Manayunk Bill's Elixir (Keller Pils);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Manayunk Brewing Company;(GABF05) Crystal clear straw body with white head. aroma is medium sweet, grassy.

Manayunk Bill's Elixir (Keller Pils);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Manayunk Brewing Company;Again not a very good beer from Manayunk, I tried to avoid their booth at the Stoudt�s MicroFest but for some reason I went over anyway, clear golden color, minimal head with little lacing, body was too thin, too bready, not enough hop character
Manayunk Bill's Elixir (Keller Pils);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Manayunk Brewing Company;Poured a clear gold color with a small white head, but nice lacing. Toasty, bready, light malt aroma. Light malts, some citrus, and a nutty (almond) taste. An OK keller, though I thought it was missing alot of somethings to make it good.
Manayunk Bill's Elixir (Keller Pils);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Manayunk Brewing Company;Had this today. Pours pale yellow, with medium head. Aroma of malt and slight citrus and wheat. Tastes slightly hoppy, bitter, malty, with a crisp finish.

Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This is a hazy orange amber body and no head. It�s also a bit on the flat side. There�s a slight sourness in the flavor with a nice peach and pear fruitiness. It�s too sweet though. Combined with the flatness, the sweetness makes for a very disapointing barley wine.
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;On tap at Copely. Red orange color with no head. This beer was presented to me almost still with a nose of burnt sugar and alcohol. Syrupy malt sweetness of funky caramel and odd spoiled fruit flavors. Not good. I hope I got a bad batch and will re-rate if I get to another Thirsty Dog.
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"Cask-conditioned; dry-hopped, wood-aged version at Dayton location: Particle-laden ruby with an orange shimmer. Candied malt aroma coupled with lots fo earthiness, tobacco, and minty alcohol. Very clean wood character. Soft mouthfeel. Extremely thick and fluffy. Cedary wood flavors liven the soft, lush malt flavors right away. Abundance of sweet, plump apricots at the center wrapped around caramel-coated wood and English hop undertones. Fig leaves and spruce linger alongside peppery hops and sweet malts. Sadly, the dry-hopped aroma was nearly non-existent. Extremely sweet barleywine...but passable."
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Creamy caramel and butterscotch aroma. Definite notes of pine and oak as well as tart orange peel in the body. Lasting soapy head. Bitter and vaguely sticky finish. Not enough hops to balance sweetness.
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;I liked this one. Not to be drank in any kind of quantity. Small amounts are very enjoyable. Nose is reminscent of bit o honey candy that I used to love as a kid. Sweet flavor that is a cross between milk caramels and clover honey. Thanks hopsrus for the sample!
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;clear dark amber color, the flavor hits you with brown sugar sweetness. For a beer, IMHO, it's far too sweet, I could see using this as an after dinner drink in small quantities
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"Dark amber ruby w/a light beige creamy lasting head. Malty and candy caramel aroma; very estery and alcohol is present in the aroma which adds to the fruitiness, not hot solventy aromas. Very slighty hop aroma hidden behind the malt. Malty and caramel flavors; very well balanced to malt. Heavily fruity esters in flavor as in aroma, some plum; aftertaste is sweet malty but not cloying, no hop flavor at all, and has a lightly roasty aftertaste. Very full bodied w/ a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Warming alcohol and low carbonation, perfect for BW style ale. I much prefer English BW to American (just my preference), and this is a very well made version by the T. Dog. Nice, big, malty, well balanced, no hop flavor. Perfect for a night in front of the fire place on a cold Cleveland night."
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Dark golden amber, great lacing, no head (probably a result of the higher abv?). Thick and sweet malts, sticky, thin citrus at the sides of the tongue. End is long and syrupy sweet. Very nice, but could use some extra hops for better balance.
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Pours a dark amber, typical looking barley wine. Body is thick and the flavor and aroma are full of sweet caramel, alcohol and spice. A slow drink, it is very sweet.
Thirsty Dog Bout Time Barley Wine;Akron, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Bottled from growler, thanks hopsrus! Nut brown with light aroma of malt, hay and oranges. Very rich, sweet maltiness with a lovely soft texture.Complex malt character, still it's very sweet and with an obvious sugary flavour, so even as at is very tasty and complex already it should improve for many years. Interesting in that it is very English in style, and offers more subtilety than power.

Mouthfeel is not as harsh as Duke of Lancaster, and the palate is just a tad fuller despite this having a lower abv. But it's not a striking beer. A drinkable session bitter with very little character, style or substance.

While not as good as the stronger beers from the brewery this is very drinkable. The light, fruity aroma gives way to biscuity malts and then a fairly dry, smooth finish. Does what a session beer should.
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;on tap - lots going on with this barleywine. Probably the darkest barlywine I�ve tried. Pretty solid overall
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Tap at Warsaw location. Sweet caramel malt and orange aroma. Hazy rufous with a small ivory head. Sweet caramel malt, saccharine, and herbal hops flavor. Full body, low carbonation. A little lighter than most barleywines I�ve tried, but highly drinkable, which could be dangerous. The alcohol is very well hidden. Per a conversation I had with the brewery, this is the same barleywine they make every year.
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On tap at the 2010 Indiana Winterfest. Poured a dark amber brown with a near white head. Aroma was surprisingly hoppy with pine notes and undertones of grain and alcohol. Flavor was also surprisingly hoppy, the beginning had some sweet grains, but pine hops quickly take over.
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Draft...08 version. Muddled amber color with a wispy white head...massive amounts of lacing present. Intense, complex nose consisting of loads of berries, caramel malt, pepper, citrus zest and an underlying piney hop and sweet tart note. Medium full body...sticky sweet, syrupy. Flavor is toffee, raspberries, floral and sticky ass piney hops finish it out. Top notch, elite brew.
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Tap (just called Barleywine). Cherry, raisin, malt and alcohol aroma. Ruby red color with small head. Iniitially a cherry/floral malt flavor followed by a strong pine hops finish. Nice malt flavor - very hoppy.
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;2005 bottle - The barley wine has been on tap this month, but I sampled an aged bottle from last year�s version. I poured it into a large snifter. It was a medium brown color with a thin head. The aroma was a nice mix of malts and hops. The flavor was something of a surprise for the style with a very strong hops presence. It made me think of a barley wine crossed with an IPA. Full bodied and flavorful, this is a different take on the style and quite enjoyable. 2nd rating, 2006 version on tap - Similar to above but this is more of a hoppy beast. While enjoyable, it wasn�t as well balanced or complex as the year old version. 7/4/7/3/15. I gave the year old one 8/4/8/4/16. Averaging the two to a 3.8 total. I think this one benefits with some aging. 2004 bottle in Dec. 2007 - Even better... it�s still very hoppy, but it does mellow a bit too. This beer ages nicely.
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;I had a barley wine on tap at the pub, and I can only assume this was this one. Served in a snifter with an attractive cascade of bubbles. Creamy beige head that left sticky lace. Nice aroma of pine, grapefruit and dark sugars. This is a hop dominated barley wine. Very fruity with apricot, pear, peach, some cherry pit but mostly grapefruit rind. The alcohol grows as it warms. I can�t tell if the burn is hop based or alcohol based (waitress told me it was 12% ABV). Nicely dry in the end with long citrus bitterness on the palate. The middle seems a little thin, but still a very tastey, hoppy barley.
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;On tap at brewery, aged over one year, served in a snifter: Mahogany hued with a small tan frothy head and very good lacing. The aroma has notes of floral and piney hops, pineapple, caramel and burnt malt, earthy yeast esters, light oak and vanilla, and some sugary component. The taste starts with a sweet burnt sugar base and some vanilla oak chiops leads to lime leaves and twangy peppery hops. A nice olde ale oxidtion gives an aged aftertaste. Some complex yeast driven background. The feel is sharp and biting with a lot of spice notes on the palate, vinous smooth finish. I don�t what the otherd had but this is a wonderful classic English styled barleywine. Maybe some aging or a different batch has improved the quality and complexity. I dunno about all that but I do know I like it!
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Not bad. Served in a 12oz bottle. Strong flavor, slight sweetness. Alcohol, and another strange scent I can't figure out. Pours a deep and cloudy brown with a thin white head that disappears fast. Not a terrible barley wine, but no where near the best.
Mad Anthony Old Crippled Bastard;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This brew had a definite aftertaste to it that stuck around for a while.Not my kind of brew.
Mad Anthony Sofa King IPA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Tap. Typical IPA with citrus aroma, orange-amber color. Head is a little short lived. A little thin in body. Fair.
Mad Anthony Sofa King IPA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Decent attempt at a bigger US style IPA. Some caramel and citrus hops in the nose. Taste was still light, medium bodied. Bitter end was short. Not exactly as hoppy as they hype it to be, but better than most of their other efforts.
Mad Anthony Sofa King IPA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;So far I am not a fan of IPA's, but I am always willing to try.This was no exception.I did not like this particular IPA.Too bitter for me.
Mad Anthony Sofa King IPA;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This is an example of another brew that I did not much care for, but then again, IPAs are not my favorite style. It poured a medium head that lasted a long time and left a good lacing. Its aroma was off and hard to place. It had a typ8ical IPA finish that was rather bitter. Once again, not one of my favorite flavors
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Raptor Red;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;"""another fairly standard entry into this catergory, but it was pleasant enough. decent mix of malts and hops in the nose and flavor, just a little thin. decent overall."""

Rock Bottom Arrowhead Raptor Red;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;(on draught at Rock Bottom Arrowhead. Now called Red Ale). Pours a clear amber color with a creamy off-white head that leaves some lacing. Moderate carbonation. Aroma has dark pit fruits, caramel and florals. Taste is sweet with some light bitterness. Medium bodied, but watery. Bitter finish. This is an ok beer.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Raptor Red;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Not bad, not great. An average red ale. Still better than most of the mass produced garbage on the market. A decent flavor of malt and hops, but it quickly fades. Good for the meal, but that is about it.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Raptor Red;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Pours amber w/ a good head. Good head retention w/ sticky lacing. Aroma of malty beer.

Rock Bottom Arrowhead Raptor Red;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Mug. Had a malty presence along with some spice notes. Dark red/brown color body with thin head and some lacing. Flavor was just ordinary with some malty toffee and some mild bitterness. Could of been more refreshing seiing it�s 100 derees now.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Raptor Red;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Phoenix. Big fruity aroma. Ruby red brown, thin white head. Prunes and wood, bitter without any vegetable hop aspects. Pretty simple and a little disappointing. Not much UK character.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Raptor Red;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;The beer as it sets in the pint glass is a deep ruby to almost brown color with a modest semi-creamy tan head, and the residual lace a concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is lightly floral, with nice grain sweetness, fresh and clean to the senses, start is somewhat sweet, nice grain profile with a fair to middling top. Finish has a stern acidity and the hops pleasantly spicy, quite dry and a nice drinkable bee. As it�s been almost five weeks since I sampled my last beer, it actually tasted great, as I missed my daily hop fix, and this one hit the �B� spot.
Rock Bottom Arrowhead Raptor Red;Glendale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Bottom Arrowhead;Pours wiht an amber body topped by a thin to medium thick head with some lacing.

Town Hall Single Malt Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler. Pint shows a clear golden color with a decent head and clingy lace. The aroma is quite pub bitter like, English hops and malt, and some marmalade. The flavor is rather bready and floral, with decent hops to temper. The palate is fairly cleansing and filling. Overall, I like it fine - glad I got the take out growler. Update 9/20/2008 - Had this cask and it rocks! The flavors really show through and make for a nice English pub like fully rounded pint. Wonderful!
Town Hall Single Malt Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap. A dark slightly hazy golden. Golden promise malt. Smells like a scotch ale, light aroma. Nice flavor.
Town Hall Single Malt Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Golden, cloudy chill haze. heather and honey come to mind. rich malt and alcohol. Town Hall always does better with their seasonal and single releases then some of their standard house brews. This early spring brew is a pleasure.
Town Hall Single Malt Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Golden orange and mostly clear. Mossy aroma. Hints of hay and sourdough � very English bitter. Taken as an experience it�s like breathing through the mouth off the shore of a temperate zone coastline. Rotted wood, seaweed, and wet mammal and salt mist. The scotch malt works its magic. With hints of doughy flavor, white fruits and grassy hops. Palate is rather empty and sour. Lacking a bit in depth but extremely interesting.
Town Hall Single Malt Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Didn�t get much from the nose on this one. Cloudy gold color with minimal white head. Faint nose. Grainy sweet tasting body with a little hop bite to it.
Town Hall Single Malt Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"At least this was available during my last trip to Town Hall. I was hoping to try the Wheat Wine and this beer. Let�s see if it is as good as it sounds. Somewhat fruity boquet. Pour is a hazy orange. Some bitterness on the finish, so I can see there were some hops, a good sign. Grainy on the palate; not super smooth, but yet, still very interesting. Sweet but not overly so. Pretty decent brew here."
Town Hall Single Malt Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;tap at brewery. This is just a nice simple fun easy drinking session beer. This is one of those fun to drink beers that make you thankful for a great brewery like this. This is beer.
Town Hall Single Malt Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Cask! The bartender pulled a cloudy hazy frothy cascading golden orange brew and set it in fron of me. I put it side by side with a regular �tap� version of the same beer. The cask version was considerably deeper (the tap version more towards the �golden� side of the equation). It was a lot cloudier than the tap version which was clear. Faint aroma of a musky malt. Taste - ahhh. Fantastic maltiness, a bit sweet, surprisingly complex. I tasted a bit of mustiness, but in a good way. I�ve had Town Hall�s ""Musty Pete"" and didn�t care for it. But this one I liked because the mustiness and peat flavor was subtle. Some honey. Lots of melon. Melon? How�d that get in there? Perfect carbonation. Perfect white head that lasted forever. Medium body. Exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. Simply put, this beer is great. I tried this beer on tap last year, and again from the tap this year. Good, but not outstanding. But on cask, oh my goodness!"

Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Draft. Poured into a pint glass a dark brown bordering on black color with a tight tan head that only nitro can produce. Subtle roast notes in the nose but otherwise very clean. Very clean flavor, starts subtly sweet balance with a slight roast. Ends with some mild bitterness and leather like flavor. Really not a whole lot to say about this but that it is a nice, flavorful stout. Enjoyable.
Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Small taster at the brewery with DalezAle- Pours thin and almost black with a frothy beige head...aroma is roasty grain and dry chocolate, toast...I wanted to sense some potato, but just could not pick out what the heck it did to this beer...flavour was fairly straightforward, dry, grainy, lightly bitter cocoa...nice creamy nitro texture, but otherwise pretty ho-hum...
Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Cask at the brewery. I like this better than the tap version. Black pour with a brown head. No nose but a sweeter taste than the tap. Roast is balanced out with soft oak notes. Very nice. Good smooth palate. Earlier Rating: 3/18/2010 Total Score: 3.2 Tap at the brewery. Black pour with a beige head that hangs on forever. Good lacing. Not much nose...only a little hop aroma. Smooth like the oatmeal stout but not as flavorful. A drier version for sure. No vanilla but there is some roast. Medium bodied and good for the style but I still prefer the bigger stouts.
Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours dark brown with off white head, smell is roasted malt with not much else. Taste is fairly plain, with a bit of roasted malt and a weird potato like quality, this is manifested more in the thickness of the beer on the palate. Overall not bad, an interesting beer.
Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap. Dark brown pour, small head. Very light on the pallet, good aroma of chocolate but fairly mild, roasty taste but seems to be missing a flavor - tastes kind of empty. Not a lot of depth here.
Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;uh. it�s.........ok. Not anything to write home about here. It�s drinkable and smooth, but the potato lends nothing to this I didn�t think. In fact, the flavor seemed a bit OFF to me in some way. Try if you may but don�t expect alot here.
Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Really a watery, bland, plain stout. The potato aspect does nothing for this. Not much in the way of flavor. Smooth drinking, but thats about all that can be said. Forgetable for sure.
Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Nitrogen pour; chocolate brown topped with gray eggshell foam. Mild aroma of berries and vanilla, milk and chocolate; dry and empty. Flavor is of wet toast and potato starch, with a juicy, generic red vinousness that lingers as the only distinct hint of complexity; nothing to taste if not looked for. Bit of meek roast. Palate is milky and very thin; finishes with some soft merlot tannin and dry starch, weakly. A sheepish offering all around; awkward like a limp handshake."
Town Hall Pot Of Gold Potato Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pour was deep dark brown with little head. Cocoa on the nose and the taste reminds me of a watered down Guinness.
De Snaterende Arend Nestvlieder;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Snaterende Arend;Tap@Beer On Broadway, Ealing, London. Quite yeasty and sweet. On the maltier side of things, with some alcohol showing, which was odd, because its only 5%abv.
De Snaterende Arend Nestvlieder;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Snaterende Arend;This is an OK beer but not very special. It�s cloudy, yellow, and with a slightly sweet taste.

De Snaterende Arend Nestvlieder;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Snaterende Arend;Keg, Arendsnest Oct 2003. Slightly hazy amber, low white head and moderate condition. Low caramel aromas with a good level of hops developing as it warms. Malty in the mouth but some vaguely American style hoppiness takes over, only for the sweet malt to return in the finish.
De Snaterende Arend Nestvlieder;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Snaterende Arend;Light yeasty and hoppy aroma. Hazy, amber color, white head, good lace.

De Snaterende Arend Dag Max;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;De Snaterende Arend;(! The version I drank yesterday at Arendsnest was brewed at De Prael, NOT at 3 Horne) Full hazy yellow-ornage, huge white fluffy head. Citrus nose, very outspoken, maybe touch of coriander too. The beer is so dry that it is really neutral - again just a vague citrus aroma. The palate, however, becomes more malty. VERY dry. And a bit light, I'm afraid, but the maltiness in the palate starts to fill it in. Very (too) carbonated). In general, my comment on the mouthfeel says it all.
De Snaterende Arend Dag Max;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;De Snaterende Arend;Bottled: Pale yellow coloured. Unclear and very bad looking. Very foamy head. Yeasty and sweet aroma. Uninteresting, veak and light yeasty flavour. Not much going on in the aftertaste.

De Snaterende Arend Dag Max;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;De Snaterende Arend;Milky, yeasty, cheesy aroma. Sweetish, yeasty milky flavor. Grape fruitiness. Some kind of mix between a German weizen en a Belgian wit. Nice beer, but not outstanding.

Full Sail Switchback Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours a bright deep amber color. Aromas of sweet malt and some hops. Flavor of sweet caramel, a touch of fruit, and a nice hop finish.
Full Sail Switchback Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;I don�t think these guys have disappointed me yet. This one�s nothing special, but it�s a solid offering. Aroma is slight caramel, more malt than anything else. Has a darker red than the usual, but still looks nice. Very balanced flavor, maybe a little in favor of the malts. Mouthfeel is very much like velvet.
Full Sail Switchback Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;This beer pours a surprise..amber red color with a thin soapy white head which dissipated quickly and left a small amount of islandy lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is light and grassy with hints of malt, twigs, perhaps a waft of orange peel, but pretty much its just very earthy. The flavor is medium bodied, syrupy and sticky mouthfeel. Pretty much a malty and citrusy flavor dominated brew. Some hints of grapefruit and orange peel yet again with a hint of bitterness near the finish. Long lasting finish, fairly dry finish, but not as much as would have been expected. Malty and somewhat cloying in the finish, but good in its own respect and what it tries to accomplish it does well.
Full Sail Switchback Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) Malty and caramely, lightly bitter, moderately sweet, but not what I�d call sugary. Sounds like a beer I might really enjoy, but the result is just an okay, but not great red ale. It starts off quite nice, but the maltiness fades away and the finish has a light roastiness, but a slightly unpleasant bitterness that sits on the palate forever. Medium in body, but it still seems a bit thin to me for some reason. The nose is entirely sweet, malty, and caramely. Medium to dark amber in color. Light tan head gradually fades to a bubbly sheen, but it leaves a solid ring of lace at the top and plenty of swiss-cheese lacing down the rest of the glass. Promises made, but promises not kept: looks good, smells good, tastes okay.

Creamy white head with a Malty toasty carmel aromas with some sharpness of hops but not over powering. A very ballanced taste of maltyness and a bitterness growing on the tongue to the the finish and then almost completely dissapearing. Very smooth session beer.

New Holland Scotch Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;New Holland Brewing Company;"On tap at New Holland. Deep ruby-garnet red body, thin off-white head. Sweet fruity aroma, lots of sweet breads and berries. Flavor was berries, berries, and more berries, with caramel highlights and sweet breads, leading to a quick, short finish. Little alcohol presence. Very nice, but could use a bit more ""roughage"" to round out the ""twigs �n berries"" profile a bit. Rich, sweet, and filling."

New Holland Scotch Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;New Holland Brewing Company;Deep amber colour. Subtle chocolate aroma. A rough maltiness to start with a hoppy finish. Better mashing required.
Brandywine HopHead India Pale Ale;Greenville, Delaware, United States;IPA;Brandywine Brewing Company;Clear copper\yellow color with white head. Nice hop aroma, some floral and fruit. The beer was generic IPA, not much for bitterness or maltyness. Decent beer but too much aromatic hops and flavor is not satisfactory.
Brandywine HopHead India Pale Ale;Greenville, Delaware, United States;IPA;Brandywine Brewing Company;On tap. One of the best beers at the brew pub. Poured clear dark copper with small tan head. Had a floral citrus aroma. Tasted of toasted malts and hops with a light bitter finish. BBC beers were never brewed very consistently, so one batch would be good and another bad.
Brandywine HopHead India Pale Ale;Greenville, Delaware, United States;IPA;Brandywine Brewing Company;KSBF 04, Small brown head, short lived. Brown almost chestnut colored brew, damn near a brown ale appearence. Spicey hop nose, lightly malty. Medium body. Spicey, citrusy hoppiness with a fair malt backing, light graininess. Decent malty dry finish. Sorta dark for an IPA though?

Brandywine HopHead India Pale Ale;Greenville, Delaware, United States;IPA;Brandywine Brewing Company;4 oz. Sampler. A very hoppy IPA. Smooth, but bitter and hoppy on the finish. Well balanced. Hopheads must try this one.
Brandywine HopHead India Pale Ale;Greenville, Delaware, United States;IPA;Brandywine Brewing Company;A vice attempt, especially considering all the hops used, but this ale falls short. It is just an average overbrewed IPA. Copper in color with a nice hoppy aroma.
Brandywine HopHead India Pale Ale;Greenville, Delaware, United States;IPA;Brandywine Brewing Company;Dark, dark copper beer. Light hop nose. Excellent toasted malt flavors with just a hint of hop, subtler than many US micro IPAs. 1 of their 2 best beers.
Brandywine Springfest Amber Lager;Greenville, Delaware, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brandywine Brewing Company;Awesome head that stuck to the glass. Toasty aroma and a good caramel, toasty malt flavor. Perfect feel. Bit of an acidic ending.
Brandywine Black Diamond Dunkel;Greenville, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brandywine Brewing Company;Good dark rye-toasty color with staying head. Roasted nut aroma .. toasted nut flavors, not quite as roasty as a German dunkel, but a good malty beer.
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;Not a strong flavor � mild, very very mild � much like typical American ale. It is crisp but not simpal supar or anything of the sort. Nice foaminess and well carbonated bubbly beer but still does not make me want to break out the Louis Prima and enjoy the sensual butt cheek that should accompany all beer of special nature. I am sorry but this is just a very average beer and for me�is much like beer to drink for lack of other fine beer availability.
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;On tap at the Visalia location. Pours clear light golden with a thin white head and a banana aroma. There is a thin malt flavor with no hop bitterness. Pretty bland.
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;12oz bottle-A golden body with a small head and an aroma of sourness and nothing. Taste of the same with more nastiness. Just bad.
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;Bottle. A golden color although slightly darker than I would have expected. An ice floral aroma with some candy. Smoth and light with an oily palate. Rating from 2005 notes.
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;This is the 2nd beer that I had carried back from California. I had this after a ABT/Quadrupel with 10% alcohol, so my taste buds were still in shock. This beer was very inoffensive and it went down easy. I like a little lemon in my Blondes and a small amount of hops in the body made it enjoyable.
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;This one we had after sipping some heavier beers so that might not have been the right way to go. Lemony aroma, very pale yellow with minimal head. Mild hoppy palate. Inoffensive. PS thanks Ron for sharing this with me!
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;"(12 oz bottle) Brewbakers is quickly becoming my most despised brewery; Aside from crappy beers, a bomber of their Tex Mex exploded in my beer cellar recently and created a huge fucking mess; This is a cheap tasting beer resembles a mass produced American lager, but quite possibly, it's even worse; Mildly sweet maltiness is totally overrun by an unpleasant sourness that persists in a long finish; The nose is sour; This is a first: the palate has a sour sensation just by inhaling the beer before sipping it; Hazy pale yellow in color; Head retention is not applicable since there was no head to speak of on the pour, and you're left with a totally headless beer within a few seconds; Honestly, I was assuming the beer was skunked and soured, but based on the previous reviews here, apparently this is the way this beer is supposed to taste; I'm pissed off that a highly respected store like Hi Times would even carry this crap; This is a really bad beer all around, just plain horrible, and my first drain pour in quite awhile; What a way to cap off a golden/blonde beer tasting, goddammit!"
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;What the hell, am I drinking coors light in a masked bottle? kept the head longer, but had a small afterbite... can you say stick your tongue out?
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;Pale yellowy, slightly hazed hue, decent head formation. Malt and grain aroma with a touch of sourness. Palate is initially sweet but quickly turns bitter with a slight bite in the second half. Lingering sourness in the aftertaste. Seems OK at first but then the more you drink it the worse it gets.
Brewbakers Surf City Blonde Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewbakers Brewing Company;"Hmmm. Should be categorized as ""Blande Blonde"", perhaps. Well-bittered and some citrus notes. Fairly crisp. Decent and brewed by a micro in CA that's relatively untested by RateBeerians thus far. This Surf City Blonde Ale suffers the unfortunate that I'm rating it on the heels of a Weltenburg Kloster Urtyp Hell, which was delicious!"
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;Draft at the brewpub in Delafield, Wisconsin. Pours light copper with off-white head and substantial lacing. Bready malt and floral aroma. Light bread crust malt flavor with floral notes.
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;At brewpub. Clear medium amber. Good sized fluffy creamy off-white head. Bready. Toasty. Earthy. Lighter medium bodied. Spicy, and fairly dry. Fair creaminess. Great drinkability.
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;Tap at brewhaus. Dark golden pour. Crisp and refreshing. Nicely balanced hops and malt.
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;Draft at the brewpub. Golden, shiny beer. Drinks with a nice, mild alcohol burn, a good bock core. Bit of a lemony twist makes it a little different. Good. (#5095, 7/2/2012)
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;Amber in color. Fruity, sweet malt with some butter. Well balanced caramel malts with light bitterness. Again some butter, but mild. Decent, but not great.
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;Draught at the BrewPub: Faint aroma of malt and honey. Poured amber in color with a small, creamy, off-white head that diminished but lasted throughout. Small particles throughout. Good lacing. Flavor is light to medium sweet and light to medium bitter. Tastes of malt and noble hops. Medium body. Average texture. Average carbonation. Malt and noble hop finish.
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at brewpub, pours a hazy golden with a thin head and some spotty lacing, the aroma is very sweet with some caramel and bread notes coming through, the flavor is very sweet as well with malt, actually caught some of the booze in the finish, too sweet for me.
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;Good amber golden color with a nice fluffy head. Sweet and floral with a hint of apple in the aroma. They used just enough hops in this one to prevent it from being an overly syrupy sweet mess. Some citrus, grass, caramel, toffee, and apple juice. I can dig it.
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at Delafield Brewhaus. Poured clear lighter golden with a short, creamy cap of white head. The aroma found sweet lighter fruity sugars and first struck me as tripel-ish.. toasty with a bit of floral and grassy notes accenting. The flavor was tasty and simple, but just too sweet.. toasty caramel and lighter fruits surrounded by peppery and green floral bitterness at the edges.. spicy and very sweet on the finish. Sweet and medium-bodied on the palate with OK balance.. a touch sharp on the edges and warm at the finish. OK.
Delafield Fr�hlingzeit Maibock;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Delafield Brewhaus;Amber with thin white head. Aroma of caramel, fruit and sweet malts. Taste is pretty much the same. Dry and astringent on the finish, a so-so maibock.
Whistler Premium Export Golden Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bear Brewing;A - pours nice golden red with almost no head. S - honey, floral notes, strong lightly tangy gross raisin bread and candied sugars. M - light body, weak watery palate. Lingering floral honey lager. T - tastes are the same as the nose, lingering honey and floral malts. 3+
Whistler Premium Export Golden Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bear Brewing;This was a rather boring beer by any standards. Pours a kind of dark golden coloring, with a fastly fading saod head. Grainy and slightly sour in the nose, with some biscuity maltiness and just a bit of herbal bitterness in the finish.
Whistler Premium Export Golden Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bear Brewing;cloudy light gold colour. no head to speak of. yeasty nose with slight hint of malt. meaty yeasty taste that fades to mild hop finish. rather a dull beer.
Whistler Premium Export Golden Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bear Brewing;Gold,fast fading white head. Light malt nose. Rather watery and bland with a touch of hops at the end
Whistler Premium Export Golden Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bear Brewing;Nothing special about this and I hope its not exported. Body is golden with a small white head with decent lacing. Aroma is of malts and nothing else noticeable. Flavour is boring and finish is slightly dry and quite thin.
Zigs Porter;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Porter;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Really dark with the typical roasted flavors. A bit of smokiness, but didn't really see this evolving into anything. Decent.
Zigs Porter;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Porter;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Notes of smoky cherrywood, sappy with a coffee bean finish. Thin, but had a lot of flavors going for it.
Zigs Porter;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Porter;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Like Sean says, I'm a sucker for that dry malty smokiness of a good porter, with a crisp bit of hops (although I'm surprised to read that its 45 IBUs!). My brew was listed as 7.5%, not 6.8%, and it showed as the alcohol thinned the body even further and took it out of style quite a bit.
Zigs Porter;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Porter;Zigs Kettle and Brew;45 Ibus. I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for smoky porters, adn for this taste in beer in general. This beer is thinner than it might be, so it relies hard on flavor, and that is a slow build of smoke and richer malts that builds into a brush fire, til the smoke takes over with the effect of a decent cigar. I like this beer a lot, and I probably like it a lot more than it deserves, but like I said, I'm a sucker for this flavor.
Zigs Coffee Cream Stout;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Easily the best Zig's brew and a monster stout. This thing is huge and rich and absolutely dripping in complex bitter java tones that hold the front line while a decent rise of thicker sweets alternately rolls in ocean waves behind. Great beer!
Zigs Sweet Stout;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Zigs Kettle and Brew;The most substance of any Zig brew I tried at the bar - this one is real chewy and full bodied, to the point that the texture subdues the flavour. It starts out rolling roastily but a little sweetness gets going and eventually rises to the challenge, rocking with the roasts behind that thick bodied screen. 30 Ibus.
Zigs Pale Ale;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Soapy. Thing watery and slightly bitter. No hops at all here. Some citrus, yes, but overall disappointing.
Zigs Pale Ale;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Zigs Kettle and Brew;Citrusy nose, but an overall grainy taste. Some dry grassy hops at the end, but no hint of the citrusy notes that it began teasing me with!
Zigs Pale Ale;Jackson, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Zigs Kettle and Brew;56 IBUs. Two hop rushes - the first one charging boldly, madly through the cloudy orange. As it fades you get a little residual citric sweetness. The next blast is subtler, but lingering. This is one challenging pale!
Leopold Brothers Nut Brown;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Poured a clear dark brown color with a moderate frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with fair lacing. Medium toasted malty aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of short duration.
Leopold Brothers Nut Brown;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Leopold Brothers Brewery;So this is a new one. These guys have a pretty good name for German styles, but on my spring break trip to A2, they had this concoction as well. It's sweeter than nutty, with some funkier, musty flavors, but pleasant enough to sample one. I'd get old fast, though.
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;2010 Tap, pours an amber color with one finger sized whitish head. Smell and flavor are extremely heavy handed spices, ginger, cigarettes, ash, and dirty earth. Theres some sweet and fruity belgian yeast and malt as well. Not a fan of this one. Too yeasty and aggressive.
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours a a mellow orange amber color. Aromas of wheat, ginger, some spice. In the flavor there are hints of orange, ginger, with a slight bitter finish.
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;"""i was surprised by actually liking the rice aspect of this beer more than the ginger, which was pretty subdued. at the end of the day, this was one of the DFH beers that comes off as gimmicky, and while it wasn�t bad in any sense of the word, why pay $15-20 for a slightly above average beer, which is what this ended up being."""
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;Poured from 750 a nice amber somewhat cloudy hue, with a small white head with almost no evident lacing. Aroma is full of ginger with spice, reminiscent of ginsing and earth. Flavour was that of dirt, is all I could think of. Uhg, can�t do it, total pass for me.
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;750ml bottle from Half Time (Poughkeepsie NY). Poured a clear dark amber color with a small foamy white head. Aroma of burnt sugar, caramel malt, ginger, and spice. Taste of sweet candied ginger, syrupy malt, sweet fruit, and Belgian spices.
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;Draught @ the saucer. Complex caramel color. Frothy off-white head. Complex aroma with pumpkin, spice, basement, and rye coming to mind. Flavor is dominated by pumpkin spice cake, nutmeg and cream. If I didnt know any better I would say this was a pumpkinator but the color is wrong. If starts fizzy, transitions smooth and has a light, bitter finish.
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bomber from Tacoma CO-OP. Pours amber in color. Thin white head. Scent is sweet and malty. Taste is ginger and spice. Tasty beer.
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;caramel, cereal, herbs, amber, fairly yeasty. Very drinkable with a medium body.
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;"From BA review on 2-25-12 - Served in a 10 oz chalice glass Appearance �Served a yellow-orange color with a little bit of haze. Upon serving there was a nice billowy white head that faded slowly. Upon fading the head leaves a moderate level of lacing. Smell � Initially the aroma begins with some nice citrus hop; mainly orange and grapefruit in nature. These aromas then begin to mix with aromas of ginger, bready malt, and some brown sugar/molasses aromas as well. At the very end there is a very light floral hop aroma which mixes with the other rounding out the aroma nicely. It�s quite unique, and rather inviting. Taste � The taste is interesting as well. A maltiness is most pertinent up front. The taste then sweetens a bit with some caramel and brown sugar flavors mixing in. These are also mixed in with some spiciness � mainly ginger and cinnamon. Some bitterness works its way in from the hoppiness of the citrus. All these flavors, as they did in the aroma, make a unique drinking beer with a rather oddly refreshing taste. Mouthfeel - While the taste and aroma were rather unique, the mouthfeel was rather normal. It was slightly above normal thickness and its carbonation was very standard. Overall � This was an interesting beer. It had some very unique aspects to it making it a very nice one to sit back and test out."
Dogfish Head Pangaea;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogfish Head Brewery;2011 bottle at tasting..medium dark amber color..nose is mostly saffron and quite similar in almost every respect to Midas Touch..mouthfeel is a bit thin and weak and not much interest here...chalk this up to another unique dfh offering that has an interesting storyline but not much else
Monteiths Kristall Weizen;Greymouth, New Zealand;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Golden body that is a touch on the pale side, the head is a bit of a poor effort. The aroma is as described on the bottle - cloves. Taste is ok , cloves and a bit of spice, not full bodied or anything but easily drinkable.
Monteiths Kristall Weizen;Greymouth, New Zealand;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);The label states that it has a distinctive clove presence. I would agree but don�t know that it has to be specificially stated to be there as it doesn�t dominate. Looks OK in the glass with a light golden colour and a head that is crisp and reasonably long lasting head. This is a bit thin and not a beer that you would go out and buy a lot of. The typical flavour of the style is present and so marks for accuracy. Not a bad beer but not one either to be too excited about.
Monteiths Kristall Weizen;Greymouth, New Zealand;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Pours golden with a loosish white head which decreases quickly to a very thin layer. typical slightly sweet wheat beer aroma, with no hint of hops. Taste is slightly more bitter than would be expected from the style and the aroma, but is very nice. As I prefer a slightly higher hopping rate than is present in most Weizen Bier, I found this to be overall very nice, but perhaps not quite true to style.
Monteiths Kristall Weizen;Greymouth, New Zealand;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Bold golden colour, with small head, Tropical fruity tatstes, spicey finish. a very enjoyable Autum drinker. Not too heavy, but still a nice warmer.

Deep gold in colour, with a slight, off-white, head. Some flabby malts, touch of stone fruits and leafy hops, leading to a moderately bitter finish. So so.
B&T Dragon Slayer;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;B&T Brewery;Initially thought this was a run of the mill session golden ale, but then a third of a pint in the overbearing aftertaste hits you, flowery, lavender. It's not nice. Way too much. Disappointing.
B&T Dragon Slayer;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;B&T Brewery;Clear, yellow-golden colored, medium frothy white head. Aroma is malty, some biscuit, fruity, light hoppy, grass-hay. Taste is medium sweet malt, biscuit notes, light-medium hay-grassy hops and bitterness, fruity estery, bit yeast. Medium bodied, soft carbonation. Fruit over hop... (cask)
B&T Dragon Slayer;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;B&T Brewery;Tastes like washing up liquid. Avoid like the plague. Has an awful aftertaste. Maybe its me.
B&T Dragon Slayer;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;B&T Brewery;Pours a pale gold colour with a small white head. Some light malt, citrus and yeasty vegetable aromas. Light sweet malt taste but watery, thin and not much in the finish.
B&T Dragon Slayer;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;B&T Brewery;Cask. Pours golden pale straw. White top and lasting lacing. Aroma cheesy yeast. But it is the taste that most disappoints. Medium sour. Medium bitter with some saltiness. Body light to medium. Texture sticky. Carbonation soft. Finish soft and long due to oil on the palate. A beer that fails and refuses to leave. 04/07/18 it has not improved nor gone away. Remarkable in a way. A bad way.

Robinsons Stockport Arches Bitter;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Robinsons Family Brewery;Cask (handpump) at a Robinsons pub in Marple, circa April 2001. Only entering these old notes because the beer is retired so I won�t be able to rate it again. Mid brown colour. Rather darker and fuller bodied than normal for a session bitter. Fairly malty. Apart from that, there�s nothing really to set it apart. A couple of pints of this went down pretty well though.

Light-medium body and some crispness.

Redondo Beach Rat Beach Red;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;On tap while out to dinner at a friends birthday. Poured a dark amber red color with almost no head. Smelled a little like caramel, couldn�t make out much more.

Redondo Beach Rat Beach Red;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;On draft at brewery, consumed 01/14/08. Medium caramel color, crystal clear. Active carbonation but no real head. Aroma is clean and a little fruity. Mouthfeel is a little thicker than water. Malty and a little sweet. No real hop character means a lingering malt aftertase. A little hoppiness would have cut through that really well.
Redondo Beach Rat Beach Red;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Tap @ Brewpub: Brownish red, no head or lacing. Nose of light caramel and vague malt, very little nose. The flavor is tinny and bitter, no cohesion or intention. Turn brain off and drink.
Redondo Beach Rat Beach Red;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Beer pours an amber color with a slightly sweet and slightly hoppy aroma. Flavor is initially malt that tastes like cinamon and vanilla, and then a little bit of citrus hop dryness. Beer is very light for style, and following the trend of the other two beers, I detected some corn.
Redondo Beach Rat Beach Red;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Crystal clear copper body with beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, caramel, earthy, white pepper. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, some earthy, finishes with some spice. Light-medium body, some chalkiness.
Redondo Beach Rat Beach Red;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;great deep red color. hints of fruit on the nose and palate. a good balance of sweetness
Redondo Beach Rat Beach Red;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Surprisingly uninteresting. No nose, too thin in the mouth, hints of flavor, but nothing sufficiently present or assertive. Not bad, nothing screams out skunky. Just not very interesting. Six bucks draft at LAX and I just tossed mine.
Redondo Beach Rat Beach Red;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Odorless. Nutty flavor with mellow chocolate and caramel tones, but all a little too mild.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;From tap at the brewpub. Pours clear and golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma is citeusy and light butterish. Dry and toasted malty.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. This beer is a clear golden color with a thin white head that evaporates quickly. Minimal lacing is evident. Mild grassy hops and fruit aroma. Light body with flavors of subtle hops, fruit and sweet malt. The finish is short and lightly hoppy. Slightly below average overall.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;On draft at brewery, consumed 01/14/08. Clear, light golden hue with active carbonation and nice lacing. Sweet aroma. Slightly astringent. Very subtle flavor. Almost nothing there (slight hop bitterness at start) until the aftertaste, which reminds me of Cap�n Crunch: sweet corn.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Tap @ Brewpub: Very pale, pellucid, yellow, light head and lacing. Nose of stale wheat, cheap malt, overattenuated yet nicely hopped. Lemony mouthfeel, subtle lameness. Thin flavor, but not in that order.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;A crisp aroma with nice hop notes. Also some corn aroma. The taste is the same, it is crisp yet corny. It is easy to drink, and somewhat enjoyable. Color is light golden. A very average beer.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Sparkling straw body with white head. Aroma is medium sweet, not much else. Taste is medium sweet, grass, some bread, minimal bitterness. Light body, some crispness.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;standard blonde ale. weak nose. simple taste. okay mouthfeel. decent color.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Same company and same name but a different recipe to the Manhattan Beach Blonde. Clean and light, lemon and citrus, slight bitterness.
Redondo Beach Blonde;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;What a lethargic, lifeless blonde. Dully pathetic. Uninspiring. Blah, blah, blah. Taste is of generic brewpub lite lager. Color is of urine.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;From tap at the brewpub. Pours clear and golden orange with a small off white head. Aroma is roasted malty, tartand solid citric to blueberry fruity. Citric and dry finish.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. This brew is a clear golden color with a medium white head that diminishes quickly. This is the second time I have run into a beer with fresh blueberries thrown in (the other being Boston Beer Works), and as far as novelties go BBW has the edge because their blueberries were dancing all over the inside of the glass, while Redondo�s just kind of laid sulkily at the bottom. Aroma of wheat and blueberries. Light body with a bubbly mouthfeel. Sweet fruit and wheat flavors with a bit of malt and sesty spice. The finish is fruity and short. Overall not worth revisiting.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;On draft at brewery, consumed 01/14/08. Light golden yellow, crystal clear (except for the actual blueberries in the beer). Carbonation especially noted due to foreign objects in glass. Aroma is (duh) blueberry. Flavor is laid-back wheat and malt with some smooth berry notes. Towards the end, some corn flavor appears. Not one of the overly-fruity novelty beers most microbreweries produce.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery / restaurant. There were blueberries in the bottom of the glass and it was nice to eat them while drinking the beer. Otherwise it was like a dry wheat beer.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;"Pretty tasty; poured a goldish color; lots of carbonation. Put blueberry right into the glass; flavor was a lot of blueberry and wheat; a little yeasty. Enjoyable, but not all that great"
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Tap @ Brewpub: There�s four blueberries sitting in the bottom of my taster glass... Golden color, light head and lacing. Nose of blueberry, tastes like those cheap instant blueberry pancakes without the buttermilk though. Intense, but unique, somewhat refreshing. I couldn�t drink much of this, because the base beer quickly comes out and shows its ugly self. Nice for the novelty. Unfortunately the blueberries don�t taste that good when you get to the bottom, you�d think they�d be some kind of reward.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Aroma is sweet malt and blueberry puree as well as some perfume. Appearance is golden and a little hazy. Beer has blueberries in the glass. Flavor has some fruity sweetness, a minute amount of citrus and wheat, and some corn. There is not alot of carbonation, and the beer is smooth and easy drinking. This was my favorite of their beers.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Off-white head, hazy amber body, served with blueberries in the glass. Aroma is medium sweet, blueberry. Taste is medium sweet, blueberry (medium strong, not overwhelming). Watery light body, undercarbonated. The blueberry isn�t too much, but not enough flavor beyond it.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Enhanced with fresh blueberries in the glass. Light in body, blueberries take over, sweet and prickley with a touch of spiciness. Of the 3 blueberry ales I've tried so far it's really difficult to see and difference.
Redondo Beach Blueberry Wheat;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Good head! Actually tastes like blueberries. My glass had 10 berries sitting on the bottom. A classy touch. Could be even more berry-flavored, though.
Redondo Beach Oatmeal Stout;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;"Draft at brewery / restaurant. Aroma of roasted chocolate malt and oats. Pretty standard flavor for this style; it could have had a creamier mouthfeel. Good balance of flavors."
Redondo Beach Oatmeal Stout;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;"Tap at brewpup; similar to the IPA, not in flavor but quality. Good, but lacking assertiveness. I didn�t mind this that much because I don�t normally like this style. It might have made me like it more. Good palate and coloring; spot on. Flavor was coffee, chocolate with a milky sweetness."
Redondo Beach Oatmeal Stout;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Tap @ Brewpub: Dark brown, black, nice head and light lacing. Nose of sweet subtle roast, chewy fig and chocolate, a bit of coffee and gluten. Not that stouty, more of a smooth robust porter. Good though. Flavor is balanced, nice body, clean chalky finish. Par.
Redondo Beach Oatmeal Stout;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Beer has a very roasty aroma. Color is dark dark brown, almost black. This beer is rather light for the style and it tastes exactly like carbonated coffee.
Redondo Beach Oatmeal Stout;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Clear red-black body with tan head. Aroma is medium sweet, mild, some anise, light roasty. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, anise, light coffee. Watery light-medium body, some creaminess.
Redondo Beach Oatmeal Stout;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Light in aroma. Overly sweet for a stout. Pastey with light roasted coffee flavors but stout qualities lacking for the most part. Disappointing for a style that brewpubs usually do well.
Redondo Beach Oatmeal Stout;Redondo Beach, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redondo Beach Brewing Company;Served warmer than their other brews, which is appropriate. Once more, this brewpub indicates that they just might know something about beer. Surprisingly fizzy for a stout. Frankly, not all that thick, either. Mild and somewhat sweet. Tad smoky. Probably their best beer.
Downtown Irish Red;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Downtown Brewing Co.;On tap at the short lived Downtown Brew Co. Poured a deep amber with off white head. Tastes of sweet malts and biscuits. Medium bodied with medium carbonation.
Downtown Irish Red;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Downtown Brewing Co.;Very dark with a strong malt aroma. Powerful, very nutty caramel offering. Heavy, full-bodied. Decent.
Downtown Market Street Golden Ale;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Downtown Brewing Co.;On tap at short lived Downtown Brew Co. Pour light gold with minimal head. Very weak in aroma and flavor. All around bland beer.
Downtown Market Street Golden Ale;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Downtown Brewing Co.;Light orange, flat with no head. An almost vinegary scent, but the flavor is an OK malt, lager-like. OK.
Buckeye RauchAlt;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Hazy mahogany body with a thin touch of off white head. No shortage of aromas here. Lots of smoke and crystal malts, for sure. Quite balanced on the palate. Smoke is not overwhelming or overly ""meaty"". Nice long finish. This would probably be great with a nice cigar."
Buckeye RauchAlt;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Buckeye Brewing Company;If you don't like smoked beers much this is the one to try. If you do like smoked beers this is the one to try. I very much appreciated the crispness of this brew combined with the moderate smokiness. A balanced smoked brew.
Buckeye RauchAlt;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Buckeye Brewing Company;"""I smell smoke that comes from a gun named extinction"" - The Pixies - yeah I love Alt Rock! Oh, it's Alt Rauch....Well that's o.k. the quote belongs to this brew anyway. When they say ""assertively hoppy"" they mean probably 35-40 IBU - that's a real nice amount that complements the strong smoke flavors very nicely. Some of the smoked beers I've had have erred a bit on the sweet side - not this one. The strong rounded bitterness seems to bring out the charred wood flavor here. The hops fade quickly at the finish while the smoke smolders on your tongue. A palate killer - don't plan on tasting much afterwords. Poured deep ruby with a tan head and great lacing. Went very well with the smoked salmon pastry puffs and smoked porter bread."
Summit Station Gaithersburg Golden Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Summit Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft... Pours a crystal clear, light golden color. Large frothy white head. Somewhat lasting with very nice lacing. The aroma holds light notes of butterscotch and English toffee. Lightly floral with a touch of citrus fruit as well. The flavor is lightly malty up front and balanced well with generous bitter and pungent hops on the backside. Medium-bodied with an oily mouthfeel. Fizzy carbonation. Crisp and clean finish.
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;Tap. Pours crystal clear golden orange, huge white head, nice residual and lacing.

Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;Aroma: Belgian yeast, caramel, earthy, spicy Appearance: clear golden with a white head Taste: medium sweetness, medium bitterness, Palate: medium body, sticky, soft carbonation, long finish, Delicious
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;Bomber with Ruthie. Near clear golden pour with ring of white head. Old and musty, even though the bottle is from 2014. Banana and bubblegum. Lots of bubblegum. A little flat, but chewy body. Meh
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;11/15/2013. On tap at the brewery. Pours light amber color with a white head. Aromas of yeast, malt, light fruit. Buttery flavors with yeast and fruit. Slightly bitter finish. Not bad.
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;Poured as a 2 oz sampler at Virginia Beer Live 2013. May have been suffering from palate blowout. Sour orange and coriander on the nose and a bit of heat. Nutmeg, clove, and banana on the palate. Very nice and very tasty.
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;Smells of coriander and some grapefruit. Bit of carbonation bubbles on the tongue with a slight dry grassy feel. Some citrus and hops.
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;Belgian yeasts and fruity banana esters. Light head and golden yellow body. Tastes of clove, belgian yeast and other spices with some light dry fruit notes. Light and smooth on the palate.
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;"Floral, honey, golden raisins, and orange peel aromas. Clear gold with very minimal head foam; oily. Off-dry, fruity, floral, and perceptibly strong. Medium body, sticky, with moderate carbonation, and leaves behind notes of wild flowers and stone fruits."
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;Sweet fruity banana aromas. The flavors exactly mirror the aromas. Overall a very good Belgian triple.
Legend Tripel Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Tripel;Legend Brewing Company;Bottle. Golden yellow pour and a bit lighter than expected. Taste and smell revel a big syrupy sweetness but doesnt show the booze. Although really sweet, the toffee and ripe fruits come thru nicely to end in a nice brew.
Maplewood Farms Duffys Milk Stout;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Maplewood Farms;Has a very dark brown color and a roasted malt smell. Taste is smooth, creamy and finishes with a nice bitterness. Overall a very nice stout, one of the better ones...
Pizzeria Uno Dunkelweisse;Metuchen, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill & Brewery;Light banana notes in nose. Muddy dark brown with dissapointing head. Very light hop character with wheat malts taking the center stage throughout the swallow. Fairly authentic, but unexciting.
Tsjing;Brakel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;De Graal;Fruity, orange aroma. Amber color, off-white head, good lace. Light sweet, spices, peppery, fruity, smooth.
Tsjing;Brakel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;De Graal;"Colour is light-foxy, but with a pinkish shine, slightly hazy. Medium-thick head, white (with again a pinkish shine) and slowly disappearing. Chalky and spicy nose (which spices I don't know, I only heard of two of them). I am thinking of a subdued raspberry nose - the mulberries probably. Taste: this IS special. Exotic wood - exotic spices - exotic fruits? Woody, certainly. There are some malts underneath, and a bitterness - but no hops discernible. No specific spice really emerges, which is good, but the overall finish is a bit overpowering. Medium-bodied. Sourish-refreshing, but I don't think this could ever figure as a session ale. No new aftertaste. This beer is brewed at De Graal brewery by and for a local beerconsumers branch, BLES from Zottegem. The name is a Flemish wordplay - it sounds Chinese, but is a Flemish version of ""Cheers""."
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear orange with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has earthy bread and sweet grains with a hint of sweetness. Flavor is similar with earthy bread, sweet grains and a bit of sweetness.
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Had at Das Boot Camp. Arrived clear amber with very little head. Aroma is doughy and earthy. Taste follows nose.
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Poured redish copper color with white head that hung around for a few minutes. Aroma was nice, kinda like a Jolly Rancher. Tasted dry with a wine like feel, not bad if you enjoy watered down wine. Overall I was fairly happy
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;(Draught) Pours a clear copper body with a medium white head. Aroma of caramel, toasted grain, and biscuit. Flavor of caramel, grain, and biscuit. My least favorite of their beers. Seemed like this beer was well past its prime.
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Aroma of buttered biscuits. Pours a bright orange with a thick white head. Flavor has mild butter with heavy biscuit notes. Enjoyable and surprising given the low alcohol content.
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Draft at the brewpub, 11/14/06: Amber-orange with an extremely active appeal. Very smooth. Biscuity at first, mellows as you go into a more evenly keeled malty brew. Quite good.
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;I am always weary about low-alcohol brews here in Oklahoma, but this one impressed me. Its rich golden bubbly body was topped by a light foamy goodness, and its aroma was fair. While the flavor was mediocre and the body was thin, the taste was still good.
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;(Tap) Pours a rich amber with a fluffy, lasting head. Yeast and biscuit notes. Not a lot in the way of hops, but still refreshing. More body than I expected, especially for a low alcohol beer. Pairs nicely with the sausage here.
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;"(On tap) Presented as ""Royal Bavaria Kings Oktoberfest"". Slightly hazy amber with a handsome, creamy, off-white head leaving some laces. Malty nose with some hints of yeast. Medium body with vague, caramelish accents. Discreet, hoppy finish. Decent but not an overly refined example of the style. 210306"
Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Tap at the brewpub: poured a cloudy orange with a medium white head. Fairly big diacetyl aroma and nothing else. Buttery flavor with a mild bitter finish. No discernible Octoberfest/Marzen flavors in this one. Not very good at all.
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Draft at the source. Hazy golden color. Light citrus aroma. Light citrus taste. Light body. Pretty light.
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a hazy yellowish gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of clove and light wheat as well as a hint of banana.

Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;From Das Boot Camp in Norman. Arrived Slightly hazy gold with a creamy white head. Aroma of wheat and bananas. Taste is wheat an bananas.
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;(Draught) Pours a clear golden body with a medium white head. Aroma of wheat, banana, citrus, and clove. Flavor of banana, clove, citrus, and bread. It appears that the new brewer certainly upgraded their beers.
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Had at Jorg�s farewell. New owner and brewer, and products have improved somewhat. The beer poured slightly hazy orange with a two finger head. Some DMS still lingering, but not the butter bomb it used to be. No banana esters, but mild clove notes are present. Still not all I�d expect from a German Hefe, but an improvement over past efforts. BREW!!!
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Draft at the brewpub, 11/14/06: Clearer than you�d expect for a hefeweizen. Very bubbly, rising into a big white head. Maltier than I�d thought. Creamy. Bit of a yeasty edge, but not much. Enjoyable but not squarely down the the HW vein.
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;There wasn�t a lot to this beer. In fact, at one point I forgot I was drinking beer. There was not much flavor to the beer and it seemed to be extra filtered leaving little or no cloudiness behind. Try one of the other beers on tap.
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;(Tap) Pours golden, but not very cloudy as one would expect. Pretty bland... no off flavors, but nothing special compared to other hefeweizens. There are almost no detectable clove or fruity notes. This is pretty unlike the style. I�d almost say it�s more like an American Wheat. I�ll try it again to see if this beer tastes consistent. Right now, it�s probably my least favorite Royal Bavaria beer.
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;"Jorg knows how to brew a ""real"" beer. You will forget about the phoney American watered down beer once you try a selection brewed at the Royal Bavaria. When I can not drink at the Royal Bavaria-- I only drink Franzis Kaner Hefe Weiss. There are a very select few others- but, I only drink good beer!!! You people that said you did not like Royal Bavaira Weiss don�t know good beer. Jorg obtains the ingrediants for his brews straight from Bavaria. There are no american products in the beer except the water. Have some Wiener Schnitzel with your Weiss and afterwards a pear schapps and you�ll feel fine!!"
Royal Bavaria Weiss;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;it poured like anaverage Weizen, but it smelled terrible, and the flavor was very bland... the aroma was the exact same for both the beers that I tried at royal bavaria... possibly infected, very buttery
Craftsman Heavenly Hefe;Pasadena, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft. Strong aroma of banana. Flavors include lots of banana, but also pepper, vanilla and clove. Unusually crisp and defined hefe. Not a lot of softness here. Terrific.
Craftsman Heavenly Hefe;Pasadena, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Craftsman Brewing Company;Tap at Bar in LA - cloudy golden color, white head. taste is wheat, some bubblegum, cloves. its a good Weizen, however, I am surprised to see it in top 50, as there are quite some Weizen in Germany who are at least as good and not listed. maybe exceptional for a Weizen from the US.
Craftsman Heavenly Hefe;Pasadena, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Craftsman Brewing Company;Tap. Pours quite hazy golden orange, small off white head, great lacing. Aroma is perfect hef, wheat, banana, hint of clove, black jack gum. Flavor is light sweet, minimally bitter, rich. Medium body, silky mouthfeel. Excellent.

Craftsman Heavenly Hefe;Pasadena, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft - Light Spice, banana and a touch of wheat. Cloudy gold with a small white head. Spicy, apple, banana and wheat. Interesting, but nice.
Craftsman Heavenly Hefe;Pasadena, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap pours out a hazy golden topped with a white head. Nose is banana bread spice and some pepper. Tatse is more of the nice sweet banana bread spice notes and pepper.
Craftsman Heavenly Hefe;Pasadena, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Craftsman Brewing Company;Guest tap at Highland Park Brewery where it was listed at 4.8%. Cloudy gold with a crackery clove tangy wheat flavor. Decent, a bit eggy but I'm surprised to see this is a Top 50 beer.
Craftsman Heavenly Hefe;Pasadena, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Craftsman Brewing Company;Backlog entry. Solid beer and tastes as described and expected. Nothing too complex or noteworthy.
Craftsman Heavenly Hefe;Pasadena, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft. Pours hazed gold with a white head. Spicy and fruity yeasty base, some banana, lighter clove, and mild sweetness. Balanced, clean, and quite drinkable.

Tastes exactly like a Hefeweizen should, not too fruity or sweet but crisp and flavourful. Not a big fan of this style but I would def. drink this again -- it is the perfect execution of a beer style.
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Had on draft at the brewery.chocolate, light smoke, sweet maltiness. Well done for a 4% Scottish ale.
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Nice head from being nitro. Malty and peaty could be a bit better on the mouthfeel but nitro helps. Nice overall. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Nice caramel, bread crust, sweet malt character. Really subtle smokiness. (Nitro tap)
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;On Nitro at Red Rock downtown Clear mahogany with a medium sized beige head, good lacing. Aroma of mild peat, toasted malts and nutty. Taste is toasted malts, toffee and smoky Ok, mild
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Draft Flight 9/02-Pours a medium mahogany with no head. Aroma of malt, caramel, and smoke. Taste of the same with some hops thrown in. This medium bodied brew is well balanced and easy to drink.
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. I didn�t think I�d see this beer, so I was happy. Pours a light red color with a small light brown head. A malty nose, some light smoke perhaps. Lots of sweet malty flavors, some dryness in the finish. Some light fruity and smoke aspects. This one grew on me. Nice.
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Poured from the tap a rich deep mahogany with a thick tan head. The nose was nice and smokey with with deep caramel malts. The taste started like the aroma. smokey, but less intense. The smoke lend itself well to the roasted malts that soon follow. The finish was lightly bitter. The body was smooth and on the light side. This isn�t a textbook Scotish Ale. It lacks oak presence and has a low ABV of 4.0. However as Brown Ales go, this is a nice drinkable smooth ale. I�m giving it a higher score because I found it to be quite delicious. Not because of it�s proximity to style.
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Dark brown with an off whited head and spotty lace. Mellow hops and malts. Same flavors with citrus and two row. Light bodied.
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;2004 NABA Festival: Dark with red tones. Light amount of head. Smell of fruit. Citrusy with alot of carbonation.
Red Rock McRocks Scottish Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Red Rock Brewing;NABA '04: Dark brown, amber, tan head, some lacing. Aroma has some light roast & malt, fairly watery, unimperssive with a musky unbalanced finish. NABA BeerFest 03: nothing exciting, scottishs are usually very subtle with a very refining flavor, this lacked that subtlety, so it wasn't that amazing.

Kelham Island Wards Brown Ale;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;Kelham Island Brewery;Dog & Bone, Gillingham Red brown colour. Served a little warm. Tangy medium to light bodied with a slight clinging quality. Malt vanishes, leaving a slight caramel note to linger alongside some rather dull hops.

Buckeye Pilsener;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckeye Brewing Company;Crisp clean refreshing pilsner. Slightly more malty than many pilsners -- which is fine with me. Worth a try if you are a pilsner fan, otherwise buckeye has plenty of other great brews to try.
Buckeye Pilsener;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckeye Brewing Company;Yellow beer with a foamy white head. Sticky lacing. Hoppy nose, with some notes of earthy malt. The flavors were quite malty in the Hoptoberfest 2005 batch. Still hopped up, but not extremely dry or spicy. Like a Czech pils than a north German style. Quaffable.
Buckeye Pilsener;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckeye Brewing Company;16 oz. draft Very quaffable, light, golden beer, plenty of wheat and the nice fungi-pilsner flavor. The one you point your domestic-drinking friends at when they walk in the door at Buckeye and stare confusedly at the taps. It's still a real beer, though, with a decent, fluffy head and a nice open aroma.
Buckeye Pilsener;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Long lasting white head on a deep golden colored body. Great floral hop aroma w/a malty backbone; Very clean and no fruity esters. Hop flavor and maltiness are well balanced with a very pleasant bitter but malty finish. It's not terribly complex, but what lager is? Aftertaste is hop and has moderate carbonation and a medium body. It's missing the diacetyl of a typical Bo.Pils, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I've spoken to Garin about this beer and it's the first time he's used distilled water to cut the mineral content of the water and it's contributed a lot of smoothness in the hop profile. He also said that he will not bottle this beer so if you want it, you have to go to Buckeye to taste it."
Buckeye Pilsener;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Nice and hoppy with thicker than expected malts. Very refreshing, but I think it lacked a ""crispness"" that would have brightened up the overall flavor."

San Diego Old 395;San Diego, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;San Diego Brewing Company;From the Beer Engine at SDBC. Clear dark amber with decent head that formed a ring for the whole glass. It looked like it wanted to leave lacing, but it kinda just slid down the glass. Aromas were caramel, cherries, and other dark fruits. The sweetness carried over to the flavor and became a little vinous as well. Alcohol in the flavor toward the end. Very smooth finish. Pretty good brew.
San Diego Old 395;San Diego, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;San Diego Brewing Company;Draft. Mildly piney hop aroma with hints of anise and caramel.

Red-amber and slightly hazy with a thin creamy head that lingered well and left great lacing. The appearance was the best part of the beer. Sweet molasses and hop aroma. Brief, sweet initial flavor, then lots of tart grapefruit hops and a long astringent bitter finish - a little unbalanced. Thick, smooth, full and creamy mouthfeel.

Lots of caramelized malts in there and lots of fruity hops. Medium bitterness with grapefruits, pine-cones juice and citrus fruits. Quite a bit of after-taste. Medium carbonation. This is a nourishing and flavourful Pale Ale. With all those American brewpub Pales Ales/India Pale Ales that end-up feeling like hop juice it�s great to find one with such a rich malted body. One of the best APA I�ve had. If Goose Island ever decide to bottle this beer then there�s not doubt in my mind that they will� well� need a label.

Point Spring Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Bottle from Springslicker. Pours a very nice deep copper amber with an off white head. Nice aroma of sugary raisens. Medium to light bodied with a smooth refreshing texture. Flavor of raisens, caramel, and bread with some slight hints of chocolate, Could use a bit more hops to balance it out, as there is a good amount of residual sweetness. Clean finish. Much better than I was expecting. Worth trying.
Point Spring Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Bottle. Pours with a brown body and a two finger head. Aromas are leather and toffee with a bit of a nutty direction. Flavor was pleasant enough, but kind of weak. Had that nice tangy bock flavor and a toffee body.

Point Spring Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Had this beer on 8/6/2005. Aroma is a sweet roasted malt scent. Color is deep amber/brown with good carbonation and a thin head. Taste is rich and sweet. Stating with a bold medium body it goes down with a sweetness comeing on. Finish comes in rich, but not heavy, with a sweet lightly roasted malt flavor and is backed by a mild even bitterness. Overall its very good, a near perfect for Spring. Its bold enough for a cool Spring day and yet refreshing enough for a warm Spring day.
Point Spring Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Bottled. Poured deep reddish-brown with a short, but well-retained cap of off-white head. The aroma picked up well-aged caramel, accented by drier herbal and floral notes.. simple, sweet, and quite alluring. The flavor wasn�t bad by any means, but definitely seemed like it had a whole bunch of simple sugars accenting the toasted caramel at the core.. a little toffee and chocolate sweetness at the edges along with primarily herbal bitterness.. some warm alcohol notes right at the edges and at the finish. Quite tasty. About medium-bodied and syrupy at times on the palate.. nicely balanced. I really enjoyed this.

Coronado Bay Bridge Bock;Coronado, California, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Coronado Brewing Company;"(Draft: Coronado Brewing Co. in San Diego, CA) This is a disappointing pale bock that seems to have all the makings of a decent, true-to-style pale bock, but just comes across as subpar and ""cheap"" tasting; It�s somewhat balanced initially, moderately bitter and hoppy with a sweet, pale malt flavor and prominent alcohol not being shy; But the light maltiness fades and the sweetness really stands out midway through into the finish, and it�s kind of a cheap, sugary sweet; The moderate bitterness remains fairly steady into the finish; Light malty nose; Pale golden color; Light tan head has average retention, fading after a few minutes to a thin sheen that leaves no lacing"

I quite enjoyed it, and I thought it was one of their better brews.

Maumee Bay Fallen Timbers Red Ale;Toledo, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Maumee Bay Brewing Co.;Draft pint at the brewpub.

TwoRows Potrero Summer Ice;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;orpheus is right about the color of this beer being extremely light...jeez. I also noticed the bubbles that clinged to the glass....lots, maybe a dirty glass? It didnt really matter though....I dont think Ive had a beer that tasted as much like water as this beer did.....just nothing there....the only thing going for it is that it wasnt skunky.
TwoRows Potrero Summer Ice;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;"Overall a very bland beer. Kinda suck as it is my 200th! I would rather have had something spectacular, but I ddn't expect them to have a new beer out tonite. Reminds me of Icehouse, but less flavor and therefor easier to drink. The PALEST beer I have ever had, with the LEAST flavor also. I'm not kidding; coors or bud or miller had more flavor than this. Ugh."

Maasland D'n Schele Os Blond;Oss, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Maasland Brouwerij;Bottle at home. Clear golden pour, thin creamy white head. Aroma of pepper, spices, malts, some Belgian yeast and faint sugar. Flavor is strangely absent. Quite creamy texture, full body, but a very empty flavor. A bit like spicy water with lots of carbonation. Strange.

Maasland D'n Schele Os Blond;Oss, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Maasland Brouwerij;Golden ale with a strawberry aroma and light malt. Plain malty taste, without character. Rather average. May 1,2005 at 2nd KBC Festival, Den Bosch, NL.
Maasland D'n Schele Os Blond;Oss, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Maasland Brouwerij;Nice colour, normal head, aroma is kind a sweet, tastes sweetish with a soft bitter finish, i found it better than the trippel, but not really special
Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;Cask in the Market Porter. Alround rating: Noteable sweet, loads of blackcurrent character, very fruity, in good conition with fine carbonation but perhaps a bit overly sweet. Good show.
Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;Cask gravity at Kent BF, Canterbury. Very deep ruby colour, with disappearing tan head. Sour, sour vinegar/old ale aroma. Surprisingly good in mouth and the choc rescues it, then lovely espresso coffee on finish. Terrible aroma, but rest is good. Funnily enough someone else had it 2 days later and it was a lot better.
Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Kent Beer Festival. Black red colour with a nice consitency. Fantastic dark chocolate malt in the nose with some liquorice, coffee and a really pleasing sourness. More roasty in the mouth with an unusual sweet and sour finish.

Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;Cask at Wetherspoons, Milton Keynes. Dark reddish brown with a beige head. Malty aroma. Taste is sweet and fruity with a little chocolate, smoke and ash. Mid bitterness. Rather odd. It tastes quite amateurish, but for some reason I liked it.
Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;cask from the shakespeare�s head, kingsway. Black cherry with an off white head. Nose of roasted malts. Taste to match with bitter nutshell. Sweet finish of treacle syrup. Creamy texture, but thin bodied.
Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;Cask at the Turf Tavern, Oxford. This was the sweetest damn thing I think I�ve ever tasted that didn�t call itself liqueur. No one told me that like everything else in Britain this thing was made with blackcurrant until the fruit started hopping out of the glass to hit me between the eyes, just as the indulgent chocolate flavors and mounds of unfermented sugars had me nearly buried in a hot, sticky mess, ready to be eaten by ants. Quite an unpleasant experience.
Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;"Cask Handpump at The Wellington, Birmingham. Black with a short foamy head. Scent is slightly roasted autumnal berry fruits. In the taste it is very very sweet. Sugar is the predominant aroma (in fact, the notes I made in the pub say ""Mouthful of glucose syrup!""). Otherwise, there is some cranberry, toffee and chocolate here. Not bad if you like sugar! Let down by being quite thin."
Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;Cask (handpump) at the Carlton Arms, Cambridge, May 2006. Very dark, very fruity. I�ve tried a few British dark fruit beers and generally complained that the fruit character is not sufficiently evident. No such criticism here. In fact it leans a bit too far in the other direction for me. The heady fruitiness rather overpowers the stout element making for a beer that is, in one sense, quite delicious but, in another, rather unbalanced. It all ends up just a touch too sweet and sticky. Despite that, I found this beer rather enjoyable.
Beartown Pandamonium;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Stout;Beartown Brewery;Cask at The Carlton Arms during the afternoon break at Cambridge Beer Festival 2006. Black in colour. Strange, overpowering fruity flavour. A lot of flavour in this beer but it doesn�t go together that well.
Faxe Fr�hlingsbock;Faxe, Denmark;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Royal Unibrew;Transferring Old Data - This was a nice pale drinkable Bock on sale in Germany. Smooth taste, not too sweet.
Faxe Fr�hlingsbock;Faxe, Denmark;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Royal Unibrew;Nice amber colour though with a rather small head. Aroma of malt, hops and some caramel. Flavour is bit bitter with toasted malts, little fruity, with a touch of alcohol.
Faxe Fr�hlingsbock;Faxe, Denmark;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Royal Unibrew;(Can 50 cl) Beautiful, deep amber colour without much head. Fresh, floral and hoppy nose. Malty all right but not very sweet, as the bitter hops rule this beer. Exclusively for the German market. 171101
Faxe Fr�hlingsbock;Faxe, Denmark;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Royal Unibrew;There is no Belgian about this beer what so ever. One of the better beers from the otherwise horrible brewery. Too bad it is brewed exclusively for the Germans.
Faxe Fr�hlingsbock;Faxe, Denmark;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Royal Unibrew;nice malty aroma, very very hoppy brew, a bit special, again, for a bock, this is more like a pale ale then a bock
Faxe Fr�hlingsbock;Faxe, Denmark;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Royal Unibrew;Avery nice brew,nice color,Nearly no head at all.The aroma is malty and slightly alcoholic,the taste is some what the same with a faint hint of hops and malty sweetness but the alcohol really comes through in this one,not that,that is bad but it lacks in some of the basic bock flavors,over all i'd say this is a pretty decent bock but just that it needs a little more work to bring it all together.
Faxe Fr�hlingsbock;Faxe, Denmark;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Royal Unibrew;Not Bad, good for a strong beer, smooth and a bit malty. The head, there is no head. The alcaholic taste is there but it is not too strong, it hidesd it better than the Faxe Festbock, and is in general a better brew. I would buy it again.
Meantime Golden;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);bottled, thanks duff. clear golden with a thin white head. aroma of weetbix and tettnanger, full-bodied, light raw sugar sweetness, some metallic bitterness, resembles good german pilsener, but is not as assertive or dry

Sweet start with a long dry bitter finish. Flowery grassy hop taste in aftertaste. Refreshing crisp finish. Nice. Re-Rate: Draught: Less hop presence, more malt there. Reminded me of a soft helles. (Previously 7/4/8/3/14)
Meantime Golden;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottle. Quite a full bodied pilsner. Some rich barley sweetness to start. Nice earthy, dry, grassy, bitter hops in finish. Nice floral hop in the nose and flavour. A nice pils.
Meantime Golden;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottled. Wonderful, clear golden body with a medium, fine white head. Lacy rings followed me to the bottom of the glass. Smooth, satin-like palate, buttery and sweet. Decent amount of bitter hop backs this beer up to give a worth structure and class. I very complete pilsner brewed in the traditional style by Alaister Hook, in Greenwich.
Meantime Golden;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);A clean, crisp and refreshing Pilsener made with Tettnang and Hersbrucker hops. A soft, buttery palate is quickly followed by firm but delicate hop bitterness. Very refreshing and beautifully balanced. [3.1] Re-rate. Tap, Union bar, Greenwich. Sweet malt with long lingering medium bitter finish. Decent lager. Lacks crispness.
Tring Cuckoos Coming;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Bar Fringe, Manchester 12/03/2004 Golden coloured hoppy and crisp on the palate. Creamy slightly dry lasting finish.
Tring Cuckoos Coming;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Sampled on Cask at the Wenlock Arms. Very fine lacey head that trails down the glass to the finish, otherwise no carbonation to speak of. Mild brown colour, with green hue. Sweet musk taste, with full hope flavour. Strong bitter finish that arrives very late and stays with you until the next sip.
Blackawton Humbug;Newton Abbott, Devon, England;Mild Ale;Blackawton;"If the other Blackawton labels were amateurish, this one absolutely takes the cake. Apparently printed on a laserprinter, there was a mistletoe sticker affixed to the front of an otherwise blank label reading ""Humbug"". Murky brown in the glass. Of course, it's what's in the glass that matters and this beer was misleading. Expecting a spiced ale, I got more of a mild ale. Very tame. A lot like their Winter Fuel, but without the sourness."

Magic Hat Ordinary Bitter;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);NERAX '03: Pale straw color with suspended particles. Stale hop aroma, watery body and ends slightly bitter.
Magic Hat Ordinary Bitter;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"They may call this beer a ""bitter"" but from the taste, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Containing considerable hops, this is more of an American Pale Ale, though the brewers might not concede that. Surprised no one else has rated this yet."

Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Had at Clybourn location. Peppery, spicy saison with nice hops and some dryness. Serving: Tap
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A slow haze has settled in my glass, painting her colors in gentle hues of gold, orange, and amber. The greatest concentration is in her head, a confused cloud of white with lacey bubbles scattered along her outer edges. Within awaits an intense confrontation of fruits, skins still attached, spice, and boozy esters. Green grass and pine linger in the background, their leaves and needles weighing heavy under dew droplets. Cinnamon sticks and nutmeg sprinkle, and I find myself right back where I started with drunken fruits. Intriguing, to say the least, and so with great curiosity I investigate the liquid side of my Goose Island Saison. Smooth and buttery, her liquid bounty glides over my tastebuds, leaving behind fruit skins dipped in honey with nutmeg. Sweet up front, her finish is dry from the insides of fruits skins and dead grass. A heavy presence of malt contributes whole loaves of bread to an already full body, along with more honey, caramel, and maple sweetness. If I didn�t know better, I would almost think I was quaffing a Biere de Garde instead of a Saison. Pith and bitter rind lingers long and hard after each quaff, bringing out a dry, woody and leathery quality. The further I quaff, the more elusive her apples, nectarines, and apricots become. With one last quaff, I bring this new tasting session to its first conclusion. Not that great, unfortunately, and definitely not what I would consider a Belgian-style Saison. It reminded me more of a confused Biere de Garde with a Brett-like finish.
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Gold color white head. English malt nose. Nice light, sweet malt flavor. Medium carbonation. Medium full body. Tastes like and esb more than a saison maltry finish lingers. No belgian yeast flavor
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On draft at R & H. Pours a cloudy light orange with a small white head. Aroma of light spice, tea and grass. Taste is grassy with hints of light spice, honey, tea and yeast.
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at RNH. Golden pour with a nice white head. The nose is very bright and spicy. Soft earthy hoppiness along with a light fruitiness. The malts have a kiss of sweetness that is fairly atypical for the style. There is a lot of fruitiness. Less spicy than I would have liked. As it warms there is a pronounced woody Golding/Fuggles woodiness. Not chewy per se, but not dry either. Finishes better than it starts as the hoppiness gives a perception of dryness.
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft. Hazy golden pour. Nothing sticks out in this saison as great, but its a common saison with nothing really wrong with it. Spices, and yeast notes dominate.
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at RNH. Pours a hazy orange with an ok head- nice lace. Aroma is fruity orange zest and peel, juicy, phenolic with spice and clove moderately sweet malts and honey tones. Flavor is fruity orange oil, zesty light citrus hops, crackery malts, toast, ok dry hopping- juiciness to the flavor, peppery and light solvent with good earthy and grassy hops- light spicing on the finish- and moderately dry which was good- pretty nice.
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Rattle. Evengreen, mint, fresh fries, German hops, with a sweetish, very clean, full body. Notes of caramel, lavendar, chalk, and absinthe. Mostly dry, complex, but indistinct. Needs a more interesting yeast.
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft. Pours an orange body with a white head. Citrus, pears, wood, and pepper spices. Cinnamon, fruit esters with a dry floral woody finish. Pine, cedar, light wheat notes. Nice.
Goose Island Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Rattle n Hum: Hazy amber pour with an off white film of head. Sweet plummy aroma- some odd solventy notes as well- a touch of acetone like notes along with sweet dark fruits. The body is fairly light, but it�s lacking the liveliness of good examples. The flavor has some residual Belgian maltose- plummy, brown sugar notes accompanied by some chalky phenolics and other types of dry Belgian phenolics. Not very cohesive, and not dry nor lively enough for the style.
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;Pours a clear golden/yellow with a fizzed out white head. Vegetal and corn aroma, some minute grain, smells almost metallic, paper. Watery corn with grain and alcohol in the flavour department. Vegetal finish. Fizzy, quick finish. They seem to make a lot of these types of lagers in Quebec, and when I see em at a Corner Store in Hull, I�m a sucker for em.
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;341 ml botte purchased to compare and contrast with that masterful cornucopia of hop and malt, Bowes Treebu. Let�s see how this stacks up. A twinge of head and some lace top a mild light gold, clear body...really repellant overcooked asparagus and creamed corn nose, gaaahhh....flavor not nearly as nauseating, moderately sweet, thin, with a somewhat brackish finish...well, the front & middle of the flavor are tolerable, but the rest...pour.
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;Bottle: Aroma is lightly skunk and strong corn syrup diluted in water. Bad enough as it is, it gets really bad when it warms since the corn syrup just gets more discernable. Bad discount beer and not much else to say about that one.
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;CORNE�D. Drank in can. taste like honey and corn. Sweet and it goes down fast. Dry, doesnt leave you anyway taste. Blargg. Not good.
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;Corn adjuncts aroma, pale yellow, pours a finger of white head, some lace. Stale, flat malt taste,thin, unpleasant mouthfeel. Whew!
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;"Pale yellow body topped with a very thin and diminishing bubbly head. Light malty aroma with some corny and bready hints. Mouthfeel is sweet, corny and dry. This is very boring, but not enough bad to figure in the ""Drainpour"" hall of shame."
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;Mildly sweet sugary aroma. Very pale with thin white fully diminishing head. Almost flavourless. Slightly sweet with a hint of hops. Watery thin body. It is actually clean and well-brewed if entirely pointless. Not a drainpour but I�d rather drink real water. Blech.
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;(Bottle) Pours a medium, white head and a straw body. Same fruity Goldings hops as the other two. The water must be good nearby the Bowes brewery because thats all their beer tastes of.
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;Pale yellow color. Nose is lightly fruity with sugary conotations and light grass, i'm reaching. Body is spritzy and sugary with a sweetness ending in a somewhat burntish hop dryness. This rating makes it sound interesting when actually it was quite dismal. That's what you get when you have to write 75 characters.
Bowes Dry Treebu;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;I found this little gem in the deep hart of Montreal. Plane yellow, minimal head, sweet. Sure it was dry, so got not much of any taste. Well the mouthfeel was so offensive, it was lacking any qualities decent beer should have. Great opening for today�s beer session.
Scotch Irish Corporal Punishment (Corporal's Bitter Brown);Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;This beer is obviously a little past its prime, and possibly its rating may reflect a more innocent era in Ontario brewing, but its still a pretty good beer. Pours cloudy brown. Good aroma of hops and some roast malt. Bottle possibly at the last place you can still find this - The Rhino.
Scotch Irish Corporal Punishment (Corporal's Bitter Brown);Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;if i say this is a foamy brew that is an understatement. is red/brown in colour.aromas are malted, caramel, nutty, and there is some vegetable note in there as well. palate is malted, caramel and some leafy finish. it is a bit thin and lack balance.
Scotch Irish Corporal Punishment (Corporal's Bitter Brown);Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Cheers JoeMcPhee. Mahogany colour with a huge frothy white head and lace.

Oostenders Lager Bier;Ichtegem, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Strubbe;Pale golden, airy head. Corn aroma. Medium sweet and fairly soft with some harsh bitterness. Somewhat unclean flavour profile. Tastes like a tropical lager.
Oostenders Lager Bier;Ichtegem, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Strubbe;Clear golden. Slight white head, stable. Nose of coloured (ambr�e) malt, very strange seen its colour, grain, CO2. Very malty taste, pilsner-malt this time in accordance to the genre. Background bitterness, reasonably soft finish. Reasonably full mouthfeel. Not too fizzy. A decent pilsener. I wonder about the kind of fermentation, though
Maasland Gido dn Blije Prater;Oss, Netherlands;Tripel;Maasland Brouwerij;Chunks of yeast floasting, small sustained head. Milky hoppy, slightly citric aroma and flavor. Fairly long bitter finish, somewhat alcoholic.
Maasland Gido dn Blije Buurtbock;Oss, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Maasland Brouwerij;Cherry aroma with a bit of apple vinegar. Caramel flavor with some cherry fruit and a hint of sourness. Hint of woodiness. Not bad, but probably with some mistakes in the brewing process.
Goose Island 21st Amendment Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap, April �03 at Wrigleyville. Deep red color. Seemed to be a english style ale. Lots of hop profile in the nose and flavor. Some fruitiness. Very quaffable beer. This is a great example of why to drink fresh beer.

Nice red/brown color and solid small head. Very malty with a fruity undertone (blackberry?). Taste was sweet but well balanced with the hops cutting through. Same fruity character is noticed on the palate as well, which was a good thing. Finished clean with no bite. Very glad to enjoy this seasonal beer with my friends and family. Among Goose Island's better brews.
Big River Spring Ale;Richmond, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;BRB (Be Right Back - Big River);Cloudy amber,no head.Lightly spiced malt nose.Light malt and coriander flavor.Medium finish.The brewmaster says he is trying to appeal to the movie going crowd ,so this is basically a transition beer
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Appearance: clear medium gold with one finger of rocky ivory head, good retention and patchy lacing. (4/5) Aroma: bready and grainy caramel malt, floral, light grassy and citrus. (6/10) Taste: moderate sweet, moderate bitter. (6/10) Medium body, moderate carbonation, lingering bitter finish. (3/5) A decent ESB, with dominant sweet caramel malt and a mild floral/grassy hop character. Not my favourite style by a long shot, but a decent example of the style regardless. Lingering bitter makes this a little more emphatic than typical for the style, which I appreciate. Solid. (13/20)
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Bottle - Carame and nice hops. Clear gold with a rich white head. Nice spice and Perfumy hops. Solid.
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Sampled this at 5th annual East Kootenay Fairmont beer festival 2016. Not overly Hoppy but a nice ESB
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;On tap at Tin Whistle, pours a hazy golden orange with a small off-white head. Aroma brings out bready malt and floral English hops. Flavour is along the same lines, with bitter floral English hops and biscuity malt. Very floral on the finish. Not overly refined. Meh.
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Bomber. Clear duller orange copper, off-white fading foam. Citric caramel malty aroma. Taste is moderately bitter, quite citrusy, leaner c-malt, slightly floral and herbal. Average carbonation, medium bodied, lightly hopped. LBW (Lagerboys Be Wary)
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;(650ml bottle) Purchased at Liquor Plus (Douglas). I�m proud to say that I got Liquor Plus to bring this ESB in to Victoria. I tried it a few years back at the brewery and was very impressed, it could be one of the best bitters (when fresh) in the province. Pours a large, frothy white head atop a amber body. Good carbonation. Nose is biting with bitter hops and the flavour is well balanced between the hops and malt with bitterness through the finish. A real gem that should be sought after.
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;This is a good North American style ESB. I use the geographical adjective because honestly I�ve yet to have a North American ESB anything similar to an English ESB, the hops take a much larger role here and instead of a berry finish you get a hollow hop pound here, but I like both styles, and this is a good version of what you get here. ie Caramelized citrus.
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;"Bottle from Central City Liquor Store, Surrey Hazy golden color, small head. Aroma of malt, caramel and some vegetables. Caramel flavor, mild, with a hint of cabbage and vegetables again, luckily quite low; correct bitterness. Not bad, but with minor flaws."
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Single bottle purchased from the Tin Whistle Brewery in Pentiction, BC on 07/01/2012. Colour: Medium brown with white creamy head. Nose: Dominant toffee malt and cinnamon spiced hops, in fact smells like a hot fresh cinnamon bun. Taste: Medium sweet, medium-light bitter, medium-light sour. German Backerei fresh roll, burnt-bitter hops mid, toast and jam late. Borderline too sweet for what it is, but still quite drinkable.
Tin Whistle Rattlesnake ESB;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tin Whistle Brewing Company;Sweet, malty, bready aroma with a touch of fruit. Initially the flavors replicate the nose, and then some bitterness emerges. Lots of malt present - caramel and bread - and I find those flavors take over. Especially in the finish. Poor.
Rosengarten Rosengasse-Bier Dinkel;Einsiedeln, Switzerland;Specialty Grain - Other;Rosengarten;"Draught in a pub in Aarau, Switzerland. Labeled as ""Aarauer Altstadtbier"". Probably the same or very similar to the Rosengasse Bier. Also brewed with the usage of spelt and 4.5 ABV aswell. Slightly acidic. Notes of caramel. Mediocre and dissapointing."
Rosengarten Rosengasse-Bier Dinkel;Einsiedeln, Switzerland;Specialty Grain - Other;Rosengarten;Luzern-07. Pours an orange-gold colour with decent white head. Has some nice fruity aroma, and the taste is sweet with very light hop.
Rosengarten Rosengasse-Bier Dinkel;Einsiedeln, Switzerland;Specialty Grain - Other;Rosengarten;"bottle, bought in Weinfelden. Cloudy, dark yellow, large and consistent head. Grainy taste, malty, slightly hoppy; perhaps a bit thin, doesn�t haven an intensive taste."

Speciaalbierbrouwerij Oijen RCN Brammetje;Oijen, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Speciaalbierbrouwerij Oijen;By far the best beer from Oijen. Aroma of forrest fruits and some carbonation. Hazy yellow/golden color, large white head, very good lace. Sweet, very fruity blackberry and bilberry, little yeasty. Long sweet and fruity finish. A fruit beer for sure but not with FRUIT all over it. It's there but subtile.
Batemans Excalibur;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Batemans;Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in October 2001. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear amber in colour with a thin white head. Fruit note of fresh green apple in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a sharp citric note of lime and grapefruit. Strong hop presence with booming lemony notes from the resins in the long aftertaste. Finish is bitter sweet and quite similar to TT Landlord. A good session blond ale.
Batemans Excalibur;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Batemans;Cockney Pub, Aarhus, DK. On tap. Golden with small white head. Aroma of malt and red fruit. Flavor well balanced of malt, fruit and hop bitterness
Batemans Excalibur;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Batemans;1. Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich (JDW) 04/11/2001 Golden coloured and pale. Bitter hop finish. 2. Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich 19/04/2003 Golden colour slightly strong in alcohol. Sour banana flavours. Some bitterness in a hop finish.
Batemans Excalibur;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Batemans;Cask, Maidstone. Another in the increasingly popular Golden style of ales. Typically this has a wheat content - the head foamed up like a soft whip ice cream, and the nose has elements of wheat. The nose is the best part of this rather insipid drink. Lemon, wheat, lily-of-the-valley, rancid bacon fat, raw meat, a butcher's slab, and sweet vomit were among the aromas I picked up. Hugely complex and intriguing nose - though not always pleasant. The colour is of hazy, unpolished brass - and was not inviting. The body and taste is extremely light - somewhat watery, though there is some yellow melon taste. Not impressed.
Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;50cl swing top bottle. A clear reddish brown beer with a huge most good lasting beige head. Aroma of mild caramelish dark malt, some vegetables. Taste of dark caramelish malt, some dark fruits, bread, nuts. Okay!
Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;Dark umber color with a seemingly fizzy tan head. Aromas seem a bit grainy and meaty. Why use those terms? I just fed the dog her Iams Mini Chunks, and this does seem to have a similar scent. Toasted malt, grains, caramel and hints of silage. Thicker feel. Flavors of caramel and mild dark breads. 3/12
Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;W�ssriger, ziemlich stark r�stiger Antrunk.

Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;Pours a deep brown with no head. Aroma of roasted malt and light chocolate. Flavor matches the aroma.
Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;Bottle. Chocolate fudge malt and hay aroma. Cloudy brown with small head. Sweet chocolate malt and hay flavor. Body on the lighter side. Good.
Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;Bottle: Clear, deep caramel-brown with a creamy, light tan head. Dark bread, molasses aroma. Taste is toffee malt, nutty, chocolate malt......creamy. Quite tasty.....though slightly flat.
Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;Bottle poured a clear brown hue w/ medium creamy tan head and minor lacing. Moderate sweet malty aromas. Initial flavor is moderate sweet w/ a faint bitter finish. Tastes are brown sugar, dark breads, molasses, and malt. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel and a dry finish.
Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;Decent dunkel. Aroma was big and delicious. Strong malt backbone with fresh baked bread and caramel. Pour was a hazy dark brown with a thin off white ring for a head. Taste was OK. Heavy roasted malt and caramel flavors with notes of toffee in the finish. Little to no carbonation is what hurt this beer. A little bubbles would�ve taken this beer a long way
Schweinsbr�u Dunkles;Glonn, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrmannsdorfer Schweinsbr�u;This is my third in a row from this brewery and I am quite excited it is not terrible. This one actually smells and tastes like a German beer style. It pours a nice chestnut bronw w/ a fine-bubbled, large but short-lived head. It smells of caramel, cherries and a bit of almond along w/ some alcohol heat, which is strange for a low-gravity brew. This is mildly sweet with mild carbonation, which brings out some more nutty oxidized character. I suspect this may be either old, poorly brewed or mistreated but it actually worked out OK in this particular bottle. I would actually probably buy this again if I had any certainty that this beer actually normally tasted like this and I didn�t just have some random good luck w/ a bottle w/ beneficial oxidation.
Kraftbrau Poetry IPA;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;IPA;Kraftbrau Brewery;My memories are clouded by the un-air conditioned room, the flies, and the sweat in the summer. A plain IPA.
Kraftbrau Poetry IPA;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;IPA;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Nice sweetness to the beer. Grapefruit slightly. The taste is greatly bitter but not overpowering. Not a bad smell (sometimes the Kraftbrau has this). Pale gold in color and quite clear. Very smooth for an IPA. This was very enjoyable. One of the best of this style I think.
Kraftbrau Poetry IPA;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;IPA;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Very piney hop aroma, malt is sweet but dominated by hops, very fresh and made with great care. Good and near great; the Goldings smooth the whole thing out nicely."
Kraftbrau Olde Packing Quilte IPA;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;IPA;Kraftbrau Brewery;A decent English style IPA. Decent balance with nice hop flavor. Rather delicate and easy drinking, this was only one of the beers I had a sample of that was worth drinking in pint form.
Kraftbrau Olde Packing Quilte IPA;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;IPA;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap. What a complex, malty treat, with the most harmonious blending of English hopping and malt I've had in a while. A very flat bitterness, some sweetness, pure coppery English IPA.
Sports City Cafe IPA;La Jolla, California, United States;IPA;CJs Grill and Brewing;"(Draft: Sports City Caf� in SD) Thin, unbalanced, and simply not good; Hoppy and fairly bitter flavor, but it's pretty dry and isn't very malty at all, so this is really hoppy water; As expected, the nose is all hops and is the beer's most redeeming characteristic; The color appears to be amber, but this dump of a restaurant is too dimly lit to tell; Small head is gone completely very quickly"
Sports City Cafe IPA;La Jolla, California, United States;IPA;CJs Grill and Brewing;Dark dirty orange in color with a hazy mysteriousness to it..hop flowers and spicey notes come through in the aroma leading the way to hop resin and hop bud crystals in the flavor with toasted bread notes, grapefruit juice...basically a not-so-balanced hop juice..
Tucks Black Forest Alt;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tuck's Brewery;I was not expecting a hoppy beer when I was told about the background of this beer. Like Jordan said, differences must be a regional thing. Very smooth and rich maltiness and a fairly well balanced beer and pretty easy to drink.
Tucks Black Forest Alt;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tuck's Brewery;On tap at the Tuck�s brewery. Pours a darker red/copper with a medium off-white head. This was a fairly hoppy alt, very nice and smooth. Malts upfront are quick but provide a good base and a touch of sweetness. Floral hops finish this brew off nicely.
Tucks Black Forest Alt;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tuck's Brewery;Max the brewmaster said this was a reproduction of the classic Uerige Alt exactly to the recipe. Dark brown/tawny color with a light aroma of light chocolate malt, a little dry. The pilsner malt is present but is shadowed by the use of some more dominant noble hops. Finishes balanced and traditional. Solid flavors here but not spot on to the Uerige flavors, probably a regional thing.
Tucks Black Forest Alt;Portland, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tuck's Brewery;Quite complex, with a unique taste. You can taste the aging done here, believe it or not. I could certainly drink this again. Excellent hopping.
Oregon Trail Ginseng Porter;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;Draught. Black with medium beige head. I thought this was misnamed and was actually a stout. Spicy aroma, the ginseng comes out. Medium body. A little too much ginseng, but the roast malt struggled nobly. Malty finish with some spice. If you come across this beer, you should taste it
Oregon Trail Ginseng Porter;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;Draft @ KLCC Microbrew Festival: Dark brown pour with a smaller tan head. Aroma is roasty malt and spices. Hint of dandelions. Flavor is roasty and spicey. Lots of florals and herbs goin on here. I think I just figured out I don�t care for the taste of ginseng.
Oregon Trail Ginseng Porter;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;On tap at Olde World Deli in Corvallis, OR--Poured a brown body with a small off-white/beige head.

Large brown head atop deep brown w/ red highlight body. Smoky, roasted coffee, chocolate alcoholic aromas. Creamy body, mocha finish with a little molasses.
Oregon Trail Ginseng Porter;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;This brew pours an opaque black color. The haed is two-fingers in height, and tan in color, but recedes fairly quickly. The aroma is amazing. Chocolate, cream, cookie dough. The taste is great too. It is not huge, but it is flavorful. It is sweet and creamy, but with a nice bitterness that keeps it from being too sweet. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a really good brew.Didn�t notice the Ginseng but thats OK godd brew
Oregon Trail Ginseng Porter;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;A little known stand out at the brew fest, super chocolate nose, black body big tan head, huge mocha flavor, and delightfuly creamy
Oregon Trail Ginseng Porter;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;This was interesting, a slightly sinewy and grainey texture. Great porter flavors, rich and roasty with some coffee creaminess. The ginseng is not really in the flavor profile, but it does give you a little bit of a boost.
Oregon Trail Ginseng Porter;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;Strange yeast smell and flavor. I really don�t pick up any definite ginseng flavor from this beer, but there�s a weird funk in there somewhere, underneath the earthy, gritty, dirty dry malts and burnt bread crust flavors... something like a sour, buttery mold. Grassy in finish and slightly dry. Overall a solid porter, worthy of the many derivatives that this brewery produces from this single brew.
Astoria Shipwreck Stout;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Stout;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Pitch black, impenetrable. A short 1/2 finger of rusty-vanilla cream head. Light sweetness of baker�s chocolate and a non-descript coffee roast. Fair strength. Shows off a rich, deep roast coffee bean and a dark cacao. Thick grain, toasted/burnt and borderline �molasses�, though not nearly as sweet. Creamy� and �smooth�, a wonderfully velvety texture that builds a slight Booziness / heat with each sip. Nice.
Astoria Shipwreck Stout;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Stout;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Very good roasted flavor. Starts as a oatmeal cream stout, but finishes bitter and coffee-esque. Not the heaviest body.
Astoria Shipwreck Stout;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Stout;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);This is a solid sweet stout, that never gets out of control. Remains well balanced and does not get too sweet or overly roasty. Nice chocolate and hearty maltiness, this is rich and creamy on the palate.
Astoria Shipwreck Stout;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Stout;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Dark as a night at sea with an unfading, frothy chocolate head. Dark malt roasted aroma and a very smoth roast malt flavor with a finish carrying minimal bitterness. A hearty oatmeal stout.

Astoria Shipwreck Stout;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Stout;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Dark brown, medium-bodied, which is kinda light for a stout. A little bourbon and smoke in the aroma, some roasted malt flavor, regular coffee flavors with some bourbon would be my guess.

Red Rock Oatmeal Stout;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Red Rock Brewing;Draft at the brewery. Pours like a thick headed dry stout on nitro: almost black with a khaki head of tiny bubbles. Faint aroma of roasted malt and coffee. Flavor is bitter chocolate and espresso. Good but I wonder if it�s not miscategorized: should be a dry stout instead.
Red Rock Oatmeal Stout;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Red Rock Brewing;Chocolate-y roast, sweet malt aroma. Creamy head. Roasty, chocolate malty flavor, followed by caramel sweetness.

Red Rock Oatmeal Stout;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Red Rock Brewing;Had on draft at the brewery. The aroma is strongly, butter, lactic acid, and roasted malts.

Red Rock English Mild;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Mild Ale;Red Rock Brewing;On tap at the brewery pours golden topped with a white head. Nose is light grain some wood notes. Taste is more of the light grain notes and a little touch of leaf hops.

Red Rock English Mild;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Mild Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Poured from the nitro tap a golden amber color with a tall, thick head that sticks around to the end. The nose had some biscuit and just the slightest hint of hops. The flavor started bready and creamy with an ever-so-slight piney bite. The finish had a very dry and creamy texture, due to the nitro pour. The feel is really creamy and awesome. This wasn�t Red Rock�s best, but it was a nice, enjoyable offering.
Red Rock English Mild;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Mild Ale;Red Rock Brewing;pours a dissipating white head and gold color. Aroma is mild roasty medium malt-caramel. Taste is mild roasty medium malt-caramel, faint earthy hops. Mellow. Mild carbonation.
Red Rock English Mild;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Mild Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Clear golden beer (huh?) Light UK-type bready malt aroma with little in the way of hops. The flavour is decent, but there is a strange noble hop herbal character that doesn�t really have any place in a mild. It�s enjoyable enough, but it isn�t a mild.
Red Rock English Mild;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Mild Ale;Red Rock Brewing;(draft at brewpub) Light amber with generous eggshell head. Mild malt aoma. Buscuit malt flavor with a pine hops finish.

Red Rock Hefeweizen;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Red Rock Brewing;On tap at the SLC BP. Foggy pale straw color. This is more of an American wheat. Lacking any of the hermanyeast flavors. Mild smooth light wheat beer. Not bad

Red Rock Hefeweizen;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Red Rock Brewing;On tap at the brewery pours out a cloudy golden topped with a white head. Nose is some citrus notes and a wheat grain note. Taste is more of the lemon citrus notes along with a wheat dough malt.
Red Rock Hefeweizen;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Red Rock Brewing;Sample 1/4 at Red Rock Brewing Co., Salt Lake City. Pours hazy yellow with a small, off-white head. The aroma contains citrus, wheat, yeast, some dough and hops (so no banana or clove). It tastes light yeasty sour and medium hoppy bitter. Medium body, slick texture, fizzy carbonation. The aroma wasn�t bad but it lacks the Hefeweizen characteristics. Too thin on the tongue.

Red Rock Hefeweizen;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Red Rock Brewing;On tap @ Red Rock. Served with a lemon, so negative cred. Hazed golden pour with white foam. Lemony and zesty orange with a lot of raw dough. Sweet bread, some hint of grassy hops, and maybe a touch of spice. The flavor pretty much follows with mostly sweet malt, some tangy citrus, and a light spicy and earthy bitterness. It�s not bad, but not really what I look for in a Hefeweizen.

Red Rock Hefeweizen;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Red Rock Brewing;On tap at Red Rock in SLC. Poured a lightly hazy gold, decent head. Aroma was lightly of wheat, a touch of lemon. Flavor was a match. Really wanted to find a bit more of a kick of wheat, or some yeast phenolics, or yeast esters, or really any flavor, but it just wasn�t here. A nice enough lawnmower wheat, but not special.
Wickwar Coopers WPA;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;"Cask at The Mermaid, St Albans on 28 September.

Wickwar Coopers WPA;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;Sampled this ale in the Pommelers Rest, London (JDW) in July 2008. Cask, handpump dispense. Pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight dusty hop in the aroma but hard to detect. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a digestive biscuit base with dry woody redcurrant fruit flavour. Prickle of spicy hop resins in the bitter aftertaste. Finish is dry and bitter with gooseberry slins tart in the mouth. An ok session ale but nothing outstanding.

Raccoon Lodge Bombay IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Brewing;"Tried this at the brewery in June 2003 when they tapped the last of 4 casks designed to recreate an ""authentic"" IPA by mimmicking the 4 mouth travel from Britain to India. They tricked me into going to the brewery by advertising it as a cask ale. What they did was advertise and hype the cask aging, but then just serve it from a regular keg. Not very authentic. On to the rating: Murky amber orange hue. Aroma of apples, sugar, and sweet caramel. Not too hoppy, more just a sugar-sweetness with some mild fruit. Good balanced hop profile overall, but muddled by the grainy-sugar feel. Roasted coffee undertones in the finish along with some nuts, most likely some taste produced by the cask. Musty finish, like an old dusty attic. I agree with portlandrunk that this would be better after a little while."
Raccoon Lodge Bombay IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Brewing;Not huge and hoppy like many west coast IPA�s. This beer is going for a more balanced taste, with a nice round and pleasant hop taste that lasts through the finish. This could become something special with aging.
Wild Duck Chocolate X-presso Milk Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;Wild Duck Brewery;Well, the name had me pumped up. It sounds like it should be amazing. And it is good, but still somewhat of a letdown... Very smooth light chocolately taste.
Wild Duck Chocolate X-presso Milk Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;Wild Duck Brewery;(gabf'03) After the first sip hit the tongue, I had to wonder if the expresso oxidized a bit as the taste was like day old coffee from 7-Eleven. Without the chocolate doughnuts. I can only hope that this keg fell off the back of the truck on the way to GABF.
Wild Duck Chocolate X-presso Milk Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;Wild Duck Brewery;Dense Nitro hesd, beatiful belgian lace. cocoa, espresso, milk and burnt malts. thin andclassic nitro feel (frown)roastey and chocolatey finish, too thin though.
Wild Duck Chocolate X-presso Milk Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;Wild Duck Brewery;You walk into Widmer, carefully hiding a Rogue Chocolate stout under your jacket. You proceed to order a Collaborator Milk Stout, and drain half of it. Then, in one deft move, you open the Rogue and pour it into your pint glass of Milk Stout. You then take a drink.....and you're almost half way to how awesome this beer is. Huge presence of chocolate, coffee, and milk. The milkiness helps to hold up the great malt character. Incredibly flavorful. By far the best beer I had at the Spring Beer and Wine Fest here in Portland. A worthy beer for my 400th!!
Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Medium gold color. Brief white head. Slightly sweet malt aroma. Gassy, bittersweet malt flavor. Brief finish.
Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;9 Jan 2015, bottle. no date on bottle or package. guy who gave me the 6-pack said it was from 1978 or 1979. Bottle didn�t fizz when i opened it. murky brown with lots of black sediment. nose is molasses and nuts, actually not as bad as i expected, i just don�t know if that�s what it was supposed to taste like 30 years ago. thin body and flat. tastes like sweet molasses bread. honestly can�t bring myself to drink more than a sip because it looks so nasty and it�s so old. Probably not fair to rate a 30 year old beer but oh well.
Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;"In the back of Bob�s fridge I spotted this gem. He says: ""that�s at least 15 years old!"" I feared the worst. But after scratching off the protective foil (it was not scratch and sniff) I was feeling much better about my selection. And actually this stuff was pretty tasty! Held up, yeah it had a few off tastes, but with the bottle + scratch off appearance is a 10. Well I can only give 5/5. Proud to be the 1st rater since 2011."
Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;(12oz bottle from some unknown 1980�s vintage, thanks to the planet�s best Pale Lager distro guy, Fratto) opaque, no carbonation, looks bad already. Nose of a cedar shoe tree, alcohol, marshmallow, sake, and rice. WTF is this? Taste is bland, rice, watery, bit of mild sweetness, nothing truly offensive, just very weird. The scratch off bra to reveal a topless girl was simply icing on the cake.
Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;12oz bottle-thanks jtclockwork for trading-pours a white head and gold color. Aroma is apple, corn, fruit. Taste is apple vinegar, cereal.
Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;(12oz bottle, from Fratto) Pours a clear yellow body with a small white head. Aroma of cardboard, grain, and minerals. Flavor of dirt, grain, plastic, and light chemical.

Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bottle from jtclockwork, who gave it to drowland, who shipped it to Cavie to give to me. Thick, light pour with a little white head. Aroma is crazy. Sweet, grass. I don�t even know. Taste is syrupy, indoor Christmas light is July, dusty beer tins from the 80s, and used condoms. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.
Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bottle from...are you ready? From jtclockwork who gave it to drowland who mailed it to cavie who gave it to Fratto who brought it to bu11zeyes for a tasting. Hell yeah. Bra intact. Pours slightly hazy light gold color. Ring of white head. Not much carbonation. Aroma is play-doh, stage dust, lip stick and single mothers working their way through college. Uh. Bad taste with latex, burnt barbecue crust, and other nastiness. This is awful! Very flat feeling too. But it�s got tits! (5 for appearance!!)
Nude Beer;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;2/22/11. Bottle (a gem, seriously!) with thanks to jtclockwork! Weird hazy brown pour with basically no head (even when poured vigorously) that looks like a glass of apple cider. And what do you know, a huge burst of appley aroma hits me before I even lean in for a whiff, followed with corn, fusels, and burnt caramel upon further inspection. Sweet corny, burnt apple metal disgusting flavor. Bleeeeech, but glad to have tried it. Pissed that I couldn�t get the bra off, no matter what I tried (story of my life)! Hot blonde, too!

Asda Gentleman Jack;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Asda (Wal Mart);Bottle from Tesco... only kidding! Poured a hazy medium amber with a frothy white head.

Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Very refreshing on a hot day. You quickly forget it�s n/a. The color and pallets are spot on. Aroma and flavor are very light, as expected. Good beer to enjoy when on a ride or drive.
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 oz can. Clear pale gold pour with a white head and poor retention. No lacing. Very bubbly. Grainy pale lager very light beer flavor. More beer-like look and taste than the other NA�s I�ve tried, but that�s not saying much.
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Worst of the NA beers I�ve since I�ve started this. Not much aroma. Just a few metallic notes. Pour was a light clear gold with no head and a few rising bubbles. Taste was pretty bad. Oddly floral with just carbonated water in the finish. Medium carbonation.
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Very light corn syrup aroma. Yellow gold with a large white head. Very, very light watered down sweet malt flavor. Light body, moderate carbonation.
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Slightly skunky barley malt aroma. Yellow with moderate head. Mildly sweet barley malt flavor with a hint of herbal bitterness. Not horrible - would drink this again (if I got stuck back in Iraq).
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Clear....pale gold..cottony white head. Virtually no scent save water... Taste..(?) also essentially non-existent.... Cornflakes and water... Perhaps the least offensive of the NA�s out there.
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"From the files: it�s gold, it�s crappy, it pretends to be beer. Not sure the purpose of this ""beer"" at all."
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);From can no. 0610-R-10:25. It pours straw yellow with busy carbonation and a quickly fizzling white head. The aroma is more like malt-flavored water. The mouthfeel is thin like water. The taste is vaguely grainy, thinly malted but otherwise generally flavorless. But it�s an NA so I did not expect much else.
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Gold and fizzy beer with some appley hints, earthy, some creamy caramelly hints. Weird beer.
Genesee NA;Rochester, New York, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Very pale. The tap water here (Sarasota) stinks of chlorine; this has no aroma at all, period. It�s like I�m selling a black hole. Fizzy, a bit worty, hugely watery. This barely looks like beer, much less tastes of it. I would, however, drink this over a Pepsi, as there�s not enough in here to offend."
Fuller's Vintage Ale 1997;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Bottle #47403. 550ml. Open: small hiss, no frothing Pour: thick, good head Nose: raisins! Appearance: cloudy Taste: still thick, dried fruits, figs, Christmas cake, hint of orange, still sufficient carbonation A sublime beer even after 21 years in the bottle. Thoroughly enjoyable.
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);OLD NOTES I really don�t know why they bothered, some genius at work in the marketing department there obviously. It doesn�t taste much different from Colds at all, infact, it�s worse! (How is that even possible!?) It is also my belief that a shot of vodka is 1 standard drink, which means this beer should be around 8%. Who are they appealing to!?
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);bottle. I had this when it was made and justing rating it for my records, all i remember was that it was bloody awful.
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Got heaps of free bottles of this rubbish at a uni function... Not much can be said really, its got all the nasty vegetables of carlton cold, as well as a awful cheap wine note that I�ll assume comes from the vodka. Its pale, hardly has any head... nothing good to say about this except that its no longer produced.
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Dark Yellow in colouring with a small white head that disappears almost as soon as you pour it. Brew is clear and crisp, but the tasted like a bad decaying flat beer. I love my Vodka - and I suppose there was not enough of in it ... or maybe there was too much of it, which killed the flavour factor. Very disappointing.
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Beer AND vodka.. what more could any reasonable alcho want? A fantastic drop, but rather expensive.
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I found this one in a small pub in the Dandenongs last weekend and it was not worth anything except the fact that it wont be found again. At least it shows that CUB has feeling. They Knew it was bad all along. No taste, not feel, no palate, no flavour. Why produce it in the first place?
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);They have stopped making these. Got the last 1 at Catalina Country Club. Wasnt the worst beer ever, probably a good way to get drunk faster while still drinking beer. Overall, tastes like a flat coldy.
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);a dry pilsner with a vodka infusion, gimmick all the way, not worth your time or money.
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I always thought carlton cold was crap so why did they bother making this one. They ended up giving the stuff away free with a case of carlton cold. Haven't had a decent beer from CUB.
Carlton Cold Shot;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Tastes like beer with vodka, why they ever released this is beyond me. Carlton cold just made worse.

Frohsinn Dunkel;Arbon, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Frohsinn;A great beer. It's sweet and tastes something like Palm from Belgium........
Restorffs V�kingur;Torshavn, Faroe Islands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Restorffs Bryggjar�;This is a light lager and therefore the very light taste to it. Ok golden colour. No head. strange aroma. Has a weird metallic taste to it. I usually buy one every time I go home just to support this small struggling brewery.
Restorffs V�kingur;Torshavn, Faroe Islands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Restorffs Bryggjar�;Definately not a beer for vikings, but an ordinary Danish-style pilsener. The finish is somewhat metallic.
Restorffs V�kingur;Torshavn, Faroe Islands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Restorffs Bryggjar�;Quite weak beer. Not much Viking strengh over this brew. It gets pretty sickening as you work your way through the bottle.
Hopdaemon Golden Braid;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Cask at the Padwell Arms. Pale golden pour with a thin white head. The nose is quite lovely.

Hopdaemon Golden Braid;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Cask at the Baring Hall Hotel, Grove Park. Gold pour with a white head. Light malt aromas with a splash of wet moss and vanilla. Christ, I wish I could make out my spider writing, according to my notes the aroma was vanilla, light citrus and dusty keys. That�s me baby, one of the pioneers of weird noses! Haven�t written much else about this one.... probably confused myself with the dusty keys reference.... or is that an �h� there...could be �hops�.. enough!!
Hopdaemon Golden Braid;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Cask@Baring Hall Hotel, Grove Park - golden pour with a small to medium creamy persistent white head and lacing. Fruity citrus hoppy, sweet bready malts, nice floral notes, easy drinking and refreshing with good medium bitter finish. More of a golden ale than bitter to me, and a good one at that.

Hopdaemon Golden Braid;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Cask (GBBF2011) Simple malty aroma - honewy there for sure. Lovely light malts and a great EKG bitter and aromatic combo - yum! Rerate: Cask (Dolphin, Canterbury) (6:3:6+:4:13=3.2+) Pretty tasty bitter. Tight head, but it wasn�t through a sparkler. Nice dry bitter bite. Long tingly finish. Full palate, nice roast.
Hopdaemon Golden Braid;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;August 12, 2011 - cask at The Harp (Chados Place). Light amber-gold with an average creamy/frothy mottled white/off-white head. Solid light, wheaty grain overlaid by pungently floral bitterness, no alcohol, dry and a bit grassy and oily - taste follows, very much a generously hopped golden ale, on the grassy/floral side of things. Average body, mild carbonation, a long dry pungent floral finish - a very, very good golden ale, would gladly have another pint or two of this one again.

D�m Vi��ov�;Prague, Czech Republic;Flavored - Fruit;Pivovarsk� D�m;Keg at Pivovarsky Dum, Prague. Clear, deep amber. Aroma of cherry sweets, candy sugar and some biscuity grain. Flavour is a straight up hit of cherries, and not really the genuine kind. Finish is a tad metallic.

Troutbrook Raspberry Blonde Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;A good beer, with a decent head and skunky smell. A nice taste, very smooth and easy going, definitly worth a taste.
Troutbrook Raspberry Blonde Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;A very interesting beer. Sort of a cross between a Framboise and a Brown Ale. It was very well done. Raspberries evident, but not overly so. Tastes of caramel, perhaps fom the candi sugar. I'm not sure how long this will be around, but it is worth checking out!
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);On draft @2SP. Pour was deep orange, weak head for the style, really the only knock on this one and somewhat unfair as a pour is just that, a single pour and subject to variability. Aroma was smokey meats, some tabacco. Flavor was richly smokey, earthy, caramel, tobacco, toasted grains. Body was moderate to full but dry and smooth to drink. A phenomenal Rauch. I�ve had the best here, I�ve had them in Bamberg, and this was among the best in the world, definitely the best stateside Rauch for sure. Great job, Victory!
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"""this version was a smoked oktoberfest, and it worked quite nicely! while not the best one we had that day, it was quite memorable. great balance in the aroma and flavor. the smoke was apparent, but not overpowering, and lended a level of complexity to an already good beer."""
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);May 3rd, 2012 - Victory�s innovating flavors and palates with this one, their Scarlet Fire Ruachbier. To memory, my only other Rauchbier is a very German affair, and the style hit me like a smoked ham square in the face. Victory�s rauch is lighter, hinting at smoked meats with a slight smoke in the aroma, a drizzle of dark caramel, and the nostalgic scent of smoked almonds (always on the table at our house during Christmas time for some reason.) The smoky almond flavor defines the flavor too. Also of note is the absence of the smoked meats or smoked pork that I was expecting given previous experiences. This is not better or worse, per se, but it�s like discovering a family branch of flavors though they all have the same family name.
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);In short: A clean golden lager with good smoke. Straightforward but effective. Solid. How: Tap at Parker Pie, West Glover VT. The look: Clear dark golden body topped by a small off-white leaving lots of lacings on the glass. In long: Nose has a good smoke presence, not quite Schlenkerla-intenisty but still more smoky than most examples of the style. Smoke character is mostly campfire with also notes of smoked ham. In mouth the beer offers a clean mouthfeel, slick-juicy texture supported by a comfortable carbonation of very soft bubbles. Taste is simple and effective. Toasted cereals that feel oily. The smoke presence is toned-down compared to the aroma and the smoke character evokes smoked meat. Hops manage to pierce through more than in most smoked beers and they have a leafy/tobacco character. A relatively dry finish with round bitterness going along very well with the smoke. Nothing groundbreaking here, a rather straightforward beer, but really gets the job done. That�s my 35th rating I enter today, I need to get some work done now, how do I pause ratebeer?
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);On tap pours a reddish brown color with a small head. Notes of heavy smoke, woodshop, and some earthy grains.
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);(Draught) Pours a lightly hazy amber-brown body with a moderate off-white head. Aroma of smoke, baseball card bubble gum, and caramel. Flavor of smoke, minerals, caramel, charred grain, and light fruit.
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);On tap at Capone�s. Pours a clear golden orange with a huge whitish head that recedes slowly with moderate lacing and good retention. The aroma is a fresh smokehouse, with biscuity malts that provide a nice complement to the smokiness. Taste is smokey up front with a caramel malt backbone. Notes of lemon with grassy hops and a touch of citrus along with grainy hay lies in the finish and seems to linger a bit with the smoke. Medium body, smooth, moderate fizzy carbonation.
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);My Bottom Line: Beechwood smoke evokes bacon bits at times, while mild oranges diversify this compelling, very drinkable Rauchbier. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam covers the misty amber. -The flavor profile is exactly what the aroma had suggested. -The mouthfeel is smooth, not too dry, not too sweet. -This is pretty authentic a Rauchbier. Makes me want to return to Franconia yet again! On tap at Parker Pie, Vermont.
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Rated at Big Texas Beer Fest, April 2013 - Light amber in color with a small off-white head. Aroma is of smoked ham, light honey and caramel. Taste is of leather, ham bone and hickory smoke.
Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Maybe the best American rauchbier I?ve had. Lots of flavor behind the smoke. Not as bacony as Aecht Schlenkerla, which is fine. Crisper than some of the American attempts at the style.

John Harvards Abbey Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);2004 draught (Framingham) To my surprise when I ordered this, they presented a light rosy peach-soft amber colored beer with a small fleeting white head. Hmmm. Aroma was light, fruity (orange, melon, peaches, mangos, tangerines) and had some honey sweetness with apparent light belgian yeast. Flavor, though not what I think of for an Abbey Dubbel, was very good. Honey, peaches, apricots, fluffy sweet yeast, and lots of bubble gum esters. Hints of a touch of clove and cinnamon, but this is dominated by the lightly fruity, bubblegummy esters. Medium body which didnt thin out. This one is really just a belgian amber with some light wit bier suggestions. I dont think they tried to brew a dubbel.
John Harvards Abbey Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Very watery body, but it tried to get the dubbel spices right. It's too bad. Too malty and sweet for my taste. Dark reddish brown body with a quickly fading head.

Hacker-Pschorr Sternweisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.5%. Good sized, good-duration head. Slight banana yeast and dark malt aroma, shades of a Belgian ale. Cloudy, near-opaque toffee colour. Moderate carbonation. Interesting hops, melon, a spritz of orange juice, and banana - lots of fruit here helped by the yeast, and a nondescript but serviceable wheat malt, with a toffee dunkel malt hiding alongside - if you want to taste it though, have your beer warm up somewhat - 13 degrees celsius at a guess - and you'll get a lovely lingering toffee aftertaste. The same advice goes for Ayinger's Urweisse, and probably most dunkelweizens - feel free to start out colder for a more light and airy taste, but make sure to let them warm as you sup to get the full experience. Balanced body, a touch of foam but also a touch of thinner-than-usual for weissbier juicy mouthfeel in the middle of it all. Hacker-Pschorr manage to combine familiar flavours in unique and interesting ways, and this beer is an example of just that. Well worth sampling.
Hacker-Pschorr Sternweisse;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle in 2016. Hazy orange with a thin white head.

Hacker-Pschorr N�hrbier;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Somehow they managed to remove all taste, even the sweetness from a 12.3 plato wort - how did they do that?. Only very slight colormalt burned taste and cardboard. According to the ingredient list the N�hrbier contains hops, but i think this is more like a handfull of hops shown to the wort as is passed on its way to the fermentation tank...

Oily to viscous texture, smooth and soft palate, fine and gentle, but efficacious carbonation. Not as brute as some US Impy Stouts, but equally rich and deep, very balanced, harmonious. Very good."
Old Chimneys Good King Henry;Diss, Suffolk, England;Stout - Imperial;Old Chimneys Brewery;(Bag-in-box at De Drie Dorstige Herten, Utrecht, 14 Feb 2019) Black colour with brief bubbly head. Malty, roasted, slightly vinous nose with notes of coffee, dark chocolate, liquorice and a touch of soy sauce. Malty, roasted, vinous taste with dark chocolate, cacao, liquorice, soy sauce, oak wood, hints of red wine and a balanced cacao bitterness in the finish. Full body, with a certain sweetness. Really tasty and well balanced. Suspect that this was aged in wine barrels (possibly a separate entry, but I'll leave it here for now). Excellent stuff.

Aroma's: tar-ish, sweetish, roasted. Retronasal: roasted, sweetish, a bit red fruit, woody. Flavour: light moderate sweet with some tarry bitterness. Medium bodied. Low & soft carbonation.

Chicago Springfest Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Chicago Brewing Company;I had this beer a while back and from what I can remember I enjoyed it. I�ve had this at the pub/brewery so it was fresh. Nothing special about it is popping into my head at the moment.
Chicago Springfest Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Chicago Brewing Company;Very clear golden color with nice white head. Taste was mild spices, orange peel, and a mild sweetness. Aroma was mild spice and not much else. Medium body. Overall decent.
Chicago Springfest Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Chicago Brewing Company;Pours a light golden amber color. Aromas of orange, clove, ginger, nutmeg.

Chicago Springfest Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Chicago Brewing Company;Pours a hazy yellow with thin white head. Aroma is yeast (almost Belgian) and coriander. Flavor is light malt, orange and coriander. Light and refreshing. Doesn�t taste like a lager (and I mean that as a compliment). Nice session beer.
Chicago Springfest Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Chicago Brewing Company;server said it tasted like blue moon at 5.4%... pours just slightly hazy yellow with a lasting white ring and some drippy lace. it smells and tastes of dusty earthy coriander, grain and oranges. it is a bit perfumy at times and finishes with a little kick of tartness and spice. the medium body has a bit of richness and creaminess on the tongue. not bad...6/3/6/3/12/3.0

Chicago Springfest Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Chicago Brewing Company;"Part of my sampler tray. It was labelled ""Seasonal #1"", so I had to ask what it was and was surprised to find it a ""Springfest Lager"" when we were at the very end of summer! Anyway, clear light golden yellow. Faintly fruity, clean grains, crisp finish. Before seeing this on the website I pegged it as a slightly fruity version of a pale lager, almost Kolsch-like, but less assertive. Maybe my palate is worn out at this stage!"
Oaken Barrel Cream Stout;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Stout;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;Sampled this on nitro. Liked it so much, I had to get a growler. Pours a nice creamy black with a tan head. Aroma is burnt roast and coffee. Flavor is burnt coffee, chocolate, toffee, and lots of cream. Very creamy on the palate as well. Almost like coffee chocolate milk. This is delicious.
Oaken Barrel Cream Stout;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Stout;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;"Dark! Possibly the darkest beer in appearance I�ve seen. Creamy large head that follows the beer down the glass as you drink and leaves a beautiful heavy stratisfied lace. A hint of soy sauce in the aroma. Distinct burnt coffee taste. An after taste that hits the entire mouth like a wave. Milk like palette and texture that is very smooth. A very good beer & definetely Oaken Barrel�s finest to date. I couldn�t find any info on this beer on their web page and the brew meister gave a vague ""about 6% ABV"" answer to my ABV inquiry."

Pours gold with a bright white half finger head. Nose is decent and light. Taste is sweet and decent with a nice after taste.
McMenamins Concordia Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Pours orange with a small white head. Fruity hop nose, citrus and grapefruit finish.Hops were the focus, but it wasn�t overly bitter. Pretty solid pale, not watery, but floral and sessionable.

Dag Select Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Well, I was shopping for brie and a nice olive tapenade today when I stumbled across this D'Agostino Select Lager Beer and just had to give it a shot. In fairness, this is by the same brewery that gives us the AWESOME Stegmaier Porter, so how bad can it be. To Lion's credit, this beer isn't overly fizzy and isn't even all that dry. While it's no Czechvar when it comes to flavor and the use of Saaz hops, it's nonetheless respectable and drinkable. In short, you could sure do a LOT worse. Tastewise, there really isn't much to say except it has no discernible hops and smells slightly funky (just a bit).
Dag Select Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Run of the mill lager - nothing offensive. Pale in appearance, wet paper bag aroma. Sours near the end. Overall, drinkable - but nothing to write home about.
Dag Select Lager;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;I bought this because I figured I'd never see it again. It started out with an OK aroma, since it was the first beer of the day, but it ended up pretty lame. Generic label, generic gold lager. Fairly dry, fizzy and a tad on the watery side. Moderately bitter finish. Nothing offensive, nothing stellar.
Monteiths Dortmunder Bier;Greymouth, New Zealand;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Golden in colour, yeasty flavour but comes back spicey. Nice Autum drinking but not one of the better Monteiths seasonals.
Oud Beersel Oude Lambik;Beersel, Belgium;Lambic - Unblended Jonge / Oude;Brouwerij Oud Beersel;Aroma with fruits notes, a bit straw. Pale, straw color a bit haze without head.

Hazy amber-orange body with a tiny, thin but lasting bubbly white head. Interesting aroma... orange, hay, funk, woody touches, sweetish. Balanced and drinkable taste, glue, hay, salty touches, orange? and better than the sum of its parts. Sweetish and tart, more so than many other old lambics. Elegant stuff!
Oud Beersel Oude Lambik;Beersel, Belgium;Lambic - Unblended Jonge / Oude;Brouwerij Oud Beersel;On tap at Weekend der Spontane Gisting, Opstal, Belgium. Shared with lovely Anja. Murky dirty golden, minimal head. Aroma is yeasty, funky, fruity, apricot, ripe apple. Yeasty, metallic, soft grainy, light acidity in flavour. Light to a medium body, soft to a moderate carbonation. Slightly sour finish. Nice, although lacks complexity.
Three Needs English Bitter;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Semi-clear dark orange/light ruby, no head. Nose pretty indistinct, a bit of pine tar maybe. Smooth, mild, nice hints of hops, little fruitiness, dry and light at the end. I guess this is the ""ordinary"" to the pub's other bitter, and ESB."
Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;Old review from summer of 2006. Light brown with some fizzy bubbles. The aroma is sweet and really malty with some fruit like plums or something. The flavour is sweet and malty as well, caramel and maybe toffee. I�m not a fan of this brew - seems thin yet thick. Glad It�s gone.
Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;Clear brown with a ruby hue, and a thin dissipating off white head. Nice nutty malt aroma, a bit woody. In mouth, sweet nutty malt, with some smokey notes, but rather thin and short in mouth. Maibock for the mass. Merci, JM.

Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;Pours a dark copper colour with not much of a head. Light malt aroma as well as some caramel. The taste was somewhat malty, kinda thin mouthfeel. Average.
Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;A surprislngly dark brew but lacking in flavor. Some caramel/molasses traces but they were overshadowed by carbonation and a strong aftertaste that was present. A nice change from stout and cream ales but overall tastes like a lager with color added. Still love Big Rock despite this one. (I believe its a seasonal beer anyway!)
Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;Not a Mai bock! It would work better as a traditional bock due to color and slight roast and carmel over-tones This said it is a pretty tasty beer and offers a nice escape from the western Canadaian blandness in most offerings
Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;Medium red-tinged brown colour. Aroma is fruity (plums), tobaccoey and molassesy. Body is moderate (so, light for style), malty (hints of caramel and earth). Fruity overtones are distracting. But I don�t think it�s esters, just the way the malt comes across, possibly a function of what appears to be light oxidation.
Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;Malty and a little sweet. No discernable hops. Slight rumminess and as it warms the malt profile becomes more interesting.
Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;Hazy brown (maple syrup) colour with a tight white head that�s gone in a flash. Pretty high carbonation I thought. Aroma is of alcohol with resiny wood tones. Flavour is thin and subdued. Slight olive tones in flavour with a mild alcohol finish.
Big Rock Maibock;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Big Rock Brewery;Deep brown with a light ruby tint. Thin fast-fading light brown head. Sweet malty aromas of brown sugar, and a touch of nuttiness. Flavour is lightly sweet, malt accented, caramel and toffee with a bit of toastiness. Just enough bitterness to balance. Well made.
Sly Fox Instigator Doppelbock;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Goat races, 2014. Fruity and bread aroma, a tad weak. Dark amber in color. The flavor is fruity, bread, not sweet, not very inspiring. Medium in body, weak for the style. A tad sweet on the finish, vague noble hops. Meh.
Sly Fox Instigator Doppelbock;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sly Fox Brewing Company;On draft at the Mad Fox Maibock Festival 2014. Pours a clear cola brown with an ecru head. Roasted nuts in the nose. Flavors tend to the sweet side, with raisin and caramel. Medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Slight sweet finish with some lingering roasty notes.

Sly Fox Instigator Doppelbock;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sly Fox Brewing Company;translucent red-chestnut, thin white head.

Sly Fox Instigator Doppelbock;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sly Fox Brewing Company;On tap at brewhouse. Pours dark reddish brown with foamy tan head. Aromas of plums, fig, caramel, toast. Smooth, full bodied. Quite sweet. Very nice.
Sly Fox Instigator Doppelbock;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sly Fox Brewing Company;On tap at Bock Fest. Very dark brown pour with a fluffy inch or so of mocha colored head. Aroma has some strong notes of dark fruits, definitely plums. Also ripe with typical doppelbock scents, toffee, caramel, nuts, roast. Flavor has pretty much all the same characteristics of the aroma. A hint of chocolate, definitely on the sweet side, a vague suggestion of raisins on the finish. Not any alcohol flavor or burn that I could discern, even as it warmed close to room temperature. Clean, full bodied beer that flows down surprisingly easily. Awesome beer. Makes me wish they had a bock fest every week.
Sly Fox Instigator Doppelbock;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Tap poured dark brown with tan head. Smells sweet and has a very sweet taste balanced with dark malt and hopps
Sly Fox Instigator Doppelbock;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Bottle from kramer in trade. Dark brown, mahogany edges, huge off white head, slightly overcarbonated. Peat/smoke up front in aroma, big fruity esters, caramel backbone. Flavor much the same. Caramel and smoke front and center, fruit character has died out. Finishes hot, big turn off. Rather thin palate/mouthfeel.
Sly Fox Instigator Doppelbock;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Immediate carbonation explosion upon opening. Poured dirty brown. Aroma is rotten vegetable soup. Taste is sour malt and vegetable. May have been a defective bottle.
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;750 ml bottle (Batch 10)-Poured an orangish amber with a big white head. Aroma of sweetness, malt, and fruits. Taste of the same with a bit of yeast. This was a nice summer brew.
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;Bottled. Pours a hazy light amber color with a medium off white head. The aroma was sweet fruity, caramel, apricot, peach and citrus. The flavor seemed to show some age inspired oxidation. Still sweet and fruity, but with a little funk. A hint of cork is also present. I�m not sure how old this bottle was.
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;750 from a departmental picnic - thanks, John! Seems like this bottle was miles better than the bottle shared by the local crew. Handsome orange color, slightly cloudy, and a big head. Not a trace of skunk, and in fact some gentle sweet apple aromas with hints of nut in there. Moderate yeast in the body, abundant carbonation and full mouthfeel. Pretty good quaffer.
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;Haven�t tried or seen this beer for a while. And the David shows up with a 750 of it with a label I�ve never seen before and its a batch #5. This shit was mad old and showed. Not a great cellar beer. Nose is incredibly skunkified, with old sweaty gym socks, armpit, and mild skunky pot. Flavor is similar, very sweaty and skunky. Haven�t had a beer this skunked out in quite some time. Definitely an experience, but not one I want to have again for a while.
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;Carolina Crew tasting. Batch 5 Quite possibly the worst/skunkiest beer i�ve ever tasted. Flavor is similar to dank marijuana. I like that flavor in my weed, but in my beer no way!
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;"Bottle of Batch 5, labeled ""Speciale,"" so this beer was likely 4+ years old, and it did not age well at all. Smell of skunk, skunky weed, and sweaty gym socks. Notes of sour grass. I honestly spit it out when i tasted it, so I didn�t pick up any flavors when tasting it. I�m sure this was once decent; thought I�d rate to advise against picking up and old botte."
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;Draft at the Blind Tiger, thanks to MaxDaddy. Brown pour with only a little head. The aroma was bready, slightly earthy malt and grain. The flavor is the same with some yeastiness. Alright, but more of a summer wheat beer than a belgian ale.
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;Tap at Blind Tiger. Lightly bready, waffle, cheesy aroma. Balanced and dry. Amber colored with a small head. Slightly belgian yeast, with a wet, unassertive, dried prune taste. Unexciting.
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;Tap at Blind Tiger: (Courtesy of MaxDaddy) Deep hazy orange with a thin white head. Mild wheat malt aroma, with a hint of subdued lemon peel and yeast. The flavor has a musty lemon peel character, along with mild yeast presence and a very weak finish. Very mild overall. Simple, not much to it.
Allagash Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Allagash Brewing Company;Cold 12oz bottle: Pours a medium orange color with microsediment and a quickly dissipating alabaster head that leaves a thin film and a ring.

Ending is of light brown sugar notes.

Denmark Dunkles Weissbier;Denmark, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Denmark Brewing;This pours faint-golden muddy-as-ditchwater brown with a head that QUICKLY dissapates. Grassy aroma with a faint fusel alcohol scent. More high alcohol notes, very light malts. Tart aroma of caramel, banana, clove, a little earth. Medium bodied with low bitterness and a quick finish. Very mild in flavor. But if you are a fan of Dark Wheat�s, this is hard to pass up.
Denmark Dunkles Weissbier;Denmark, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Denmark Brewing;Chestnut color with a bone colored small fizzy head. Heavy aroma of malt and stewed prunes.

Kameleon Amber;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij den Hopperd;Pours clear, light amber. Smll white head. Smell is caramelly. Taste is aromatic, yet rather blank ambermalt taste. No hops or yeast are to be found in this one. Weak. Wattery. Yet theres nothing bad about the taste. Just could use more complexity. Or any complexity, to start with
Kameleon Amber;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij den Hopperd;33cl bottle courtesy of and shared with kermis. Thin white head. Golden blond pour. Not great. Something wrong in the aftertaste.
Kameleon Amber;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij den Hopperd;Bottle shared. Pours hazy small floater amber with a thin off white head. Aroma of yeast, veggies, herbs and malt. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Not very good.
Kameleon Amber;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij den Hopperd;"Not really an amber but rather a blonde thirst-quencher. Back in 2006, I too the following notes: snow white, coarse head, warm yellow golden colour (not amber at all), more or less clear but cloudy after adding the yeast deposit. Aroma of apple and caramel but lots of medicinal solvents overpowering them, some hay-like hoppiness, cloves, liquorice, eucalyptus, honey, ginger powder. Sweetish taste, subdued fruit, smooth, low carbonation and (too) thin mouthfeel, strange resinous, liquorice-like sweetness sticking to the palate, finish mildly hoppy with some badly hidden alcohol. The current version has improved a bit: the resin- and liquorice-like, medicinal sweetness, like cough candy, has declined, there is more carbonation now and a somewhat better balance between fruity yeastiness and honeyish maltiness, with a more nutty profile; the finish is also more assertively hoppy, a bit peppery. I am convinced that with further improvements, this can eventually become a real good beer."
Kameleon Amber;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij den Hopperd;Watery amber beer. Has a bit caramalt and some fruits of course, but it�s all flat.

Nelson Trafalgar Bitter;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;"24th Aug 2018, cask half-pint, gravity pour; 22nd Codsall Station Beer Festival. Slight haze to the light brown body, wispy topping. Malty, yet it had a hoppy aroma and initial taste; mild farmyard esters and flavour giving a little sourness in the finish."
Nelson Trafalgar Bitter;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;"September 15, 2017 - at A Friend At Hand - handpull cask. (once again, fish and chips at this GK pub, and I find a tick or two! I doubt the beer will be in terrific shape, but what the hell). Clear and attractive amber with a mottled biege head. Smells like a dull floral bitter with some weird and unwelcome chalky component. Taste follows, less chalk, but it's dishwatery, so not much better than the frickin' chalk; pretty unpleasant stuff all round. Watery, still, harsh mouthfeel - unpleasant aftertaste. Like going back in time ten years. Blech."
Nelson Trafalgar Bitter;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask HP at The Crosse Keys Bishopsgate as Nelson Trafalgar Bitter. Hazy dark orange, still, very hazy for a cask ale, and it�s not condensation on the glass. Tan head doesn�t endure. Aroma is airy, bread crusts initially with more souring fruits as it drains. Body is smooth with light carbonation. Taste is interesting drying citrus suggesting maybe the slightest brett, bready, yeasty, drying fruity dimension, dusty, touch tangy, some plum. Really drinkable with an interesting character. Given the other ratings, I was surprised to have enjoyed it.
Nelson Trafalgar Bitter;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;It's bitter but far from the great tast of IPA's. The Nitro is also not contributing to the tast

Beaver Street Harvest Hefeweizen;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Beaver Street Brewery;West USA trip 2010. On tap @ the brewpub. The aroma has banana�s and some yeast. Slightly hazy, yellow coloured weizen with a white head. The taste has a lot banana fruitiness and some yeast. Quite a refreshing beer. Okay.
Beaver Street Harvest Hefeweizen;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Beaver Street Brewery;Pours beautiful hazy gold/yellow with rocky white head. Nose has plenty of banana fruit, fresh bread, and some spice. Banana is prominent on the palate, with some wheat cracker sweetness, and medium to light bodied. Very drinkable hefe-weizen aimed more towards the banana than clove, but not necessarily unbalanced. Best locally brewed beer in Flagstaff, hands down.
Beaver Street Harvest Hefeweizen;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Beaver Street Brewery;hazy dark straw yellow with a thin white head. it smells of bananas dipped in lemon juice, yeast, spice and flowers. the banana in the flavor tastes like a banana flavored blow pop... candy-like with notes of bubblegum, spice, lemon-y acidity and some yeasty richness. the medium body has a nice creamy texture from soft carbonation. 5/3/6/3/13/3.0
Beaver Street Harvest Hefeweizen;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Beaver Street Brewery;This taste like blue moon more than a good hefe weizen. The bannana flavor is over powering. The flavor was not really pleasurable.

Olde Stone Anniversary Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Olde Stone Brewing;Draught. Dark black body with a slight ruby tinge and a large creamy mocha head. Sweet aroma consisting of oats, roast, and faint hop leafiness. Medium body with nice malt bitterness and coffee roast. Pretty solid, though how is it a mild ale? Pint at the brewpub on April 21, 2007.
Olde Stone Anniversary Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Olde Stone Brewing;Well I felt like this was trying to be a stout....and then perhaps a porter....and still somehow was reminiscent of an English strong ale....all of which was rendered irrelevant as it turned out to be a really nice beer. Creamy near-black body with a creamy tan head. Aromas of coffee and butter and perhpas some subtle fruitiness too. Very easy-drinking ale from a somewhat hidden gem of a micro.
Olde Stone Anniversary Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Olde Stone Brewing;This had the colour of dark cherries with a creamy white head. Aroma of roasted malts, fruit (cherries). Flavour of fruit (cherries again), slight roastiness of coffee. Finishes like a light stout and dry.
Olde Stone Boston Pale Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Stone Brewing;Nice beer. I am not a hop head, so this has a good balance between the malt and hops. Lots of citrus aroma and taste without too much bitterness.
Olde Stone Boston Pale Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Stone Brewing;Half-pint shared with a friend at the Olde Stone. Not my favourite. Then again, I haven�t liked any Boston lagers I have had to this day. Nose was of malt and the typical macrobrew smell. The flavour was offensive to the palate. The bitterness was uneven and it really turned me off this beer.
Olde Stone Boston Pale Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Stone Brewing;Pint at the pub. Amber orange with a small, quickly disappearing head. Nice aroma of grapefruit and a little pine from the Cascade. Taste is not quite hoppy enough to be an IPA, but it�s close. Tankhouse territory, without the complexity of the malt backbone. Nice bitterness in the finish. Definitely worth seeking out.
Olde Stone Boston Pale Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Stone Brewing;The surprise of the pints I had at the brewpub. Light amber, small white head. Sharp citrus hops in the aroma, dispelling my fear that this might be a Keith�s clone. Great taste that I would say borders on IPA territory - light body, sharp citrus hops up front and in the linger. It just does not have the malt profile or body to suggest APA to me. Regardless, this seasonal beer is well worth seeking out fresh. On par with other good Ontario pales like Black Oak which it is probably most similar to), Merchant Ale House IPA, and Church Key West Coast (I know, I know, there�s a mix of APA/IPA�s there, but it is a fine line in this Province).
Olde Stone Boston Pale Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Stone Brewing;Nice amber color with a sharp hoppy aroma and taste. Quite a bit of bitternes too but I liked it.
Olde Stone Boston Pale Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Stone Brewing;Light amber colour. Aroma of floral hops, citrus and some wheat. Flavour was quite hoppy, pine, citrus with a nice bitterness coming in at the finish. Finished quite dry. Quite nice.

Girardin Kriekenlambik;Sint Ulriks-Kapelle, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Girardin;25cl from cask at Het Goudblommeke van Papier/La Fleur de Papier d'Or (3 X 2018). I had this 5% ABV fruits lambic at a legendary bar for Brussels beer, although is has been taken over by Inbev now. The Girardin Kriekenlambiek has a perfectly red coloured appearance, with an astonishing ruby red, even hellish red glooming shine and dark red backbone. This lambiek is quite clear and has no foam at all. What a window clean gem. This brew has little to no nose, I'm afraid. Perfhaps there is some dust and cellar in this one, and at the very distance few sour cherries (the so-called 'noordkrieken') - yet all this rests minor and vague. The mouthfeel has vanilla and milk, lots of cedar wood and even liquorice. Yet, these little sweet hints do not make this into a sugar experience: the sweet-sour balance makes up for a great performance... and actually masks lots of this Girardin Kriekenlambiek dullness. The taste has a keen sour berry fruit tongue as well, and adds earth, vinegar and red wine notes to the whole. On the tongue there are bits of dust and soil. The palate is quite flat though. All in all, a perfect looking cherry lambic with proper taste and a flat aroma.
Girardin Kriekenlambik;Sint Ulriks-Kapelle, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Girardin;11-09-18 // cask at Het Goudblommeke in Papier / La Fleur en Papier Dor�. Dark dark red. No head. Nose of cherry flesh. No carbontion. Straight sour cherry juice. Really nice.
Girardin Kriekenlambik;Sint Ulriks-Kapelle, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Girardin;"15 July 2018. At 'In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst', Eizeringen. Solo tasting. Pours hazy, dark ruby red, with a lasting, thin, bubbly, pink head. Strong aroma of sour cherry, cherry stones, unripe strawberry, wood, red wine, wild yeast, faint lactic acid. It tastes medium funky sour, notes of brett & sour cherry, and light to medium fruity sweet, like sweet cherry juice & red wine, a bit 'yoghurty'; already becoming dry and woody. Dry, tart finish, as of cherry stones, hint of wood, astringent even with red wine tannins; lingering cherry taste. Medium body, slick texture, soft to flat carbonation. Balanced & tasty, great 'wild' stuff."

Boon Oude Lambik;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Unblended Jonge / Oude;Brouwerij F. Boon;This is a backlog rating from�2007 on cask shared by Tmoney99, from�notes.�When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are funky, sour citrus, wood, some acidity, one of my first lambic experiences.
Boon Oude Lambik;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Unblended Jonge / Oude;Brouwerij F. Boon;On tap in St Albans, England While perusing the tap list at Mad Squirrel I noticed a new Boon's lambic on draft. Having had one or two other entries in the VAT series I immediately asked for a pour. This one happened to be VAT 82. AROMA / APPEARANCE Old oak and leather linger in the air as if transported to a cobbler's shop. The mild sourness pops up without the strong assertiveness of an older, funkier lambic. The cool inviting rose body however does resemble what most people run across in the stores. FLAVOR / PALATE Citrus, honey, and dried malts soak up the moisture of the mouth as they work to the back of the throat. The finish of yeast and blue cheese brings out the highlights of the funky back end. If this were bottled and available in the United States I would love to add it to a future side by side with the Discovery Kit that was recently launched.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary);Lot, Beersel, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij 3 Fonteinen;750ml bottle at Akkurat, stockholm. Hazy dark orange color with white head. Malty and yeasty aroma, funky, dusty, barnyard notes, wood, citrusy fruity, light nutty. Sweet and moderate to heavy acidic taste. Medium oily body with soft carbonation.
3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary);Lot, Beersel, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij 3 Fonteinen;"The legendary special blend made in 1998 for the fiftieth anniversary of the Drie Fonteinen blendery, released in 2000 as a one-off, and the first to bear Felix De Boeck's ""Nightlights"" (a Flemish 1977 painting) on its label, later reused on the Oude Geuze Vintage. Never thought I would ever get the chance to taste this legend, but Akkurat had a few bottles left apparently and I was more than happy to pay the 1295 SEK they charged per bottle - considering the skyrocketing prices whales like this generate on the black market, it seemed proportionally very reasonable. Fun to see how nervous the waiter was when he had to open the bottle, quite a solemn moment really. And after twenty years, this geuze was still very much alive: some gushing was apparently inevitable but with minimal loss (not more than, say, 5 SEK or so�). Thick and very frothy, off-white, lightly lacing and slowly opening but largely stable head on a misty straw blonde robe with warm peachy tinge and lively sparkling - looking like a bottle of no more than a year old. Ancient damp cellar and decades old wine from said cellar cover the original profile like an ornamental blanket, a profile consisting of ripe peaches, sour apple, oxidized white wine, haystack, very old dry sherry, moldy lemon peel, moist jute cloth, green plum peel, sour grapes, old artisanal cider, barnyard, faint hint of chlorine - all the fine elements I am looking for in a top quality 'oude' geuze. Softly and complexely estery onset, wryness of grape and plum peel soaked in gooseberry and crabapple sourness with a softer pear- and peach-like edge, yet nowhere descending into a harshly burning acidity and enlivened by a perfectly measured, cava-like sparkling on the tongue. A soft, bready 'soil' carries the esters onwards with pear and gooseberry remaining the most prominent impressions, towards a 'brut', highly complex, dense but still refreshing finish in which the musty cellar and very old wine notes are accompanied by hayish and leathery Brettanomyces effects on top and wet wood tannins below, the latter quite long-stretched and eventually bittered by a dim, structurally essential and perfectly positioned, very late hop bitter touch. The tartness carries on, adorned by the woody effects and the noble effects of elegant aging. I have held this producer in very high esteem ever since I first put a Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze to my lips a couple of decades ago, but this absolute masterpiece of a geuze was a real honour to taste, all the more so because age has not demolished its basic structure: on the contrary, the ancient wine and musty cellar merely oversee the funky, estery complexity with great care and nobility. Underneath these charming old age aspects still lies a perfectly refreshing, perfectly solid, complex and bright geuze, internally untouched by age, like the roguishly twinkling blue eyes of a weather-beaten old man's face still betraying his soul's eternal youth. Before I get even more lyrical: among the most masterful geuzes I ever had the pleasure to taste, one I had been dreaming of for a long time, and one to reverentially bow one's head for when it happens to cross one's path. Granting it a perfect score is the only option I have on this site."

Frankfurter Pilsator Pilsener;Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Frankfurter Brauhaus (TCB Beverages);500ml bottle on Saturday 4th Aug 2018. Alongside G�rlitzer Bahnhof in Berlin there is a row of cafe's, night shops and plenty of graffitti. One of the 'iffy looking' shops has a surprisingly large cold beer selection (La Chouffe being one). I sat outside and downed four cheap rates while resting my feet after some 'heavy walking'. This was my second beer of the little session. Usual bright, clean and clear golden look you'd expect from a Pilsner, the fast fading white crown also indictive of the style. The nose held some grainy notes but otherwise nothing. Fairly dry in the mouth, malts too the fore with a light hop balance. Refreshing rather than exciting and it really could have been any one of a thousand Pilsner, they do tend to blend into each other in my opinion.
Frankfurter Pilsator Pilsener;Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Frankfurter Brauhaus (TCB Beverages);Bottle from Sp�tkauf, Berlin. Clear golden with a white head. Mild with grain, bread and light citrus. A bit on the thin side with a medium bitter finish.
Frankfurter Pilsator Pilsener;Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Frankfurter Brauhaus (TCB Beverages);03-04-18 // 500ml bottle in Berlin. Clear golden. Flat grainy boringness with papery malt notes.
Frankfurter Pilsator Pilsener;Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Frankfurter Brauhaus (TCB Beverages);Fades, fast trockenes, pappiges Pils. Trotz allem in sich eine gewisse Balance. Insgesamt aber aufgrund der gleichbleibend langweiligen Note nicht wiederholenswert.
Frankfurter Pilsator Pilsener;Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Frankfurter Brauhaus (TCB Beverages);500 ml can. BB 07/2018. From my advent calendar, door #6. Thanks to my lovely wife! Clear golden color with a big foamy white head. Dry malty aroma with some hay and hints of hops. The flavor is hay dryness, cardboard, malt and some sawdust. Easy. Soft carbonation.
Frankfurter Pilsator Pilsener;Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Frankfurter Brauhaus (TCB Beverages);50cl can. A clear golden beer with a mid-sized most good lasting white head. Aroma of mild grainy malt, cereals and mild spicy hops. Taste of dry grainy malt, cereals, bread, mild spicy bitterness, boring!
Charles Reibenbach Light Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Can. Grassy aroma. Light, but it does not smell bad. Sort of better than Bud Light. Clear brassy color. White head was strong, then collapsed. Has a light corn/grass flavor. I think there is some hop bitter at the end, but it also has a wet cardboard aspect. It�s at least a tie for Bud Light. It�s not great. It is a drain pour. But if you have to have this sort of beer, this is probably a good one to have.
Charles Reibenbach Light Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;You cant be expecting too much from something like this. The taste and smell actually has a white grape juice flavor to it. Everything is too light and flavorless to even earn a rating. Drain pour
Charles Reibenbach Light Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;The aroma has garbage, (and I mean actual trash) corn syrup, acetate, and alcohol. The appearance actually wowed me, but not in a good way. It is so Pale that it almost looks like the tap water in many cities. It is by far the lightest pale gold of any beer that I have seen to date. The flavor is metallic corn malt and a little alcohol. The palate is watery. Giving this beer a 1 is generous.
Charles Reibenbach Light Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Yup, its pretty damn light in all respects. Only available at your local Albertsons these parts.
Charles Reibenbach Light Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Cheapest beer at the store. Tastes pretty bad at first and then leaves a bad taste in your mouth and throat. It smells weird as well. This is the second time I�ve tried it. I don�t think I�ll buy it again.
Charles Reibenbach Light Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;The can looks like a prop from a '50s movie set. It actually says it is brewed by Old European Brewing Co. - is that run by Donald Rumsfield? Must have been bought out by Gluek. Lifeless pour. Aroma - a bit of sweet maltiness apears for a microsecond - then settles into metallic blandness. Taste and texture of club soda. Overall - very bland and dry. Does not have that signature Gluek twang to it though.
Charles Reibenbach Light Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This was actually a relief after the Reibenbach Ice and the Reibenbach Lager. I guess the more dilute the beer is, the better it is. Fizzy, pretty dry and flavorless. Still had that Gluek twang, a bit though. My wife drank it, so after you buy 12 for $3.99 just to sample it, you may pass the remainder off on the unenlightened. Or use it for marinade without spoiling the meat.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;From the 650 ml. bottle best by 11/05/15. Light, straw yellow in color with a quick erupting white fizzy head that becomes a ring in a moment. While I get toasted bread and crackers in the aroma I also get a kind of cellar-like dankness. Some feint grassy hops. Light to medium mouthfeel. Light sweetness in the taste with a light bitter finish.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle purchased at my local Market Basket. Clear gold color with thin lasting head poured into a lager glass. Aroma is sweet grain, honey and wheat. The flavor is exactly as you would come to expect: pale malts, grain body that is light with a mild carbonation level. The German lager yeast strain can be found toward the back of the sip with a very light grass note. Honestly this brew is exactly what it should for the style, easy drinking summer thirst quencher.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;Straw, yeast and lemon aroma. Hazy straw body. Head laces nicely on the glass that settles slowly to quarter inch film. Has a some whet lemony bitter that is balanced with a yeast bread finish. Quick dry finish. I�d recommend this one. Light and refreshing feel. Excellent warm weather choice.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;bottle from mrnightshoe, yup another god damn railroad based beer name. as one can assume, golden spike should really be termed gold plated.. ie a perfect brand new track.... but i digress. pours hazy gold with a quick fizzy head. cracker with quick flashes of grass, earth, socks all wrapped in alight fizz body.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;Poured from a large bottle into a trumpet glass to drink. The beer had a cloudy, lighter gold-straw color with a modest foamy white head that had low retention and below average lacing and cling. Its aroma featured grain and straw hop components blended with some lemon and yeast and was somewhat modest overall. The taste was a grainy and straw sour-bitter blend with some yeasty bitterness and a bit of corn. It had a wetter, watery body and was somewhat then with lower carbonation and life and light mouthfeel. Thank you for the gift, Linda.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;Has a light golden color with a good bit of carbonation and a light malt/sweet smell. Taste is light, kind of american standardish and finishes a little metallic. Overall not the best BBC beer made, but it is at least drinkable.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;Bomber from Whole Foods Market Darien. Pours a hazy straw color with a thin fizzy off-white head. Fair head retention. Aroma of grainy malts and faint grass. The taste is sweet malts, grainy and nutty notes, faint fruits and very mild hops. Medium bodied. Fairly average but not bad.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;22oz Bottle, enjoyed at La Strada - Matunuck, RI. Green and gold, slightly stale beer aroma. This has a bit of a yeast sickness to it. Flavors focused on watery, wheaty, yeast, and minerals. Thin-ish. Not stunning Kolsch. It really tasted like a flabby, dead-yeast Golden Ale. Funny though, I had this and then a Newport Storm Hurricane Amber and this was way better as any beer than the Newport Storm was as an Amber Ale.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;A little citrus and flower in the aroma. Flavor is remarkably weak and dull. Some flowery hops and a little metallic tinge in the finish. Probably an OK choice if you�re really thirsty on a hot day, but certainly nothing worth seeking out.
Berkshire Gold Spike Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Berkshire Brewing Company;Excellent surprise. Found this on tap at the Amesbury Barking Dog Restaurant. Came to the table in a shaker pint...but after that, all was good. Light aroma of wheat and citrus. Hazy, light golden yellow with a thin, but persistent, creamy, white head. Tasting gives you a light sweetness with a hint of lemon zest and wheat tanginess. This quickly dissolves into a deep bready/biscuity warmth. Then it dries up on the tongue with a very pleasant aftertaste. Light and creamy. This is an exceptional summertime brew.
Kameleon Ginseng;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij den Hopperd;Bottle from LDW, Eke. Hazy blond colour, white foam. Nose of grass, banana, citrus and ginseng. Earthy. Bitter hoppy finish. Decent.
Kameleon Ginseng;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij den Hopperd;Bought from Malting Pot. Blonde ale with strange infused after taste. Not great. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Kameleon Ginseng;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij den Hopperd;A small taste from a friend (bottle) @ One Pint Pub. Pours hazy greenish golden with a high head. Aroma is some malts with loads of herbs. Flavor is malts, herbs and hops. Not my cup of tea, pun intended.
Oakham Barton Mild;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Oakham Ales;Cask Conditioned, at the Brewery Tap, Peterborough. John (the Oakham Head Brewer) took me on with the Pepsi challenge of the night. He went down to the casks to pour off a fresh sample of their mild and fresh tasted of the Elgood Black Dog mild. The outcome was that the beers are very similar (ie. I didn�t guess correctly). No really they were very similar. Dark brown, thin looking with white bubbly heads. Mild flavours that require quaffing to extract sufficient flavour to analyse. Just a regular thin mild.
Oakham Barton Mild;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Oakham Ales;Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham. Another absolutely delicious Mild for the month of May. Jet black, with a fading head and blocky lacing. Very balanced taste, oily mouthfeel. Sweet, nutty beer, grill-pan choc and barbeque. Slightly grainy, less obviously strong than the Bank Top tried immediatly before. Short finish, but neat and tidy.
Oakham Barton Mild;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Oakham Ales;Very dark beer with a smooth head. The aroma has a light bitterness and the flavour is slightly hopped/citric. Overall a good beer, tasting much stronger than the alcohol percentage.
Titletown Extra Special Bitter;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Titletown Brewing Company;A very acceptable interpretation of the style, but it didn't knock my socks off the way some other Titletown beers have done.
Mogollon Mountain Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mogollon Brewing Company;Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty. A light bodied pilsner. Malts are fruity and sweet, and a little more noticeable than most pilsners. Hops are citrusy and mild. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Mogollon Pinon Porter;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Porter;Mogollon Brewing Company;Deep brown color. Medium head. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. A full-bodied porter. Malts are roasted and chocolaty. Hops are spicy. Well balanced. Nice lighter flavored porter. Nice complex chocolate, coffee and roasted malt thing going on. Smooth taste, The cocoa flavor lingers is the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;I�m not a stout drinker but my visit to the Southwest has begun to change that. This one, like a couple others I tried, is very drinkable and not overly heavy. Black, black, black with a dark tan head. Wood and some coffee in the nose. Roasted malt flavor, nice and full-bodied without being heavy. Finish is slightly sweet and bitter, doesn�t knock you down.
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;Poured up on tap at Papago with deep darkness with thin mahogany edges supporting a dark mocha head. The aroma offers up big notes of rich sweet chocolate, sweet malts, some molasses and highly roasted maltiness. The taste is the same. Wow, I get a rich yummy mix of chocolate, sweet malts and molasses all playing up against bold nearly burnt roasted malty goodness. This is a delicious stout, holy smokes. Nice job.
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;Draught. Had this beer at a friend�s house. It is to date one of the best stouts I�ve ever had. Great nose, not too sweet and a smooth clean finish. Yummy, I�ll be looking for more of this.
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;On tap at 1702 Appearance: Black with a nice beige head and good lacing Aroma: Roasted malts and coffee Taste: Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate with a light bitterness in the finish Nice and smooth
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;on tap at papago 8/1/10. dark. black pour with a light brown head and drippy trails of foam. the nose is very roasty... full of barley, chocolate, toasted nuttiness, cola, molasses and cream. the flavor is the same only there are some green hoppy notes poking through and a little tartness on the finish. the palate is a touch sweet but really doesn�t get in the way since the body is just medium and stays far away from thick or cloying. simple, delicious and well executed. 8/4.5/8/4.5/16/4.1+
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;Typical stout...but for an AZ beer...good stuff! Black pour, tan head. Roasty and toasty aroma with some light cocoa, coffee and ashy notes. Flavor is very roasty, ash, tar, light hops. Interesting and pretty good!
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;Deep brown pour with minimal creamy head. Roasty coffee, malt and chocolate in the aroma. Nicely balanced, roasty flavor. Not bad at all.
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;On tap at Papago on 8/6/10. Pours pitch black with a 2 finger tan head. The nose is roasted malt, light coffee and dark chocolate. The taste is burnt malt, milk chocolate and faint coffee grounds. Medium semi-creamy mouthfeel. Pretty good stout.
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;Poured @ GTBF. Amazing chocolate presence in this beer. Aroma is of cocoa powder, chocolate covered coffee bean, and Hershey syrup. Appearance is a little disappointing...translucent mahogany pour with a small khaki head. Palate also somewhat thin. Flavor, however, is solid. Rich dark chocolate, caramel malt, and char. Nice beer.
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout;Mogollon Brewing Company;draft at the Green Room (formerly Mogollon brew pub) - Pours black with a minimal tan head. It smells of dark roast malt and coffee. It has a full, dark roast malt flavor with big coffee notes and a hint of smoke. It�s full bodied and has a lightly bitter finish. Very good.
Granville Island Sunset Beach Blond;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Mildly sweet and grainy aroma with a very light fruitiness. Clear golden body is topped by a low white head that recedes to ring. Sweet grainy flavour with mild fruity esters and light finishing bitterness. Light body with moderate carbonation. Sampled on tap at Malone�s Taphouse in Vancouver as Malone�s Beach Brew after the Grey Cup 2005.
Granville Island Sunset Beach Blond;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);A mild ale. Moderate malting and hopping. Great lacing! Noticeable prescence of fruitiness. I was quite pleased especially with the gassing of the beers I had at Granville on this particular day.
Granville Island Sunset Beach Blond;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);A nice light blond ale. Body was golden with minimal white head. Noticed some carbonation and tasted that as well. Goes down easy but kind of boring.
Main Street Brewery Weizenbock;Corona, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Very cloudy orangish brown. Very sweet smelling, kinda smells like fruity had soap. Tangy and fruity flavor of raisin. Medium body.
Main Street Brewery Weizenbock;Corona, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);A brownish murky color with a small white head. A plumb aroma with a malty note. The flavor is of plumbs with a warming alcohol presence. A touch of malty caramel emerges as it warms.
Citrus Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"It says a lot about my mental age that I was delighted to find that the yellow plastic sheath on this �beer� bottle has a vertical clear section with a series of plumb-lines or marks down its length with marketing slogans to suggest reactions and thoughts as you drink your way down the bottle. On the neck, just below the beer level, it says, ""First drop"". Good advice. The smart thing to do is first drop this bottle, then go to the beer fridge and get something else. An inch and a half down, it says ""Mmmm... fruit"". It should say ""Mmmm.. fruit flavourings and food acid 330"" because that�s what this contains instead of fruit. Another inch and a half and it says ""Tastes good"". Please refer to the average rating of 1.12 for an alternative opinion. An inch and a half more and it says ""So refreshing"". Can�t argue with that. It tastes like lime and lemonade, which is refreshing. If, however, you were expecting something like beer, you are holding the wrong bottle. This is an alcopop. And finally, at the base of the bottle, the final marketing slogan says ""All gone!"" Amen to that. (330ml bottle, Amatos)"
Citrus Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Looks and smells like lemon/lime juice. I do not really like either. The aftertaste is the same and it certainly hangs around for a very annoying period of time. The worst artificially flavoured DB ""beer"" which I've so far found."
Citrus Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"My instant reaction was ""Schweppes Lime Cordial"", maybe the diet version with a touch more metallicity about it. At least DB admit ""This is not good beer. . . . "" because it certainly isn't."
Citrus Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Tastes like Schweppes Lime Cordial, mixed with a very weak lager. Really sweet Bacardi Breezer type stuff.
Citrus Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Drinkable. But only just. There doesn't seem to be many redeemable features in this alcopop. It's a cheap, artificial tasting citrus nonsense which uses cheap beer as the base. ""This is not beer as we know it."" Indeed."
K�ndig s'Helle;Rietheim, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;K�ndig-Br�u;Bottle from Brewery. Hazy yellow with thin head that dissipates fast. Strong sweet banana esters in the nose. Slightly bitter and surprisingly dry with medium carbonation. Not a very interesting or complex beer but a good drinker. Worth a try. I think this beer has evolved since the 2009 ratings.
K�ndig s'Helle;Rietheim, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;K�ndig-Br�u;Bottled, thanks Bov! Hazy orange colour, faint head. Fruity nose with light sulphur and butter. Sweet and light bodied. Fruity like a k�lsch but less hoppy than the artesanal ones. Light grass and minerals in a drier finish. A careful beer with good drinkability, no flaws but not a lot of character.
K�ndig s'Helle;Rietheim, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;K�ndig-Br�u;Bottled 50cl. Courtesy of Bov. Hazy deep golden with a smallish head. Homemade caramel, pop corn, butter, candy and peanut butter showing up in the nose. (Diacetyl). Sweet buttery taste- too sweet for my liking. Low bitterness. A lot of caramel in the taste. This beer gets cloying after a few sips. Sweet finish which is reminiscent of papaya. Thanks a lot Bov!
K�ndig s'Helle;Rietheim, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;K�ndig-Br�u;Hazy blond color. Light malt aroma. Poor taste, with just some bitterness at the end.
K�ndig s'Helle;Rietheim, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;K�ndig-Br�u;"bottled from the brewery - hazy blond-orange colour with a persistent white foam; flowery and fruity tones met some malts in a subtle and balanced nose; decent malt body with some sweetness and some fair bitterness; more light fruity tones in a moderately dry and malty finish April 2003; labelled as Lager cloudy orange colour, big creamy head, nice lace, some aromatic hops in the nose, sweet, medium-bodied, subtle aromatic finish - interesting"
Huus-Braui Dunkler B�gel;Roggwil, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Huus-Braui;"Pours dark brown, clear; tan head, quickly dissipating - Aroama of malt; roasty; maybe some coffee; and something like italian cauliflower - very balanced taste, light bitterness maybe - medium body, rather creamy, soft carbonation - roasty, bitter finish."
Huus-Braui Dunkler B�gel;Roggwil, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Huus-Braui;bottle, bought in St. Gallen. Dark brown colour, nearly black. Beautiful capuccino-coloured very creamy head. Flavour: malt, roasted malt, caramel and coffee, reminds me a little of a stout. Neither sweet nor bitter, balanced somewhere in between.
Huus-Braui Dunkler B�gel;Roggwil, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Huus-Braui;Dark amber color, creamy head. Too light malt aroma. Strong, full body, with a lot of caramel and heavy hopping, but not enough malty nor aromatic
Huus-Braui Dunkler B�gel;Roggwil, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Huus-Braui;dark brown colour, fine head, toasted, malty aroma, light-bodied, touch of bitterness, short dry finish - a little bit weak
L�wenbr�u Maibock;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;L�wenbr�u Munich (AB InBev);Street tap in Nordhorn. Fine sweetish hopbitter flavor. Caramel and mango. Maybe a bit sticky in the aftertaste, but a good and tasty thirst quencher.
Green Tye Wheelbarrow;Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Green Tye Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Ship & Mitre, Liverpool 08/04/2004 Golden coloured and hoppy. Slightly dry crisp malt finish.
Green Tye Wheelbarrow;Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Green Tye Brewery;Cask, The Barge, Gillingham. Like Flagship, this brewery only uses Maris Otter barley from Warminster Maltings. And like Flagship, the result is an over malty sweetness. A very unbalanced and quite awful beer. There is huge sulphur on the nose - a massive and continuous belch of rotten eggs. If they intended to re-create a Burton beer they seriously overdid the calcium sulphate. The sweet malt tastes caramelised, though not by direct fire, but probably by handfuls of brown sugar. There is a vague finish, slightly cloying. A confused and poorly made beer.
Redfish Saison;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Draught. Body is hazy light yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers, lemon), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with a note of vinegar. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, acetic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter, acetic. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Have had twice now several weeks apart...the vinegar elements are consistent. Oh well.
Redfish Saison;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;"I'm assuming this is the ""Saison Wheat"": Yellow-orange with a weakish head. Light and creamy mouthfeel. Sweet bread dough malts with some light, flowery hops. Bitter hop nip in the finish."
Redfish Saison;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;"Not bad as simply a refreshing golden beer on a hot day; but not very distinguished as a Saison. The French need not worry about Oskar Blues."
Bitter End Prickly Pear Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;An unclear red beer with a disappearing white head. The aroma is just sour - nothing else. The flavor is very sour and very fruity - I can�t pick out the pear. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. It bears a lovele resemblance with a fruit gueze.
Bitter End Prickly Pear Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Uh oh. Big difference between what Chad thought and what I thought. I did not get mine in a snifter (?), no big deal. Deep garnet color. Little head. Severely tart to start. Mellows quickly though. Dryish. Stays dry and trat at the same time- strange. I did not finish this beer- not really because I hated it, but I really didn't want to waste my time on it.
Bitter End Prickly Pear Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Dark-amber, foamy head, very handsomely served in a snifter. Smells and tastes like...prickly pear cactus! For those of you who haven't had the experience of eating a prickly pear, let's just say it's somewhat akin to a mild bell pepper. This makes it seem like it wouldn't make a good beer, but something about this appealed to me. Nice malt/hop balance that left it with a very crisp mouthfeel. Some apple flavor in the finish. Legion242 had this recently, can't wait to see how he rates it.
Bitter End Raspberry Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Nice color--like a mixed drink or a pressed fruit juice, bright and hazy. The aroma anticipates the sourness with a good fruity aroma. Pleasantly sour, though not mouth-puckering at first. There is a good burn there, acidic with a vinegar essence. Gentle sweetness rounds it out. Excellent. (Sampled at Southern Ratebeer Gathering, Austin, TX, December 6, 2003)
Bitter End Raspberry Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Very sour, tart lambic. Mostly raspberry aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel is very syrupy, but doesn't coat the inside of your mouth like you would expect.
Bitter End Raspberry Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Very sour aroma, berries, barnyard, hay. Flavor pretty much followed suit with a tart, almost lip puckering finish. The finish didnt really linger as much as I expected it would, somewhat disappointed, not bad though.
Bitter End Raspberry Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Thought this was called ""Raspberry Tart"" at the brewery. It is a cloudy light red/pink hue. The aroma is very sour... a little fruit sweetness is evident. Strong as hell, with a medicine flavor... La Folie-like - sour cherries and wood flavors. Very sour finish of fruit and band aids."
Bitter End Raspberry Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Appearance: Cloudy, reddish-brown Aroma: Sweet, floral aroma, similar to a rosh bush. Also slight aroma of balsamic vinegar Flavor: Sour like lemons, slightly floral, and some flavors like rasberry jolly rancher candies Palate: sweet, sour and smooth, with some slight tartness resembling a fruit dessert Fabulous beer.
Bitter End Raspberry Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Aroma is like raspberry lemonade at firt, then a hint of vinegar comes out. Color is cloudy reddish brown - light. Flavor is fruity at first with a tart finish and a vinegary aftertaste - very acidic. I like the mothfeel of this, totally invigorates the senses. A good beer and a nice surprise. Reminds me a little bit of La Folie.
Bitter End Raspberry Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Aroma is vinegar/tart a hint of raspberries. Appearance is cloudy reddish, brown. Flavor is nicely tart, not a lot of raspberries. Refreshing.
Bitter End Raspberry Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Yummy, a good transition lambic beer for me. Kind of sour but not to the extent that it took away from the fruit flavor. Pinkish-red color, nice strawberry aroma and taste, it's all good!

D�m K�vov�;Prague, Czech Republic;Flavored - Other;Pivovarsk� D�m;Keg at Pivovarsky Dum, Prague. Clear, deep brown. Massive aroma of coffee cake and mocha. Too sweet in the flavour for my liking. Life a coffee cream from a tin of Roses... and no one wants that.
D�m K�vov�;Prague, Czech Republic;Flavored - Other;Pivovarsk� D�m;Draft sample at the source. The beer is a clear copper with a beige head of foam. Strong coffee and caramel aroma. Vanilla toasty pastry notes. Sweet and roasty. Medium body and moderate carbonation.
D�m K�vov�;Prague, Czech Republic;Flavored - Other;Pivovarsk� D�m;On tap at Pivovarsk� d�m, pours a dark reddish brown with a small beige head. Nose reveals intense coffee essence, a bit artificial tasting. Flavour is along the same lines, with coffee essence, light sweetness and some medicinal notes. This is just not a good coffee beer.
D�m K�vov�;Prague, Czech Republic;Flavored - Other;Pivovarsk� D�m;Taster glas @ Pivovarsk� D�m, Prague (March 24, 2018). Strong taste of coffee... and nothing else. But it's good coffee. This was better than any coffee stout I have sampled.

Batemans Spring Breeze (Bottle) 5%;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Batemans;From BA (Sept 2006): New bottle design, the label now has Demeter, the Godess of Spring and Fertility on it. Poured very nicely, good clean light amber colour with a solid white foaming head, which stayed for the whole pint. Floral, slight hoppy aroma, nothing heavy, but pleasant and almost sweet. The Maris Otter barley gives the whole beer a slightly sweetish flavour, which in my taste, gave it a weaker mouthfeel than I had hoped for. The beer is still very, very drinkable.
Batemans Spring Breeze (Bottle) 5%;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Batemans;Malty, some hop bitterness only really comes through a bit in the aftertaste.

Ottos Mt. Nittany Pale Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;It�s fine... nothing wrong with it, just not very memorable. It�s a standard pale ale and I wish the hops were a bit more pronounced. I�m forgetting if I have had this on tap at Otto�s perhaps that would be a better experience than in the bottle.
Ottos Mt. Nittany Pale Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Bottle. Pours a golden color with a small creamy tan head. Aroma is mostly citrusy and hoppy. Bitter hoppy flavor with plenty of citrus. Light bodied. Pretty good.

Ottos Mt. Nittany Pale Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy, semi-burnt orange color with no head nor any lacing. The smell had a light under-spiced absorbing citrus to grassy connotation to it. A light toasty to breadiness finds itself around the aroma. The taste was semi-sweet and lightly spiced with a light underscore of bitter citrus rind. A sharp sweet citrus finds itself in the aftertaste and leads into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a good sharpness as an APA should on the palate. This was carbonated nicely. Overall, I say this was a pretty good APA I could have again, preferably in the warmer months as there�s a decent refreshing quality about it.
Ottos Mt. Nittany Pale Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 9-30-12- Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance � Served a golden colored brew with a tiny white head. The head faded fast to leave very light level of lacing. Smell - The aroma was a mix of a biscuit and bready aroma with some lighter notes of an earthy and hay-like aroma. Taste - The taste begins with flavors of a lighter caramel sweetness and a biscuit base. As the taste moves on the sweetness fades some as flavors of an earthy nature come to the tongue. More toward the end of the taste, the earthy flavors grow even stronger and are joined by a light herbal flavor which in the end, leave a dry bitter flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer was on the light to average side with a carbonation level that was rather average. It makes for an easy to drink brew, but lacks some complexity which may have been better to accentuate the bitter flavors. Overall � An OK beer. It tasted and drank very much like a standard APA but lacked some of the finer flavor transitions and subtle flavors of a great APA. Earlier Rating: 5/19/2014 Total Score: 3.3 Transfer from BA reviewed on 2-15-12 - Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance � Pours a nice golden color with not too much head. There is a moderate amount of lacing upon the quick dissipation of the head. Smell � Carmel malt is the most prevalent. While not very potent, there is a light amount of pine and citrus hop mixed in. Taste � A very nice malt backbone with a slight roasted barley flavor which is lightly sweetened by a bit of toffee flavor. The lighter hop flavor then comes into play toward the middle and the end. Mainly pine and earthy in nature, it leaves a nice finish to the taste. Mouthfeel � A little thinner then would be desired with an average level of carbonation. Pretty standard for the type of brew. Overall � Not bad, but noting too special. Easy to drink.
Ottos Raspberry Wheat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Very fragrant, like a bowl full of ripe raspberries. A little hops tang. Looks like dark pink cloudy grapefruit juice. Foamy lacing pink head. Light carbonation, almost flat and medium watery body. Great raspberry taste. Starts a little sweet and then the sour juices take over. Bitter in finish and after, with persistent raspberry flavor. Good fruit beer, though a little too bitter/chalky from either fruit tannins or yeast sediment.
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 5-15-12 - Served in a 12 oz chalice glass Appearance � Served a clear orange-copper color with a tiny white head. The head faded really fast giving almost no lacing at all. Smell � The nose was biggest in breadiness with yeasty and spicy aromas mixed in. There was a light sweet fruit aromas of banana, orange and some dark fruit smells as well. While overall the aroma was light, it was very nice. Taste � The taste was up front of breadiness and caramel sweetness. A yeasty and light fruity flavor quickly came into the tongue. Flavors of yeast cake, banana and orange all came to mix with the breadiness. The little bit of caramel that was left from the initial taste soon faded and a nice Belgian spice blend hit the tongue. These flavors had a nice balance and left a very pleasing flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The mouthfeel was rather average with a lower level of carbonation. The mouthfeel was a little thin and to accentuate the nice flavor balance and spice it would have been better a bit thicker. Overall � While not the best example of a dubbel it was a good tasting and smelling brew none the less. Worth a try.
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Had on draft @ Otto�s brewpub, in the NeW location, in State College,PA .. . quite the light feeling dubbel .. sweet aftertaste .. cola and caramel, some homemade molasses .. . light yeast .. . thin but good, not traditional .. . . Why is that mirror sneezing?
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;In short: An overly spicy and soapy/perfumed Belgian ale of some kind How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear golden copper body with a small beige head. In long: Spicy nose. Taste has way too much herbal and perfumy spiciness for me. Coriander, lavender, camomile, cloves, rose water, some spices that I use in my unsuccessful Chinese cooking attempts. Second in line was an intense �having my mouth washed with soap� feeling. That thing got gross before the end of my 4oz sample. I think I got a bad batch, a bottom of keg that shouldn�t have been served or something like that. This beer was like seeing my cousin Louis with working-boots on and a lunchbox, you know there�s something not quite right and that�s not how it�s supposed to be.
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Draft @ Otto�s. Mostly clear amber body with a small white head. The nose is fruity and estery with bananas, clove, plums, candi sugar and dough. The taste is moderately sweet, moderate to light bitterness with plums, light berry, candi sugar and some banana. Medium body is round with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a bit of pepper.
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Draft @ Otto�s. Shared by artusory. Pours a bright, orange-reddish color; thin off-white head with fine-bubbled lacing. Lots of straightforward cloves and brown sugar and oily dried fruits in the aroma; a bit syrupy. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy dried fruits, bananas and cloves, with lots of chewiness and residual sugar. Sticky, but tasty enough. Lengthy finish from all the sugar; cloves and bananas and dried fruits."
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Wonderful - really candyish and sweet. Lots o� malt with no hoppage at all. Nice.
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Aroma is a lightly coarse phenolic blast, with the curtness of salted ginger and heavy yeast. Very pungent and a bit chalky. Not my most desirable Belgian profile. Pour to the scupper with a rather clear middle red, thin rim of opalescent head above. Flavor rings with the aroma, in a lightly grainy, astringent yeast profile. Pale fruit liqeurs dominate an otherwise lightly chewy malt body. I just don�t get the malt character and soft, estery yeast expression I want. Hops are right on with a blast of juicy cone resin in the back end. Fresh, but the yeast got ugly and takes the beer down. Not my kind of Dubbel.
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;About as good as most American brewpubs get when they try the Dubbel. I still encourage them to try...but few can get it right. I can�t remember if I was served in the right glass when I had this...
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Listed as ""Otto�s Dubbel Ale"" - I had this on draft at the brewery. First impressions are that it smells and tastes a bit stale, but I�m learning that this is probably a product of the house yeast - I find this presence in almost every Otto�s beer. The thickness is remarkable, since it appears, at least to my palate, that they didn�t use candy sugar and instead just used straight malt to get the gravity - the effect being of course that the body is far too thick for a proper dubbel. Doesn�t mean this beer doesn�t taste good, in fact it�s delicious, though the banana is a little too dominant, and the requisite clove character is a little too subdued. Brash and slightly metallic at times, with a decent hop bitterness, also not to-style, but still tasty. Reminds me of a fresh New Belgium Dubbel but of course with a much higher gravity, or at least I perceive it to be too vinuous and heavy."
Ottos Abbey Dubbel;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Otto's Pub and Brewery;I still haven�t had a Dubbel that I really loved. This one was good, deep color and some sticky-sweet maltiness, molasses or caramel or something, but I would�ve rather had something else. Oh well, worth a shot.
Ottos Maerzen Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Copper color with aroma of caramel malt, toffee, and cinnamon. Tastes caramel malty, with firm palated toffee, hops, and nuts.
Ottos Maerzen Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Light malts and a little hops. Weak overall aroma. Iced tea clear liquid with wispy lacing off-white head. Light medium carb and medium watery body. Muted sweetness to start with light bitterness. The finish is clean with light bitter. After is nutty sweet. Refreshing and smooth but not remarkable.
Ottos Maibock;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Tap from the source. Gorgeous clear copper-orange with a short white head. Beautiful grainy, heavily malty nose that continues in the mouth, half-sweet but not annoying and indeed very rounded with honeyed edges. Hints of orange and melanoidin, some paler Pils/wheat at the margins, minimal spice, clean and malty medium-full body, repeatable. Knocked it out of the park, awesome. [2018.07.09: 4.1]
Ottos Maibock;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Otto's Pub and Brewery;This isn't a style I gravitate towards, so I wasn't very excited to try this one. Malt-forward lager with some sharp bite from hops (and perhaps the yeast used?). It is a more complex beverage than I was expecting, but not one I'd order again.
Ottos Maibock;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear amber with a thin white head.

Ottos Maibock;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Transfer from BA review on 3-27-12 - Served in a pint glass Appearance � Served a nice amber color with a light white head. The head faded fast giving way to some a very small amount of lacing. Smell � The smell is mainly malty in nature with an ever so light amount of sweetness. The maltiness is bready with a light yeast aroma mixed in. The sweetness is of toffee and a bit of caramel. Taste � The taste is very similar to the nose; it starts out malty and ends a little bit sweeter. In the beginning nice tastes of some roasted malt and a little bit of wheat meet the tongue. These are sweetened as the taste progresses with flavors of toffee and caramel. The mix of flavors then mixes with an ever so light hopiness and some alcohol flavor come in to take the taste profile to its finish. Mouthfeel � The mouthfeel is rather moderate and the carbonation level is quite average. It is very easy to drink. Overall �A nice bready brew that is very easy to drink."

Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask at Otto�s. Very mild brown ale, light biscuit and roasted grain notes. Mild beany hops. Clean. Dark coppery amber clears with creamy off-white lacing head. Medium body with cask carbonation. Mild brown, light sweet and nutty. Good roasted malt flavor. Big hop presence but not harsh. Nice rounded dry bitterness to the finish with light nutty after.
Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask at the brewpub. Pours a clear, brown colored body with a finger-width, creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is pretty light. Some grainy caramels with a medium sweetness, a hint of chocolate, and nuts. Flavor is a bit better, but still on the light side of things. Some more grainy caramels, sweet nuts, chocolate, and a hint of toast. Finishes a tad dry and smooth with a light sweetness. Shorter aftertaste following a medium, smooth body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty lame offering from Ottos. Not a lot going on here.
Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Not sure which Otto brown I had, didn�t look closely at name, will move this rating later. Nice appearance, dark brown with orange highlights, clear. Heavy lacing. Not much of a nose, a bit grainy. Creamy feel. Simple body, mild malt, slight hop finish. Very average.
Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Sampled on cask at Zeno�s this beer poured a medium caramel-brown color with a medium sized soapy beige head that produced good lacing. The aroma was lightly bitter and roasty with touches of coffee, wood and toffee. The flavor was tangy and bitter with sour nut, light roasty malts and wood with a touch of floral hops. The finish was long, tangy, woody and roasty. A bit thin in body. The elements do not mix very well and the beer just does not work. Less than the sum of it�s parts. Disappointing.
Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask at the brewpub. Pours brown-red with small, lacy ivory head.

Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Cask. Copper pour with minimal 0ff-white head. Aroma was caramel malt, some maple syrupy brown sugary notes, slight almonds and walnuts. Medium palate; not terribly complex, with flavors of caramel malt up front and mid-palate honey and almond flavor. Very smooth and drinkable."
Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On Cask at the brewpub. A succinct aroma of elephant shit and bear urine. This smells like a freakin� zoo. I recognize that it arises from typical malt characters and possibly ester formation, but it has been magnified so significantly that it just smells terrible to me. Rubbery. This beer reeks. I can�t believe I�m giving a craft Otto�s beer this low of an aroma rating. Pours beautifully, with a deep rich mahogany tone and ruby corners, floating a supreme cream head above. Flavor doesn�t stray too far from the aroma, there�s an unpleasant sensation of burning crude oil, the licking of tires, and an acidic mouthful of coal. This mingles with a standard hazlenut and browned butter brown malt profile. Standard cask body and minimal hop presence. Sans the revolting malt character, this beer doesn�t carry that much complexity or flavor. And the cask sensation isn�t all the phenomenal either. It isn�t particularly drinkable nor fulfilling. Right on par with Newcastle in my opinion, somewhat unfortunately. I wish I had better things to say about a craft brewers cask brown, but this wasn�t working.
Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Cask (forced). Nitro forced cask ale, which is weird. Appearance is clear brown and burgundy hues at the edges of the glass, with a firm cream colored head on top. Nose is sweet malts, honey and maple sugar. Flavor is mostly toasted malts, toast bread, light honey and malt syrup. Dry like an Irish stout, so I guess the nitro body isn�t so bad. Crisp and light.
Ottos Arthurs Nut Brown;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Cask. Clear brown body with a nice size head that stayed for a while leaving a decent size ring around the glass. sweet nutty aroma. Flavor is slightly bitter sweet with a little nutty kick. Smooth.

The Tap Robust Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a sly film of a little off white foamy head. Subtle stringy lace. The aroma coughed up some roast and sweet milk and dark chocolate malts to present a good strength with a big coffee bean roastiness. Light earthy hops at the end. The flavor was the roastiness, pretty bold up front with the chocolates combining really nice with the coffee bean. Not much of an aftertaste - slightly dark chocolate-like. Dry sort of roasty finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a pretty good sessionability about it. Good carbonation and ABV. Overall, pretty good porter - worthy to crush during early Spring or mid Autumn.
The Tap Robust Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Cask: Very strong dry coffee aroma and flavor. Rich on the mocca feeling you would expect for such a dark brew, though, it gave me even more flavor than expected for a brew on 4,5%. Very nice!

The Tap Robust Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Cask, GBBF2003. Jet black, poor beige head and moderate condition. Chocolate and licorice dominate both the aromas and flavour, with some roast barley apparent in the finish.
The Tap Robust Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Gravity Cask, GBBF 2003 Some cheese in aroma and taste. OK, but going nowhere special. Duff gulped the rest before I could finish!
The Tap Robust Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;I wasn't so impressed by this. Milky and dry in aroma, with some manure/barnyard notes. Similar flavor profile. Quite thin, perhaps as expected from the style but in a way that is not comfortable. (gravity pour at GBBF 2003)
The Tap Robust Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Cask, GBBF. Medium bodied, strong coffee and caramel flavor. Tastes a bit like baileys cream. Sweet but lots to compensate. Long roasted malt finish. I like it!
The Tap Robust Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;NERAX, Somerville, MA: Cask Sample. A musky sweet aroma. Dark color with a thin head. It was very delicate. Layered flavors were subtle and a little hard to pick out (I should have had more than 1/4 pint sample). Mildly hoppy, with bitter leave. Well done, especially for such a new brewery.

Nose is caramel malts and a fruity hop note. Flavor is light toffee, hints of nuts and toast. It did have a creamy texture so the carbonation was there despite the fizzy dying head. Overall ok.

Nail Ale;Bassendean, WA, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Nail Brewing Australia;375 ml yellow can. Appearance is a hazy translucent dull orange tone, topped with thin and very transient white froth. Aromas are non-hoppy - malty, bready, earthy and yeast. Taste is typical for malt based brew, medium mouthfeel and body, malty, grainy tastes with some light floral bitter. Not your typical pale ale, but a good take on a malty alternative.

More depth and bitterness in the taste makes this a pleasant refreshing ale. Finish is dry and grainy. Easy drinking.

Hofbrauhaus Newport Dunkel (Altmunchner Dunkelgold);Newport, Kentucky, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Hofbrauhaus Newport;Pours a dark clear liquid with a good sense of malt and grains.

Couple ropes and splotches of lace. Good head retention. Lighter body. Kind of a light bite in the texture. Sort of smooth, lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Taste is a lot worse than expected. Very much like a coors light or something. Moderate bitter, big bite in the finish. Not much aroma to speak of, wet bread, lightly peppery. Mostly watery with a totally unnecessary bite. Like sex in a canoe. Not good at all, very sub par for a bavarian style lager. Par for the course for a cheap macro-lager that�s probably sat around for a bit.

Fredericksburg Maibock;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;2009 Tap. A nice maibock, surprisingly found in South Central Texas.

Fredericksburg Maibock;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;A freind picked up a growler of this from the brewery in Fredericksburg over the weekend, brought it to work a day or two later to share. By that time a bit of the aerated liveliness (and head/lacing potential) had diminished, but that didn�t affect the taste. It had a lovely amber-gold color and was very tasty for a bock, a nicely sweet and hoppy. Reminded me a little of the Sierra Nevada ESB - might have been the sweet balance with the hops. Not sure why. Did they use Cascade? Served chilled but not COLD, felt nice and warm on the tongue. Was very good for a south Texas microbrew. I was (am) impressed.

The poor little girl who answered the phone didn;t even know if they had a maibock on draft. She coulldn't figure out what I was talking about so I finally hung up on her. It's hard to find good help these days. Super sweet. Very little depth. decent mouthfeel. a bit of spicy hops comes out at the end."

McNeill's Dubbel;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;McNeill's Brewery;Hazy mahogany with an of white head. I smell corn silage from my Grandparents farm. I guess I know why the cows dig this shit so much. Quite sweet with some raisin conotations in the middle. Not the best dubbel I have had...kinda reminds me of the Lake Placid Dubbel Bogey.
McNeill's Dubbel;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;McNeill's Brewery;Aroma is sweet and sugary. Kind of strong. Pours a hazy mahogany with an off-white head. Start is VERY sweet and VERY MALTY. I mena it�s decent, but nothing extraordinary. I reckon im going to give it a -1 point for appearance due to the trailer park label.
McNeill's Dubbel;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;McNeill's Brewery;Not impressed. Pours dirty iced tea. NO head. Some pleasant aromas fruity/malt maybe some chocolate coffee. Finish is sticky and flat.
McNeill's Dubbel;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;McNeill's Brewery;Dark ruby copper color with a thin light tan, short-lived head and mostly flat body. Sugary dark malt aroma with some fruitiness. Thin watery mouthfeel has a light sourness and plenty of sweetness to mask the alcohol quite well. Finishes sticky and sugary. Has a somewhat authentic bready Belgian malt character and hints of Belgian yeast. A decent dubbel, but not one of McNeill's better brews.
McNeill's Dubbel;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;McNeill's Brewery;Candi sugar and maple throwing their sweetness around to distract the confused tastebuds...Dirt and watery trashcans are mistakenly knocked over and the damage is irreparable...Caught in the chaos of a barley wine/brown ale interregnum...
McNeill's Dubbel;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;McNeill's Brewery;Half of a 660mL bomber into a Delirium Tremens glass. Body is chocolate milk brown with very low carbonation, off-white head is barely there, making just a ring around the glass. Weird nose for a dubbel: Where I expected dark berries and fruitiness was a vegetable touch, not particularly appealing, but classic vanilla and black chocolate are also there to save us from the disaster (a bland dubbel?!!). The taste is more interesting and complex than the aroma. Sweet chocolate bars slowly become bitter. The alcohol shows its nose together with a slight salty peak. The mouthfeel is a little thin and lacking as well. It's indeed not a typical dubbel and it's almost hard to understand why Mcneills would brew this (not representative of their qualities, it's not a good introduction to micros, their most hardcore fans just like pure belgians fans won't find this particularly attractive neither... anyway, I'm not here to judge, but to rate:)
McNeill's Dubbel;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;McNeill's Brewery;I had the Dubbel Vision at the brewery, and I'm assuming this is the same one. Pours a deep cloudy brown, with a dun colored, quickly dissipating head. Aroma is malty and big, with a slight alcohol bite. Flavor is huge. Tastes more like a barleywine to me. Big malt, with pretty agressive hopping. Slight nuttiness, big alcohol flavor, light notes of cherry, licorice, and raisin. A touch of coffee. A pretty swell barleywine, but I wouldn't call this a dubbel, unless you mean the color. Points boosted a little because it is an interesting beer, just not right for the style.
McNeill's Dubbel;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;McNeill's Brewery;Light nose. Fruity with chocolate and licourice. Nice hazy reddish brown color. Chocolate coffee with a cherry tartness. Has a slight hop bitter in finish otherwise finishes clean and smooth. Not what I was expecting at all. I'll have to live with the fact that mcneills came up short on one.
Mill Street Stock Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Pours clear yellow-gold colour with a thin white head that recedes steadily.

Mill Street Stock Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Bottled. Half-hazy yellow body, small white head. The aroma has yeast, the taste is like a pils, with citrus.
Mill Street Stock Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle, This is a really funny one, great beer out of the bottle but terrible from the tap! I don�t understand it but everyone I know says the same thing. Steer clear of the draft here.

Jab�onowo Belfast 8.1 %;W�lka Kosowska, Poland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Browar Jablonowo;500ml can (Carrefour, Warsaw) Very very dark red, fizzy head. Huge sticky mashy malty and roasty porridge of an aroma. Quite a refreshing palate, pleasant carbonation. Retronasals both light and fruity, and heavy and burnt. Some cardboard there too, maybe something lactic. Taste is a dry burntness, with a slightly artificial extract-style hoppiness, with paperiness accompanying. Finish is a touch sticky and dry, some ash, and a few alcoholic vapours. Definitely a lagery taste, but packed full of flavours of various qualities. Can�t make up my mind about this one. I�ll leave the numbers to the end, and rate on hedonism...
Jab�onowo Belfast 8.1 %;W�lka Kosowska, Poland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Browar Jablonowo;Can. Medium head with medium duration. Color is dark brown. Aroma and taste are sweet roast malt, caramel and notes of chocolate.
Jab�onowo Belfast 8.1 %;W�lka Kosowska, Poland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Browar Jablonowo;Bottled. Interesting malty aroma. Flavor is malty too but alcohol tones are strong. Not so bad.

Jab�onowo Belfast 8.1 %;W�lka Kosowska, Poland;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Browar Jablonowo;"Rated first time 15.01.2008 with ""chmurarz"" Can 500ml The majority of beer from Jablonowo Brewewry are poor, wattery, taste lacking, poor quality pilsners or other majority of strong lagers being mediocre as for Polish standards for a good strong lager beer. This one shares all the same features of unideality but to make it more interesting is Dunkler Bock. In fact the strategy of Jablonowo Brewery was to make a beer reminding Irish Stout, as the can says ""strong irish style stout"" what is bogus. The foam is initially thick, off-brown, first seemed firm and strong, but now it is getting bubbly very quickly, what stays is 3mm foam, colour of body: deep dark amber, like strong earl grey, aroma is sth like bock beer, malty and yeast, flavour; caramel, smooth, sweet, but unpleasant alcoholic nose, no smoke, no hops, no roast, some bitterness but dominated by alcohol. I have drunk more alcoholic beers so it is not that bad, but all in all poor brew lacking full taste and generally far below Polish average standards of beer. The taste pretends to be interesting but I think that is all what it does. Too simple, too flat, too much white sugar blended with beer. Each can tastes a bit different, I mean how they really managed to get any certificat of quality???"

Can not find any BBE information on the bottle. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is sweet malts, herbs, some slight alcohol, mild cardboardy notes (maybe a rather old bottle then?). Flavour is sweet malts, mild oxidated sweetness as well as some slight alcohol and mild bitterness in the finish.

Sweet malt aroma, with some cookie malt hints, and a very light, ""skunked"" Euro-hop suggestion. Very sweet flavor, with a slightly medicinal malt spiciness. Has a sweet nutty hint, almost honey-like, followed by a sweet/herbal-like finish. A bot too sweet overall."
Kiper Extra Jasne 8.1%;Piotrkow Tryb., Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Sulimar - Browar Cornelius;Bottle. Clear copper/amber colour, creamy white head that is fairly sticky. Sweet, slightly nutty aroma. A bit of brown sugar and a light grassy hop character. Surprisingly fresh-smelling. Flavour is quite sweet with wildflower honey, light caramel, and a fairly dry finish. It�s not bad, for what it is.
Kiper Extra Jasne 8.1%;Piotrkow Tryb., Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Sulimar - Browar Cornelius;Bottle: Pellucid copper, light head and lacing. Nose of bright sweet malts and light hops. The flavor is stale, fruity and bright with alcohol, lots of corny alcohol and rice. LAme malt liquor. Bah!
Kiper Extra Jasne 8.1%;Piotrkow Tryb., Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Sulimar - Browar Cornelius;"Dark honey colour is matched by the nose. Aside from that, this ""extra"" beer is sweetish and alcoholic. Not much personality or distinction. Worth the $1.37 I paid, but not the 3 mile drive. I did finish the 13 ounce bottle nonetheless."
Kiper Extra Jasne 8.1%;Piotrkow Tryb., Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Sulimar - Browar Cornelius;Clear bubbly gold with a lasting medium white head. Aroma is corny sweet with a bit of bubble gum. Flavor is same and mild with a bit of grass. Not bad, but apparently I overpaid a bit at $2.85/13.52 oz. No integrated price label on mine.
Kiper Extra Jasne 8.1%;Piotrkow Tryb., Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Sulimar - Browar Cornelius;Good looking, at least. It pours a deep golden body with a three-fingered creamy head that both lingers and laces throughout the experience. The aroma is a light malt with rock rock candy and some recently mown grasses. Very soft and fluffy in the mouth and slightly oily. The flavor is sweet and bready with perhaps a touch of corn and a very mild grassy bitterness. Sugary sweet finish. The sturdy ABV is well hidden throughout. Not too bad. Corner Cottage, Elmhurst, IL
Kiper Extra Jasne 8.1%;Piotrkow Tryb., Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Sulimar - Browar Cornelius;Oh man. LOL this beer is amazing. It�s the first bottled beer out of almost 1000 that the price tag is printed on the label as $1.25. It looks like something that should be sitting in the dollar store. That alone is amazing. To ship this across the sea and have a 13.xx ounce bottle be profitable.. wow. My expectations were low, but this ended up to be fairly enjoyable. Clear orange, moderate head, decent lacing. Aroma is light corn, some caramel, hint of hops and alochol. Fairly sweet finish with a light to medium body. Not bad for what it is. Possibly my first Polish beer.
Kiper Extra Jasne 8.1%;Piotrkow Tryb., Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Sulimar - Browar Cornelius;Bottle. Yellow and clear in color with no head. Corn and malty aroma. Caramel notes. Corny flavor. Thin bodied. Ok.

Samuel Adams LongShot Molasses Coffee Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Boston Beer Company;Bottled (from 1997, sampled 2000 and 2004). Black, no head. Very full bodied. Roasty coffe taste. Oily mouthfeel. Crude, but flavourful and interesting.
Samuel Adams LongShot Molasses Coffee Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Boston Beer Company;This beer was actually called �Molasses Coffee Stout�. It was from the second round of Long Shot beers - in two years (1996 and 1997) Boston Beer Company produced beers from homebrew recipes. This was from the second year. This was the only one from that year I actually had (the other two that I unfortunately missed included an ESB called Longshot Special English Ale and a Bock called Longshot Bock). From what I recall, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was black with a medium-dark head. The aroma had typical burnt smells including coffee and dark chocolate. But I do remember a distinct caramel and molasses note to the aroma. And to the flavor. The mouthfeel was very full and thick. The flavor was bitter coffee stout by not dry thanks to the sweet caramel and molasses flavors.
Samuel Adams LongShot Molasses Coffee Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Boston Beer Company;sampled in September 2000 - deep black colour, few head, fine coffee aroma, smooth, sweet molasses flavor following by a explosion of mocha - quite original
Samuel Adams LongShot Molasses Coffee Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Boston Beer Company;"One of 3 beers brewed for Longshot by Boston Beer Co. I, unlike many posts I�ve seen, happened to enjoy this beer. Nice appearance and great aroma, it was extremely sweet, almost overbearing hazelnut coffee flavor at first but after a few sips, went down smooth with roasted molasses notes; being as sweet as it was you couldn�t drink a lot of these but 1 or 2 was a treat."

Samuel Adams LongShot Molasses Coffee Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Boston Beer Company;NERAX '03: This beer wins the dreaded Volgon Worst Beer At Show award.

Magic Hat Matty OCohens Dry Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Cask at the Blind Tiger. Interesting beer. Kind of tart, carbonic aroma, a little chalk. Very carbony flavor, graphite, definite sour mash. Very traditional tasting, like I am drinking back in 1870. Interesting. My rating is probably a bit generous.
Magic Hat Matty OCohens Dry Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Cask at Blind Tiger. Deep black beer with a thin white head. Aroma is pretty rich and coffeeish with a lot of cocoa sweetness. The flavour is a bit cocoaish and lightly herbal. Fairly tart initially on the palate. The flavour is lightly cocoaish and lightly herbal . The palate is quite thin and it tastes a little bit watery. It�s not all that bad, but it smells a whole lot better than it tastes.
Magic Hat Matty OCohens Dry Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Cask at BT. Pours a black body with ruby hues and a thin lacing of dark coffee bourbon head, if that makes any sense. LIghtly sweet malty aroma, very thin paper and soy notes, water with a hint of wood and burnt malt.
Magic Hat Matty OCohens Dry Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Cask @ Blind Tiger. Pours a deep black with a quickly-dissipating tan head. Aroma is heavy chocolate and roasted to burnt malt. Taste is largely the same, though it pulls off the sweetness rather well. It�s nothing spectacular, but it�s solid.
Magic Hat Matty OCohens Dry Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);(draft @ The Old Toad - Rochester, NY) Dark black pour with a mound of tan foam. Aroma is very burnt with a little hint of chocolate. Not much else. Flavor is bitter, burnt, and ashy. Way too much roasted flavor. It definitely overpowers the entire beer. Some chocolate at the end but it was very weak and not very pleasant.
Magic Hat Matty OCohens Dry Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Not impressed at all. Very watered down with not much flavor. Black pour with brown head, little aroma and very weak body.

I wrote �Magic Hat Matty O�Connors Irish Stout� which I�m assuming must be this. Pours a very dark brown with an average size fluffy light-brown head. Mild aroma of lightly roasted mat, some coffee and a hint of chocolate. Slightly watery flavour of mild roasted malt, coffee and a bit of chocolate. Average bodied (should be fuller for a Stout imo). Not bad, a decent Stout.
Magic Hat Matty OCohens Dry Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Dry;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at Cole�s. Black, small tan head. Sweet aroma, odd for a dry stout. Decent roast in taste, but body is thin, bubbly, and a tad watery, which took away from the overall impact. I liked it, but only ok at best.

Vermont Pub Billybuck Bock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Poured a hazy gold with and amber hue and a white head that dissipated to the edges. Aroma had a bit of light fruit but main notes were crisp grain and bread. Flavor was similar with crisp grain and a bit of bread with a hint of backing light citrus.
Vermont Pub Billybuck Bock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Tap at Vt pub. Dunkler bock? Pours a clear golden with a thin head- should be heller bock. Aroma is gritty, cracker, toast, grass, sharp burnt biscuits and toast, cereal, light floral hops. Flavor is doughy wheat, light caramel, caravienne lgith toasty biscuitiness, then cereal grit, and lacks a big syrupy sweetness that i was expecting- finsih was pretty good. Not bad.
Vermont Pub Billybuck Bock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Vermont Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clean clear orange gold with a thin white head.

Typical caramel malty bock aroma with some mustiness. Body is semi-dry and grainy with some bready notes and caramely sweetness. An ok bock, but could use some more balance.
Vermont Pub Billybuck Bock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"A new VT Pub beer, close on the heels of three new 3 Needs and preceding a new McNeills! We're in Vermont beer heaven, folks! Well, if this were really good, anyways, which unfortunately its not. Light golden, slight head, uh-oh looks awfully light for a bock. Some malty hints in the weak nose, but the bar smoke does that in. Flavor is pleasant, clean, malty caramel with hints of peat; body is medium, buttery, with a little hop bite at the very end. Not terrible, but probably not to be drunk again by me."
Mary Ann Jubilee;St Saviour, Jersey;Pilsener - Imperial;Liberation Brewery;Hazy yellow color, ultra fast dying head. Mild herby and cheesy aroma with some spicy hints. Weird. Spruce and yeast flavor. Dry. Not very good.

Mary Ann Jubilee;St Saviour, Jersey;Pilsener - Imperial;Liberation Brewery;A hazy orange beer with no head. The aroma is sweet with notes of metal. The flavor is sweet and flat with stronger notes of metal than malt. Not my style and even a bad attempt at a European Strong Lager.
Mary Ann Jubilee;St Saviour, Jersey;Pilsener - Imperial;Liberation Brewery;Cloudy pale color, no head. Poor aroma, with some herbs. Bad taste, with tobacco. Almost disgusting!
Mary Ann Jubilee;St Saviour, Jersey;Pilsener - Imperial;Liberation Brewery;Bottled: Light yellow coloured. Off white fluffy head. Fruit and malt in the aroma. Sweet and malty flavour. Alcohol in the end. This is not a very good beer.
Mary Ann Jubilee;St Saviour, Jersey;Pilsener - Imperial;Liberation Brewery;"Very pale amber; no head. Nutty, cookies nose. Nothing else. Taste: pure walnut, walnut oil, ending in walnut peel bitterness. Some cookie malt underneath. Finish gives some alcohol. Mineral water-like MF, flat as a pancake. In the aftertaste, the bitterness fades away. Can�t imagine it was much to start with, but age certainly didn�t yield any hidden treasures."
Mary Ann Jubilee;St Saviour, Jersey;Pilsener - Imperial;Liberation Brewery;The Ann Street Brewery, which also trades as The Jersey Brewery, makes the Mary Ann and Pony brand beers. Founded in 1905, the brewery stopped making cask ales between 1950 and 1992, and now only makes cask beer at the Tipsy Toad site. Bottled and keg beer is made at the main site. This Jubilee Lager was originally brewed for the 1977 Jubilee. A fairly straighforward strong lager it has little of interest apart from an industrial taste of oil and metal.

Barley's Dunkel Weizen;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Barley's Brewing Company;I haven't had too many dark wheat beers, and while this is a decent summer beer it's not something I would get often considering all the better brews Barley's has to offer. Pours a dark orangish-red with a thin light beige head. Very little lacing. Strong wheat aroma. Relatively light-bodied, with wheat and fruit flavors. Finish is kind of crisp, but overall I found this beer to be a little simple.

Heavenly Daze Heavenly Hemp Lager;Denver, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heavenly Daze Brewery;This doesnt taste like any other hemp beers Ive had.

The aroma was awesome, with huge citrus pine hoppyness and intresting earthy notes. teh flavors wernt�t as good as the smelll pumped me up for, though. Grainy and coarse mouthfeel.

Heavenly Daze Heavenly Hemp Lager;Denver, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heavenly Daze Brewery;"Clear gold with a dead head (get it, Deadhead?). Sweet malts, sweet hops and a sweet aroma. Hemp aroma/flavor is only slightly noticeable, much less than other hemp ales I've had. Nicely carbonated and nicely balanced. Further down the glass, hop bitterness seemed to improve, and finally caught up to the sweetness. Malts became somewhat thickish, offering a decent mouthfeel. Overall I thought it was a pretty tasty brew; I'd definitely order one again."
Heavenly Daze Sunrise Rye;Denver, Colorado, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Heavenly Daze Brewery;"Hopefully I caught this one on a bad day: Clear as a bell, amber in color, no lasting head. Hardly any carbonation either, which made the mouthfeel flat and watery. Small amount of the typical ""rye-like"" notes, though very subdued. Had more of a ""root-like"" characteristic that made it earthy. Slight fruitiness. Overall, a little too bland, light and lacking."

Vanuatu Premium Bitter;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;On tap at Grand Casino Port Vila. Rating from January 2014. At least it was cold, probably the best thing I can say about it.
Vanuatu Premium Bitter;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;Compared with the regular Tusker, this is heavier, with more of a malt accent, but less flavour overall. Ok, but the lack of hop hurts it.
Vanuatu Premium Bitter;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;On tap (March 2012) Pale golden colour with medium head. Light and refreshing, with a mild hop finish and pleasant enough.
Tuskers Premium Ale;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Wheat Ale;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;Pretty lame beer. I prefer a bolder ipa though so my opinion could be biased.
Tuskers Premium Ale;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Wheat Ale;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;"I�ve been living here in Vanuatu for 2 years now and have had the displeasure of having to drink this pisswater. The only thing worse than the taste is the price: $2-$3 per bottle. They refer to their beer as ""export quality"", which makes it even more ridiculous."
Tuskers Premium Ale;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Wheat Ale;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;500ml. Thick white head with strong, thick, clinging lace. Golden-yellow (piss) in color. Taste was equally as lame. Very average lager with slight buttery taste to initial flavor. The only thing worse than the taste of this beer is the linger on the palate. Yuk! By the way, the bottle was one month over it's time. Skunked.
Tuskers Premium Ale;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Wheat Ale;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;This beer has one of the foulest smells I have ever smelt. Its almost like vomit. The taste isn't much better although the colour is a nice gold. Overall not very impressive at all.
Tuskers Premium Ale;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Wheat Ale;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;AIBA 2003: Surprisingly there was some flavour in this one. A strange buttery, toffee like character, still, pretty unpleasant.
Southern Cross Stout;Port Vila, Vanuatu;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Vanuatu Brewing Limited;AIBA 2003: a bit ugly, sweet brown sugar and mollasses, with some roasted malt in the finish. A bit nasty and sweet. Still, it was interesting to have a stout from Vanuatu.

Low carbonation. Equal malt aroma and flavour as is expected with red ales, yet a profound citrus hop finish that adds a nice touch to this red. Some floral aromas and flavours. The carbonation needs fixing, but otherwise great.

Nose shows massive toasty/nutty malt and caramel alongside a heap of earthy, resinous hops... nice! Similar hops and malt follow as flavours, although the hops take a more dominant role with big resinous notes and a pronounced bitterness. Carbonation is a bit high for these flavours.

James Squire Brewhouse The Craic Irish Stout;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Stout - Dry;James Squire Brewhouse;i think if you compare it to other irish stouts it more than stands up. better than any guinness you will get in Australia, and in my opinion has much more flavour than most modern irish stouts. it was thick and creamy but had a great nutty biscuit flavour to it. it probably doesnt have the depth to score high points with beer geeks but for a good session nitro stout it hits the spot.
James Squire Brewhouse The Craic Irish Stout;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Stout - Dry;James Squire Brewhouse;Tap at James Squire, Melbourne CBD. Remarkable beer, but served too cold, so I had to wait for a while to enjoy it. The aroma is not intense &#40nitrogen effect?&#41, and has liquorice, dark fruit, and coffee. Flavour is predominantly sweet, but there is bitterness at the end. Creamy in the palate, with a medium-full body. Black colour, with a head that is off-white and long-lasting.

James Squire Brewhouse The Craic Irish Stout;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Stout - Dry;James Squire Brewhouse;Not big on stouts and this one didn�t change my opinion either. Perhaps the Guiness has faulted me. I fond this lacking strength. Soft stout with no body.

Wittmann Urhell;Landshut, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Carl Wittmann;Slightly metallic, mouthfeel a little hollow. Still refreshing and decent with some bratwurst on a crisp day outside.

Wittmann Urhell;Landshut, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Carl Wittmann;Advent Calendar: pours clear fizzy gold with a white head. Aroma is cheap, grainy lager mostly. Taste is sooo metallic. Anything positive is thoroughly vitiated.
Wittmann Urhell;Landshut, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Carl Wittmann;"Crystal clear, golden coloured body with a pure white head, about a centimetre tall that fades pretty quickly and leaves a very ugly lace on the side of the glass. Aroma of grass, hay, cereal, grain, yeast, bread, funk and a little bit of soap - with not much too exciting and no hops at all, aside from the dashes of grass. Light-bodied; Strong grassy and very herbal notes up front with a more assertive yeast and bready flavour with some grain towards the end and a good hit of the floral and lightly herbal components with a more of a metallic twang and pungency throughout. Aftertaste shows the grasses for sure, but with the light sweetness and grain/cereal/yeast there is nothing really else to sample with this one - fairly bland ad underwhelming, which in some respects is good, but just mellow overall. I sampled this 500 mL can as Day Nineteen [of twenty-four] of the 2018 Christmas Advent Calendar, purchased from Costco in Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia on 30-September-2018 for US$59,99/twenty-four, sampled at my house here in Washington on 20-December-2018."

Clear caramel malt aroma and a touch of nut. A smooth palate, light in body with a short finish. Medium sweetness, caramel, but finishes abruptly. Great initial nose and flavor, but very little lingers to savor. A good pairing, however, with a corned beef sandwich, each enhancing the flavor of the other.
New Holland Red Tulip;Holland, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Sampler at the brewpub (Holland, MI). Missed this last time and have been looking for it for awhile. Pours a deep dark copper, reddish and a decent haze with a sizable offwhite head that eventually dies to a thicker film, laces ok. Aromas are mellow, caramel and toffee, toast and bready malts mix with decent florals, a touch of dryness on the nose. Simple Red. Initial is a pretty thick caramel and toffee bomb, moves to medium bodied with a good sweetness overall, caramel and a touch of nuttiness move into toast, bread, and a light floral hopping. Pretty malty and not my kind of red ale. Quite toasty and malty, light florals provide insufficient bitterness. Not my thing, almost some black olive showing up in there which is weird.

New Holland Red Tulip;Holland, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from busch�s grocery store in Novi. This pours a reddish amber with off white head. I was actually somewhat dissapointed with this, as I was expecting a lot more flavor and better mouthfeel, but this is by no means a bad beer. It�s a great session brew, with decent flavor. Despite this, I probably won�t be getting this any time soon, as there are so many more brews from NH that I haven�t tried. Cheers!

The nose on this beer is very nice with aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, and a slight bit of roast. The body is soft and lean with some good flavors of bitter sweet chocolate and coffee flavors on the tongue. Bube�s Porter finishes with some more chocolate and coffee up front, then ends with just a touch of roast that slightly lingers. A nice beer to relax with at the Bottle Works(the pub) at Bube�s Brewery, and a great beer to pair with sinfully delicious made ""from scratch"" peanut butter pie with a chocolate graham cracker crust on the desert menu."

Bubes Porter;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Bubes Brewery;Black as night. Light brown head with middling retention. Deep smoky flavor. Medium bitterness. Lacks some of the sweetness apparent in other porters. Could easily be mistaken for a stout. May not be a good example of the style, but a great flavorful beer nonetheless.
Mill Street Tankhouse Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Distillery Bar in Pearson airport Terminal 3, on tap. Really full bodied ale, nice bitterness, good color. Very enjoyable!
Mill Street Tankhouse Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Tawny with a small head.Quite a lot of carbonation upon opening. Some maltiness but lacks the fresh clean flavour of other organic beers I have tried. Can't understand why such an average beer which is lacking in any outstanding flavours rates so highly.
Mill Street Tankhouse Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);A copper coloured beer with a traditional malt character and fairly strongly hopped. Always gives some dry caramel and bready taste with prominent leafy and pine hops, enough hops to be more on the bitter than malty side. Medium body but pretty easy to drink these. Always a good standby in Toronto, well made and consistent, Toronto's answer to Sam Adams.

Chicago Maibock;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Chicago Brewing Company;pours clear pale golden with a lasting white ring for a head. the aroma is really faint... maybe some grain, brown sugar and soapy/floral/perfume. luckily it tastes like something... grain/malt, caramel, flowers and a spicy finish. it gets really boozy as it warms and is really felt in the belly. it is only 7% yet this thing is a monster. medium bodied though it feels rather thin from the alcohol content. 3/3/4/3/10/2.3
Chicago Maibock;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Chicago Brewing Company;Really no aroma. Taste is okay, like some other pale bocks, a little too strainy and alcoholic for me. Just an okay beer for me. Nothing amazing.
Chicago Maibock;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Chicago Brewing Company;CBC does it again! Nice deep golden color with a strong hint of fruit and liquor. Sits very nicely on the palate with hints of spice and liquor and goes does nice and warm.

Mudshark Havasu Helles;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Mudshark Brewing Company;Standard golden color with an impressive head. Toasty aroma with promised toasty malt flavors. Well-intended sweet citrusy tones, but they don't quite fit. But this is a decent micro lager.
Mudshark Scorpion Amber Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mudshark Brewing Company;12 oz single bottle from Total Wine & More - Gilbert, AZ. Clear amber appearance with a tiny off-white head, fully dissipating. Aroma of caramel, nutty malts, light toffee and light hops. Similar flavor, adding moderate malt sweetness and a touch of hop bitterness. Light to medium body. A little generic and slightly boring overall.
Mudshark Scorpion Amber Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mudshark Brewing Company;Definitely a good dose of dry earthy hops, but not a whole lot else going on. Standard rather thin amber otherwise.
Mudshark Scorpion Amber Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mudshark Brewing Company;Amber with a small frothy beige head. Caramel. Bread crust. Earth. Dry. Currently listed here as a Pale Ale??? Must be a mistake as this is clearly an Amber. As an amber, I�ve had much much worse. Better than the typical amber.

Aroma is nutty caramel and chocolate malts, with a hint of earthy sweet hops. Taste is all malt, nice nut brown caramel qualities, sweet earth. Not a bad red, but nothing too awesome.
Mudshark Scorpion Amber Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mudshark Brewing Company;"A soft pour into my Bruery tulip produces a five finger thick, almost overflowing, excessive, amber tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a deep amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a berry and citrus like fruitiness to it that is backed by some sweet tea, English biscuit, and brown whole grain cracker like malt character. There is a sharpness to the finish that seems a touch off, but not overly so. The beer is a touch sweet, quite fruity with a melon like note that gets a little bit funky towards the finish. The funky fruitiness is the predominant character here; there is a backing, subtle, crystal malt character that leans towards toasted brown crackers, and touches of brown sugar. There are some higher alcohols, lots of esters, and just a general almost rotten fruit character to the flavor. The body is a bit light, but not overly watery. Definitely not good, it is interesting that a brewery can be around for so long and not figure out basic sanitation; most of their beer is likely consumed on site, so they don�t really notice, but if you are going to send beer out, you got to tighten things up a bit."
Mudshark Scorpion Amber Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mudshark Brewing Company;Amber pour with an off white head. Plenty of caramel malts with some roastiness, taste is sweet and similar to the nose with some hops lingering at the end.

Light lacing. Aroma is esters and a hint of phenols. Flavor is lightly sweetened malt, esters, and some hop spiciness. Medium body. Not quite sure what to make of this beer. It�s OK. Don�t think it would have much of a shelf life. Worth a try.
Mudshark Scorpion Amber Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mudshark Brewing Company;Brown coloured beer with almost no carbonation and a small off-white head.

Pours clear amber color with tan head. Active carbonation. Aroma has caramel, florals, and cracker. Taste is sweet with light bitterness. There is some metallic notes as well.

Monte Carlo Brown Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Brown Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Tap at brewpub. Pours an anemic brown with a curious aroma of weak tea and malt. Nutty, buttery, and powdery chocolate on the tongue. Watery mouthfeel.
Monte Carlo Brown Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Brown Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;"Called ""Spiced Brown"" When I had it (Feb 2005), and our waitress didn�t know if it was different from a regular brown ale.

Bitter End Poindexter Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Decent brew from a great brewery. Really quite refreshiong and clean but just lacks the body and robustness of the Live oak pilz. Golden pale straw color. Almost Canary yellow. Nice whte head that is frothing and mountainous. Smells like saaz. This lager yeast strain seems to be a bit more dry in the fnish in the nose and palate than others. Less fruity and spicy and much more like paper. Flavors of grass, clove like spiciness and the typical atsringent bitterness all good pilz�s give off. Could have more body on the back and. Could be less dry. Still refreshing though. Grat

Bitter End Poindexter Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Color of american standard. Thin and fizzy head. Clean nose. Could use more effervescence. Do all Bitter End beers suffer form this under-carbonation? It is not a matter of them being flat or even faux-cask conditioned, they just are lacking ""spark""! The head was fizzy, but not on the tongue. Good drying hops. As it warms, it gets better."
Bitter End Poindexter Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Probably the best pils I've ever had; this is leaps and bounds above the standard brewpub pils. Golden color and served in a proper pilsener glass. Very crisp hops backed by nice pale malts, I think. Just enough punch to command respect, but it is still just a pils so of course it isn't over the top. Not the least bit skunky, excellent clean finish. I want another!"

Keltek Revenge;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;Keltek Brewery;500ml bottle, bought from Tuckers Maltings, consumed at Kookfest, September 2006. Past its best before date, but I though it had held up reasonably well. Deep bronze colour. I thought it had a distinctly Belgian style aroma with yeasty and candi sugar notes. Very herbal tasting with plenty of liquorice too. Some sour cherry fruit. There�s a quite medicinal, herbal bitterness on the finish reminiscent of angostura. Rather thin body for a strong beer. All over the place, but interesting.

Aroma starts with intense citrus and pine but soon drifts off into a perfume and yeast note.

Ossett Old Gurners;Ossett, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ossett Brewery;"Chromate yellow beer with a sturdy, dense white head. Vanilla, chalk, pale malts initially, then fresh, noble UK hops kick in, and they mean business. What is more important, they smell clear and wholesome. Excellent bitter, hopcharacter-filled flavour; touch of lemon/lemonzeste, (pale) malts give body, but don�t interfere much in the taste - but the balance is just right. In fact, simple, hoppy as it is, it is so pleasing that it deserves extra marks for that. Light, maybe medium, but not watery; grist slickness, as the effect of dissolving some pale biscuits completely in sparkling water. Excellent beer, excellent brewery, IMO."

Pilot Bay Amber;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;Amber is found in many parts of the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania. It is an interesting substance that often has the remains of insects and/or other fossilised small organisms embedded in it. Perhaps this is what this beer needs. It is a beer with small and fleeting head, poor nose with a touch of fruitiness bordering on acidity. The taste is of a distinctive unfavourable tang that detracts from any potential balance and flavour. New Zealand produces some fine beer, this is not one of them.
Pilot Bay Amber;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;Yes it is amber in colour. small fluffy head, hoppy aroma and very bitter taste.

Speights Pilsener;Dunedin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Speights Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours murky golden, bubbly white head. Aroma has hops, slightly grassy, and a brief bready malt. Hops hit the tongue initially, developing into a nice dry bitterness. Bready malt stays in the background and balances nicely. Surpisingly nice and quenching from this brewer.
Speights Pilsener;Dunedin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Speights Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);The nose is hoppier than I expected. hints of passionfruit with a base of grainy malt. Flavours are quite sweet, although this is almost (but not quite) balanced by a bitterness from the hops - but is this enough to be classed as a pilsener? The sweetness is that of apple, with a bready malt in the background. Mildly dry yet short-lived finish. Certainly not bad, but rather one-dimensional.
Speights Pilsener;Dunedin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Speights Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Draught. Golden colour, mediumsized creamy head. Aroma is fruits, malts, hops and mild saltwaer. Flavour is malts, hops, saltater, fudge and some grassyness.

Wheaty malt aroma with some light grassy hops and some very very slight metal but it�s not a spoiler. Nice pale malt flavour with some faint but pleasant Sauvin and Saaz with more slight metal notes.

Watch City Obscurit� Tripel Brown;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Watch City Brewing Co.;Stale chocolate and bitter coffee grounds in the oxidised aroma. Opaque dark brown with very shy, large-bubbled, fully-diminishing tan head. Fruity, powdered chocolate and coffee grounds with some candied malt flavours. Lifeless and flat. Slick, syrupy mouthfeel. Though this bottle was purchased at the brewpub only hours previously, there were major problems with it. Sampled with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
Watch City Obscurit� Tripel Brown;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Watch City Brewing Co.;New England Road Trip Easter �05 with MartinT, tiggmtl and Rastacouere, beer #54. Bomber in the hotel room. Thick cola appearance...oxidized, chocolaty nose...bitter coffee-chocolate initially in the mouth promises much but delivers little as the body is dull and lifeless, thin and sour-fruity...just not good at all, but how much is due to poor bottling/storage I don�t know.
Watch City Obscurit� Tripel Brown;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Watch City Brewing Co.;From a low-filled bomber bought at the brewery : Coffee and oxidized berries seem bothered by the brown sugar...Plums and yeasty cocoa are distraught by the near lifeless body...Spices slowly abandon their post...Another terribly sad bottle job by Watch City which will have to be re-rated from the tap in the future...
Watch City Obscurit� Tripel Brown;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Watch City Brewing Co.;660mL. Reddish brown garnet. Low apparent carbonation contributes to the formation of a bare off-white ring. This is a bit unsatisfying for that type of beer. Extremely weird aroma emanates from obvious oxidation and carbonation problems through the bottling line that we�ve encountered in the past from Watch City. Their stuff seemed to be pretty good in the past, so I hope they can get this fixed, because this one made me think of a particular Simpsons episode in which Homer waters his old father�s field with plutonium thus developing a genetically modified mix between tomatoes and tobacco. This beer smells like tomacco as I imagine it, very seedy, cigar like and chocolatey/vanilla. Dull palate, a bit roasty, but overall stale due to oxidation, uninteresting malty, wheaty and yeast interplays. Uncarbonated texture, this could have been pretty good under other circumstances, but they seem to have been selling problematic for a while..
Watch City Obscurit� Tripel Brown;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Watch City Brewing Co.;"Okay, contradictions start right away here..Belgian Dark, says the label, but this is listed as a ""Tripel Brown""??? Tripels are not brown...who the what the hey? Anyway, the appearance? It�s a terribly dark brown color, we may as well call it black, with a head that�s a mere whisper that turns into a tan ring around the edge of the glass. Aroma: liquor, right off the bat, but sweet, albeit twisted, almost medicinal..and that�s all I can pull out! Other than to suggest...Jagermesiter? Taste: that same feel comes through here, thick, pungent, viscous, more like a port wine than anything I normally encounter in a beer, equipped with roasty malt flavors, a thick, full, very nice texture...this was an unexpected beer, delivering things that clearly deviate from the norm...amd I�ve got to nod to that! Didn�t match anything I�d encountered before, so it was very hard to compare and evaluate. For an experience and experiment, I gotta give this props!"
Watch City Obscurit� Tripel Brown;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Watch City Brewing Co.;Art of Beer Fest �04. Brown in color with ruby highlights and a small off-white head. Aroma of dark fruit and malt. Flavor is malty,with notes of toffee and roasted malt.

Babes Boston Lager;Rancho Mirage, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Babes Bar-B-Que & Brewhouse;Tap @ brewpub: copper body. Aroma is a trace of grassy spicy hops, but is mostly caramel and slightly darker malts. Extremely carbonated, I was having trouble finishing this. It might offer more complexity than SA, but I�d rather have SA.. damn.
Babes Boston Lager;Rancho Mirage, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Babes Bar-B-Que & Brewhouse;The name Boston lager may be a little deceiving as it's certainly an amber with more character and body than Sam Adams. Finishes well with a light dry citrus and smooth sweet nutty aftertaste.
Babes Maibock;Rancho Mirage, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Babes Bar-B-Que & Brewhouse;AKA Spring Lager. Clear golden bronze. Aroma is bready with light spicy hops. Not a lot of character and fairly flat. Alcohol hidden well. After a long hike it was still enjoyable.
Babes Maibock;Rancho Mirage, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Babes Bar-B-Que & Brewhouse;I had this as part of a sampler. It poured golden and had a very nice malty flavor. I thought it was very well done. I didn�t think it would pair well w/ the bbq�d ribs I was going to have (I went w/ the schwarzbier) otherwise I would have gotten a pint.
Babes Maibock;Rancho Mirage, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Babes Bar-B-Que & Brewhouse;Malt and alcohol emphasis, sweet and fruity. Nutty caramel and chocolaty, finishes sweet and warming.
B&O Station Light Rail Lager;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;B & O Station Brewery;"No aroma. Not as light in color as I had expected. Golden color, slight slight head. Tastes of corn & yeast. It would be easier to drink if I could drink that type of beer (light). Overall Impression: Better than coors. ""This is the kind of Light every brewpub should have to ween people off macros."""
B&O Station Light Rail Lager;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;B & O Station Brewery;From a sampler: I was very surprised at how good this beer is. This is the kind of Light every brewpub should have to ween people off macros. Pours a pale gold color with a thin white head. Mild effervescence and minimal lacing. The aroma is lightly hopped with a touch of malt. More body than you would expect, with a fairly hoppy flavor that lingers well past the point most Lights would give up. There isn't much else going on in the flavor other than a bit of malt, but this isn't supposed to be a complex beer. The finish is lightly bitter hops. Overall this is one of the best Lights I have had and would recommend it as a great gateway beer for the macro drinker.
B&O Station Light Rail Lager;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;B & O Station Brewery;this isn't your brother's (who plays football and playstation) bud lite. it's much smoother, easier to drink, and has more flavors. taste it, try it, i dare you. come to the b&o and say hi.
B&O Station Light Rail Lager;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;B & O Station Brewery;Light and crisp, B&O's lager is still more flavorful than most american standards you'll find. I couldn't pin down the flavors but it's pleasant. Great alternative to any macro out there.
B&O Station Light Rail Lager;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;B & O Station Brewery;"Smooth and light; some light sweet caramel in the malts. Finished crisply, but no real hop presence. The medium gold body was thin, but not watery - actually more body than I expected."
B&O Station Arroyo Amber;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;B & O Station Brewery;No aroma at all. Nice small head, and nice amber color. Flavor is kind of flat. Not too hoppy, more malty. Almost like a poor man�s ale (Anchor Steam. Easy to drink. Overall Impression: An ok amber. Would be a great cheap beer, like a Yuengling. Nice head and color.
B&O Station Arroyo Amber;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;B & O Station Brewery;From a sampler: This is more or less the standard Killian's equivalent you find at most brewpubs. Pours a dark amber color with a medium off-white head and thin lacing. Aroma of light malt and caramel. Medium-bodied with a decent mix of malt, caramel and hops. The finish is a little on the sweet side but there are enough hops to keep it from being too much. This beer is not bland, but it is not very exciting either.
B&O Station Arroyo Amber;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;B & O Station Brewery;this one surprised me. it's a refined killians. it's better, trust me, and worth the try. not as sweet as one might expect but not bitter either. it aint that bad, chad.
B&O Station Arroyo Amber;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;B & O Station Brewery;I'm not a fan of reds but tried to approach this objectively. Was heavier than I'd expected but seemed to have some hop flavors cutting through the sweetness. Great appearance however.
B&O Station Arroyo Amber;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;B & O Station Brewery;"This one started with an almost syrupy sweet thickness; thick caramel palate. Luckily, it finished dry, otherwise the sweetness would be overpowering."
B&O Station Youngstown Brown;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;B & O Station Brewery;No aroma. Nice dark brown, no head. Tastes nutty, roasty, and choclatey. Not too much flavor. A little watery. Very drinkable. Overall Impression: Not a great brown but not bad either.
B&O Station Youngstown Brown;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;B & O Station Brewery;From a sampler: Pours a nice dark brown color with a medium tan head. Decent lacing throughout. The aroma is nutty with some malt as well. Medium-bodied with a pleasant nutty flavor, along with malt and caramel. The finish is somewhat hoppy. Overall this is a solid Brown Ale.
B&O Station Youngstown Brown;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;B & O Station Brewery;i really really really like this stuff currently. it took a few times to try but i overcame my initial thoughts on it and took a real liking to it. it's my current favorite - you can bet the house on that one, leroy!
B&O Station Youngstown Brown;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;B & O Station Brewery;"This one started with a bit of roughness on my tongue. As it warmed, the finish became a lot smoother and thicker. Malts had a medium ""werthers"" toffee flavor."
B&O Station Hearth Ale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;B & O Station Brewery;this one is very sweet, very cinnamony, and overall best taken as a sampler. you'll like it a few times but it might get old and overly sweet after awhile, frank.
B&O Station Hearth Ale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;B & O Station Brewery;Very tasty, appropriate as a dessert beer. Strong conammon and vanilla (I think) flavors here. Fairly complex, and too heavy and sweet to take more than a pint at a time. Of course, that's not what this one's for anyway. Exceptionally smooth.
B&O Station Hearth Ale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;B & O Station Brewery;This was delicious. The great cinnamon aftertaste is made this beer excellent. I could drink it with buttered toast.
B&O Station Hearth Ale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;B & O Station Brewery;Geeez, somebody dumped way too much cinnamon and honey into this batch! The flavors were just too overpowering for me. My wife thought it was pretty good. This would probably go well with the pub's chocolate cake as a dessert beer.
B&O Station Pedalines Pale Ale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;IPA;B & O Station Brewery;Excellent brew for any hop head! This heavily-hopped pale is very well balanced and not overpowering. Very easy to drink. It has a nice head, beautiful color, and a crisp finish.
B&O Station Pedalines Pale Ale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;IPA;B & O Station Brewery;Hoppier than I prefer but still a nice brew. Well-balanced with the malts. Went down pretty smooth.
B&O Station Pedalines Pale Ale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;IPA;B & O Station Brewery;Oh sweet citrusy hop juice! This one's definitely for us hop-heads (they list it as 70 IBU's). Don't get me wrong - there's a big fat body of sweet malts underneath. Deep golden/orange color, great lacing. Finish was long and sweet grapefruity. I'm surprised at the 4 hop mixture - it tasted like a single hopped IPA. Well made - make sure you get a growler of this to take with you.
B&O Station Semaphore Stout;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;B & O Station Brewery;A nice thinner bodied stout. Malts were roasted and brimming with chocolate. Great head, lacing and color. Finish was very dry - this seemed to be more of a dry stout than a sweet one.
Dogfish Head Hommelbier;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;Draft - A golden amber color. The palate of this beer was overly sweet for me without much balance. Didn't finish that great.
Dogfish Head Hommelbier;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;Overly acidic with a homebrew-gone-wrong aroma and flavor. It's tolerable in small sips, but I couldn't finish this. Pretty gross.
Dogfish Head Hommelbier;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;"(On Tap at Max�s On Broadway, Baltimore)... Extended RBSG2003... Slightly hazy, orange brew. Small, white creamy head. Excellent lacing. The aroma is yeasty, malty and fruity with notes of white wine. Smells like ""liquid fun"" to me! The flavor is tart, tangy and fruity... Grapefruit? Honey and white wine flavors. Light-bodied with an astringent mouthfeel and light carbonation. Dry, acidic finish. Very good brew! Pulls up just short of world-class! Summertime!"
Dogfish Head Hommelbier;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;Dark golden color with a light head. The nose is candyish with hints of honey and some sweet malt. A bitter-sweet malt body is complimented by hints of yeast and a nice hoppy finish. Somewhat spritzy but nice and tastey.
Dogfish Head Hommelbier;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;Despite the name, I think you'd be hard pressed to consider this a Poperings knockoff. Bright golden amber. Sweet aroma of honey, clover. Palate is sweet and dry - a good combo that is hard to execute. Light caramel dances with gin-like Styrian hops. Occasionally cloying but ultimately appetizing as the hops regain their strength late.
Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;Draft - Lemon (wedge) and biscuit. Clear gold with a decent white head. Biscuit and lemon. Not very wheat like.
Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;Pint on tap at the brewpub pours a clear pale golden color with no head or lacing. Mild aroma of citrus and cereal grains. Grassy hop bitterness with light citrus and a grainy malt sweetness. Light body and light carbonation. Definitely below standard for the style.

Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;GCBF 2010. Pale lemony yellow. Low wheaty aroma, watery wheaty flavour. Limp, lacking character. Meh.
Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;@GCBF-on tap-pours a white head that laces and yellow color. Aroma is barnyard wheat, some light hops. Taste is barnyard wheat, some light hops-lemon/slightly flat, some honey.
Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;(Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival 2007 in Victoria on September 8th, 2007. Near clear with a lightly carbonated and white head. Nose of pure butter and tonic water. Needs popcorn. Yuck!
Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;Tangy, but restrained as was the phenolic presence. At least the food is always good at the Barley Mill.
Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;GCBF. So many breweries make this stuff. At least it came out a bit cloudy, stress on the bit. Not much in the aroma to differentiate this from any popular lager...no citrusy or zippy smells. Taste followed suit. Except that this beer has wheat in it, I would not characterize it as a wheat beer. Hazy lager might be closer. Colour was dark straw. Taste was bland....can�t even call this a crystal weizen. Sorry guys, it was a dumper.
Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;Served with lemon. Golden colour. Light character. Slightly malty. Clean. Would be dominated by the lemon if you left it in place.
Barley Mill Cayuse Wheat Ale;Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Barley Mill Pub;Aroma was lightly wheat but no real orange or citrus that most wheat beers have. No real head and the colour was more akin to Bud then a Hoe. Flavour was refreshing but not overly wheat and finish was rather bland and thin.

Barley Mill Mustang Pale Ale (formerly: Palamino Pale Ale);Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley Mill Pub;Now called Mustang Pale Ale as I received 2 menus (a drink menu and a food menu) and one menu said Palomino Pale Ale and the other stated Mustang Pale Ale, even though they only have one pale ale on tap. Anyways, pours a golden amber color with a small white head that leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Mild aroma of grains. Taste is a citrus and grassy hop bitterness with a grainy malt sweetness. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. A decent pale ale, but there are many better ones out there to be had.
Barley Mill Mustang Pale Ale (formerly: Palamino Pale Ale);Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley Mill Pub;Draught at the brewpub Amber-copper color, with creamy head.

Barley Mill Mustang Pale Ale (formerly: Palamino Pale Ale);Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley Mill Pub;Draught @ Milestone�s in the Vancouver airport. I confirmed with the bartender that this beer is made in B.C, so I�m assuming this is the brew. Light copper, generous white head. Grainy aroma with a hint of hops. Interestingly, that hint vanishes on the palate, which is sweet and grainy with a hint of toast.
Barley Mill Mustang Pale Ale (formerly: Palamino Pale Ale);Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley Mill Pub;(Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival 2008 in Victoria, September 2008. Butterscotch. Blah! Very poor. 3/2/2/1/1
Barley Mill Mustang Pale Ale (formerly: Palamino Pale Ale);Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley Mill Pub;This is made for fans of Okanagan Springs Pale Ale and is plain in the same way. A light brown with bitterness begging to be augmented by some dry hopping.
Barley Mill Mustang Pale Ale (formerly: Palamino Pale Ale);Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley Mill Pub;From a can sent by Oakes! Pours medium amber with a thin head of white that falls immediately. Nutty caramel aroma, little to no hop aroma. The flavor is lightly sweet lacking any hop character, but the palate is a bigger detractor than the lack of flavors. Chalky, some cardboard with a bit of astringency in the finish. Needs more hops.
Barley Mill Mustang Pale Ale (formerly: Palamino Pale Ale);Penticton, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley Mill Pub;Tap at GCBF. I�ve now officially passed into drunkenness. Golden colour with a thin white head. Light grassy and resiny hop aroma. A bit of strange toasted corn flavour in here, some smokiness and light caramel malt. Strange brew.

Real Rock Premium;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;When in Jamaica, I find Real Rock a much better pick over the overdone Red Stripe. When in Rome...
Real Rock Premium;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;"355ml bottle - pretty sure biegaman gave me this one quite some time ago. Okay, it�s a bit old - but honestly would it likely matter? Slightly hazy gold with a fizzy diminishing white head (3-). Smells - meh; clover, sugar, weedy grass - not great, not ugly. Taste - jaysus, that�s not bad - too sweet, but I still get some crispness, honey and clover - just a bit of paper, not much alcohol at all - I just checked the bottle - best before 21 months ago! Well, it was in my fridge - but this is seriously not bad for a pale lager. Light body, almost stingingly carbonated, quick-finishing, and only slightly harsh in the finish; just a hint of pvc, but better than most - would like to try this fresh on tap."
Real Rock Premium;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;brought back the mini bar of my hotel in Montego Bay. Sweet honey malts on the nose with hints of cereal grains. Pours a golden blonde with a thick head that dissipates with champagne like carbonation. Light, very light, with a crisp dry finish. The flavor has light bread notes, with mild grassy hop notes.
Real Rock Premium;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;Clear bottle, thank you Colin and Kendra. Medium yellow, no head at all. Typical very corny aroma. Taste not nearly as offensive as aroma suggests. In fact not offensive at all - quite a lot of malt for the style. Hops, which are present, are fruity. Good lively carbonation, again, not as expected based on very flat appearance. As far as pale lagers go, this one has some flavour and is not bad - I�d happily drink it at a sun spot vacation.
Real Rock Premium;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;"12 oz. bottle from a friend. My friend went to Jamaica and all I got was this stinking beer. Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow color with a medium sized white head that disappears quickly. The aroma is grainy pale malt, hay, and light citrus. The flavor is more grainy pale malt, light corn, a weird apple note, and light grassy bitterness. This was a tick; nothing more nothing less."
Real Rock Premium;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;On tap in Jamaica. Pours a light golden color with a white foamy head. Smells of light grain and sweet corn. The flavor has a faint sweetness along with cereal grains and a slightly metalic finish. Nothing great, but it does the job when baking under the island sun.

Ochakovo Premium Chernoe Lyogkoe (Black);Moscow, Russia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ochakovo;09-Mar-12 (500-ml bottle) Pretty generic black beer out of Eastern Europe. It pours nearly black in color with some mahogany highlights at the edges, and the tan head builds to half an inch before settling to a thin ring. The aromas are very sweet, sugary, raisiny with a fair amount of cola. The sugary sweet flavor of cola is quite dominant, along with raisin, molasses, brown sugar, dark bread, and some nuttiness. There is some roastiness and coffee notes, I guess, but the sugar sort of masks everything else. It�s medium in weight, with the residual sugar making it seem heavier, and the carbonation is moderate. Not one of the better examples of this style, but it�s still drinkable.

St Peters Brewery Astounding Amber Ale;Sydney, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St Peters Brewery (Australia);was looking forward to this all month and then went to the nags head and the cask looked good and the beer sounded good coming out of the cask and it looked light purple and unfizzy and tasted of not that much. late bitterness. some berries. very watery. no regrets that it's a one-off
St Peters Brewery Astounding Amber Ale;Sydney, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St Peters Brewery (Australia);Wow, this was pretty lemonady, I thought: flat etc. I guess this is meant to be an old-man-playing-darts English beer. I appreciate the effort though, nice to see some lame arse beer guy putting a keg on at a Sydney pub: too bad it was the Nags Head. It reminded me of a watery Newcastle Brown or something. I'm not gonna complain about the price 'cause I'm loaded. Much love, Betty.
St Peters Brewery Astounding Amber Ale;Sydney, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St Peters Brewery (Australia);On cask at the Nag's 2/5/03 in St Peters' monthly series of one-off ales. darkish amber - alt colour. immediate whiff of fat fruity British yeast like fullers or something, plus very aromatic, flowery hops. Palate is suitably watery, slighty grainy. heaps of thick hop flavour and sweaty fruit up the front, then biscuitty malt, then quite a bit of bitterness - all good elements but they don't blend together into beery harmony, just happen in detached sequence. banana in the aftertaste seems a bit wrong. overall pretty authentic tasting, but authentically weak and unsatisfying like most sub 4% bitters. authentic english price of $6 a pint too, which is steep when you're not as well off as, say, Betty from Walgett.
Delafield Maddys Mild;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Medium bronze color and a sweet malty body and aroma. There's a touch of sourness in the body, but overall this was very smooth and flavorful considering its low alcohol content.

Hermann M�ller;Jedrzejow, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);Clear gold and modest foam, very faint lacquer on the nose. Flavour is weak grains and nothing else. Some vague carbonation saves it, but otherwise this stuff tastes forgettable and that might be intended.

Batemans Godivas Gold;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Batemans;Had this at the brewery. Maybe it doesnt travel well. The aroma is sulphuric with some sourness. Again flavours have some sourness with a licourice tang. The finish is smooth and dry. A little odd - but not bad.

Batemans Godivas Gold;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Batemans;"Cask, Dog & Bone, Gillingham. Part of the Bateman's ""GOOD HONEST'ALES"" range of seasonal beers based on semi-fictional characters and events through history. I think the apostrophe is placed to indicate that the range can be read as Good Honest Tales. Mmmm. This is a hazy golden beer which tends more toward lager than it does toward ale. There seems to be an interest in Britain at the moment in producing ales which are more acceptable to lager drinkers. Ale sales are down, but lager sales are up. It's an unpleasant trend. This piece of nonsense has a sweetish aroma and a watery texture. There is some mild malt. It is a very poor quality beer."

John Shippeys Forbidden Trubbel;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Dubbel;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Cloudy medium brown/red colour. Thin, white frothy head. Fruity, citrus, sour cherry, and plum aromas. Sour, almost tangy but mellow flavours, with plum, raisin, cherries, citrus, and a light bitter and nutty finish. Medium bodied, maybe a touch thin.
John Shippeys Red Wheat & Blue;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;John Shippeys Brewing Company;On tap at the Split Crow. Very cloudy golden-yellow colour with a thick white head. Strong aroma of blueberry sweetness up front with a nice citrusy zing in back. Flavour is good, sweet blueberry over a fairly tart acidic wheaty. This acidity really helps cut through a beer that would otherwise be cloyingly sweet. Body is actually a bit too full for my liking, but still a pretty tasty brew. As it warms some dirty esters start to pop out of the background. Perhaps it�s showing its age. Still quite a tasty brew.
John Shippeys Red Wheat & Blue;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Draft. Served without the blueberries. Hazy golden pastel hue with a small creamy head. Powerful blueberry aroma fades the longer it is in the glass. Touch of malt is an interesting contrast to the salty breeze wafting from the harbourfront. Sweet body, with glimpses of blueberry throughout, peaking in the intial wave over the back of the tongue at first sip. Sweet creamy undercarriage is delicately malty and occassionally tart-whearty fruit gives it just enough bite to raise it from adequate to interesting. Slightly above average palate is smooth. Interesting yeastiness that didn�t really warrant articulation but was noticable on some level. Surprisingly tasty.
John Shippeys Red Wheat & Blue;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Beer looked ok, served with blueberries...a pale yellow with a decent frothey white head with a purple spot where the berries passed thru. Aroma is blueberries, bubblegum and candy, which leads me to believe there is some artificial flavor. Flavor is syrupy blueberry with a tiny bit of beer flavor in there. Refreshing, yes, but so is alot of pop.
John Shippeys Red Wheat & Blue;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Hazy pale yellow colour with a thin diminishing white head. Semi-artificial blueberry aroma. Lemony, citrus, blueberry, and bitter flavours, as well as hints of coriander. Much better than I expected, judging from the aroma. Medium bodied, slightly dry, and incredibly refreshing. Very Hoegaarden White-like, almost as if a blueberry essence was added to Hoegaarden, but in a good way, not artificial at all in the taste.
Dostal Alley Gilpin Golden IPA;Central City, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dostal Alley Casino & Brew Pub;Bomber poured a clear golden amber with a lasting white head.

Sutton Madiba Stout;Plymouth, Devon, England;Stout;Sutton;Others suspected this might have been infected. I�m not so sure. I wonder whether it may have been simply past its best - I�d certainly had the bottle for a while and there�s no best before date in the bottle. Plus, Silk Tork�s original observations don�t differ too much from the later ones. Perhaps its meant to be the way it is. In which case, its a rather odd stout. Looks fine, but it has a rather thin consistency with some sour cherry and berry fruit and just a hint of bitter chocolate. Dry and bitter, with an odd (for a stout) citric tang. Weird. 500ml bottle (bottle conditioned) at the Joet London gathering, January 2005.
Sutton Madiba Stout;Plymouth, Devon, England;Stout;Sutton;Big picture of Nelson on the bottle with a large grin. Weird sour/acidic aroma. Black with a tan lasting head. Sweet, slightly acidic flavour. Medium bodied. Quite bland, and i suspect it was off.
Sutton Madiba Stout;Plymouth, Devon, England;Stout;Sutton;Bottle. Not a typical stout and the slight acidic sourness led me to believe that it might be slightly infected. Aroma was slightly smelly and a little bit sour. The palate was acidic and slightly smokey. Not much happening otherwise, not the best stout you�ll have.
Sutton Madiba Stout;Plymouth, Devon, England;Stout;Sutton;Bottled at The London/Joet Gathering Chez Chris_O. A black stout with a mountainous white head suggesting straightaway something is wrong. The aroma is a bit non-existant whilst the taste is a bit sour fruts with some stout notes. A typical English BC gone wrong.
Sutton Madiba Stout;Plymouth, Devon, England;Stout;Sutton;Bottle at Chris� place. Really funny label. Malt, slightly roasty, fruity, sweet and slightly smokey in aroma and flavour. Possibly infected, possibly just bad.
Sutton Madiba Stout;Plymouth, Devon, England;Stout;Sutton;May, 2003:A bottled stout from the Plymouth micro-brewery which opened in 1994. There is a picture of Nelson Mandela on the label. The beer pours dark with a generous nicotine stained head. There�s an attractive rootsy aroma of twigs, roasted malts, alcohol soaked figs and a damp wood at midnight. The taste is surprisingly sour, rather like a Flemish beer - not sharp, but over-riding all other tastes. Finish is quite tannic. Interesting, but not great. [2.6] Jan, 2005:The Kilburn Gathering. Carbon Dioxide and raspberry aroma. Nice dark appearance with cappacino foam. Sour notes initially - continues roughly. Lacks roasty flavours. Infected? Tastes fresh and acceptable. I note that two years ago I recorded sour notes in the beer and gave it roughly the same score. [2.4]

Lion Heart Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Big City Brewing Company;A pitch black brew that had an amazingly bland flavor that was non-descript. The most notable part of this beer was the complete lack of carbonation. Not horrible, but on the low end of drinkable.

Lion Heart Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Big City Brewing Company;"Bottle - Chris O�s pre-NY tastings. Bad buy by me .Oh well. Sweet malts; caramel and soy source. Really nothing much going in this and I�m incredibly disappointed as I thought this would be a nice beer. Dried out hops and metallic taste. Clear bottle - light shot probably. Weak Guinness immitation which tastes more like Newcastle Brown Ale."

Harwells Bob;Shakopee, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Harwells Steakhouse & Brewery;"Albeit Harwell's actual IPA was out, and none of the bartenders could identify a style for me on this beer called simply, ""BOB"", it tasted like an IPA to me. Very heavily hopped, and easily the best beer on tap that night among approximately 8 offerings. Harwell's makes below average beer, and their bartenders, by pushing customers out at 9:30pm on a Thursday, are in desperate need of a priority check. But Bob is pretty decent. Unique aroma with hints of stone (not smoked). Heavy hops also come through in the nose, laden with pine. Flavor is very sweet and hoppy. Appearance-wise, loses points for a promising lace that evaporates at mid glass. I sampled just about all of their beers, and this was the only drinkable one. No wonder the bartenders don't pay much attention to it."
Harwells Coal Fired Stout;Shakopee, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Harwells Steakhouse & Brewery;I've been to brewpubs with worse beer (e.g., O'Garas, Crescent City, Los Gatos), but none with a combination of bad beer and a total ignorance of the beer they serve. The only reason they the bartender knew this was a stout is because the word, Stout, is in the name of the beer! Average-sized, creamy, light-brown head. Fully opaque, black body. Excellent lacing. Flavor is very soft and dry. First impression was that it was amateurish, but it growns on you at mid-glass. A very average Stout.

Everlasting retention around the edges of the glass. Fruity, chocolaty aroma of cocoa, dark cherries, black currants, wood and earthy hops. Full-bodied and very creamy with medium carbonation. Almost perfectly balanced. Medium sweetness, adequate bitterness and moderate acidity. Barrel aged cherry cola. Lengthy, tangy, sweet, and then tongue-numbing finish. Kudos to StFun for providing this interesting and delicious bottle of beer!

Back Road Aviator Doppel Bock;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Back Road Brewery;Bottle from BBB63. I need to start trading with this guy more often! The body is a brooding, dark rootbeer brown. A small, foamy, light tan head settles pretty quickly to a wispy film with a prominent rim. Sheets of sudsy lace rejoin the body very quickly, leaving nothing but clear glass behind. The aroma is rich and deeply malty. Caramel and nougat jump out of the glass, while chocolate rushes in from behind very quickly, completing the malt profile. Vanilla cream and coffee liquor add to the decadence, making this brew smell almost like a fresh slice of tiramisu. The flavor is nearly as impressive, as creamy chocolate, caramel and nougat again play fullback for more subtle flavors of vanilla and dark rum. This one is very dessert-like and satisfying. The medium body is neither sticky or cloying. In fact, it transitions nicely from round and smooth to a short, dry, fruity finish. Many will call this one too fumy or alcoholic, but I love what it has to offer. Excellent brew, and near the top of the genre.
Back Road Aviator Doppel Bock;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Back Road Brewery;Bottle from BBB63. Lightly vegetal aroma has very little going on. Dry, lactic flavor is a bit sludgy and dull, kind of like licking an old machete. Can�t say I�m too enthralled by this.
Back Road Aviator Doppel Bock;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Back Road Brewery;"12oz bottle, courtesy of BBB63. Thanks, Mike! Dark cola color; minimal tan head. Chewy caramel and nougat in the aroma: roasted malts and a hint of smoke. Very chewy, medium-to-full mouthfeel: viscous caramel and nougat upfront, with a soft cola-infused carbonation lurking behind; excellent chewy malt presence, with the drinkability of chocolate milk. Medium, coffee and caramel finish."

Copper Creek Alt;Athens, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Creek Brewing Company;I really loved this beer. When I was in Athens, I tried it at the Classic City Brew fest, then had a few more pints of it at the brewpub afterward. Instead of the boring, bland, thin light brown ale that most breweries seem to want to pass off as alts, Copper Creek brewed a clean, crisp ale with a very noticeable hop bite. Quite drinkable and quite tasty.
Copper Creek Weizen;Athens, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Poured cloudy gold with a big white head. Aroma of bubblegum, banana, spice.

Copper Creek Weizen;Athens, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Copper Creek Brewing Company;This just couldn't stand up to the Alt. This is just another hefe. The body is a pale cloudy wheat beer. It tastes like they used a legitimate hefeweizen strain of yeast, but the yeasty flavors don't come out enough. It's not a bad beer, but hefeweizens too easily go the way of blah, even when you're like me and love the style.
Copper Creek American Pale Ale;Athens, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery with Linh, Scarlett and Mom.

Copper Creek American Pale Ale;Athens, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Copper Creek Brewing Company;Appearance: Dispensed a dark amber-hued body featuring good clarity and an off-white head. Smell: Copper Creek�s APA smells of pale malts, toasted barley, floral, citrusy hops, and a flickering of crystal malt. Taste: Opens with pale malts, lightly toasty accents, and a small hint of sweet caramel. Faint fruitiness. Hops give florals and a taste of white grapefruit. Moderate bitterness. The taste as well as the body thins out on the back half. Drying, bitterish finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-light carbonation.

5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Oh back in the days of Spike. Its been awhile since I Have tried this, long before the days of Terrapin.

5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Clear Amber with a reddish tint and a beige creamy head. Delicious hop scent, plenty of citrus peel but not overwhelming at all, in fact the sweet malts are just as (if not more) noticeable. A full-flavored, chewy feeling beer. More of an English IPA. Well balanced with plenty of hops but just enough for balance, not the astringent Left Coast hops we�ve come to know and love.
5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Big Hoppy Monster pours to a beautiful, bright, deep amber color with a tight white head that fades and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very fragrant with zesty, lively aromas of grape fruit, lemon, and pine. This signature aroma comes from the use of PNW hops such as Cascades, Columbus, and Centennials, and they are in this beer in abundance. Some nice crystal malt is used in this beer, but it really doesn�t stand a chance in the nose, and only acts as a spring board for more hop flavor on the palate. Big Hoppy Monster has a wonderful sweet malty, candied grapefruit hop flavor, that just dances on the tongue. I�m guessing this beer ranges from 5 to 6% abv, but peppery alcohol is not a flavor factor in this beer. Big Hoppy Monster finishes with more sweet malt and candied hop flavor up front, then ends with a big, citrus burst of grape fruit hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Big Hoppy Monster is a very impressive AIPA, and is a classic example of the West Coast style of this beer. I really loved the citrus/grape fruit character of this beer from the use of Cascades. Citrus hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness dominates this beer, making it pure hop juice. I was surprised to see how dark this beer poured, so they have attempted to give this beer a nice crystal/caramel malt base, but hops, as it should be with this style, is the star here. And the reason you should not be afraid of this Hop Monster, is the fact that it is a gentle hop beast. This beer is just loaded with hop character, but it isn�t so over the top that it is going to make your face wince or your mouth pucker. What I loved the most about this beer was it was so hoppy, yet so drinkable. Big Hoppy Monster would make an excellent aperitif beer to rouse the appetite before a meal at 5 Seasons, and would work well with some of the salads or grilled pizzas on 5 Seasons menu. Or you could do as the brewpub suggests and enjoy this beer as an after dinner mint. An excellent beer, from a very impressive brewpub.
5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Big thanks to JohnC for this bottle. Pours copper with a decent head, aroma is roasty malt, citrus and hops. Listed at 8%, this was a fairly bold brew and a lot more roasty than an IPA, probably would fit better in the American Strong style., as close to Arrogant B as I have tasted. Some burnt orange peel and lots or bitterness in the backend, I enjoyed this more as it warmed and opened up. Quite good.
5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;The glass arrived with a light frothy head on an amber body with coppery tints. The aroma brought visions of citrus fruits freshly sliced. Flavor was lightly fruity with a strong hop bite. Malt was evident but could have been more solid. A very nice IPA with a lingering bitter finish.
5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;I will always enjoy my visits to 5 seasons. This one isnt huge but it does acheive some balance. A nice hop bite followed up by some caramel and malt explosion. A dark reddish brown apperance with a moderate head. Its gotten even bigger since the 6% law was overturned, but even before this was awesome
5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;"I love hops and this beer is definitely a hop lovers beer. The 2003 version was more hoppy than that in 2004; so much so that a good friend said that it just �smelled like grass clippings�. Could use a little more malt to balance out the hops, but I guess that may be for the upcoming Five Seasons Imperial IPA."
5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This beast pours a clear copper amber with a frothy off-white head. Aroma is bold and hoppy, no real surprise there. Some caramel and earthy malt also comes through. Starts mildly sweet, turning somewhat bready and bitter toward a crisp hoppy finish. My only complaint is that the malt and hops don�t seem to mesh together as well as they could. Nonetheless, this goes down very smooth and flavorful. Many thanks to TheBeerCellar2 for this treat.
5 Seasons Big Hoppy Monster;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Tap @ brewery. Huge floral hop aroma. The citrus tastes are of grapefruit, limes & lemons. This is certainly a great IPA. The malt isn�t all that present but that�s ok with me. This baby kicks ass at about 70 ibu�s. Taste is sweet, dry and bitter with a ton of crystal malts.

Terrapin Golden Ale (Cream Ale);Athens, Georgia, United States;Cream Ale;Terrapin Beer Company (Tenth and Blake - Molson Coors);From Dec 2007 I got this bottle in a trade with leftmindedrighty, Thanks Aaron! This beer pours from 12oz bottle a slightly hazy light gold with a small, quickly receding head of foam. The smell is very light..hard to detect anything. Maybe a bit of hops? I keep on sniffing but not much is registering. The taste is another matter. First thing I notice is a real grainy and bready flavour followed some citrus and a slightly sweet malt flavour. Pretty tasty in my book. It has a light mouthfeel, the carbonation is high, and it finishes with a grassy hop kick that lingers on for some time after the swallow. A pretty nice Golden..err...Cream Ale and one that I could easily kick back a few of. Thanks again, Aaron!

The aroma is a pronounced grains note with a light sweet lemon backing note.

The texture is slick with foamy carbonation and a medium light body. The flavor profile is, up front, grains and lemon, with a crisp and clean finish that�s refreshing with a mild citrus zip that turns to bread with a light buttery character.

Mild roast in the nose. Light to medium sweet flavor, modest roast and sugar. Body is a bit light and the carbonation is fine. Mild warmth to finish, semi-dry, faintly bitter, some roastiness. Just OK.

City Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);a strange woody type of pale ale with little hop but a somewhat interesting character none the less. muscatel taste and amber with floaties again wood it has a bitter tinge to it like an aged citrus rind perhaps a bit candied in its natural sweetness. could be a bad botlle that in fact is not so bad. foamy light brown head and a bit yeasty......aged and aged well.
City Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Cloudy amber with a quickly dissipating thin tan head. Aroma of caramel and citrus hops. Nothing too unsettling but nothing exciting as well. Grainy texture contains caramel, citrus hops and some honey. Some bitterness on the back end but the sweet malt seems to overpower the hops a tad too much for a pale ale.
City Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Pours a bright, clear copper colour with a full white floral head. Aroma is of soft pine and citrus, taste is light, refreshing and full citrusy character.
City Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at Flanagan�s in Appleton, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear orange amber brew with a thin, creamy white head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Aroma of caramel malt, a touch of citrus zest a touch of spice and white pepper. Taste has a mild pear and fruity flavor, plenty of carbonation, some caramel malt and a touch of tangerine. Finish has a mild bitterness and a semi-sweet fruity malt afteraste that quickly disappears.
City Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);First of all, this beer is highly under rated. Not a great beer in any sense, but not deserving of the terrible ratings. True, it has a lot of maltiness, but the hops do shine through. For that price, a very drinkable beer.
City Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Has an almost chocolate malt yeasty aroma when you pop the lid. Slightly darker than the typical pale yellow american beer, just a little more orange. Mild pale ale annoying hop refined impressions. A little processed on the palate. Cerrtainly more offensive than most lagers. Could use a little more carbonation. Reminds me a bit of Big City Ice and City Lager. Has that same background flavor overtaking the palate. Malty alky presence is almost in your face. Not too civilized. Short length bitter hop malt back of throat taste hangs for a while. Like many annoying pale ales.
City Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);12oz bottle from variety pack. wow talk about bitter aftertaste. I dont like PA�s so this does Nothing at all for me.
City Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Pour was a medium brown with barely a head. Aroma is all malt with some hoppiness. Taste was sweet-definately more malt than hops. The hops come out in the aftertaste but overall this is very unbalanced. Could use a little more carbonation also.

The aroma is caramel and sweet with just a hint of citrus. The flavor is all about sweet. Very little bitterness at the end. Creamy mouthfeel and little to moderate carbonation. This was way too sweet for an APA.
Brewzzi English Pale Ale;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Pale Ale - English;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft� Cloudy caramel-colored ale with a mid-sized, fluffy, white head. Decent retention. Musky, hempen hops greet my nose right off the bat. Mild biscuit and caramel malts try to elbow their way up to the bar, but are rudely dismissed. Medium to full-bodied with some meat on its bones and lackadaisical carbonation. Hempen hop bitterness tilts the brew toward the bitter and dry sides of balance. Crisp, refreshing, mildly bitter finish.
Brewzzi English Pale Ale;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Pale Ale - English;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Decent. Orange color, smell of grain, very bitter taste. makes a good session beer. Waitress claimed mine was only 4% not 6%.

Brewzzi Spring Bock;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Tap @ Brewzzi, Boca. Golden pour, white head. Aroma of pale malts, grassy hops, and a little butter. Yup, flavor of butterscotch overwhelms any flavors of hops or malt. This one has been in the tanks a bit too long.

Brewzzi Spring Bock;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Part of the Brewzzi Sampler tray - all pours were in small flute tasting glasses, approx 6 oz (healthy pours). This was the reserve selection - pour is golden copper, clear with a dirty white head. Aroma is grain, light honey sweetness. Faint. Taste is the sweetness right up front, honey and sweet caramel malt transitioning to a more traditional cereal grain. Palate is thin to medium bodied, lower carbonation and a bit of a sweet bite to the finish.
Brewzzi Spring Bock;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft� Clear golden lager with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Fantastic retention that leaves thick lacing as it slowly recedes. Biscuit and honey aroma with a gentle waft of spent grain and faint, spicy German hops. Full-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor is of honey, toffee and barley with a sharp hop bite. Lengthy, bitter finish.
Brewzzi Spring Bock;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Very much like amber bock. Smoothe, hides alcohol content well. Extremely bitter finish. nit much going on in the body though. Very golden color.

Brewzzi Belgian Abbey Ale;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft... West Palm Beach location... Muddy, dark amber ale with a small, creamy, white head. Breadsy, fruity, spicy aroma. The flavor provides fuzzy and dark fruit esters and lots of spice (clove) phenols. Tangy, almost tart, acidity. Medium-bodied and creamy with feather-soft carbonation. Not at all boozy. Lengthy, spicy finish. The bartender told me the ABV of this seasonal is 7.5% instead of 6.5% as listed on RB. Just an FYI for those who care about such things.

Stoney Creek Rivertown Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Nice looking Porter with a decent head and roasted grains. Some coffee flavors are in there sure enough, offset with a mellow hope bite and coffee. Starts a bit sweet but manages to pull enough hop flavor to offset that a bit. Not bad at all.
Stoney Creek Rivertown Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Tap, dark brown, nice dark tan head, very nice lacing, aroma of coffee beans, taste of chocolate and coffee with a nice balance.
Stoney Creek Rivertown Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;draft at brewery. a very soft porter, which is a nice change of pace from the intensely chocolate and malty porters that make themselves so common in the winter. very very drinkable, surprisingly one of the better offerings from stoney creek--contrary to some of the other ratings here.
Stoney Creek Rivertown Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Tap. Just a mediocre offering. Decent roasted grain aroma. Body is just light of medium. Some chocolate aroma and flavor. Try it if you are in the area but don�t search it out.
Stoney Creek Rivertown Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;I didnt find this beer to be as bad. It was fairly sweet for a porter, but nowhere near cloying. The body had some balance issues I will agree, but the hops and malt were both there. This was a more traditional porter, lighter body. Had a bit of a stale hops flavor and a bit of a grainy feel (the metallic rancidity referred to previously), that was exacerbated by the carbonation content (too high for a porter). No trace of bitterness, and finishes a little off. Overall not a terrible beer though, for as much shit as it is taking so far. Appeaarance is a bit blacker than the vanilla porter, and there was almost no head. Rerate. Wow, this is like a brand new beer in this batch. Much fuller body now, a solid medium. Big malt flavors with some spicey/sweet almost like cinnamon and cherries malt. Hops are very apparent on the finish. Still quite sweet, carbonation problem is almost gone. Much better than I remember. I see where you would call this thing slightly rancid tasting, but that is from the yeast this brewery uses, gives a sour/bittersweet flavor. I think it makes it interesting. Like bitter orange and tart cherries.
Stoney Creek Rivertown Porter;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Apparently just their vanilla porter minus the vanilla extract. Yeah, they got the chocolatey thing, but it's mixed in with some kind of metallic rancidity and cloying sweetness that puts it damn close to drainpour quality. The website says their now making their own wines--Stop them before they kill again!

Ellicott Mills Big Red Bock;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ellicott Mills Brewing;This one missed the mark a bit for me. Poured ruby coppery. Nose was vinoius fruit, earthy malt. Tasted malty and grapey and earthy, but I tasted diacetyl in this.
Ellicott Mills Big Red Bock;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ellicott Mills Brewing;pours clear and quite red with an off white head and some spotty lacing. i am starting to see a trend in the aroma of these brews... creamy caramel, flowers and malt. they all share a distinct house flavor and smell... the flavor follows suit... quite sweet maltiness, some fruit perhaps citrus, flowers and a mildly dry finish. medium bodied. 6/3/6/3/12/3.0

Ellicott Mills Big Red Bock;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Not a bad bock to drink, but it seems to be wandering between styles. Is it an Irish red? Is it a bock?

Very malty and sweet aroma. Huge notes of orange blossom honey. Fruity and lightly floral.

Moderately bitter and very lightly acidic hop presence on the backside. Medium-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Long, well-balanced, lightly bitter finish. World Class Bock! I'm heading back to try more beers at this very promising brewery/restaurant. They seem to specialize in German and Belgian style beers.
Brenham Black Lager;Brenham, Texas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Brenham Brewing Company;Pours a thick black. Smokey and chocolatey, with a dash of bitterness in the finish. Fine beer.
Brenham Black Lager;Brenham, Texas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Brenham Brewing Company;On tap at Flying Saucer: nearly opaque with a big creamy head and very good lacing. Smokey, burnt malt, chocolate, and nutty aroma. Good balance between smokey and tart hints and the sweet malty tones. Finished fairly clean all thing considered. Thin to medium-bodied with a dry and lively mouthfeel. A pretty darn good blackbier made in Texas of all things.
Brenham Black Lager;Brenham, Texas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Brenham Brewing Company;On tap the Flying Saucer in Houston. Dark in color, pathetic head. Taste was of boring malt with a slightly roasty finish, very flat, not much kick to it. Typical of the style I guess.
Brenham Black Lager;Brenham, Texas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Brenham Brewing Company;Decent, but not really up to par. A little bit of a funny taste to it, caramelly-sweet. Dark brown/black, small thin head. Not a bad brew, just something odd about it that I couldnt quite place.
Brenham Black Lager;Brenham, Texas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Brenham Brewing Company;Tap. Opaque black appearance. Notes of chocolate-licoriche. A bit more smoky character would have done this beer well. Needs more complexity.
El Gran Campeon Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);"Only reason I gave the appearance a 2 was for the painted bottle - otherwise - looks like a warm sink of dishwater - no head - barely even a trace of golden in it. Aroma - industrial and metallic. Flavor - lifeless; metallic. Palate - does not go down real smooth. I really did not expect much from this - but it said ""take me home"" from the Albertson's singles cooler - so I gave it a good home. Now let me go get a lime to make it somewhat palatable."

Pyramid Maibock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pyramid Maibock is a very lively amber lager that seems to have a slight haze. The light khaki head is solid, smooth and waxy and has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a bready, malty aroma with a hint of sweetness. It�s medium light bodied and quick on the tongue. The finish is dry and very clean. It has a nicely balanced flavor, malty but not sweet. The bitterness comes in toward the finish. It�s ample and wooden, but not resiny. There almost seems to be a hint of fruit in the aftertaste. It�s not super interesting, but it�s solid and well crafted and goes down with great ease.

Pyramid Maibock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Not very impressive. There�s just not the depth I�ve had from other Bocks. Pyramid seems to be very hit or miss with me.
Pyramid Maibock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);A - Pours a fairly clear copper-orange with a finger of frothy white head . The head fades down at a normal pace leaving behind some lacing. S - Aroma is a mix of caramel and bready malts with some noble hop, some lemon, and a bit of grain. T - Starts off with some caramel and bready malts with some noble hops and a touch of bitterness. Through the middle, a bit more noble and grassy hop comes through with a bit of lemon. The finish is a mix of sweet malts with some noble hop and some grains. M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a sweet and dry finish. D - Very drinkable. Well balanced, but feels just a bit thin and could have used a touch more of a kick.
Pyramid Maibock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);After working in the yard I needed lawn mower beer and this hit the spot. Sorry no glass for this baby. I chugged it on the spot. It�s kind of like a Genny Bock.

Light bodied with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall this was ok but forgettable.
Pyramid Maibock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Bottle. Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, off white, fully diminishing. Body is light to medium amber. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, grain, husks, corn syrup), lightly hoppy (herbs), with notes of metal, butter, and DMS. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter, husky, unclean. Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic, metallic. Wow, ""bock style ale"", eh? So it�s not even an actual lager, ok, ok, I�m with you so far. The vegetable brine, tin, grain husks, and diacetyl make for quite the attractive nose, so far so good! The dirty, syrupy, metallic, husky mouth experience pretty much knocks it out of the park, we�ve got a home run right here. Nice going, Pyramid, you obviously burned the candle at both ends laboring over this one. Kudos."
Pyramid Maibock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"12 oz bottle from the Spring Variety pack. Expired three days ago.

Taste is light malty sweet, a bit meaty and finishes lightly bitter. Thin body and kind of watery. Pretty dull."
Pyramid Maibock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 oz. bottle- Expired three days ago, but should be still good- Pours orangeish amber with a thin soapy white head, there is sediment floating around. The aroma is generic beer and malt. The taste is better than the aroma, malt forward, but it does leave a dryness in the mouth. body is medium, carbonation is medium high. Overall I appreciate Pyramid finally trying something new, but this is very average and boring.

Yes, vitamin C injected, but a stale and industrial taste is the ruiner. Funky, musty, tastes like the inside of a well-used pipe. No real bitterness, malt is tinny.

Gritty McDuffs Vacationland Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Gritty McDuffs;This beer needs a vacation! Average dark gold pour w/ a thin tan head & decent lacing. The aroma is of remotely sweet malt. The taste rather bland & boring up front & then finishes w/ a strange bitterness. Doesn�t have a good mouthfeel either & overall a poor brew that isn�t worth your time!

Gritty McDuffs Vacationland Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Gritty McDuffs;22 oz. bottle from Epsom Circle Market. Aroma is faint--a bit like beer that sat out all night or that someone vomited. Appearance is hazy light gold with massive off-white foamy head (actually a little annoying because it took so long to go away) with foamy lacing. Taste is similarly lacking though not mildly aversive like the aroma. Mildly bitter. Palate is light bodied with thin texture and soft-flat carbonation. Finish is mercifully brief. Overall, this is not a good beer. Perhaps I had a bad one? I can�t imagine any place calling itself a craft brewer would put this out--I�d rather have a Miller Genuine Draft or a Michelob. If someone hands you one, make sure it is ice cold. Avoid.

Rock Bottom Arlington Spout Run Porter;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Arlington;Tap at the brewpub. Deep brown with modest lacing. Though gentle like everything else I sampled from the brewery, this one is really nice. I get mostly soft chocolate and molassas, without much of the vinous complexity that dominates some porters. Slightly chalky mouthfeel. There are hints of smoke here, and beer - though not paricularly sweet overall - turns softly sweet on the finish with those flavors held in check by just the right amount of hops. While this beer may not be my favorite interpretation of a porter, it is very well crafted beyond a shadow of a doubt. Nice job.

This beer finishes with some nice dry hop bitterness paired with more notes of coffee and roast that lingers. This beer was absolutely delicious, and made the perfect desert beer. It worked very well with a desert of mudd pie, which is coffee ice cream, chocolate, and caramel. This was an outstanding porter with lots of flavor and character. So the next time you see a Rock Bottom, go in a give the beers a try. You will always find something a little different at each location, and it is this quality and variety, that makes this national chain seem like a real local

Woodstock Inn Pemi Pale Ale;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Yes a pale ale fer sure. Just a clean fresh beer aroma. Big rocky head from a bottle. A rather mild tasting pale ale. Never tries to be in yer face and I like that. Must say this is one of the better behaved APA I�ve ever tasted even after 4,000 beers, heheh. Just the right amount hops to let you know its hopped but never over the top or inyer face, good balance IMHO. Never rude. Finish is a mild citrus thing on the palate, good overall.

Woodstock Inn Loon Golden Ale;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Light floral and candied sugar aromas. Looks like any blonde beer. Taste is a lot more sweet than bitter, some sugary malt at play. Crisp and crushable, the session beer of the lineup. Suffers from some weird line funk like all the brew pub�s beers do.

Homebush Bay Lager;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Masthead Brewery;Homebush bay is a remarkably unprepossessive place that can really only boast a polluted little stream that flows through concrete canals. One sincerely hopes that the water for this beer is not derived from this source. On the other hand, a bit of character provided by the numerous nasties and effluent may have given it some unique character. OK, I know, as ecze says, this is from Queensland, the home of great beers, ahem. Weak, thin and tasteless are the 3 words that spring to mind. Couldn't detect any honey but a distinctive malt extract tang was certainly there.
Homebush Bay Lager;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Masthead Brewery;"brewed under licence in queensland so that they can call the pub at the olympic site a ""brewery"" - eh? can imagine thirsty rugby league players waddling across from telstra stadium and kicking back after the game with a stubby of this and some chisel on the jukebox. descriptive bit: a yellow, sweet , faintly herbal but overwhelmingly flavourless lager with extra ickiness from added honey, seemingly added for no reason other than to make it seem homebrewy."

WinterCoat Festival Ale;Sabro, Denmark;Strong Ale - English;WinterCoat;Draught at the Danish Beerfestival 2003: Dark amber coloured. Has a nice offwhite head. Spicy and light vineous aroma. Flavour is spicy and fruity. Ends with a long dry bitterness.
WinterCoat Festival Ale;Sabro, Denmark;Strong Ale - English;WinterCoat;Sampled draught at the Danish Beer Festival. Nut brown with rich head. Herbal banana aroma. Sweet and malty with toffee flavour and a long, sweet butterscochy finish. Even though the yeast strain used creates an estery flavour, and, aided the by the relatively high alcohol contents, gives this beer the character of a Belgian ale, the brewer still consideres it a bitter. It is still young and a bit raw, but unusual and pleasant enough to grab my attention.
Portchester Firepot;Portchester, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Portchester;Oxford Beer Fest, Gravity Fresh. This is the little brewery that is contained in the garage of Graham Stone's house. This beer is grapefruit flavoured up front, then the warm chili spice comes in late in the finish and lingers gently. There is a nettles flavour in the middle, which seems appropriate. The colour is that of a murky urine sample. This is very yummy, but tricky to drink a full pint (or even a half) as the chili warmth is cumulative.
Portchester Firepot;Portchester, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Portchester;A crisp straw coloured ale with a firm white head, that was consistent and laced well.Initial taste of a good light summer drinking beer with a slight citrus/smoky taste. The surprise is in the finish, when after 5 - 10 seconds the chilli flavour creeps in and stays. All in all a very pleasant experience.

Hambleton Goldfield;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hambleton Ales;Tasted this Golden Ale in the Three Judges, Glasgow in September 2006. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale straw in colour with a thin white head. Dusty hops present in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a light digestive biscuit flavour with citric fruit evident. Strong dusty hop resins give a sharp astringency to the increasingly bitter aftertaste. Finish is tart and very dry with grapefruit peel present. Not my favourite from the Hambleton portfolio.

A. Le Coq Black Beer (Light);Tartu, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;A. Le Coq (Olvi);From the archives: available as a single batch. Typical Le Coq lager. If black had some character, then this was just pointless. Absolutely nothing special.

Therefore it�s still a complete mystery to me, why this is called a black beer. This beer is golden - dark golden at the most - with a fairly decent head. Fullbodied, sweetish with a hint of hops. This is a pretty OK strong lager. But ""Black""? No way. And ""Schwarzbier""?? Come on... 071103"

A. Le Coq Black Beer (Light);Tartu, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;A. Le Coq (Olvi);"I expected this to be a Schwarzbier or at least a Dunkel. Instead I get a glass of very pale, very light flavoured, very boring beer. When I asked the guy who served me this at the Danish Beer Festival, why the hell they call it ""Black"" when it's light, he said: ""Because it's funny!"". Estonians are crazy."

Duysters Loterbol 8 Blond;Diest, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);33 cl bottle from the old Sam's Wines, 2009. Date notch 2006. Another beer I probably should have pulled from the cellar many years ago. Ah, well. Nose on this does have the slightly medicinal smell of an aged, malty beer. No spoilage. But a note of plum and raisin that's kind of nice. Color is brown to brassy, with just a light ring of foam around the rim. Taste is malty, just a little fruity, pretty good. Slight note of maple syrup. But the mouthfeel comes across a little bit thin. Perhaps that's what's kept this from coming out as oxidized. Altogether, it's middlin' for an old beer, but maybe should have held on to a bit more character.
Duysters Loterbol 8 Blond;Diest, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);Poors light yellow ocre, slightly oily with big, dense, white head, good lacing. Good, dense, sweetish, malty base, caramel, fruity hops, sourish/spicy impressions, yeasty, some faint alcohol, despite the overall sweetness a nice bitterness towards the finish, thick MF, aftertaste pilsener-like.

Duysters Loterbol 8 Blond;Diest, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);Bottle from the Old House, Wellingborough. Golden and hazy with a light ring of soapy white head. Light aroma: some butterscotch, apricot and gently spicy yeast, with a light vegetal note. Much improved taste, with the yeasty sweetness buoyed up by an earthy nutty character.

Keesmann Josephi Bock;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Keesmann;Drinking from bottle at Meibockfestival Amsterdam. A very bad aroma, sewer at first.

Slottsk�llans Dublin Red;Uppsala, Sweden;Red Ale - Irish;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);"The pale yellowish foam is thick, with fine bubbles. It disappears quite fast into a thin white skin. The colour is clear, dark copper red (as the name suggests). The smell is mild; there are hints of dark rye bread, dark malt and some traces of yeast. The Carbon dioxide is just right, making the brew refreshing but not sharp in the mouth. The taste is gentle yet focused: At first, there is a fresh acidity, then the fine bitterness and the hints of diacetyl and hazelnuts take over and the whole taste ends with a somewhat dry, harmonic bitterness. This is ale as I really enjoy drinking at the pub with my friends � it got character, but doesn�t take over the full attention as an ESB or stout might do. Yes, the small Slottsk�llan Brewery does really show their craftsmanship in making fine beers in a wide range of styles. This particular ale is, by the way, made in collaboration with the O�Connor�s Irish Pub & Restaurant in Uppsala, the town that Slottsk�llans Brewery is located in. Hmmm� It makes me wonder how this beer tastes from the tap. It is probably even better that way."
Slottsk�llans Dublin Red;Uppsala, Sweden;Red Ale - Irish;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottled: Amber coloured. clear. Off white dense head. Aroma is malty and sugary sweet. Flavour has some chocolate, hops, berries and fruit to it. Is light bitter in the end. Dies quickly on the palate.
Slottsk�llans Dublin Red;Uppsala, Sweden;Red Ale - Irish;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottle. Nice, solid Irish style red, nothing fancy. Clean balanced mouhtfeel. Nutty, with some light caramel, with a slight hint of berries, sweetish, but dries out at the finish, a nice easy drink, i like it.
Slottsk�llans Dublin Red;Uppsala, Sweden;Red Ale - Irish;Slottsk�llans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottle, DBF 2004. Amber bronze, moderate white head and low condition. Low roast barley and some fruity berry notes in the nose, soft and quite thin in the mouth with some hop apparent, a slight maltiness but a nasty aftertaste develops dominating a slight hop bitterness and caramel in the finish.

Almaza NA;Beirut, Lebanon;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);Bottled, 330ml at Al-Salam Lebanese Restaurant, Oxford. Pale straw, heavily carbonated. Dear oh dear the things we do for ratings. I�d already had the other beer available, so it was this. Corny, wet cardboard, sharp. Not a good beer. Could have done with something better at the post Theatre meal.
Almaza NA;Beirut, Lebanon;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);12oz bottle in beirut, split with my awesome grandmother. Exp. date was 5/28/2011, which normally wouldn�t bother me, but this bneer had some floaties that looked liked dust particles, like tiny little strings, something I�ve never seen before. I�ve never had an NA beer before, so I wasn�t sure if this was normal or what. Nose smell was pretty awful. The aroma was similar, but less offensive, much more watered down. This beer had a really quick finish and little aftertaste. nicely balanced carbonation and texture.
Almaza NA;Beirut, Lebanon;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);Did not realize this one was no alcoholic before drinking it in a hotel in Amman, Jordan. Knew something was seriously wrong as soon as I tasted it. Oh well.
Almaza NA;Beirut, Lebanon;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);This NA beer is not bad at all. It has a light malt flavour and a little bit of hops. A sort of blunt, mild bitterness unlike that found in most beers. Nothing outstanding, but this is a solid NA brew (which is always an accomplishment).
Almaza NA;Beirut, Lebanon;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);"When you have Muslim grocery stores in dry areas of Texas, what beer can you expect to find? Answer: Almaza NA! Whole cases of it, piled high in a central location, tempting buyers to relax with a refreshing cold beer. It�s not bad. Relatively deep yellow color with a moderate white head; the carbonation was fairly small in the streams, only moderately sized on my glass. The bottle color had me thinking ""Heineken"" as I was drinking it, encouraged no doubt by the basically skunky notes emerging in the aroma. Grassy, woody flavor, somewhat malty, though with a subtle something that reminds me there is no alcohol here. Aggressive carbonation in the mouth--the kind that you can hear fizzling as it sits on your tongue. Not a bad beer among low-end beers, and I confess to liking something about a NA beer, as I can drink it while working. The bottle proclaims ""0,0%""--it�s not 0.5%, this is pure alcohol-free! It turned out to be a good sipping beer on a hot night in Dallas."
Almaza NA;Beirut, Lebanon;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);Pale colour, large bubbles. Doughy, biscuity flavours and a touch of hop. One of the better non-alcs, definitely.
Almaza NA;Beirut, Lebanon;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Almaza (Heineken);"Probably the best non-alcoholic beer that I've had, but that isn't saying much. Broadly in the style of an international pilsner, this has a surprisingly full body, and looks good; the head actually leaves some lace. Flavor is about the same as any green-bottle international pilsner; the lack of alcohol seems to be well-hidden. There was a slightly odd sweetness, and if this wasn't in a green bottle the hoppiness would be pretty nice."
Red Star American Wheat Quench;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Star Agave Grille;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a pale yellow color with a large white head. The aroma was faint and a bit dry. The flavor was light and dry with a hint of wheat graininess. Not much body or flavor to it. Earlier Rating: 10/26/2004 Total Score: 2.2 Sampled on draft at the brewery. The beer pours a straw yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is very faint. The flavor is indeed crisp and clean, but is lacking in character. Only a hint of wheat can be detected. While certainly not a bad beer, there is little remarkable in this one.

Red Star American Wheat Quench;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Star Agave Grille;Barely any wheat aroma, if any. This must be a filtered wheat because the appearance of this is ubiquitous pale yellow american lager. Not much of a head, but there is a froth present. Taste is not wheatlike as I expected. It is more like a pale lager in feel and flavor. There are no spices in the taste or texture. Yep, none of the extra bang you would find in an unfiltered wheat are present.This is very refined compared to other american wheats. Mild bitterness is present but not more than any well balanced pale lager. Mild carbonation. Finish is friendly and easy going. No offensive personality characteristics here.
Red Star American Wheat Quench;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Star Agave Grille;Draught: This is the first beer that I have had here that I have been really disappointed in. It pours pretty much like a fizzy yellow beer. It is clear as they filter the beer. Very thin aroma. The taste is also pretty thin. There is maybe a hint of wheat in the body. Perhaps a hint of citrus, as there is a bit of a sour aftertaste. Pass on this one.
Red Star American Wheat Quench;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Star Agave Grille;Quite possibly one of the worst microbrewed beers of all time. No i take that back, its one of the worst misnamed beers of all time. This is honestly disgraceful to call this a wheat beer. It had no flavor, absolutely whatsoever. The beer tasted like Coors Light. This sucks.
Willimantic Pony Expresso Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;on tap at the brewery, holy crap this has a strong espresso flavor. Pretty overwhelming. The base beer is extra roasty which makes it pretty good.
Willimantic Pony Expresso Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;The aroma is brilliant with pungent espresso that pierces the sinus cavity.

Willimantic Pony Expresso Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;On cask at the brewery. Pours black with no head. Aroma of vanilla and espresso. Flavor of charred malt, sweet vanilla, roasted nuts, and tons of espresso. I really enjoyed the flavor of the beer, but the light carbonation didn�t sit right with me for this beer. 7/4/8/3/14 (3.6/5)
Willimantic Pony Expresso Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;Cask at the brewery. Aroma heavily roasted (perhaps even charred) coffee, nuts, emphasis seemingly more on the roastiness than the espresso itself. Flavor brings more of a lovely coffee bitterness to go along with all the roastiness, surely also contributing to the bitterness. Smooth, smooth smooth, light but adequate carbonation from the cask. Nice one.

Bohannon Pale Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Market Street Brewery & Public House (TN);This beer poured a light orange color with hints of yellow and a slight foamy white head which dissipated quickly. The strange deal about this beer is it had serious sedimenty brownies at the bottom of the bottle so I�m slightly worried it could have been the beginnings of an infection so a re-rate may be in order for the future. The aroma is citrusy and malty with sugar candy and malty goodness. The flavor is light with apricots, sugar candy, sourness, butter, and popcorn being predominant. Somewhat sweet finish. Not sickeningly sweet, but not exactly right if you know what I mean. One dimensional sweetness, fairly heavy carbonation, but overly citrusy in mid-sip which worries me regarding the possibility of an infection.

Astoria Aster Amber Ale;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);This is more toward orange than amber. It came to the table with a nice white head that tended to last. It had fair lacing. It has a nice fizz and is fairly clear so a person looking for a more traditional beer would like the appearance. This beer has a light hop nose with little malt aroma. The taste is clean and light. Minimal hop flavor and a light malt finish. I has a quick finish that is slick and not too lasting. This one is just one step up from the pale ale and not over powering. This is a beer that can be drunk in quantity.

Complex for an amber with enough of a hop balance--though they definitely take a back seat-- and a pleasant, but indiscernale flavor tones. Little bitterness. This is an amber worth having around.

Astoria Willapa Wheat;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Light brown with a creamy head and stringy lacing. Wheat aromas with some sourish notes. Sourdough maybe. Citrus and some spice. The flavor consists of wheat, bitter hops, and lemons. Not much else. Medium body with a bitter finish.
Astoria Willapa Wheat;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Sampled draught at Wet Dog Cafe/Pacific Rim, AstoriaDark amber color with light head/lacing. Nose of clove & banana, esters abound, lots of wheat. The flavor is sweet, a little malty with hops, not too bad but an interesting color for a wheat, very similar to the amber.
Astoria Willapa Wheat;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Astoria Brewing Co.

Astoria Willapa Wheat;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Semi-cloudy orange, slightly sweet nose of bread and burnt orange, not very powerful. Nothing exciting... some burnt nuts and bread, not appealing.
Astoria Willapa Wheat;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);"Astoria (Wet Dog Cafe) on tap: I think the chalkboard called it ""Willapa Wheat."" Golden-orange and hazy with a soapy head. Very crisp and carbonated. Light malts without much sweetness. Very spicy (Saaz I suspect) and bitter. Bitterness lingered a little too long, by the way. Slightly unbalanced ... needed more of a malt backbone and a little more sweetness to complement the hop influence."
De Proef Knock Out (K-O);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Sampled from an 11.2 oz brown bottle this beer poured a butterscotch color with tons of little floaters and an enormous fluffy orange-white head that lingered and left good lacing. The aroma was sweet and yeasty with pear, white cherries and honey. The flavor was sweet and sugary with tart jammy notes of plum, pear and white cherries and notes of honey and faint astringency. Long sweet jammy fruit finish. Moderately full bodied. Well done.
De Proef Knock Out (K-O);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;bottle @ Party Source / Bellevue KY --- Cloudy medium amber color, persistent white head, sheets of lace. Taste is caramel malt that grows substantially as it moves through the swallow, adding fizz and slight bittering along the way. The finish warms up enough to reveal the alcohol. A big-bodied, but satisfying brew.
De Proef Knock Out (K-O);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle. Very light toast aroma with a little, mild stone fruit, with a citrus finish. With light carbonation and and light body this one really can sneak up on you. I had it on a rather cold afternoon and it felt a little lacking, but sometimes it strangely seems all a beer needs is a hot day and this might just be that beer.
De Proef Knock Out (K-O);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;It will be a sort of De Proef kind of place, with lots of contract brewing for different people who want to have their beer made here at a price much lower than transporting from Europe or elsewhere.

De Proef Knock Out (K-O);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Taster on tap at Neon�s. Hazy orange golden color. Little off-white head. Bigger body. Lighter carbonation. Pretty dry. Just a dot or two of lace. Some light grapefruit citrus. Caramel malt. Light belgian candy sugar. Moderate sweet taste. Light bitter. Just a very light bite. Solid tripel - the light citrus zestiness is an interesting twist, but besides that, there�s not too much else to say about this one.
De Proef Knock Out (K-O);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;"Draft to taster. Looks good for the style; a hazy golden orange with thin white lacing.

A solid example of the style."
De Proef Knock Out (K-O);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Aroma is spices, citrus and a very strong yeast funk. The flavor is citrus, spices, dryish malts, fruit and a dry bordering on puckering finish.
De Proef Knock Out (K-O);Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;750 ml bottle from Winnoski Beverage Warehouse for $11.99. Nose is nice, Esther�s of pears, banana and lots of bready pale malt. Flavor has a big yeast profile that gives me tropical fruit, clove mild yeast and a large amount of sweetness in the finish. ABV is there but not distracting at all. A nice little zip of spicy hints in the finish. Medium in body and real easy to drink for the big ABV.
Northumberland Kitty Brewster;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);On cask at Cloisters. Pours a dark golden colour with a decent white head. Aroma of caramel, grassy hops and yeast. Similar flavours with mild carbonation and a foamy mouth-feel.

Northumberland have been brewing since 1996, though they did pause in 2002 when they had financial problems. This is a decent amber coloured bitter with an interesting hint of urine and blood orange on the nose. There is a good suggestion of nettle tea in the flavour, plus some tinned lychees. Firm mouthfeel.

Cottage Hound Dog;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask, Wheatsheaf, Blackpool. The Wheatsheaf was the best pub of the Blackpool Rocks weekend. Full of character and characters. It is held in time, with plenty of old men in flatcaps sipping their pints while reading the paper, light streaming in through the smoke. The beer was scarlet coloured with an oatmeal head. 11 pints into the weekend and I'm starting to appreciate the smooth, creamy Northern method of serving ale. Dark brown sugar and raisin fruit, with a gentle dusty hop finish. Nice balance.

Pale coppery amber colour. Quite resinous hop aroma. Very dry on the palate, with lots of citric and spicy hop presence. Light biscuity malt backdrop. Extremely steely mouthfeel.

Hair of the Dog Ed;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Cloudy amber,off white head. Fresh hop nose. Huge hop flavor from previous bottles seems to have faded, no doubt due to age.. Great Belgian lace. Guess I cellared this for too long
Hair of the Dog Ed;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;1998 Vintage, Sampled on tap at The Stuffed Sandwich Pours from the tap with a hazy honey color and with no head to speak of. There is a soft fruity nose to this beer with notes of apple and pear being most noticeable. The aroma also has a nice chewy malty note to it that makes me think the beer might taste sweet. Age and some slight oxidation have definitely altered the malt character here, though not necessarily in a bad way. The flavors seem to bear out what I noticed in the aroma. The fruitiness leans towards notes of pear and plum in the flavor and there is even a note that adds a touch of tartness (again accentuating the plum note). The aged character is so much mellower than I would expect from a beer of this age and is a testament to the slower aging of beer in a larger container (in this case the keg). Sam seems to have avoided the typical oxidation notes of wet cardboard and sherry, instead the age just adds to a mellow complexity.
Hair of the Dog Ed;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;On tap at stuffed sandwich, very mellow, smooth drinker, malty, hops non existant, some light fruitiness, easy drinking brew, nice, even aged for 9 years!
Hair of the Dog Ed;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;On tap at Stuffed Sandwich, 1998 Vintage. I have to admit I was skeptical about this one at first - a nine year old mild ale was giving me doubts about giving it a fair shot. After trying a small sample though, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that is has held up remarkably well over the years, so I went back and got another full sized pour in order to spend some more quality time. Pours a slightly hazy color of beechwood with fringes of fall apple cider and a thinly carbonated layer of diminishing white head. Soft fruity malt aromas decorate the bouquet with hints of ripe pears and dried pineapple rinds. A vigorous swirl shakes up a bit more light creamy head, and along with it comes some more tropical fruit dimensions - this time passion fruit and guava. Light bodied, thinly carbonated mouthfeel. Not nearly as fruity as the aroma, but instead a wave of solid light malt flavors meet the tongue. Unmistakingly the second runnings of Fred - after leaving this question in my tasting notes, the commercial description verifies this lingering thought. A lightly toasted baguette crust coats the tongue, garnished with some dried french herbs. As the malt flavors fade, they are replaced by an aged hop character, very herbal, but very light on the bitterness, which I guess can be expected. Quite nice for a mild ale, and one that I would eagerly look foward to trying again fresh if this is ever brewed again.
Hair of the Dog Ed;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;On tap at Stuffed Sandwich poured a hazy amberish orange color with almost no head. The aroma was mainly malt and no hops noticable, it was almost 10years old. In the taste you could tell it had some age on it, but really not a bad beer. No hop bitterness and in no way comparable to its big brother. You could tell that Sam really took care of this one for being so drinkable after all these years.
Hair of the Dog Ed;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Pale straw color. Nice nose, punchy and bright, fruity and crisp with green apples. Grapefruit and pine predominate the flavor, has a good sharp, tart bite and a nice sweetness. Good fizziness as well.
Hair of the Dog Ed;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Cloudy amber body with medium off-white head. Aroma is moderately sweet, grapefruit and pine. Taste is minty grapefruit, a combination that in my book isn't wholly successful.

Hair of the Dog Glen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Sampled at the first annual Sasquatch Brew Fesival on 5/31/2003 at the Wild Duck Brewery: Flowery, fruity, sweet and caramely. a hint of esters. alcohol as well. cloudy orange/straw body. Tastes like a belgian strong to me, spices and citrucy, yeasty, dry barley flavors follow a bitter initiation. Creamy and full, some cloying hold a holds a salty, buttery, dry malt finish. Surprising warmth.
Hair of the Dog Glen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Cloudy peach. Nose is spicy, orange peels. Taste like candied oranges, maybe apricot, possible circus peanuts? Painfully dry in the finish. Unpleasantly undercarbonated.
Hair of the Dog Glen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Cloudy amber body, with minimal white head. Aroma is faint orange. Taste is spicy (coriander) orange, moderately sweet, some floral hop in the finish. Aftertaste is also spicy orange, but somehow different, as though using a different type of orange.

J.W. Lees Brooklyn Best;Middleton, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;J.W. Lees;Cask@Nottingham Beer Festival. Blond/Golden beer with a fruity, vinous aroma and a light fruity flavour that is slightly weak. Overall a nice fruity mango like beer.

J.W. Lees Brooklyn Best;Middleton, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;J.W. Lees;Draught in the Briar Rose (JDW), Birmingham. Big and very hoppy beer, a big change from the British bitters which are usually in evidence in Wetherspoons' pubs. A grainy orange brown colour, with a fairly fluffy head and thick IPA aroma. Very dry, verging on harsh, and a sandpaper finish on your tongue and throat. Tasty, with some fruit and malt notes, and pretty refreshing too.
J.W. Lees Brooklyn Best;Middleton, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;J.W. Lees;Cask, Wetherspoons, Blackpool. The Wetherspoons pub in Blackpool is one of the dreariest pubs I've been into, but managed to serve up the best beer of the Blackpool Rocks weekend. Because it also serves food all day long, it was also the only pub we visited twice. This Brooklyn Best, brewed under advice from Garrett Oliver, contains Willamette, Cascade and Chinook hops, delivering a wonderful brew. The colour is a hazy orange straw. A beautiful rush of citric flavours perform a delicate broken glass dance with lemons and grapefruits, finishing with a subtle pirouette of crushed ice vanilla. Winner of the Blackpool Rocks weekend.
Hair of the Dog Dave;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;A couple of years ago the RateBeer Summer Gathering was in Portland. Several guys, including hannont went in on a bottle of this. I could not justify chipping in on a beer that is less than 12 ounces and costs $1500. However, Todd (hannont) did. He then gave me and my friend hayduke a sip of it. Awesome!!! I have held Todd in so much esteem since. The beer was very good and somewhat memorable. Todd, however, was so much better that it was. I saw Todd last weekend and remeberred I had forgotten to rate this. Good beer. GREAT guy.
Hair of the Dog Dave;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Aged sample No head, reddish/orange tinted beer, faint haze. Soy sauce, ketjap manis, chocolate and whisky notes. Wood, oxydation, ketjap soy sauce, alcohol, fusels, and immensely complex. Very thick body, ultra-slick, even a tad buttery. Surprisingly complex still for a 23yr old beer. Strange, the nose doesn�t do it any right for what is following. Hip Hip Hoera for Mathieu, and many thanks for this superb celebration special!
Hair of the Dog Dave;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Review #4400. Were you wondering what I�d review for this epic milestone? Well I�m not going to disappoint you crazy tickers. It�s the Welshest of Wales, the crowning achievement of many a ticking career including mine, the one and only Hair of the Dog Dave. Does it live up to the hype? First of all, hell yes. Second of all, am I the one you really want to ask? Bottle, thanks to Alan. Shared with lots of other Bay Area tickers - I mean beer enthusiasts. Very dark brown color with minimal head. Aroma is smoky with roast, molasses, soy sauce, molasses, tobacco, and dark chocolate dark fruit, whiskey, port. Flavor is medium sweet, some spice, molasses, bitter coffee ground and cigar room finish. Palate is smooth, slick, with a carbonation level that would make Tomme Arthur blush (e.g., almost none). Not too hot for 29%, which is crazy. Full body, but not overly so. Very good beer, and the tick value is obviously astronomical. Life goal achieved. One of the best and most unique beer experiences I�ve had as well.
Hair of the Dog Dave;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;375 ml bottle shared at the original Chez Moeder Lambic�s cellar, thanks to kermis! Hazy dark brown almost black color with no head. Malty aroma, lots of alcohol, caramel, nutty, hazelnut, light dark dried fruits, soy sauce. Heavy sweet and light bitter taste like aroma. Medium to full oily sticky body with flat carbonation.
Hair of the Dog Dave;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Extreme & manifold thanks to kermis & fux for offering!!! Very few beers are more legendary & myth-like if any than this one. Black with no head. There is oxidation in the nose, very warming, very boozy, plenty of alcohol with thick sugar, molasses, dark fruit & soy sauce. Oxidation is low in taste body, likely due to ABV, seems to have kept quite well, what kept is very thick syrup, molasses & above all huge amounts of soy sauce of which I am not the biggest fan, very umami viscous, very monolithic taste, finish carries clear sharp plastic bitter, low burning plastic which further takes it down in my eyes. Viscous, molasses, marmite syrup body, not getting carbonation. It is decent, soy sauce & plastic bitterness are just not the most enticing flavours. Back when this came out there simply being a beer of this ABV must have blown people�s minds & there was nothing to compare it with. The legend is huge & massive will without a doubt remain.
Hair of the Dog Dave;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;@ A day to sink all seasheppards. Thnx for sharing, everyone !! Pours dark brown to black, no head. Smell is intense ! soy sauce, for sure. Taste is boozy, sweet, soy sauce. Very boozy aftertaste. Nice beer, on it�s own, but given the extreme fuzz it gets ( its like THE whale of whale�s ) i�d agree on it being a big dissapointement. We had far better ones in the tasting, but i�m extremely thankfull to Kermis to have made it possible for me to try this ( and so many other beers during the tasting he set up for it ) .

Hair of the Dog Dave;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Bottle shared at Kenny�s 20k tasting - London. A big cheers to Ken, one of RateBeer�s most generous members, who fittingly shared this beer with the group. Pours unclear, deep brown with no head. The nose is lightly roasty, with definite notes of alcohol, dried dark fruits and scorched earth. Big sweet flavour, a little ashy, with more old and dried out dark fruits, some berries, faint cocoa, rich alcohol. Full bodied and fairly chewy, with soft carbonation. Hot on the finish with further earthy bitterness, leathery fruits, touches of toffee. Good stuff overall. It may have once been worthy of being one of RB�s highest-rated beers, but at this point it�s just a pretty good barley wine. That said, it has held up reasonably well over the years. Thanks again to Ken for the opportunity to try this one!
Thwaites Bloomin Ale (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;First tasted this in Gabriels, Paisley in May 1998. Cask, handpump dispense. Opaque pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Soft toffee notes present in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts deliver a smooth ovaltine flavour laced with sweet toffee biscuit notes. Just a hint of hop resins detected in the very brief aftertaste. Finish is robust and malty with sweet toffee flavours to the fore. An excellent session bitter which reminded me slightly of Caledonian 80/?
Thwaites Bloomin Ale (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;"Cask at The Albert (Westminster - London). Compact but little long-lasting head.

Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);This is a backlog rating from�2011 from a bottle, from�notes.�When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are citrus, resin, grass, on the mild side.
Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Part of the IPA on Tour series. This could my least favorite of the tour stops. Reminded more of a #9 with some hops added, or kind of pale ale-ish. Not quite an IPA for me,...call it a light one.....very East Coast. Cloudy yellow appearance. Needs more malt and hops, at least more hops. Balance slightly off. It is drinkable and a decent dinner pairing, just not an IPA that I will seek out in the future.
Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Poured from 12 oz. bottle. Clear bright golden color with a 1-finger off-white head and good lacing. Aroma of pine, floral hops, pineapple, tropical fruit and a shag carpet a few days after spilling beer on it. Taste of tropical fruit, pineapple, floral hops, citrus and an intense musky bitterness. Medium/light body and medium carbonation. This beer improved (to maybe mediocre) after it was allowed to air for a while.
Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle - Pours a hazy amber/orange with a nice head. Bright, tart, citrus aroma. Juicy mouthfeel, sweet citrus turns into some tartness with a hop-bitter finish, an excellent ride.
Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Golden body with large head. Nose is hoppy. Tatste of fruits and citrus. Bitter in the finish.
Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);From an IPA 12-pack. Lighter colored IPA, somewhat hop forward. NW hops, moderately bitter. Good nose. Comes across as a fairly run of the mill IPA, but a well made one.
Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);This beer has the usual citrus flavor that you get from the IPA beers. Also there is the pine flavor in the background. Some bitterness at the finish. It does feel a little but watery and week at the finish. Nothing special here.
Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a dark Amber with a foam head. No noticeable aroma, and somewhat Bland hops taste. I think I got something in there as well, which is not a good sign. Generally more bitter than you would expect for something of this style.
Magic Hat Hi.P.A.;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);12-ounce can from a 15-pack sampler pours hazy yellow with small creamy off-white head and lacing.

Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Earthy, peaty malt aroma and grassy hops. Copper brown color. Moderate bitterness, some malt starchiness. Medium body - this one felt a little raw.
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap�pours hazy amber/copper with a tan head. Aroma is earthy, medium malt. Taste is earthy hops, medium malt-roasty/peat. Good red-to style so 3.3, not sure about the IPA part so 3.0. Additional note: 1st pour on this one was sour/rotten apple. I asked for the bartender to run the line for another pint, then got a 2nd pour. Glad I didn�t rate what got served initially. 3.2
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;On tap at Watch City, Waltham MA, 5 November 2009 as Mongrel Red Ale @ 5.6% but I guess this is the same stuff. Very dark red. Thin beige head. Chocolate in the aroma. Mix of roasty malt and bitter hops. Very bitter but not very aromatic. Somewhat astringent in fact. Light mouthfeel.
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;~8oz pour from cask @ brewpub. Big foamy and sticky head. Color is red and the body is relatively clean. Aroma is AWESOME with a mix of soft hops and just the right amount of caramel sweetness. Perfect blend of soft citrus and soft caramel. All this makes an overall perfume-y flowers aroma. Of course the cask gives off a very under-carbonated body, works kind of nice here. Taste is similarly a great interplay. However, with the light carbonation it seems either really original and slightly weird. Leaves a hoppy aftertaste. Not a thirst quencher, but returnable and definitely recommended.
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;NERAX 2005 Deep copper/brown in color with no head. Aroma and flavor of sweet malt and citrus hops.
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Tap@Watch City Brewing, Waltham, Ma. Sweet and caramelly to start, slightly buttery. Syruppy, nectary, piney hops. Hop leaf bitterness in the finish. A touch sticky i though.
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewpub, 6/29/2005. The brewer�s notes say this is brewed with 15 different malts and I can believe it. The color is a dark brown with some auburn-magenta highlights on the edges, rather transluscent. Looks like a porter. Has a small off-white head on it, that recedes to a light cover, but is retained there. Some lacing is provided. Aroma of light roast, bits of chocolate and light floral hops. A bit of pale malt sugariness and some earthy notes as well. Mainly hops and light coffee though. Flavor begins with a chewy, lightly syrupy (in a pleasant way) chocolate, with a smattering of easygoing coffee-roast. Mint, pine and floral notes from the hops, which are quite apparent and only lightly bitter. Dries out a good deal on the finish, with some dirty/earthy notes, brown bread and cinnamon. Body is medium-full with no thinning and the mouthfeel is lightly chewy, with low carbonation, big airy bubbles lazily exploding in the mouth. I�m never a huge fan of chocolate and American hops, but this one works pretty well, as everything is fairly understated. Good mouthfeel and body, anyways. I bet there�s some rye in here. . .
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;NERAX 2005, on cask: Hazy brown, orange color, spicy pine aroma, starts and ends bitter, juicy mouthfeel, long aftertaste.
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;From old notes , Tap @ Brewpub. Good nose, Lite coffee, tootsie roll, woody, pine. Clean orangy brown color. Small head that faded. Sweet bitter flavors, Chocolate/coffee with a metallic bitterness. Thicker bodied, creamy mouthfeel, bitter finish that hung on for a while. Kind of a piney brown ale. Flavor faded as it warmed.
Watch City Mongrel American Red IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Growler from brewpub. Pour is a clear reddish brown, with a thick tan head that slowly receeds to leave good lacing. Aroma is big on the malts (not a surprise since the brew has 15 different malts in it) - a lot of chocolate, some roastiness, and a slight hint of smokiness appears. Flavor has a huge malty front, mixing up all the flavors mentioned above, and ends with a good floral hop blast. Full body, lot's of complex flavors, and dangerously drinkable.
Carlsberg Black Currant;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle quality save dewsbury. Golden thin head. Blackcurrant aroma taste same pretty sweet. Bit watery palate. It is what it is.
Carlsberg Black Currant;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle, from Asda, Hull. Gold, thin shortlived white head and moderate condition. Sweet fruity blackcurrant dominant in the nose, thin and fruity dryness with a delicate berry note in the mouth and a short slightly sweet finish with a hint of blackcurrant.
Carlsberg Black Currant;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle from Tesco, Gateshead. Pale golden coloured with a slight grassy flavour followed by sugary sweet blackcurrant and a slight bitter-sweet fruity finish.
Tesco Organic Lager;Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tesco;Bottled. Gold colour, moderate thin white head,low condition. Some malt aroma and flavour and a sweet cloying chemical finish that leaves you with a chalky mouth. The classic European lagers that it is trying to copy are obviously more the Heinekens than the Budvars. Not one of Caledonians best beers.
James Page Oktoberfest Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;Finally found my ratings... Pours darker reddish brown with light head. Heavy malt aroma with some caramel malts. Flavor is slightly roasted caramel with malt.
James Page Oktoberfest Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;(12 oz bottle: The Cellars in Roseville, MN) Rather hearty and flavorful Oktoberfest, malty, caramely, lightly toasty, with some sweetness and a mild bitterness in the finish. I appreciate that the sweetness is kept under control and isn�t the dominating feature of the flavor. The aroma is somewhat malty, but overall is pretty damn light. Medium body with a strong carbonation tingle on the palate. Dark amber color is pretty dark for the style, and there�s a slight haze that isn�t clearing up as the beer warms. Small off-white head retreats to a thin ring along the edge of the glass, and lacing is minimal. Pretty decent beer, definitely worth trying, but not in my upper echelon for the style.
James Page Oktoberfest Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Brown Coloring. Small Head. Plenty of Malt on the Nose and Tongue. Some Caramel. Very Enjoyable Overall.
James Page Oktoberfest Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;2004 ABR. Malty, roasted malt aroma. Chocolate and caramel notes. Dark amber, orangish brown. Totally diminishing off-white head. Flavor is not good. Served too warm firstly. All malt, no hops (which isn�t exactly a departure from style), but this brew is unbalanced.
James Page Oktoberfest Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Brownish color with a quickly thinning head. Good malt start... and hot damn, there�s a nice malt taste also. A little sweet and sticky, but not overdone. Maybe some caramel. Not too much going on, just decent.
James Page Oktoberfest Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;Nice dark amber color,small off white head that faded quickly leaving a slight lace behind.Nice malty hoppy aroma with a slight fruit presence and a nice sweet side coming through.The flavor was a nice maltiness with a little caramel and fruit with a decent hop presence,fairly sweet but not to verly so.Well worth having a few more IMO aqnd luckily i have more.
James Page Oktoberfest Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;Light rubyish color, minimal head. Aroma is fresh and floral, soft, herbal,. Smooth palate, easy texture, still some decent body, but not much. Nice amount of sweetness, but not well-balanced by anything else. Little hops, hell, little of anything else. And now the sweetness is getting to be too much for me. Very ordinary, disappointly so. This will have to serve as a late night beer, until I get rid of it, my 4th or 5th of the night when it's too late to care and I'm almost asleep!
James Page Oktoberfest Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Stevens Point Brewery;Indeed, as they promise, this is indeed a very good Oktoberfest. It pours with a nice vigorous cascade, though the head quickly goes to leave a vivacious amber body (yellow on the edges) and a decidedly oily appearance. The aroma promises much--it has a strong vein of alcohol to suggest something of a strong ale but it is deepest in its caramel malts, although I wouldn't argue if someone said they could find a hint of late autumn fruits as well. In the tasting it does reveal a bit of metal, and the alcohol is perhaps too pronounced, but what it lacks in balance it does at least provide in boldness. A lingering bitterness is good, but again more concerns about the metal. Perhaps it was just my bottle, which sat in my cellar just a little longer than the ideal. I was disappointed most by the palate, which faded as quickly as the carbonation burned off, leaving a sticky, rather too-sweet syrup with too little bounce. Still, if I were offered this beer, I would happily drink this during Oktoberfest--or any time of the year.

Crushable and light, but nothing to write home about.

Thomaskirche Spezial Schwarzbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Brauerei an der Thomaskirche;I drank this right at their brewery. It�s overrated on here. Way below average for a german schwarz. Nothing terrible, but lacking cleanliness and not making up for it with the malt.

There is a creamy (textured) off-white almost cappucino coloured head. Nutty and caramel on nose, touch sweet but pleasant. Taste is a little nutty but smooth, creamy and with some toffee and lightly roasted flavours, really likeable and served in bloody good nick. A7 A4 F7 P4 Ov14 3.6
Highgate Black Pig;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask at The Regal (JDW), Cambridge. Very dark red brown with a small off white head.

Highgate Black Pig;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask-conditioned at the Commercial Rooms (JDW), Bristol 24/05/10. Near black with attractive red hints and a decent, off-white head. Dark fruits, some caramel and a lick of liquorice with a gentle, bitter finish. Enjoyable.
Highgate Black Pig;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask at The Metropolitan (JDW) by Baker St tube. Deep red-brown with a clingy fine tan head. Tart plums on the nose, plus a little red wine. Smooth and fruity, with plums and redcurrants and more vinous hints, soft bitterness in the finish, along with notes of dark chocolate and roast nuts. Rather more-ish.
Highgate Black Pig;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask @ Hengler�s Circus, JDW. Colour is dark reddish-brown with a medium foamy off-white head. Aroma of slight roasted malts and fruits. Flavour is sour fruits, hint of roasted malts, a bit of licorice, red wine. A bit disappointing, keeping in mind the high ratings so far (although the most recent is from 3 years ago). Not enough roastiness, not enough body.
Highgate Black Pig;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask Dark brown, thin head. Sweet burnt malt aroma. Surprisingly hoppy for a mild. More like a porter, but that�s not a perfect match either. Very well-rounded combination of burnt and roasted malts - sweet and a little spicy - with subtle, but quite emphatic, hoppiness. Great mild.

Caledonian 1869;Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);First tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats in May 2003. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper red in colou with a thin white head. Distinctive caley aroma of toffee malt. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives typical chewy digestive biscuit with sweet caramel notes. Very little hop presence though. Slight raisin fruit in the sweet finish. An excellent session ale.

Caledonian 1869;Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Golden colour. heavy butterscotch aroma. It would appear from other comments that the beer is made that way, rather than the conditioning being at fault. The flavour has some dry malt and moderate bitterness, but that intrusive diacetyl comes through again. Not great. Cask (handpump) at the Head of Steam, Euston.
Caledonian 1869;Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask conditioned - handpump - Head Of Steam Euston (RB London Xmas Crawl 2004).

Caledonian 1869;Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Nov, 2004:JDW, Whitehall, London. A pale malt beer. Fragrant hops, but too much diactyl.

New Glarus Fat Squirrel Nut Brown Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;"Currently enjoying a can of this very-limited-distribution brew courtesy of a friend, thanks Jeremy! Poured into a snifter, this bottle-conditioned brown ale pours a cocoa-brown hue with white foam and some noticeable particulates that remind you that this beer is unfiltered and refreshingly faithful to brewing tradition. On the nose, there are notes of chocolate, caramel, and jaegermeister spices; this also has a distinctive continental hoppiness to it as opposed to an English-style brown ale. The taste features a rich syrupy caramel maltiness coupled with some toasty and woody notes, along with the recognizable taste of hazelnut, as advertised. Medium-bodied and smooth, with a slight booziness more akin to a bock beer. Overall this is a uniquely German-leaning brown ale that is more bock-ish than the Samuel Smith's Brown Ale, for example, and offers a lot of flavor for the style. Well-executed and definitely something I would look for whenever I finally make it to Wisconsin!"
New Glarus Fat Squirrel Nut Brown Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle with many thanks to Drake! Pours clear brown with a small beige head. Aroma is green grasses, cheap lager. Strange aroma for a brown. Flavor is brown grass and leaves, green grass, nuts, caramel. Not the best offering from New Glarus I've had, but still very appreciative of the bottle!
New Glarus Fat Squirrel Nut Brown Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;From bottle. The combination of various malts make it a good fall option. There are better out there but is certainly above average for the style.

Grain and a sort of perfumy yeast aroma, grain and grapefruit in the mouth tinged with more yeast and a slightly dry finish. Certainly reminded me of a Belgian beer, kind of like a watered down Duvel

Strzelec Porter (Brok Porter);Jedrzejow, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);Porter Medalista 9,5%. Best before 2002. 16 years after the date. Overwhelming tomato pulp aroma. Covers almost everything. Lots of herbs, some caramale, coffee, cacao, sweet cherries, herbal candies. Sour, rather light body. First time trying waaay overdue porter - this wasn't worth either time and money

Strzelec Porter (Brok Porter);Jedrzejow, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);Bottled (backlog, had as Brok Porter). Deep brown, close to black colour with a mediumsized beigeish brown head. Aroma is caramel, some slight alcohol, mild ripe fruits, some dried dark fruits as well as mild chocolaty notes.

Strzelec Porter (Brok Porter);Jedrzejow, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);Dark and sweet, molasses and raisins initially come to mind at first sip. Dark brown with small creamy beige head. Aroma is prune juice, dried fruit, molasses. Taste is initially sweet, elements of raisins and roast grains. Sweet and smooth.
Strzelec Porter (Brok Porter);Jedrzejow, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);Ugh. Dark pour. Molasses, Vegemite, rotten fruit. This is flat out nasty ass.
Strzelec Porter (Brok Porter);Jedrzejow, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);Tasted from a 500 mL bottle purchased in Aurora, Colorado. Pours with a brown/black head that dissipates pretty quickly. Deep blackish brown body. Dark malts are in the aroma but they�re surpassed by the alcohol. Almost vomited on the first taste. Very strong alcohol flavor with a deep somewhat chocolate-y malty body. Bitter and hard to swallow. Worst Baltic Porter I�ve ever had. I didn�t finish more than 4 oz of the 16.9 oz bottle. Yuck!
Strzelec Porter (Brok Porter);Jedrzejow, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);Pours a five finger tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Molasses nose. Flavor is sweet roasted molasses and coffee. Higher ABV is hidden. A deal at $1.79 for a 500ml bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT.
Strzelec Porter (Brok Porter);Jedrzejow, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Jedrzejow (Van Pur);Bottled. Poured deep brown with a creamy cap of tan head.. looked very nice initially. The aroma picked up rich chocolate and coffee amplified by some alcohol warmth and some char.. deep and foreboding. The flavor had semi-sweet to darker chocolate at the core with moderate roast to it.. spicy coffee bitterness and more warmth on the edges.. finished with chocolate and sharper boozy warmth. Heavier-bodied and rather syrupy on the palate with a decent flow.. very long, warm, bitter finish. Overall this was a very good drink.

Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"From Aug 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a cloudy light gold with a smallish head of foam that quickly shrunk leaving a broken, fine layer. The smell is quite light but I note some citrus and wheat. The taste is well...where *is* the taste? There's a bit of wheat present and an ever so slight hint of, umm...I'm reaching here....citrus? Man, this is maybe the blandest brew my palate has ever encountered in my years of drinking micros. I mean, it's not offensive, it just doesn't have any character that you can reflect upon after you swallow it. Wow. That being said, it's probably a big seller in the markets that carry it. ;^)"
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a hazy golden yellow color. Aromas of bread/lemon/ and some fruit. Had a taste of yeasty bread with some fruit.
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Decent and would be really easy to drink in the summertime. Loses some of its lacquer in the middle of an Oregon winter but nice for a change. Has all the textbook flavors, a little too lemony with some really nice banana bread maltiness and that is rounded out by a herbal clove bite in the finish.
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);(Bottle) Pours a cloudy golden body with a moderate quickly diminishing white head. Aroma of lemon and mild hops. Light citrus flavor with a hint of banana and cloves.
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pored pretty clear for a hef, kinda a light brown, head bubbled up and flew away super fast. Watery, soapy, acidic, not a good hef. crap I have 5 more.
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Really a non-impressive Heffe (even for Heffe�s). Poured well, but nothing special. Nose was very weak with hints of hops, citrus, and clover. Attack watery. Slight citrus finish. Was easy on the palate though.
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);I was not very impressed with is heffe beer. Almost no flavor to speak of, no color, just really nothing going on with this. I won�t be buying this again.
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Hazy straw colors, thin creamy head with sparse lacing. Light citrus, some clove and banana followed by hops. Yeasty, wheat, citrus hops and light malts. Light bodied, slight bitter finish.
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Hazy blond color with light fizzy head. The aroma is lightly malty with wheat & a touch of citrus. The flavor is musty & tangy with wheat & some dusty hops. Finishes bland & lightly tangy, bland american wheat. When I was trying these Metolius beers, I had no idea who they were made by but they really reminded me of the Fire Station 5 stuff, also a PBC brewed beer for a specific grocerty store chain.
Metolius Hares Ear Hefeweisen;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Ok this beer is brewed by MacTs for the Albertson grocery chain. Bought a 12 oz brown bottle single. Has a nice river scene with a fisdhing fly on the label. MM this beer is very murky even for a hefe..murky orange..small pure white head that dissapears fast..no lacing..hope this is not off. well doesnt smell off..doesnt smell of much at all to be honest. Taste is pretty weak..although the wheat sourness is discernable..small malts too. It feels oily on the tongue due to the lack of carbonation. Its not that bad..but I would not buy it again..maybe it was off..I dont really know.
Kopparbergs Apple Cider;Kopparberg, Sweden;Apple Cider;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Awful stuff. Makes you wonder if an apple ever came near it. You must be pretty desperate to drink this. Ugly label, too crowded, with all sorts of font conflicts, and, believe it or not, what looks like an apple. It simply screams out: please avoid this!
Kopparbergs Apple Cider;Kopparberg, Sweden;Apple Cider;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Light yellow colour with an almost invisible head. Smells apple juice. Taste is a midway between sweet alcopop and apple juice. Medium body. Average carbonation. Sprite is more refreshing. Never again. [Bottle from Systembolaget in Str�mstad, Sweden]
Kopparbergs Apple Cider;Kopparberg, Sweden;Apple Cider;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can from supermarket in Ayia Napa, Cyprus. Clear pale yellow with a white head. Aroma is sweet, sugary and artificial apples. Flavor is quite sweet. Sweet finish. Watery and sticky. 170913
Kopparbergs Apple Cider;Kopparberg, Sweden;Apple Cider;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;"For a cider, awful; I wouldn�t have dreamed of describing it as ""apple"" were it not right there on the label. Taste is of fizz, sugar, weird half-alkaline lemon. Like a Sprite with added sugar and color; highly unrecommended, especially for �3.20/$4.25 a can (in Estonia, probably higher in Sweden ;))"
Kopparbergs Apple Cider;Kopparberg, Sweden;Apple Cider;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;500ml bottle. Pours very pale gold with medium carbonation. Aroma is very sweet apple juice. Taste has a nice apple juice start but a far too sugary finish.

John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap at the Harvard brewpub. Black, creamy head. Light smoky roast aroma. Berries underlying roast. Smoke retronasal. Good balance pleasant.
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Almost like a guinnes but smoother. Not bitter. I liked this beer a lot. Had on the tap, in a glass with dark brown color and a tasty burger. Very filling meal
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);11th October 2008. GABF. Clear dark brown beer. Malty with a little toastyness about it but really not an interesting beer.
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap at Cambridge. I think this is a textbook Porter, and that is why it�s impressive. Aroma is hazelnut, chocolate, well-creamed coffee. Texture is velvety without tasting buttery. Very smooth, very relaxing.
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);(Draught) Pours a amber-brown body with a small beige head. Aroma of toasted grain, raisins, caramel, and light peat. Flavor of roasted malt, raisins, some cocoa, and caramel with a dry finish.
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Got it in a growler from the bar. It pours a tan head, which is darker the closer you get to the liquid. Dark brown body. Roasty and nutty aroma. Really nutty and really malty. Some chocolate taste in it as well. Almost an oatmeal taste at times. I rather liked it.
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the brewpub. Dusky, overly warm fermented English ale yeast. Heavy esters and minerals masks light ash. Not welcoming. Pours a mid-brown, with little head. Flavor is as expected. A shallow wash of brown malt sugars, tannic, peaty harsh smoke malt, and then a drying curb of alcohol. Underfermented. The smoke is gross. Not well balanced in the beer. Malt depth is shallow, with little complexity. Chocolate malt dryness makes up for some of the sugars. One redeeming factor is the nice gummy english hop glow on the backend.
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);From tap at the brewpub in Cambridge. Pours black with a little off white head. Malty caramel and chocolate aroma. Light chocolate and roasted malt flavoured. Mild bitter in the finish, blending nicely in with the mild chocolate note. Nice.
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the Harvard location. Pours a deep brown with hints of amber and a smaller tan head. Aroma of light smoke, chocolate, some peat, light earthiness and some caramel. Flavor of slightly roasty/chocolate malt, some caramel and very light smoke.
John Harvard's Provision Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Dark, reddish body with light-brown head, Fully diminishing. Aroma is of roasted malts with sweet undertones. Initial taste is loaded with coffee notes, more reminiscent of a stout. Moderately bitter, moving to a light bitter finish with average duration. Light to medium on the mouth, it has a watery to creamy texture with soft carbonation. Coffee, coffee, and more coffee in the taste. Reviewed on January 20th, 2007.
Delafield Jan Primus Belgian Style Grand Cru;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Delafield Brewhaus;Pretty darn fine. It's not quite in the true belgian realm yet, but it's getting there. Nice sweet/scotchy notes.
Delafield Jan Primus Belgian Style Grand Cru;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Delafield Brewhaus;Wow this has a nose like Jimmy Durante ! It is a big beer in strength and taste. Really unique and interesting. It has the definite bourbon aroma and taste in the foreground, but then floats to a vanilla/raisin taste. I suggest letting it warm up a bit and drinking it from a glass with a fluted body.
Delafield Jan Primus Belgian Style Grand Cru;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Delafield Brewhaus;This beer was very strong and did taste quite woody. An interesting beer though I found it a bit too thin lacking malt and relying too heavily on the alcohol flavor and aroma.
Delafield Jan Primus Belgian Style Grand Cru;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Delafield Brewhaus;Whiskey Barrel Aged. Light chestnut color with a light tan head. Sweet toffee and date aroma. Tastes like a chocolate covered cherry blended with an almond joy bar. Oak and alcohol finish. If you like whiskey this is it. Real whiskey flavors come out in the finish. Interesting, truly interesting.
Fischer La Royale;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Fischer (Heineken France);Keg on Tap, 330ml, pasteurised in a bar (name not known), Buzancy, Ardennes, France. Gold with white head. The next campsite was in The Ardennes, so I thought I would look in the local bar, surprised to get a rating, but this was rough, gassy eurofizz with alcohol. Not pleasant and neither was the bar.
Fischer La Royale;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Fischer (Heineken France);"This was purchased at a Monoprix in Aix-en-Provence under the name ""La Royale Bi�re Sp�ciale"" in 250mL bottles for around E2.50 per 6 pack. Light amber-golden color. Small head, leaving lace. Slight flowery aroma, along with some malts. Spicy hops. Good pilsner-like bitterness. Also decent maltiness. Okay body -- more than I expected. Overall, this being a very cheap supermarket-brand beer, it is very good. I was pleasantly surprised. Sort of a pilsner-bock hybrid with lots of alcohol. Not exceptional but well-made."
Fischer La Royale;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Fischer (Heineken France);A bitter pilsener. Ok quality, but pretty uninteresting. An average beer from France
Heineken Buckler Highlands;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;Sweet nutty caramel aroma, toffee, burnt sugar. Coppery red clear with off-white head. Light medium body with medium carbonation. Taste starts sweet and malty, like cr�me brul�e. Finish is sweet like weak cold sugary coffee and cream. After is lightly bitter and watery. Not bad for a non-alcoholic beer.
Heineken Buckler Highlands;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;Some taste but funny aftertaste. Decent looking head though pale in the glass. Beer aroma masked by hint of apple. Bit dry and low in taste but passable in a pinch as carbonation gets you through it
Heineken Buckler Highlands;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;Extreme Caramel taste. It is unbearably and beyond my endurance. Extremely artificial and disgusting.
Alexander Keiths Blonde Summer Wheat;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);A much better effort than their flagship IPA. Fuller bodied, with a very slight wheat flavour and aroma. Not bang on for the style, but at least its an effort.
Alexander Keiths Blonde Summer Wheat;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Hint of wheat, some malt in the nose, hazy golden, small white head. Faint wheat taste, good mouth feel, nice bitterness, light bodied, mild wheat aftertaste. Average, but for these guys that's something!
Alexander Keiths Blonde Summer Wheat;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Slight amber-tinted blond. Slightly fruity, leafy, currant aroma. OK body given where it comes from. Sweetish. Refreshingly wet finish (no, I'm not being facetious). Low carbonation helps this out a lot. Not really worth seeking out, but another drinkable Keith's seasonal and ol' Alexander might slow down his grave-spinning.
Alexander Keiths Blonde Summer Wheat;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Slightly hazy gold colour with a mostly diminishing white head. Faint aroma of apple and honey. Touches of apple flavour, maybe a bit of honey and coriander, but not enough to get the beer beyond bland. Watery finish.
Alexander Keiths Blonde Summer Wheat;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);(Draught) At Patty Bolands in Ottawa. Thin head and somewhat flat, light amber body. Bizarre but enjoyable. Bitter flavour and finish. Average... A step up for this macro-swillery...
Alexander Keiths Blonde Summer Wheat;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);I didn't expect this of a Keiths... Mildly enjoyable when a bar is full of other unenjoyable beers. Yellow slight haze. Nice creamy head that lasted a long time. Malty aroma slight malty taste. Noticable wheat.
Alexander Keiths Blonde Summer Wheat;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Wheat Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Yellowish with little carbonation. Actually kind of nice lacing. Aroma has some maltishness, but nothing too much. I think my glass was too full, and I couldn't do a swirl. Taste is somewhat bitter at the start, the finish is kind of empty, but the aftertaste comes back with a little of the bitterness. Maybe that's the wheat? Upon re-reading the product description, that's actually the Cascade hops, which I didn't recognize in a macro-Canuck beer. I didn't get much wheat until I had filled my gob with fries and gravy, then took a sip. (This was after finishing my rating). I think that the viscous grad student bar gravy covered up the right tastebuds so I got some of that wheat taste you'd expect. All in all, a beer that tries harder than most Canadian macros, and perhaps succeeds.
Hair of the Frog Oatmeal Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hair of the Frog;light chocolate nose, sweet with very little aromatic power. moderately black with light red, no head but lots and lots of lace. lots of oats, creamy body. light coffee but mostly oats and very light hops. starts sweet with a lasting roasty flavor.
Emerson Biggins Smoked Porter;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Porter - Smoked;Emerson Biggins Sports Bar and Grill;"Decent stuff. Pretty sour, though; nearly a baltic porter owing to its ""sour malts."" Also, it is really hoppy for a porter, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. The smokiness is there in some degree, but a bit jagged."
Emerson Biggins Double D Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout - Dry;Emerson Biggins Sports Bar and Grill;Very similar to the porter, but without the smoke aspect. Actually, the stout is a bit thinner than the porter. This beer is almost overbearingly roasty, with bitterness coming more from the grains than the hops. Has a bit of a molasses taste to it, but without the sweetness. A tinge of charred chocolate.
Emerson Biggins Good Grief Charlie Brown Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;Emerson Biggins Sports Bar and Grill;"An excellent brown ale; one of the best I've had. As with all their beers, it was served too cold, and in a cold glass. I had to ask for a warmer one. Has exactly the appearance I would ask for in a brown. Has the requisite light caramel and toffee flavors with just a touch of butterscotch (diacetyl). Sweetish dark lingering finish. Very appropriate hopping. The best beer for its style that I tried here."
B&O Station Orange Sensation;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;B & O Station Brewery;"This is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. The orange taste wasn't overpowering, and went well with dinner. As far as I know, it's a limited run; I took a growler home so as not to forget it so easily."

Apperance: Slightly hazy golden amber colour, with a very thin white head Aroma: malts,grains, Taste:moderate sweet malts, light bitter a hint of sourness, some grains ans a ligght herbal touch Earthy spicey light bitterfinish. Light bodied, (too) high carbonation, dry finish.
Mongozo Quinua;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;"One of those weird quinoa beers to support honest trading practices with the Third World. Refermented with champagne yeast. The result is a somewhat bizarre beer with spicy sweetness in the aroma, something grainy and aniseed-like; taste does not live up to this relatively promising and interesting aroma, grainy, sweetish with a sour, �wild� touch."

Mongozo Quinua;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle at home. Pours a pale yellow with a large white head. Sweet sour aroma of yeast, wheat (quinua?), bread. Taste is a bit sweet-sour, wheat, yeast, bit of a sour-bitter aftertaste. Strange brew, but not too bad.
Mongozo Quinua;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;"Bottle 33 cl. Pours a hazy yellow with a white head and an aroma of sweet malts, hops, ripe fruits, yeast, lime and yeast. The taste is medium sweet, with a fizzy mouthfeel and a slightly bitter finish. I dislike this ""superfood""-bullshit, but this is not a bad beer."
Benskins Colne Spring;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);9th February 2008 A 1984 bottle - Extra Strong Ltd Ed! Smells like Vintage Port! Tastes like Vintage Port with malt. Well caramelised! Not bad at all and shows beers can survive well beyond BB dates!
Benskins Colne Spring;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);"Bottle. Nutty leather alcohol aroma; quite intensive. Muddy brown colour. Soft, warming alcohol with some sweetness. Some salt in finish, not quite soy sauce. Soft licorice in flavour. A little patchy in places. A flavour packed brew, through a little bit muddled. Benskin's can trace their roots back to 1720, though it was in 1827, shorty after moving to the High Street site in Watford, that they assumed the name Benskin. They were taken over by Ind Coope in 1957 who were themselves eventually absorbed into the Carlsberg-Tetley monster. The Watford site closed in 1972."

Pours clear pale golden colour with a huge most good lasting froothy white head. Aroma of mild metallic hops, grainy malt. Taste of mild grassy hops, pale malt, hints of metallic hops, overall not bad.
Hallertauer Hopfentrunk Hell;Elsendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Horneck (Josef Stempfhuber);Standard Helles appearance. Aroma is sweet malts, not really hoppy. Taste is flowery, sweet malts, boring Helles, but very drinkable. Finish is too metallic. Nice foamy mouthfeel. I am not sure what to think of this.
Hallertauer Hopfentrunk Hell;Elsendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Horneck (Josef Stempfhuber);"This beer has such a beautiful name... Really, ""Hallertauer Hopfentrunk Hell."" It holds such promise. Sadly the liquid does not deliver. It�s clear pale gold, some sticky foam -- so it look all right. Swirling around the glass throws some sweet wort, garbage-like DMS, and barely any hop into the aroma. Lightly sweet, light acidic tang, very low bitterness. I fear that it�s misleading to put the word ""hopfen"" in the name. Lately I�ve been enjoying some subtle, boring-ish beers but this is below consideration."
Hallertauer Hopfentrunk Hell;Elsendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Horneck (Josef Stempfhuber);0,5 l bottle. Also from kappldav123. Thanks a lot! Clear, golden, white head. Looks like expected. Malty with fruity hints on the nose. Taste is malt, grainy, little bit metallic, citrus background. Increasing bitterness. More taste than a standard Helles, but still a Helles.
Hallertauer Hopfentrunk Hell;Elsendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Horneck (Josef Stempfhuber);Many thanks to kappldav123 for this bottle! Smooth and malty beginning. Not too deep, not too hoppy. Standart Helles with not much flavour. Highly drinkable though but boring with hints of grain and only a few malty hints. No long aftertaste, nearly no bitterness.

Cairngorm Stag (Bottle);Aviemore, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cairngorm Brewery Co.;Clear amber beer, thin bubbly head. Smell is dry, bitter malt and not a hell of a lot else. Flavour is bitter malt, some hop, a bit of fruit, caramel. There's not a hell of a lot to it but as this sort of archetypal bitter go it's got a reasonably clear flavour, nothing unpleasant lurking in the backtaste and low enough strength that you could enjoy a few without any bother.

Cairngorm Stag (Bottle);Aviemore, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cairngorm Brewery Co.;Quite an unusual one taste wise, but in a good way!

Kelburn Cart Blanche (Cask);Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelburn Brewery;Clear golden ale, bubbly white head. Light zesty aroma. Flavour is tangy citrus, a bit of bitter grassy hop. Follows through into the aftertaste nicely too. It does pretty much the same as what many pales of this type aim for but it actually holds its flavour as opposed to descending into a watery nothing. Solid
Kelburn Cart Blanche (Cask);Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelburn Brewery;Pint, Malt Shovel. Pours clear gold. Bright and lively. Soft wheaty malty aroma. Dry and crisp. Lipsmacking stuff. Good session beer, much better than many anonymous blonde ales.

Kelburn Cart Blanche (Cask);Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelburn Brewery;Cask at GBBF Saturday, 13/08/2016. A hazed golden coloured pour with a loose white head. Aroma is big earthy raw grains, straw berry hop, hedgerow hop, damp hay. Flavour is composed of sweet Base malts, tangy fruits, hint of hot alcohol. Fruity. Little bit of a hot ferment. Palate is medium sweet, moderate carbonation. Middle of the road golde.
Kelburn Cart Blanche (Cask);Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelburn Brewery;Cask at GBBF 2016. It pours clear amber with a small white head. The aroma is soft, sweet, bready, toasted grain, cereal and porridge. The taste is smooth, bitter, chewy malt, porridge, peppery spice, white bread, hint of lemon and grain with a dry finish. Medium body and soft carbonation. A pretty run of the mill malt-led golden ale.
Kelburn Cart Blanche (Cask);Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelburn Brewery;Cask at the Bow Bar. Pours clear golden with a thin white head. Aromas of lemon and hobnobs. Taste is more of the same, faint butteriness. Light sweet finish.

Deka Chernij Prints;Velikiy Novgorod, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pivzavod Deka;Dark mahogany-brown colour. Grainy aroma with light molasses note and hints of Mexican chocolate. Reasonably full-bodied but somewhat thin flavours...odd. Burnt brown sugar and dates form a basic flavour profile, drowning out adjunct notes. One of the better Russian dark lagers, at least amongst the macros. Not perfect by any means, but enjoyable enough.
Deka Chernij Prints;Velikiy Novgorod, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pivzavod Deka;Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is clear medium to dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (bread, caramel, grain, cereal), lightly hoppy (flowers). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, slighty husky. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Considering where it�s from, this is pretty decent. A bit grainy, industrial-smelling, and on the sweet side, but otherwise inoffensive and nearly pleasant.
Deka Chernij Prints;Velikiy Novgorod, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pivzavod Deka;Malty aroma with strong smoked notes. Reminds me of Rauchenfelser Steinbrau. Dark red in appearance with a large off-white head that is mostly dissipating. Good visible carbonation. Not much lace. Tastes of oysters. Would probably go well with oysters, although that may be overkill. Unique but slightly off. Still has a certain alluring, ancient quality. While I was drinking it my mind conjured up visions of vikings swilling large mugs of the stuff. Or, maybe it was the 5.9% ABV talking.
Deka Chernij Prints;Velikiy Novgorod, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pivzavod Deka;Bottled. Red brown, no head and low condition. Fruity port and woody tart nose with a hint of pepperiness developing. Sweet caramel and port in the mouth and a lingering caramel finish balanced out with a roasty dryness.
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottle at home ... golden amber ... small white head ... soft odd fruit nose that i need to assume is ginseng... again an odd flavour thats very simelar to the nose .. its kind of smokey but not... soft fruits ... just wierd but not unpleasant ... almost a poor quality sherry element to it, gets less plesent as i get further in
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);bottle at home. quite odd stuff indeed. i really don�t think a ginseng beer was a good idea. awfully unballanced and badly composed flavoures. but it does what it says on the label. it tastes of ginseng....
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Drank at Wing Yip, Purley Way - not a fan. Sweet, overpoweringly and cloying ginseng. Uncomplimentary flavours.
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Got this for 50p in a chinese super market. Aroma is seriously ginger and some sort of floural spice which i assume is the ginseng. Taste is similar, very carbonated, but it suits the beer. I really like ginger so this is a good deal to me, also i think it might be slightly bottle conditioned as mine was a bit cloudy.
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);A bit more gingery than ginseng but a very nice beer. I wish I could get this in Ashford instead of having to go to Wing Yip in Croydon to find it!
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);(Bottle 33 cl) Pilsener golden with a small head. Fresh, gingery nose and very marked flavours of ginger and perhaps also ginseng (not sure I recall the flavour of ginseng....) But very refreshing and mild, pretty much without bitterness. 140701
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottled, Pasteurised. Pale yellow beer, no head, boiled herb flavour. Ginseng is used to reduce stress and improve energy, actually a better beer would do this adequately.
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);very pale yellow colour, head disapperas in 1.2 seconds, perfumy, herb aroma, smooth with an after-shave aftertaste
Meantime Oriental Ginseng Beer;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Flavored - Other;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottled. Hazy straw colour, no head and high condition. Not knowing what ginseng smells or tastes like, I couldn�t spot it beneath the ginger that dominates this beer. Very one dimensional with aggressive condition.

Hanby Premium Bitter;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wem Brewing;[Bottle conditioned] The aroma is dominated by sweet oranges with a hint of bitterness.

Hanby Premium Bitter;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wem Brewing;Cask conditioned. Orange amber colour, moderate head and condition.

Stoney Creek Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Stoney Creek Breweries;Amber with some brown tinges throughout. Smells a bit hoppy with some earthy aromas. Low carbonation and some decent toffee malt give this a fairly good backbone. Plenty of hops with some rooty flavor. Has some spice to it, and almost a peppery feel as it finishes, though this is largely offset by the wet malt flavor that combines. Smooth overall, and not terribly complex, but still a decent beer.

Very, very roasty malt aroma with some chocolate & caramel and a lightl toasty malt muted by dark grains. Clean of esters. Roaste grainy flavor up front, but burnt and acrid causing bitterness and astringency... Also slighly metallic. Lighty oxidized w/ a burnt stale malt finish that is semi dry. Aftertaste is highly burnt & bitter from dark grains... Unpleasant to my palate! Lighty floral hop in the aftertaste, mostly just burnt & bitter. Biting CO2, but smooth once it settles a bit on the tongue, with a lighter body. Too burnt and bitter for me! Oxidation doesn�t help matters, but just not overly enjoyable on my palate. Pleaseant enough aroma, but just not a huge fan.

Smoother than the Trumpeter but still hoppy. Not as malty as the Trumpeter either. You couldn�t tell it had port in, but there is a definite sweetness that isn�t coming from the malt.
Swan On The Portside;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Swan On The Green;Hrd to believe they had a bottle of port too each cask, i can't taste it. Grainy apple juice, really thin and annoying, probably one of the worst beers i had at the festival (Cask KentBF 03')
Swan On The Portside;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Swan On The Green;Aroma of pepper and frozen lasagna. Hazy amber color. Flavors of ice tea, latex, and roasted onion and parsnip. Little influence from the port that is added (one bottle per cask, supposedly), except that it is a bit oily. Dreadful. (gravity pour at 2003 Kent Beer Festival)
Swan On The Portside;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Swan On The Green;Cask, Swan brewpub, Kent. Raspberry nose. Ruby red colour. Like an Irish Red beer. Caramel sweet. A little sticky. Crude and undeveloped, like a homebrew not left long enough to ferment. [2.1] Re-rate. Gravity Cask, Kent Beer Festival, with Nuffield & Duff. Foul.

Picks Lions Main;Green Haworth (Accrington), Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Picks;A powerful sulphurous aroma reminds me of the Burton ales. This seems to lack body, but this beer is all about finish - salty, with sourness followed by a very hoppy dryness. Very nice.
Fernandes Empress of India;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Fernandes Brewery (Ossett);Tasted this at the Troon Beer Festival in September 2003. Cask, gravity dispense. Clear pale mahogany in colour with a loose open white head. Strong malty aroma with dark berry fruit evident. Thin resiny mouthfeel and no lacing of note. Mixed complex malts give a fiery digestive biscuit base with strong rosehip syrup notes and elderberry. Hop flavours build up into a strong resiny aftertaste with pine notes. Dry notes continue into the long finish with woody sherry and vanilla cask notes. An interesting Strong Ale which is full of flavour and complexity, highly recommended..

Pleasant. I had this one at the Peterborough Beer Fest not knowing anything about it. It wasn�t on the official beer list booklet. A Fernandes that got in when nobody was looking? On our side of the ocean it�s the Gonzales who do that a lot.

Phoenix Wobbly Bob;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Strong Ale - English;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Tastes like it packs a wallop and at 6% it does. It's far too malty for bitterness, nothing much else in it and hops are virtually non-existent. But still somehow drinkable no doubt due to the alcohol content. Good quaffing beer for a pub dart match... not.
Phoenix Wobbly Bob;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Strong Ale - English;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);A delicious and powerful all rounder. The equivalent of sir Ian Botham of the beer world!

Phoenix Wobbly Bob;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Strong Ale - English;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Crikey this has a kick to it!

Pint at Y Dic Penderyn, Merthyr Tydfil.

Bass St Margarets;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Porter;White Shield Brewery / Museum Brewery (Molson Coors);Brewed specially for Leicester Beer Festival. This is an inky black porter that is light and smooth with a touch of chocolate. Shame it is lacking in complexity. Quite a standard porter.
Parish Ale Samoud II;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Parish Brewing Co.;Named after the famous Iraqi missile! The brew pub even has a plastic missile stuck in its roof to celebrate this beer. Samoud is tan in colour, flavours comprise of smooth toffee and caramel malts along with a fruity tang. I would rather be hit by this rather than the aforementioned missile.
